00:50 - and then these coins
00:51 - you use it to buy upgrades in the shop
00:54 - and if you get three
00:55 - if you get hit by three bombs and you
00:56 - lose
00:58 - and i actually turned down the volume a
01:00 - little bit so we don't get
01:02 - demonetized for it because like it's
01:04 - copyrighted music
01:05 - so i'm just gonna click begin so i'll
01:07 - show you
01:09 - so you get the money money it gives you
01:11 - a pick random one to ten money
01:13 - and the bombs will hurt you you lose one
01:15 - life if you
01:16 - hit the bomb as you can see i lost the
01:19 - life one of the x's got colored
01:21 - and as you can see the an armageddon a
01:25 - bunch of fruits and bombs just
01:26 - continuously fall
01:28 - so you can buy upgrades this wings is
01:30 - speed this is bigger basket
01:32 - um and then this is a different skin
01:36 - and then this is force field so force
01:38 - field does if you press f
01:40 - then that means you get shield from any
01:42 - incoming damage
01:43 - from the bombs and you get to collect
01:45 - stuff so i'll buy one and you can buy
01:46 - infinite of these
01:48 - so you press f to activate the force
01:50 - wheel so when you activate it during an
01:51 - armageddon it will really help you
01:54 - so i'm going to wait until armageddon
01:55 - comes and i'll show you
01:58 - so in the meantime let's collect some
02:00 - fruits and money
02:02 - okay so as you can see when you get this
02:04 - you get
02:05 - prevented from any damage and you get a
02:07 - lot of money and points

02:11 - different currency so
02:13 - score is just like to show you how much
02:15 - things you caught
02:16 - and then you have the money which is to
02:18 - buy stuff and you press p
02:20 - to exit and go to the shop so let's buy
02:23 - the speed
02:24 - bigger basket and buy some more force
02:26 - fields
02:28 - okay so now as you can see
02:31 - the basket is bigger and we move way
02:35 - quicker
02:36 - as you can see bigger basket can
02:38 - sometimes actually harm you because
02:40 - you can catch bombs but you can also
02:42 - catch more fruits
02:43 - so i'm going to use force field again
02:46 - armageddon

02:51 - game
02:55 - so yeah okay let's go peed let's buy the
02:58 - skin
