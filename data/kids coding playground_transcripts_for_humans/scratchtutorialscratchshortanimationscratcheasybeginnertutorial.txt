00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys in today's and
00:09 - other kids coding playground video today
00:12 - we normally make games but today I'll be
00:14 - telling you how to make a animation so
00:17 - we will be working on an animation a
00:20 - really short animation so it's about
00:26 - giggle C 5 she's like hiking and then
00:29 - she's lost she finds a bear inside a
00:31 - cave and she runs away it's a really
00:33 - short animation and really simple so
00:36 - we'll be learning these following
00:38 - concepts in scratch the understanding
00:41 - broadcasting messages goes in animations
00:43 - you need a lot of broadcast messages if
00:45 - you're gonna make it really long text to
00:47 - speech so you can say stuff changing
00:51 - background and loops so I will be
00:58 - demoing this game for you I'm not so she
01:05 - says I'm lost
01:06 - she's going walking she's trying to find
01:10 - her home again but then she goes into a
01:12 - mountain oh no it's a bear I'm like a
01:14 - man so he says oh no it's a bear and it
01:17 - runs mine ah run away
01:19 - it's yelling ah run away and then she
01:28 - escapes
01:30 - so before we start our game please like
01:33 - share and subscribe to our Channel and
01:35 - please support us that means a lot to us
01:38 - so anyways let's start so we have the
01:41 - cat let's delete the cat sprite then
01:47 - let's get the Giga the Giga let's get
01:53 - this price before we do the background
01:55 - the Giga walking's right then let's take
01:59 - the bear the bear walking not there bear
02:05 - walking and then let's let's change the
02:10 - backdrops so we need two backdrops
02:13 - let's delete it let's delete this one
02:17 - first we got to select one before we do
02:20 - any one so we have to take the heart the
02:25 - winter the winter one and we also need
02:32 - another backdrop which is the mountain
02:37 - this one so we have two backdrops so
02:42 - first we start on the backdrops we need
02:45 - but it Flags like we always have to
02:47 - start out then it flag clicked only if
02:50 - you're using cloning in all its type of
02:52 - stuff so which cost you I mean backdrop
02:55 - to mountain
02:55 - no not mountain a winter because that's
02:59 - where she walks in then let's start on
03:06 - the Giga spray so if flag click you need
03:17 - to show let's make her go to ram here go
03:26 - to around here yep around here this is
03:28 - pretty good point in direction 90 cuz it
03:33 - has to point this way and we gotta make
03:35 - her turn back so we gotta make her not
03:37 - to turn around
03:39 - so we need to put this you know click on
03:42 - that look at that thing right here right
03:45 - that thing right there this thing and
03:48 - then scare you then set you need
03:51 - text-to-speech so you normally go and
03:54 - hear and get to the Texas speech then
03:56 - you gotta set voice to you can use also
04:01 - if you want but I I'll use squeak and
04:06 - speak I'm
04:20 - sorry caps lock is on and speak I'm so
04:30 - so say I'm lost and then you can also
04:35 - make her sing it as well that's optional
04:38 - but I'm gonna do it so let's say I'm
04:47 - then then do it repeat until love you
04:56 - until touching the edge so they'll touch
05:00 - the edge and then they'll broadcast a
05:02 - message to change the backdrop for
05:04 - touching an edge then move five steps
05:09 - he's got to make it a smooth and steady
05:13 - things so you got to do next costume so
05:18 - it looks like he's walking because the
05:20 - costumes will take a to walk three times
05:22 - and then it's what it looks like it's
05:25 - walking then it waits a little bit or
05:28 - also the feet will go away too quickly
05:30 - just make it wait not one second 0.1
05:33 - second or else the feet will go too slow
05:37 - and make her go hide because we want to
05:41 - make her touch the edge and then she
05:43 - hides because she went to the mountain
05:45 - and broadcast and broadcast we gotta
05:50 - make a new message broadcast switch back
05:58 - so this is a battery so when I receive
06:06 - switch back drop switch back drop to the
06:11 - mountain listen this is where he meets
06:12 - the the what's that called again Oh bear
06:18 - so switch back drop this where he meets
06:22 - the bear so and then the bear spray the
06:29 - bear sprite yeah
06:30 - so when clicked when you clicked I'm
06:36 - gonna zoom in a little bit go to about
06:40 - right here
06:43 - go to around there and hide because in
06:47 - the beginning it has to hide so let's
06:50 - play this script so then I don't I
06:52 - actually now let's not play that script
06:55 - it lets to do when you switch back draw
06:58 - you can use the same broadcast message
07:01 - because it's basically doing it's a one
07:05 - message can handle few things so again
07:07 - let's do set size to 50% because it
07:11 - looks like it's coming out and it's
07:12 - growing bigger and bigger so let's set
07:14 - size to 50%
07:17 - let's first do this and then change it
07:21 - this way ninety degrees and then Glide
07:25 - okay glide around here let's make a
07:35 - guide around here glide around here like
07:41 - one second 267 negative 29 so change
07:49 - size by 20% so it's growing bigger 20 so
07:56 - it's gonna grow bigger and bigger like
07:58 - now I didn't play the animation yet so
08:00 - it's not growing bigger that's a second
08:02 - so glide one second let's say up to
08:12 - let's actually go more up because it's
08:15 - pretty small
08:17 - so let's glide like up to here maybe a
08:22 - little bit back around here yep around
08:33 - here
08:33 - 41 negative 73 this is close enough and
08:39 - then we got a do change size by 20 so it
08:44 - grows bigger okay and then if we need to
08:49 - do broadcast BAM attack that's when the
08:52 - bear attacks Giga well not really
08:54 - because she didn't scratch her anything
08:57 - but chases her bear attack so and also
09:06 - we need another one when I receive
09:07 - switchback drop repeat 15 times next
09:11 - costume so it's like moving up next
09:14 - costume 0.1 wait zoom let's good enough
09:25 - and let's go down here back to kick up
09:29 - so when I receive bear attack let's peek
09:35 - oh no it's a better and also say because
09:57 - yeah you can also say it if you want
10:00 - it's optional and then point in
10:10 - Direction negative 90 and remember you
10:15 - have to point in direction negative 90
10:19 - remember what I said earlier
10:23 - negative money who goes this way as you
10:26 - can see this is you have always had to
10:30 - clip this or also flip over so that's
10:33 - why you got to always click this and
10:36 - then we need repeat until it's touching
10:42 - the edge sensing because it has a sense
10:46 - that it's touching the edge and move
10:49 - five steps move five steps next costume
10:58 - mm-hmm
10:59 - now wait 0.1 seconds and then broadcast
11:07 - we need another message broadcast
11:11 - backdrop change broadcast backdrop
11:18 - change to okay so remember she's running
11:31 - backwards Giga is running backwards so
11:39 - she was running backwards cuz point
11:41 - Direction negative 90 so you also had to
11:43 - do it for her as well yeah that's it
11:46 - don't see if it spins over oh that's
11:49 - great so you also gotta do it for the
11:52 - kid goes well you know wait you got it
11:57 - with a backdrop in the backdrop again
12:00 - because we made a new doctor up change
12:04 - too and then switch back to the winter
12:10 - switch backdrop to the winter again
12:12 - because she flipped backwards basically
12:15 - she went the other way instead of the
12:18 - right side her face was pointing to the
12:20 - left side and then she runs back to the
12:22 - winter the winter that drop so let's go
12:29 - back to
12:33 - back to giggle so when I received back
12:41 - drop change to because remember a
12:48 - message can handle more than one one one
12:54 - thing so go to around here because she's
13:01 - like running back so go to here let's
13:05 - make it a little bit closer she isn't in
13:08 - soil go to here and then repeat repeat
13:15 - until her appeal until European Hill
13:19 - touching and touching move seven steps
13:32 - next costume
13:37 - wait 0.1 second so now she's running
13:42 - quicker because she found a banner and
13:45 - then hide I forgot to make her show so
13:51 - we need to make it back-to-back SOT
13:55 - change because I switch back drop cuz
13:58 - that's the first one so go - so guys I
14:07 - came back at just checked out my
14:09 - animation guys I just forgotten some
14:11 - simple moves to put a show here cuz the
14:14 - bear was hiding so remember go back to
14:17 - the switchback drop thing and put a show
14:19 - and right here the switchback drop I
14:21 - forgot this as well sorry guys
14:23 - um the switchback drop right here and go
14:26 - to X negative 169 it can be anywhere but
14:29 - I decided to go here and show it's
14:34 - working free frequently again so I'm so
14:38 - let's um start on where we were again I
14:44 - think we were on
14:47 - giggle right here yeah yeah yeah we're a
14:54 -  so that trap changed to speak ah I
15:00 - like she's screaming and then speak run
15:10 - away and then you can also do say so
15:29 - broadcast we lost him
15:34 - we lost what up yeah redcap make a new
15:39 - message called we lost him we're not
15:41 - going straight there yet we've lost him
15:46 - so we got to do so yep we finished up
15:54 - this code right here this codes right
16:00 - here yeah we already finished this up
16:01 - and then now the bear when I receive
16:06 - after up change to go to X let's say 167
16:14 - it's near right there and negative 105
16:17 - give me anywhere but I decided to choose
16:20 - these exact things and then repeat until
16:24 - touching the edge move seven steps
16:35 - because you have to move the babe as
16:38 - well and then next costume wait
16:49 - actually we have to scrap this um
16:54 - backdrop change to go to X let's say 200
17:03 - [Music]
17:05 - 4184 like these hide wait 2 seconds show
17:21 - because that you have to show repeat 50
17:30 - times move five steps slightly slower
17:39 - than giga next costume
17:44 - now wait 0.1 second and when I receive
17:54 - if we lost him because we already made
17:57 - that I receive when you lost him set
18:03 - voice to giant set voice to giant so
18:07 - just dude is giant then speak raw raw
18:19 - then looks we gotta make him say raw so
18:32 - that is all the code for today and thank
18:36 - you for watching and have a good day
18:40 - [Music]

Channel and please support us that means a lot to us so anyways let's start so we have the cat let's delete the cat sprite then let's get the Giga the Giga let's get this price before we do the background the Giga walking's right then let's take the bear the bear walking not there bear walking and then let's let's change the backdrops so we need two backdrops let's delete it let's delete this one first we got to select one before we do any one so we have to take the heart the winter the winter one and we also need another backdrop which is the mountain this one so we have two

we want to make her touch the edge and then she hides because she went to the mountain and broadcast and broadcast we gotta make a new message broadcast switch back so this is a battery so when I receive switch back drop switch back drop to the mountain listen this is where he meets the the what's that called again Oh bear so switch back drop this where he meets the bear so and then the bear spray the bear sprite yeah so when clicked when you clicked I'm gonna zoom in a little bit go to about right here go to around there and hide because in the beginning it has to hide so let's play this script so then I don't I actually now let's not play that script it lets to do when you switch back draw you can use the same broadcast message because it's basically doing it's a one message can handle few things so again let's do set size to 50% because it looks like it's coming out and it's growing bigger and bigger so let's set size to 50% let's first do this and then change it this way ninety degrees and then Glide okay glide around here let's make a guide around here glide around here like one second 267 negative 29 so change size by 20% so it's growing bigger 20 so it's gonna grow bigger and bigger like now I didn't play the animation yet so it's not growing bigger that's a second so glide one second let's say up to let's actually go more up because it's pretty small so let's glide like up to here maybe a little bit back around here yep around here 41 negative 73 this is close enough and then we got a do change size by 20 so it grows bigger okay and then if we need to do broadcast BAM attack that's when the bear attacks Giga well not really because she didn't scratch her anything but chases her bear attack so and also we need another one when I receive switchback drop repeat 15 times next costume so it's like moving up next costume 0.1 wait zoom let's good enough and let's go down here back to kick up so when I receive bear attack let's peek oh no it's a better and also say because yeah you can also say it if you want it's optional and then point in Direction negative 90 and remember you have to point in direction negative 90 remember what I said earlier negative money who goes this way as you can see this is you have always had to clip this or also flip over so that's why you got to always click this and then we need repeat until it's touching the edge sensing because it has a sense that it's touching the edge and move five steps move five steps next costume mmhmm now wait 0.1 seconds and then broadcast we need another message broadcast backdrop change broadcast backdrop change to okay so remember she's running backwards Giga is running backwards so she was running backwards cuz point Direction negative 90 so you also had to do it for her as well yeah that's it don't see if it spins over oh that's great so you also gotta do it for the kid goes well you know wait you got it with a backdrop in the backdrop again because we made a new doctor up change too and then switch back to the winter switch backdrop to the winter again because she flipped backwards basically she went the other way instead of the right side her face was pointing to the left side and then she runs back to the winter the winter that drop so let's go back to back to giggle so when I received back drop change to because remember a message can handle more than one one one thing so go to around here because she's like running back so go to here let's make it a little bit closer she isn't in soil go to here and then repeat repeat until her appeal until European Hill touching and touching move seven steps next costume wait 0.1 second so now she's running quicker because she found a banner and then hide I forgot to make her show so we need to make it backtoback SOT change because I switch back drop cuz that's the first one so go so guys I came back at just checked out my animation guys I just forgotten some simple moves to put a show here cuz the bear was hiding so remember go back to the switchback drop thing and put a show and right here the switchback drop I forgot this as well sorry guys um the switchback drop right here and go to X negative 169 it can be anywhere but I decided to go here and show it's working free frequently again so I'm so let's um start on where we were again I think we were on giggle right here yeah yeah yeah we're a so that trap changed to speak ah I like she's screaming and then speak run away and then you can also do say so broadcast we lost him we lost what up yeah redcap make a new message called we lost him we're not going straight there yet we've lost him so we got to do so yep we finished up this code right here this codes right here yeah we already finished this up and then now the bear when I receive after up change to go to X let's say 167 it's near right there and negative 105 give me anywhere but I decided to choose these exact things and then repeat until touching the edge move seven steps because you have to move the babe as well and then next costume wait actually we have to scrap this um backdrop change to go to X let's say 200 4184 like these hide wait 2 seconds show because that you have to show repeat 50 times move five steps slightly slower than giga next costume now wait 0.1 second and when I receive if we lost him because we already made that I receive when you lost him set voice to giant set voice to giant so just dude is giant then speak raw raw then looks we gotta make him say raw so that is all the code for today and thank you for watching and have a good day
