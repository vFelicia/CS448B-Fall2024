00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to
00:09 - kidscoolingplayground
00:11 - so this will be the third among us part
00:14 - three the animated story
00:17 - so the part 2 we did the the first
00:21 - stage where you know the saiyan can take
00:25 - out the red
00:26 - among us sprite and then we go on to the
00:29 - next stage
00:30 - then there's a pink among us sprite
00:33 - there
00:34 - so what we continue to do is we did the
00:36 - door for our last
00:37 - video um so we'll continue working on
00:41 - stage three and then all the other
00:43 - weapons that you can use to take out
00:46 - this crew
00:48 - so let me just run through it one more
00:50 - time
00:51 - so just refresh everyone so you say
00:55 - start so
00:58 - okay let's do that again no this one is
01:00 - not correct you see how this is
01:02 - showing up you need to fix that
01:06 - so in here make sure that you code it
01:08 - for the first
01:09 - first one just in case you know
01:11 - something like this happen
01:12 - because a different episode right go to
01:14 - one
01:15 - so what you can do is do this okay let's
01:17 - start again so we have this one second
01:19 - for now we can change it back to like
01:21 - four seconds so the user can read but uh
01:24 - for right now we just keep it at one
01:26 - let's run it again
01:28 - so you have this right and then it comes
01:30 - to here
01:31 - then we call it the club
01:33 - [Applause]
01:35 - we can kind of hit them and then swirl
01:38 - effect
01:39 - we're going to push the up they open the
01:40 - door it hides the sprite
01:42 - and it goes to the stage two and you
01:44 - have the paint
01:45 - among us okay so that's what we left off
01:48 - last time
01:49 - so let's begin again so we'll continue
01:52 - here
01:53 - so uh what we want to do next is that we
01:55 - can work on the other one like the laser
01:57 - gun
01:58 - the infinity garnet and lightsaber and
02:00 - so on okay so we're going to do the
02:03 - laser gun so the laser comes a little
02:06 - bit different
02:07 - it's actually not a weapon over here
02:09 - when i did it at that time i actually
02:11 - did it with the uh
02:12 - a costume so we'll just do it like that
02:14 - so you can do it other way but
02:16 - so what you do is you we're gonna put
02:18 - this little laser gun i found online
02:20 - just kind of
02:20 - cut it up and then we just kind of move
02:23 - it and copy it and then move it over
02:25 - here so if you want to add different
02:26 - sprite
02:27 - you can just upload this sprite into
02:30 - here
02:31 - say upload and then you find your spray
02:33 - upload and then after that just
02:34 - kind of copy the image and put it in
02:36 - here
02:38 - if you guys want me to show you let me
02:39 - see if i can
02:41 - so we're going to show you here um
02:45 - so let's say you kind of pick a sprite
02:48 - when you download online sometimes
02:50 - they're not the icon is not
02:52 - clean even though it says png sometimes
02:54 - it's not like for example
02:56 - this is the old laser gun we had right
02:58 - so as you can see you have white
03:00 - it has some white background here so
03:03 - you have to use like the scratch 2.0 to
03:06 - clean it up
03:06 - if you don't know how to do that take a
03:08 - look at one of our uh how to uh
03:10 - series and then we actually show that
03:13 - and you can download
03:14 - scratch 2.0 and use the magic wand and
03:16 - do that
03:17 - so after you clean it up you can import
03:20 - it here after you import it here you can
03:21 - do convert to vector
03:23 - and you can kind of select this and then
03:25 - you can put it into your
03:27 - sprite here and then you can resize it
03:30 - however you want right
03:32 - since you see how this one has a has a
03:34 - back
03:35 - white background which is no good so
03:37 - this one i did is i clean up the
03:39 - background
03:40 - so after that you can just kind of move
03:42 - in and
03:43 - rotate and then just give that give it
03:46 - to your sprite
03:47 - so anyway if you need to know how to do
03:48 - that look at the uh
03:50 - what about to do uh how to video on how
03:53 - to clean up a background for a sprite
03:55 - okay
03:56 - not go into that for now so what happens
03:58 - is you just pick any weapon
04:00 - you created online or you can create you
04:02 - can draw your own
04:04 - and then just put it for this uh sprite
04:07 - okay okay so
04:10 - what we're going to do is we're going to
04:12 - create a code down here
04:14 - okay say when
04:19 - so number two is press so we did number
04:21 - one on the club so number two is press
04:24 - and same thing that what we did in club
04:26 - right it it's not
04:28 - not in progress basically the they're
04:30 - not saying anything then we want to do
04:32 - that right so same kind of logic we need
04:34 - okay let's go back to our sprite here
04:38 - let's
04:39 - zoom in a little bit we're calling for
04:42 - number two
04:44 - uh attack which is the laser gun
04:47 - okay so you drag the if and l statement
04:50 - here
04:51 - if and then i mean we don't need the
04:52 - else and then
04:54 - you the nut operator
04:58 - and then you drag the equal operator
05:01 - go to variable um select this
05:05 - dialog in progress say
05:08 - but yes basically saying is dialogue
05:10 - progress is no or you can actually do it
05:12 - like this
05:13 - if you don't want to do it or not then
05:14 - you can say
05:16 - no whatever it will be the same thing so
05:18 - this
05:20 - is the same as not yes
05:23 - okay since i did it not yes i can
05:27 - let's just continue using that uh what
05:30 - you can do is
05:32 - you can switch to
05:35 - custom number two so we're gonna delete
05:37 - that icon actually
05:40 - here this thing's messed up so we're
05:42 - gonna switch to custom number two which
05:43 - is the
05:44 - the sprite holding the laser gun
05:47 - okay put that over here and what we do
05:51 - is we're gonna do a wait for one second
05:53 - kind of show up a little bit
05:55 - and we're gonna broadcast a new message
06:00 - called fire
06:05 - laser okay so this will fire the laser
06:09 - and wait
06:09 - until the other uh message is finished
06:12 - right
06:13 - and we'll do a little bit away again
06:16 - then we want to switch it back
06:17 - to custom number one which is the
06:21 - standard costume okay so
06:24 - we're gonna use this fire the laser
06:26 - switch it back to
06:28 - this one okay okay so what we
06:32 - want to do is we're gonna have to code
06:35 - this
06:35 - uh the sonic power that suit from the
06:38 - laser and then like you know kind of fly
06:40 - to the
06:41 - the other sprites right to attack him
06:45 - so we need to do something here
06:48 - so what we want to do is we're going to
06:52 - create when green black is clicked
06:56 - we want to hide the sprite in the
06:58 - beginning
07:00 - now i'm gonna draw a forever loop here
07:06 - and what we're going to do is we're
07:08 - going to change the ghost effect just
07:10 - kind of make it blank
07:11 - blinking so goes
07:15 - effect by 25 and we're gonna wait
07:19 - for 0.1 second
07:24 - do that again duplicate the block okay
07:27 - and then duplicate one more time kind of
07:30 - like a blinking kind of thing
07:32 - okay so when when we run this
07:36 - so let's say i run this just if you want
07:38 - to test something right you can always
07:40 - just you don't actually have to run
07:41 - through everything what you can do is
07:43 - just click on the code block here on top
07:45 - so right now it's actually running you
07:47 - see it's yellow but it's high right so
07:48 - if you say
07:49 - show let's see where is it
07:52 - i don't know where that is actually
07:54 - maybe somewhere here actually let me
07:57 - stop this again okay here it is
08:01 - so so let's try this again
08:06 - so you'll see it it goes away so you see
08:10 - that it kind of flashes and goes away
08:11 - but what we want to do is we're going to
08:13 - have to
08:14 - make it show right and then this thing
08:17 - should
08:17 - should also you know uh show up
08:21 - so we want to show up in high right i
08:23 - think i did it wrong here
08:25 - so what i want to do is i'm going to
08:27 - kind of go dimmer
08:28 - and then i have to go back out actually
08:31 - so i'm going to have to do negative 25
08:34 - and then 25. okay let's try it again so
08:37 - my mistake i did a copy and i forgot to
08:39 - change the effect
08:41 - so oops so i don't actually have to do
08:43 - that
08:44 - just click on the green flag let me see
08:46 - this
08:48 - oh it is so you can see it's blinking
08:51 - you see this it's blinking that's what
08:53 - we want right so we're
08:54 - hiding making it dimmer and then making
08:57 - it uh making a brighter dimmer and
08:58 - brighter a bit demonstrating
09:00 - so that's why it's kind of having this
09:02 - blinking effect okay
09:04 - all right okay so
09:08 - we have the fire laser right so what we
09:10 - want to do is
09:12 - from here with this fire laser right so
09:14 - what we want to do is go back over here
09:18 - so when i receive fire laser
09:22 - i want to create a clone of myself
09:27 - so basically going to create one of this
09:29 - sounding tower
09:31 - okay and then you have to say when i
09:33 - start as a clone what you want to do
09:35 - so this will actually call this
09:39 - so what we want to do is we're going to
09:41 - set up another well another variable i
09:44 - think
09:45 - called got hit
09:48 - so got hit you have to create that for
09:50 - the sonic power only
09:51 - okay just for the clone so that you can
09:54 - so
09:54 - we don't want to so we want to keep
09:57 - track of
09:58 - if the actually the sonic power should
10:00 - hit him let's say i can
10:02 - shoot the other way and it will not hit
10:03 - him so we want to
10:05 - check that make sure that actually hit
10:07 - him before we change the
10:09 - you know the effect for this uh uh for
10:12 - this uh uh
10:12 - among the spray so that's why we need to
10:14 - create another
10:16 - variable called gap hit so we don't know
10:18 - how to do this you can click on make
10:19 - variable
10:20 - and say got hit put got hit here
10:23 - and then you can select for this sprite
10:27 - only
10:27 - okay so that will create the
10:31 - variable basically this is a private
10:33 - variable for sonic power okay
10:36 - okay so what we want to do is
10:40 - we want to set got
10:44 - hit to note so first
10:47 - meaning like when you start the clone
10:48 - that means it did not hit the uh
10:51 - hit the uh the other sprite this right
10:53 - right
10:54 - so and then we want to make this go to
11:00 - so that means when they fire the gun
11:03 - this clone should go to the cyan
11:06 - and we want to point in the direction of
11:08 - the science of the
11:09 - just like the club right so the science
11:11 - pointing to the to the right
11:13 - right now the signs pointing to the
11:14 - right so this thing will actually go in
11:17 - here
11:17 - okay so the cyan is pointing to the left
11:20 - then the sky will point it the other way
11:22 - okay so that's what we want to do
11:24 - so what we want to do is point in
11:27 - direction here
11:29 - and then go to sensing and you have to
11:32 - pick out
11:32 - from here put it here so always select
11:35 - the back one first
11:36 - before you select the front so you
11:38 - select cyan first
11:40 - and then you select direction okay
11:44 - and then we will do a move
11:48 - 50 steps what happened is we want the
11:52 - the sonic power come out from like right
11:55 - here we don't want it to come out from
11:56 - his stomach
11:57 - right we're gonna push 50 steps so that
12:00 - it's somewhere like this
12:01 - okay that's why we have that 50 set
12:04 - and then we'll say show so that way now
12:07 - after we
12:07 - do all this coordinate thing then we'll
12:09 - show that way
12:11 - you can always see it kind of flying
12:12 - like this i mean let me change the
12:14 - costume for this guy so you can
12:17 - see a little bit better so maybe
12:18 - something like this okay
12:21 - so you can adjust it so if you think uh
12:24 - 50 is not enough you can put 100 or 75
12:27 - whatever kind of justice so that it
12:28 - looks like this
12:29 - okay so i think i have 50 let's just try
12:32 - i think 50 is fine
12:33 - okay now next we will want to say repeat
12:38 - until
12:41 - okay so here we want to make sure that
12:46 - you know
12:47 - we want to destroy the clone if you're
12:49 - doing clone you have to make sure you
12:50 - delete the clone
12:51 - so we want to make sure that you know
12:53 - when you touch the edge or touch this
12:55 - guy the clone should
12:56 - disappear if not you keep on having too
12:58 - many calls on the
13:00 - game it's not good it can potentially
13:02 - mess up your game
13:03 - okay and it looks better when you when
13:06 - the bullet hit the
13:07 - hit this guy the laser hit this guy the
13:09 - laser disappear
13:10 - okay so what we want to do is we're
13:13 - gonna have to use the or join
13:15 - because we wanna check if it actually
13:18 - hit him
13:18 - or the edge right so we'll use the whole
13:21 - joint
13:22 - so all meaning either condition happen
13:25 - it will work so we'll say select the
13:28 - among the sprite which is the red one
13:30 - here
13:31 - and then duplicate this and then we'll
13:34 - say touching
13:34 - edge meaning you know it missed the uh
13:38 - mr spry and it hit it on the edge okay
13:41 - so after that you're gonna say
13:45 - set so we want to set this gap head to
13:49 - yes
13:49 - now since we it was every time the clone
13:52 - created is known
13:53 - but if it either touching the edge or
13:55 - touching this then we say
13:57 - got it yes i mean oh sorry i got it
14:00 - wrong
14:02 - so um we're gonna do that a little bit
14:05 - later only if you actually hit the
14:07 - among us sprite then we'll go through
14:09 - cut it yes
14:10 - my bad so what we want to do one make it
14:12 - move right so you have to say move
14:14 - 10 step as you can see it's just a 10
14:17 - step you don't need like negative a
14:18 - positive
14:19 - since you're already pointing to the
14:20 - direction so if you're pointing to the
14:23 - this side if you say 10 step and just go
14:25 - on this side you point this side
14:27 - 10 step it will go on the right side
14:28 - okay all right okay we need another
14:31 - condition here
14:35 - so if oops
14:39 - i'm making a lot of mistake today for
14:42 - some reason
14:44 - okay so we want to duplicate this so if
14:47 - it actually touch
14:48 - the among us you know then we say god
14:52 - hit
14:52 - is yes okay that means it hit the among
14:54 - us sprite
14:56 - okay and then
15:00 - what we want to do is so i've either it
15:03 - touch the edge or this it will finish
15:05 - the the code here will go out of this
15:07 - loop
15:08 - then we will do another check here
15:11 - okay so we say if the got hit
15:14 - it'll use another operator here to check
15:19 - and select the variable got hit
15:22 - if it is go to yes meaning like it got
15:24 - hit
15:25 - right here you go yes then we're gonna
15:27 - broadcast a message
15:30 - what has a message
15:34 - okay this time we're gonna say
15:38 - god hit by laser
15:41 - okay so this is for the the among us uh
15:44 - sprite to
15:45 - change the effect okay and after that we
15:48 - want to set this back
15:51 - just resetting it just in case you know
15:54 - you might not need to but uh just for
15:57 - good of it we'll just reset it back to
15:58 - no
15:59 - and then we can delete this clone
16:05 - delete this clone so basically make this
16:07 - disappear
16:08 - okay all right so let's zoom back out
16:12 - so let's see so this is everything that
16:15 - we had
16:16 - to find the laser we'll call this code
16:18 - and run this
16:20 - okay so that's what we have so far let's
16:22 - go back to the red
16:24 - uh the red um uh sprite here
16:30 - so what we need to do is we are going to
16:32 - have to code this right so
16:34 - because we haven't called the red sprite
16:35 - to change things right when we got hit
16:37 - right
16:38 - so where to do that so we will try to
16:41 - put it over here let me move this on the
16:43 - top
16:43 - so these are all the control moves are
16:45 - like from one place or another we'll put
16:48 - on top
16:49 - and then we are going to do the you know
16:51 - the effect on the bottom
16:52 - you know so this is the first one is the
16:54 - club
16:56 - so second one you can say got hit by
16:58 - laser
17:00 - uh what we want to do is we want to
17:03 - insert a swirl we'll do the
17:05 - fisheye effect by 25 play the sound
17:09 - and broadcast mission complete so
17:14 - so you remember the mission completely
17:16 - coded earlier on the portal
17:18 - so basically it will open up the portal
17:20 - or allow you to go into the door
17:22 - so for this one if it's not backdrop one
17:25 - seven
17:26 - or eight it will show the door and it
17:29 - will show it will show the
17:30 - portal inside inside so the portal okay
17:33 - so it's not one of these
17:34 - those have the portal so after your
17:36 - broadcast mission uh
17:37 - uh complete okay and then after that you
17:40 - can go back over here
17:42 - so you can see right here so if you push
17:45 - the up key
17:46 - and you're touching the portal or high
17:48 - broadcast next stage
17:50 - it will open it will not allow the open
17:52 - door again which
17:54 - will actually change the uh the
17:55 - background of the sprite here
17:58 - on the portal
18:02 - uh so right here not in the portal i
18:04 - mean on the background so you have like
18:06 - next stage you'll
18:07 - go on to the next background so let's
18:09 - just try it
18:10 - out let's see how it works not sure it's
18:13 - gonna work let's see
18:14 - should let's try it out so we're gonna
18:17 - start
18:17 - so you can see we have the club and
18:20 - let's just use a laser right now number
18:22 - two
18:23 - so you see it didn't work right
18:27 - so something is wrong so let's see
18:28 - what's wrong
18:31 - so we made some mistakes so we did a
18:33 - copy from here right so that's why
18:35 - so when when you're doing coding you
18:37 - always want to check if it doesn't work
18:39 - see how you're going to figure out how
18:41 - you do it so as you can see when we
18:43 - shoot
18:43 - it's touching among us so this is
18:45 - correct and you can open up
18:47 - like the variable right so let's say if
18:50 - you try to debug your code or
18:52 - some problem you see got hit is no no
18:55 - so let's just try it again so let's say
18:57 - we say yes
18:58 - so this is no so let's say hit two
19:03 - so i think you cannot really see it
19:05 - because of the clone
19:07 - okay so we were not able to get it
19:09 - working so let's just check through our
19:11 - code make sure everything is
19:12 - correct so here we have got hit this no
19:16 - and we see that touching either this or
19:18 - this and then we get
19:20 - yes so if this is yes then we're gonna
19:22 - broadcast this message
19:24 - so i think we might have some error on
19:26 - the uh here and the among us
19:28 - so here actually we actually did it
19:31 - wrong here
19:33 - we actually don't need that that way
19:35 - until
19:37 - so uh actually when we actually we know
19:39 - that it got hit because this is
19:41 - the sprite here that checks it if it's
19:43 - already touching the uh
19:45 - among us sprite uh we know that it got
19:48 - hit so
19:49 - and then we broadcast this message so
19:51 - when we look at this message we know
19:53 - that
19:54 - this guy got hit already so we actually
19:56 - don't need to have this way until
19:58 - uh touching club or touching the sonic
20:00 - power
20:01 - so i think i made a mistake because i
20:03 - did a copy from here
20:04 - so it's always i mean all the time you
20:07 - know you
20:07 - you will make mistake from coding you
20:09 - know not always one time it will always
20:12 - work so
20:12 - when i do coding i have never done it
20:14 - like one time i will always work
20:16 - so try to like learn how to debug and
20:18 - find out what the problem
20:20 - is so you just kind of check you know
20:22 - what what
20:23 - what would it be wrong you know things
20:25 - look correct here then you see like okay
20:27 - it's broadcasting this
20:28 - so what is it doing i think before i had
20:31 - like touching club or whatever and then
20:33 - i
20:34 - it was incorrect or touching sonic power
20:36 - whatever that is
20:37 - still incorrect so we shouldn't actually
20:39 - need any of that so
20:40 - when we receive this you should just
20:42 - change the fisheye
20:44 - so now let's try it again okay
20:47 - so let's try again uh we have the gun
20:50 - so let's say i shoot on this side right
20:52 - so it should come out on this side you
20:54 - see that
20:55 - come out on this side looks okay
20:58 - not a problem so if i shoot on this side
21:01 - so you can see
21:02 - it got hit it becomes yellow you see it
21:05 - got yellow and then it changed
21:07 - so after that it broadcasts the complete
21:10 - ignition and you can open the door
21:12 - push the up key then you see the
21:16 - the other sprite here which is the uh
21:18 - the uh
21:20 - the pink one but you see we don't see
21:22 - cyan yet so
21:23 - that is incorrect so we need to reset
21:26 - cyan to a position maybe right here
21:28 - okay so what you want to do is kind of
21:31 - open up cyan
21:32 - see where your cyan is okay
21:35 - click on them you see let's say let's
21:37 - say we move them right here
21:39 - so what you want to do is let's go back
21:40 - to cyan
21:44 - so we have the code for the backdrop
21:45 - right so backdrop one
21:47 - so we can duplicate this so sometime
21:50 - when you duplicate code make sure you
21:51 - change it correctly
21:53 - so that happened to me right so
21:56 - so this is backdrop two so we want the
21:58 - sign let's say go to somewhere here
22:01 - then you can make sure you delete this
22:03 - go to get the new go to from here
22:06 - put it here okay and then
22:10 - you can say show or you can have switch
22:13 - to custom one too
22:14 - just in case you know you're switching
22:16 - from another one to here
22:18 - it doesn't hurt or you can i think uh
22:20 - even show is fine because
22:22 - we always reset it after the gun or the
22:24 - club white
22:25 - we always reset it but anyway let's just
22:28 - do that
22:28 - so that you know whenever the screen
22:31 - change from one screen to the next
22:33 - it has the custom show as one okay let's
22:36 - run it again
22:38 - okay we're gonna use the club this time
22:40 - make sure that's the box
22:41 - so that works fine
22:42 - [Applause]
22:44 - so you open the door you can see that
22:46 - yellow is bright lighting up meaning
22:48 - it's working
22:49 - running the code so let's say use this
22:51 - so you can see
22:53 - fisheye and then the total open up you
22:55 - see that so now we're done with
22:57 - the second stage right
23:00 - so we push up again if we put up this
23:03 - will activate here we'll touch bottom or
23:05 - higher stage so let's go back over here
23:08 - we'll push up
23:10 - so you see this cool run now you see
23:12 - this photo is coming up right that's
23:14 - incorrect
23:14 - so this is stage three the portal should
23:17 - not come
23:18 - only come when after we broadcast the
23:20 - message saying
23:22 - the mission is complete so this is
23:25 - incorrect we need to fix that
23:28 - so what we want to do is go to the
23:30 - portal we add a small piece of code that
23:32 - will kind of
23:33 - take care of some of this problem uh
23:35 - what we can do also we can set the uh
23:38 - like the location of the portal where
23:40 - you want to go
23:41 - so um what we can do is since this is
23:44 - the
23:44 - second one let's say let's just put it
23:47 - here
23:48 - so we haven't done that so first stage
23:50 - we don't have a portal right second
23:51 - stage where portal let's say we want to
23:52 - put at this location
23:54 - then you can say okay go to this
23:56 - location
23:57 - right but don't show until the actually
24:00 - the
24:01 - stuff is done and also what we want to
24:04 - do is
24:04 - every time you receive something called
24:06 - next
24:07 - next stage we want to hide it so
24:10 - when you move from one stage to the next
24:12 - we want to hide it
24:14 - and only show when actually you know
24:16 - when you completed the mission
24:18 - so now let's test it again
24:22 - so here we use the club
24:25 - that works fine we're able to go into
24:27 - the door
24:29 - so so now switch to backdrop too it
24:32 - actually has the border over here you
24:34 - cannot see it because it's not shown
24:36 - so if i take out this
24:39 - stuff here this uh this among us right
24:42 - here you see the portal comes up
24:44 - once i go in this code should run you
24:47 - see it run really fast and hide it so
24:49 - you don't actually see it
24:50 - okay all right so we'll go on and do
24:54 - the next part of the next weapon
24:57 - okay so let's stop this let's go to the
24:59 - hand which is the infinite corner
25:02 - so what we want to do is we're gonna say
25:05 - green flag is clicked
25:09 - okay so what we want to say is high
25:15 - and then we will want to throw in a
25:16 - forever loop
25:18 - here and similar to the other one we
25:20 - want to make sure that it goes to the
25:22 - cyan
25:25 - okay go to cyan and we also want to
25:28 - point in the direction that the cyan is
25:30 - pointing right
25:31 - so similar to that one go to sensing
25:35 - grab this guy here and you select the
25:37 - back one first
25:39 - cyan and then we want to say direction
25:43 - okay so the glove will point to the left
25:46 - or the right depending
25:47 - where the cyan guy is standing okay
25:51 - so what we want to do is we want to have
25:54 - another if condition here is a little
25:56 - bit different
25:56 - so what we want the glove to be let's
25:59 - say let me open cyan here
26:01 - and open the glove here so we want to
26:05 - make the the hand kind of like like this
26:09 - in front of uh you know this guy a
26:11 - little bit in the front
26:12 - on the top you know top top right or top
26:16 - left depending what is that right
26:18 - so that you know it it looks a little
26:20 - bit better
26:21 - so what we want to do is
26:25 - we have if an else condition
26:28 - so we need to do the sensing again here
26:33 - and select cyan
26:36 - and we're going to check the direction
26:38 - okay
26:40 - direction so
26:43 - now where you can use the operator
26:46 - we're going to use the greater than so
26:49 - greater than zero
26:52 - so when it's greater than zero meaning
26:54 - it's actually pointing to the right
26:56 - so the direction is like less than zero
26:58 - you see this is
27:00 - let's say we go here this is pointing to
27:03 - the right
27:04 - right any any number is positive it's
27:06 - pointing to the right right you see
27:08 - any number that's negative it's actually
27:10 - pointing to the left you can see right
27:12 - so you can see the hand kind of switch
27:14 - let me put the hand over here maybe i
27:16 - don't know it may be easier to see
27:18 - so you see positive pointing to the
27:20 - right
27:22 - negative pointing to the left so we're
27:23 - trying to see where it's actually
27:25 - pointing
27:26 - and then we're going to make the hand
27:28 - going up accordingly okay
27:31 - okay and you want to set it at this uh
27:34 - this one here so that doesn't rotate all
27:36 - around okay
27:38 - so we're gonna put it back at 90. so if
27:41 - it's the direction
27:42 - is greater than zero meaning pointing to
27:45 - the right
27:46 - side okay okay
27:49 - what you want to do is say motion
27:53 - set x
27:57 - and we want to use the operator
28:00 - use a plus so what we want to do is
28:03 - we're going to find out where cyan is
28:05 - standing
28:06 - in the x position so select cyan
28:09 - x position put this in here
28:12 - and then you say plus i mean you have to
28:14 - test it for me i already tested so i
28:16 - know
28:17 - so i say plus 45 and do something
28:20 - similar here
28:21 - and this one is where to do a minus
28:26 - plus i always say use this
28:30 - the x position let's say if cyan is you
28:33 - know is uh standing on the right
28:35 - i mean facing to the right we want the
28:38 - glove to
28:38 - you know show up like right here so if
28:41 - he's actually facing if science facing
28:43 - to the left let's say
28:44 - facing to the left this side
28:47 - then we want the glove to be on this
28:49 - side okay got it
28:51 - so hopefully you understand that okay so
28:54 - that's why i have to check here so i
28:56 - know where it's gonna show
28:58 - okay now we are going to minimize this a
29:01 - little bit put this over here on the
29:02 - side
29:03 - so we have the code for number three
29:06 - so similar to what we did for number two
29:09 - and one right
29:11 - um why am i not able to find my code
29:15 - okay here's the callback so when i say
29:19 - three so this is the number third plot
29:21 - power the infinite garnet so we're gonna
29:24 - try to call that and also same thing
29:27 - right we have to make sure that is
29:28 - not in progress you know the uh
29:31 - no one is talking so make sure that we
29:34 - want to do that
29:35 - so that you know we don't want the
29:37 - sprite to kill off the other guy before
29:39 - you have a chance to talk
29:40 - okay so this one
29:43 - you say equal
29:47 - and over here
29:50 - so dialogue with dialogue variable
29:56 - okay and you put down yes so
29:59 - not yes then we want to make sure that
30:02 - we can go to the front layer
30:04 - so that it will show up in front of
30:06 - everything else
30:08 - okay and then we want to show
30:11 - because we have high in the beginning
30:13 - right so we're gonna show
30:15 - and then broadcast our message
30:22 - so what we're going to broadcast is snap
30:25 - like a finger snap so that
30:28 - that nose will do a finger snap right to
30:30 - make everything disappear
30:32 - so that works well because uh scratch
30:34 - will have something like ghost effect
30:36 - we can make things disappear okay
30:39 - we can put this one and then we are
30:42 - going to
30:43 - hide it okay so now we have done the
30:47 - gauntlet code but we still go back to
30:49 - the anonymous right
30:50 - to fix it okay so now we have
30:54 - got hit by laser right the club now
30:56 - we're gonna do the among us
30:58 - uh just pull this event here
31:01 - and change it to snap
31:04 - okay and what we want to do is we're
31:07 - going to repeat 10 times
31:10 - and then i'm going to try to use this
31:13 - ghost effect west coast effect
31:17 - okay so change ghost effect
31:22 - by 10 and then we want to
31:25 - do a little weight so 0.1
31:29 - second so a little bit of weight to 10
31:32 - times
31:33 - and then we're gonna play the sound
31:38 - until done and we want to broadcast the
31:41 - message
31:42 - same thing okay so now let's let's try
31:45 - it out
31:46 - so see how it works so now number three
31:50 - for thanos who actually doesn't care
31:52 - actually way snappy
31:53 - looking on the left side snapping it the
31:56 - right side doesn't matter
31:57 - so let's say i'm facing to the left side
31:59 - if i use number three the gun will be
32:02 - somewhere
32:02 - here so as you can see you can't make
32:05 - the other guy disappear
32:07 - right and then what has the complete
32:09 - message you can go in
32:11 - same thing i mean if you think you've
32:13 - gone that's a little bit
32:14 - too close you can adjust it let's see do
32:17 - it again
32:18 - so it's right here and if you want to
32:20 - move them a little bit further
32:21 - then what you do is you go to the
32:23 - garment and change this position like
32:26 - 45-50
32:28 - so now we're done with gauntlet now
32:30 - stage three
32:31 - same thing right we don't have anything
32:33 - yet but we do have
32:35 - uh created the power for the
32:38 - laser and the infinity gauntlet right so
32:42 - in stage three
32:43 - we can go back over here so what we need
32:45 - to do we have
32:46 - like stage one stage two right so we
32:48 - need to do something for stage three
32:50 - to show it right okay so you can just
32:54 - copy this
32:56 - duplicate let me move this down a little
32:59 - bit
32:59 - i'll adjust it later so i get more space
33:03 - so now we have one two and then we'll do
33:06 - number three
33:07 - so number three you can kind of put
33:09 - whatever you want
33:10 - i have some coordinate already down but
33:12 - what you can do is just kind of open the
33:15 - this guy and just try and drag him
33:17 - around where you want to put them right
33:18 - and then you can just grab the motion
33:20 - and just put it okay
33:22 - so let's say we want to put him right
33:24 - here or whatever doesn't matter
33:26 - right then you know you can
33:29 - you know uh just drag this position like
33:32 - this
33:32 - or whatever right so i think we all had
33:35 - a hundred so we can't keep it a hundred
33:37 - so let's say we want negative 105 get a
33:40 - good number
33:41 - and then negative 100 right
33:45 - and then what we want to do is uh we're
33:47 - gonna face it to the
33:49 - let's say he's gonna face the other way
33:51 - he didn't know that
33:52 - something's happening to him okay let's
33:54 - say he's gonna face the other way
33:56 - so if i hit this back drop three you can
33:58 - see he's actually facing this way
34:00 - right and then make sure you clear the
34:04 - graphic effects of that you know
34:06 - whatever ability you did to him it will
34:08 - clears it up
34:10 - and also cyan number three you also need
34:12 - to do that
34:13 - as well i think we'll probably move this
34:16 - guy
34:18 - let's see how i want to do this
34:21 - i'm going to move this over here
34:25 - so i'm going to put this here because
34:27 - this will not change
34:31 - right so we have this this will not
34:34 - change mostly
34:35 - so we're gonna stack this up here so we
34:38 - have
34:38 - one over here and two over here so this
34:42 - is where
34:43 - two and three can open let's say you
34:46 - wanna cyan face this way or this way it
34:48 - doesn't matter
34:50 - right so either way is fine so what you
34:54 - want to do is a backdrop three
34:56 - you're going to say duplicate right so
35:00 - say back drop number three
35:01 - go to the front layer you know let's say
35:04 - you want to implement this position
35:06 - you can right so
35:09 - or you can put it in some other position
35:10 - down there so let's say you want to put
35:12 - them at this position
35:14 - and then switch to custom one and show
35:17 - all you let's say you want to
35:18 - turn around doesn't matter
35:21 - then you have to say the the direction
35:24 - so
35:25 - if you want him to turn around this is
35:27 - one into the right if you want to turn
35:28 - around then you need to do
35:30 - negative so you double click on this you
35:32 - can see that is
35:33 - turning around okay so either way so
35:36 - let's say i didn't have this
35:38 - whatever he is coming in doesn't matter
35:40 - so let's try it again
35:43 - okay so we have this guy
35:46 - here so we're gonna use the club
35:49 - [Applause]
35:52 - we are able to go in
35:56 - then we see this one let's say we use
35:58 - number three
35:59 - [Applause]
36:01 - this guy disappeared the portal open up
36:04 - we go in number three stage number three
36:08 - let's say we use the
36:10 - let's say we use the gun we shoot this
36:11 - side see it doesn't help rather than do
36:14 - it so that's why we have that
36:15 - check uh that got hit right so we have
36:18 - to have that check so it touched the
36:19 - edge doesn't matter
36:21 - i only even touch this sprite so you
36:23 - might go back
36:24 - so when i say touch the sprite then
36:28 - effect then this the photo will show up
36:31 - again we'll go in
36:34 - so as you can see we go in this is stage
36:36 - four where we've got a little computer
36:37 - in the box here
36:39 - so we don't have anything yet for stage
36:41 - four and also we hided the
36:43 - power ability breaker so the empire
36:47 - so when we say we'll get the backdrop
36:49 - number four and hide it so you get more
36:52 - room to see things right i think for the
36:54 - first three stage we want to show you
36:56 - know what the ability the
36:58 - among us character can do after that we
37:01 - don't have it
37:02 - so this is where we're going to start
37:04 - for now i think that's a pretty long
37:06 - video already
37:07 - so we got the gauntlets and then
37:11 - the hand and other stuff done and then
37:13 - moving to stage four
37:15 - so we'll walk on this next time for
37:18 - the stage stage four and other
37:21 - power ups so whatever power-ups we have
37:25 - here so we're done with these three
37:26 - first three
37:27 - we're gonna work on these one next okay
37:30 - all right
37:31 - all right thank you guys uh please like
37:33 - share and subscribe to our channel
37:36 - and comment in the comments below what
37:38 - uh
37:39 - about uh if you have any questions about
37:41 - the video
37:42 - or just love letting us know that you
37:44 - know we'll do a good job or something
37:46 - that would be greatly appreciated
37:47 - all right see you guys next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys and welcome back to kidscoolingplayground so this will be the third among us part three the animated story so the part 2 we did the the first stage where you know the saiyan can take out the red among us sprite and then we go on to the next stage then there's a pink among us sprite there so what we continue to do is we did the door for our last video um so we'll continue working on stage three and then all the other weapons that you can use to take out this crew so let me just run through it one more time so just refresh everyone so you say start so okay let's do that again no this one is not correct you see how this is showing up you need to fix that so in here make sure that you code it for the first first one just in case you know something like this happen because a different episode right go to one so what you can do is do this okay let's start again so we have this one second for now we can change it back to like four seconds so the user can read but uh for right now we just keep it at one let's run it again so you have this right and then it comes to here then we call it the club we can kind of hit them and then swirl effect we're going to push the up they open the door it hides the sprite and it goes to the stage two and you have the paint among us okay so that's what we left off last time so let's begin again so we'll continue here so uh what we want to do next is that we can work on the other one like the laser gun the infinity garnet and lightsaber and so on okay so we're going to do the laser gun so the laser comes a little bit different it's actually not a weapon over here when i did it at that time i actually did it with the uh a costume so we'll just do it like that so you can do it other way but so what you do is you we're gonna put this little laser gun i found online just kind of cut it up and then we just kind of move it and copy it and then move it over here so if you want to add different sprite you can just upload this sprite into here say upload and then you find your spray upload and then after that just kind of copy the image and put it in here if you guys want me to show you let me see if i can so we're going to show you here um so let's say you kind of pick a sprite when you download online sometimes they're not the icon is not clean even though it says png sometimes it's not like for example this is the old laser gun we had right so as you can see you have white it has some white background here so you have to use like the scratch 2.0 to clean it up if you don't know how to do that take a look at one of our uh how to uh series and then we actually show that and you can download scratch 2.0 and use the magic wand and do that so after you clean it up you can import it here after you import it here you can do convert to vector and you can kind of select this and then you can put it into your sprite here and then you can resize it however you want right since you see how this one has a has a back white background which is no good so this one i did is i clean up the background so after that you can just kind of move in and rotate and then just give that give it to your sprite so anyway if you need to know how to do that look at the uh what about to do uh how to video on how to clean up a background for a sprite okay not go into that for now so what happens is you just pick any weapon you created online or you can create you can draw your own and then just put it for this uh sprite okay okay so what we're going to do is we're going to create a code down here okay say when so number two is press so we did number one on the club so number two is press and same thing that what we did in club right it it's not not in progress basically the they're not saying anything then we want to do that right so same kind of logic we need okay let's go back to our sprite here let's zoom in a little bit we're calling for number two uh attack which is the laser gun okay so you drag the if and l statement here if and then i mean we don't need the else and then you the nut operator and then you drag the equal operator go to variable um select this dialog in progress say but yes basically saying is dialogue progress is no or you can actually do it like this if you don't want to do it or not then you can say no whatever it will be the same thing so this is the same as not yes okay since i did it not yes i can let's just continue using that uh what you can do is you can switch to custom number two so we're gonna delete that icon actually here this thing's messed up so we're gonna switch to custom number two which is the the sprite holding the laser gun okay put that over here and what we do is we're gonna do a wait for one second kind of show up a little bit and we're gonna broadcast a new message called fire laser okay so this will fire the laser and wait until the other uh message is finished right and we'll do a little bit away again then we want to switch it back to custom number one which is the standard costume okay so we're gonna use this fire the laser switch it back to this one okay okay so what we want to do is we're gonna have to code this uh the sonic power that suit from the laser and then like you know kind of fly to the the other sprites right to attack him so we need to do something here so what we want to do is we're going to create when green black is clicked we want to hide the sprite in the beginning now i'm gonna draw a forever loop here and what we're going to do is we're going to change the ghost effect just kind of make it blank blinking so goes effect by 25 and we're gonna wait for 0.1 second do that again duplicate the block okay and then duplicate one more time kind of like a blinking kind of thing okay so when when we run this so let's say i run this just if you want to test something right you can always just you don't actually have to run through everything what you can do is just click on the code block here on top so right now it's actually running you see it's yellow but it's high right so if you say show let's see where is it i don't know where that is actually maybe somewhere here actually let me stop this again okay here it is so so let's try this again so you'll see it it goes away so you see that it kind of flashes and goes away but what we want to do is we're going to have to make it show right and then this thing should should also you know uh show up so we want to show up in high right i think i did it wrong here so what i want to do is i'm going to kind of go dimmer and then i have to go back out actually so i'm going to have to do negative 25 and then 25. okay let's try it again so my mistake i did a copy and i forgot to change the effect so oops so i don't actually have to do that just click on the green flag let me see this oh it is so you can see it's blinking you see this it's blinking that's what we want right so we're hiding making it dimmer and then making it uh making a brighter dimmer and brighter a bit demonstrating so that's why it's kind of having this blinking effect okay all right okay so we have the fire laser right so what we want to do is from here with this fire laser right so what we want to do is go back over here so when i receive fire laser i want to create a clone of myself so basically going to create one of this sounding tower okay and then you have to say when i start as a clone what you want to do so this will actually call this so what we want to do is we're going to set up another well another variable i think called got hit so got hit you have to create that for the sonic power only okay just for the clone so that you can so we don't want to so we want to keep track of if the actually the sonic power should hit him let's say i can shoot the other way and it will not hit him so we want to check that make sure that actually hit him before we change the you know the effect for this uh uh for this uh uh among the spray so that's why we need to create another variable called gap hit so we don't know how to do this you can click on make variable and say got hit put got hit here and then you can select for this sprite only okay so that will create the variable basically this is a private variable for sonic power okay okay so what we want to do is we want to set got hit to note so first meaning like when you start the clone that means it did not hit the uh hit the uh the other sprite this right right so and then we want to make this go to so that means when they fire the gun this clone should go to the cyan and we want to point in the direction of the science of the just like the club right so the science pointing to the to the right right now the signs pointing to the right so this thing will actually go in here okay so the cyan is pointing to the left then the sky will point it the other way okay so that's what we want to do so what we want to do is point in direction here and then go to sensing and you have to pick out from here put it here so always select the back one first before you select the front so you select cyan first and then you select direction okay and then we will do a move 50 steps what happened is we want the the sonic power come out from like right here we don't want it to come out from his stomach right we're gonna push 50 steps so that it's somewhere like this okay that's why we have that 50 set and then we'll say show so that way now after we do all this coordinate thing then we'll show that way you can always see it kind of flying like this i mean let me change the costume for this guy so you can see a little bit better so maybe something like this okay so you can adjust it so if you think uh 50 is not enough you can put 100 or 75 whatever kind of justice so that it looks like this okay so i think i have 50 let's just try i think 50 is fine okay now next we will want to say repeat until okay so here we want to make sure that you know we want to destroy the clone if you're doing clone you have to make sure you delete the clone so we want to make sure that you know when you touch the edge or touch this guy the clone should disappear if not you keep on having too many calls on the game it's not good it can potentially mess up your game okay and it looks better when you when the bullet hit the hit this guy the laser hit this guy the laser disappear okay so what we want to do is we're gonna have to use the or join because we wanna check if it actually hit him or the edge right so we'll use the whole joint so all meaning either condition happen it will work so we'll say select the among the sprite which is the red one here and then duplicate this and then we'll say touching edge meaning you know it missed the uh mr spry and it hit it on the edge okay so after that you're gonna say set so we want to set this gap head to yes now since we it was every time the clone created is known but if it either touching the edge or touching this then we say got it yes i mean oh sorry i got it wrong so um we're gonna do that a little bit later only if you actually hit the among us sprite then we'll go through cut it yes my bad so what we want to do one make it move right so you have to say move 10 step as you can see it's just a 10 step you don't need like negative a positive since you're already pointing to the direction so if you're pointing to the this side if you say 10 step and just go on this side you point this side 10 step it will go on the right side okay all right okay we need another condition here so if oops i'm making a lot of mistake today for some reason okay so we want to duplicate this so if it actually touch the among us you know then we say god hit is yes okay that means it hit the among us sprite okay and then what we want to do is so i've either it touch the edge or this it will finish the the code here will go out of this loop then we will do another check here okay so we say if the got hit it'll use another operator here to check and select the variable got hit if it is go to yes meaning like it got hit right here you go yes then we're gonna broadcast a message what has a message okay this time we're gonna say god hit by laser okay so this is for the the among us uh sprite to change the effect okay and after that we want to set this back just resetting it just in case you know you might not need to but uh just for good of it we'll just reset it back to no and then we can delete this clone delete this clone so basically make this disappear okay all right so let's zoom back out so let's see so this is everything that we had to find the laser we'll call this code and run this okay so that's what we have so far let's go back to the red uh the red um uh sprite here so what we need to do is we are going to have to code this right so because we haven't called the red sprite to change things right when we got hit right so where to do that so we will try to put it over here let me move this on the top so these are all the control moves are like from one place or another we'll put on top and then we are going to do the you know the effect on the bottom you know so this is the first one is the club so second one you can say got hit by laser uh what we want to do is we want to insert a swirl we'll do the fisheye effect by 25 play the sound and broadcast mission complete so so you remember the mission completely coded earlier on the portal so basically it will open up the portal or allow you to go into the door so for this one if it's not backdrop one seven or eight it will show the door and it will show it will show the portal inside inside so the portal okay so it's not one of these those have the portal so after your broadcast mission uh uh complete okay and then after that you can go back over here so you can see right here so if you push the up key and you're touching the portal or high broadcast next stage it will open it will not allow the open door again which will actually change the uh the background of the sprite here on the portal uh so right here not in the portal i mean on the background so you have like next stage you'll go on to the next background so let's just try it out let's see how it works not sure it's gonna work let's see should let's try it out so we're gonna start so you can see we have the club and let's just use a laser right now number two so you see it didn't work right so something is wrong so let's see what's wrong so we made some mistakes so we did a copy from here right so that's why so when when you're doing coding you always want to check if it doesn't work see how you're going to figure out how you do it so as you can see when we shoot it's touching among us so this is correct and you can open up like the variable right so let's say if you try to debug your code or some problem you see got hit is no no so let's just try it again so let's say we say yes so this is no so let's say hit two so i think you cannot really see it because of the clone okay so we were not able to get it working so let's just check through our code make sure everything is correct so here we have got hit this no and we see that touching either this or this and then we get yes so if this is yes then we're gonna broadcast this message so i think we might have some error on the uh here and the among us so here actually we actually did it wrong here we actually don't need that that way until so uh actually when we actually we know that it got hit because this is the sprite here that checks it if it's already touching the uh among us sprite uh we know that it got hit so and then we broadcast this message so when we look at this message we know that this guy got hit already so we actually don't need to have this way until uh touching club or touching the sonic power so i think i made a mistake because i did a copy from here so it's always i mean all the time you know you you will make mistake from coding you know not always one time it will always work so when i do coding i have never done it like one time i will always work so try to like learn how to debug and find out what the problem is so you just kind of check you know what what what would it be wrong you know things look correct here then you see like okay it's broadcasting this so what is it doing i think before i had like touching club or whatever and then i it was incorrect or touching sonic power whatever that is still incorrect so we shouldn't actually need any of that so when we receive this you should just change the fisheye so now let's try it again okay so let's try again uh we have the gun so let's say i shoot on this side right so it should come out on this side you see that come out on this side looks okay not a problem so if i shoot on this side so you can see it got hit it becomes yellow you see it got yellow and then it changed so after that it broadcasts the complete ignition and you can open the door push the up key then you see the the other sprite here which is the uh the uh the pink one but you see we don't see cyan yet so that is incorrect so we need to reset cyan to a position maybe right here okay so what you want to do is kind of open up cyan see where your cyan is okay click on them you see let's say let's say we move them right here so what you want to do is let's go back to cyan so we have the code for the backdrop right so backdrop one so we can duplicate this so sometime when you duplicate code make sure you change it correctly so that happened to me right so so this is backdrop two so we want the sign let's say go to somewhere here then you can make sure you delete this go to get the new go to from here put it here okay and then you can say show or you can have switch to custom one too just in case you know you're switching from another one to here it doesn't hurt or you can i think uh even show is fine because we always reset it after the gun or the club white we always reset it but anyway let's just do that so that you know whenever the screen change from one screen to the next it has the custom show as one okay let's run it again okay we're gonna use the club this time make sure that's the box so that works fine so you open the door you can see that yellow is bright lighting up meaning it's working running the code so let's say use this so you can see fisheye and then the total open up you see that so now we're done with the second stage right so we push up again if we put up this will activate here we'll touch bottom or higher stage so let's go back over here we'll push up so you see this cool run now you see this photo is coming up right that's incorrect so this is stage three the portal should not come only come when after we broadcast the message saying the mission is complete so this is incorrect we need to fix that so what we want to do is go to the portal we add a small piece of code that will kind of take care of some of this problem uh what we can do also we can set the uh like the location of the portal where you want to go so um what we can do is since this is the second one let's say let's just put it here so we haven't done that so first stage we don't have a portal right second stage where portal let's say we want to put at this location then you can say okay go to this location right but don't show until the actually the stuff is done and also what we want to do is every time you receive something called next next stage we want to hide it so when you move from one stage to the next we want to hide it and only show when actually you know when you completed the mission so now let's test it again so here we use the club that works fine we're able to go into the door so so now switch to backdrop too it actually has the border over here you cannot see it because it's not shown so if i take out this stuff here this uh this among us right here you see the portal comes up once i go in this code should run you see it run really fast and hide it so you don't actually see it okay all right so we'll go on and do the next part of the next weapon okay so let's stop this let's go to the hand which is the infinite corner so what we want to do is we're gonna say green flag is clicked okay so what we want to say is high and then we will want to throw in a forever loop here and similar to the other one we want to make sure that it goes to the cyan okay go to cyan and we also want to point in the direction that the cyan is pointing right so similar to that one go to sensing grab this guy here and you select the back one first cyan and then we want to say direction okay so the glove will point to the left or the right depending where the cyan guy is standing okay so what we want to do is we want to have another if condition here is a little bit different so what we want the glove to be let's say let me open cyan here and open the glove here so we want to make the the hand kind of like like this in front of uh you know this guy a little bit in the front on the top you know top top right or top left depending what is that right so that you know it it looks a little bit better so what we want to do is we have if an else condition so we need to do the sensing again here and select cyan and we're going to check the direction okay direction so now where you can use the operator we're going to use the greater than so greater than zero so when it's greater than zero meaning it's actually pointing to the right so the direction is like less than zero you see this is let's say we go here this is pointing to the right right any any number is positive it's pointing to the right right you see any number that's negative it's actually pointing to the left you can see right so you can see the hand kind of switch let me put the hand over here maybe i don't know it may be easier to see so you see positive pointing to the right negative pointing to the left so we're trying to see where it's actually pointing and then we're going to make the hand going up accordingly okay okay and you want to set it at this uh this one here so that doesn't rotate all around okay so we're gonna put it back at 90. so if it's the direction is greater than zero meaning pointing to the right side okay okay what you want to do is say motion set x and we want to use the operator use a plus so what we want to do is we're going to find out where cyan is standing in the x position so select cyan x position put this in here and then you say plus i mean you have to test it for me i already tested so i know so i say plus 45 and do something similar here and this one is where to do a minus plus i always say use this the x position let's say if cyan is you know is uh standing on the right i mean facing to the right we want the glove to you know show up like right here so if he's actually facing if science facing to the left let's say facing to the left this side then we want the glove to be on this side okay got it so hopefully you understand that okay so that's why i have to check here so i know where it's gonna show okay now we are going to minimize this a little bit put this over here on the side so we have the code for number three so similar to what we did for number two and one right um why am i not able to find my code okay here's the callback so when i say three so this is the number third plot power the infinite garnet so we're gonna try to call that and also same thing right we have to make sure that is not in progress you know the uh no one is talking so make sure that we want to do that so that you know we don't want the sprite to kill off the other guy before you have a chance to talk okay so this one you say equal and over here so dialogue with dialogue variable okay and you put down yes so not yes then we want to make sure that we can go to the front layer so that it will show up in front of everything else okay and then we want to show because we have high in the beginning right so we're gonna show and then broadcast our message so what we're going to broadcast is snap like a finger snap so that that nose will do a finger snap right to make everything disappear so that works well because uh scratch will have something like ghost effect we can make things disappear okay we can put this one and then we are going to hide it okay so now we have done the gauntlet code but we still go back to the anonymous right to fix it okay so now we have got hit by laser right the club now we're gonna do the among us uh just pull this event here and change it to snap okay and what we want to do is we're going to repeat 10 times and then i'm going to try to use this ghost effect west coast effect okay so change ghost effect by 10 and then we want to do a little weight so 0.1 second so a little bit of weight to 10 times and then we're gonna play the sound until done and we want to broadcast the message same thing okay so now let's let's try it out so see how it works so now number three for thanos who actually doesn't care actually way snappy looking on the left side snapping it the right side doesn't matter so let's say i'm facing to the left side if i use number three the gun will be somewhere here so as you can see you can't make the other guy disappear right and then what has the complete message you can go in same thing i mean if you think you've gone that's a little bit too close you can adjust it let's see do it again so it's right here and if you want to move them a little bit further then what you do is you go to the garment and change this position like 4550 so now we're done with gauntlet now stage three same thing right we don't have anything yet but we do have uh created the power for the laser and the infinity gauntlet right so in stage three we can go back over here so what we need to do we have like stage one stage two right so we need to do something for stage three to show it right okay so you can just copy this duplicate let me move this down a little bit i'll adjust it later so i get more space so now we have one two and then we'll do number three so number three you can kind of put whatever you want i have some coordinate already down but what you can do is just kind of open the this guy and just try and drag him around where you want to put them right and then you can just grab the motion and just put it okay so let's say we want to put him right here or whatever doesn't matter right then you know you can you know uh just drag this position like this or whatever right so i think we all had a hundred so we can't keep it a hundred so let's say we want negative 105 get a good number and then negative 100 right and then what we want to do is uh we're gonna face it to the let's say he's gonna face the other way he didn't know that something's happening to him okay let's say he's gonna face the other way so if i hit this back drop three you can see he's actually facing this way right and then make sure you clear the graphic effects of that you know whatever ability you did to him it will clears it up and also cyan number three you also need to do that as well i think we'll probably move this guy let's see how i want to do this i'm going to move this over here so i'm going to put this here because this will not change right so we have this this will not change mostly so we're gonna stack this up here so we have one over here and two over here so this is where two and three can open let's say you wanna cyan face this way or this way it doesn't matter right so either way is fine so what you want to do is a backdrop three you're going to say duplicate right so say back drop number three go to the front layer you know let's say you want to implement this position you can right so or you can put it in some other position down there so let's say you want to put them at this position and then switch to custom one and show all you let's say you want to turn around doesn't matter then you have to say the the direction so if you want him to turn around this is one into the right if you want to turn around then you need to do negative so you double click on this you can see that is turning around okay so either way so let's say i didn't have this whatever he is coming in doesn't matter so let's try it again okay so we have this guy here so we're gonna use the club we are able to go in then we see this one let's say we use number three this guy disappeared the portal open up we go in number three stage number three let's say we use the let's say we use the gun we shoot this side see it doesn't help rather than do it so that's why we have that check uh that got hit right so we have to have that check so it touched the edge doesn't matter i only even touch this sprite so you might go back so when i say touch the sprite then effect then this the photo will show up again we'll go in so as you can see we go in this is stage four where we've got a little computer in the box here so we don't have anything yet for stage four and also we hided the power ability breaker so the empire so when we say we'll get the backdrop number four and hide it so you get more room to see things right i think for the first three stage we want to show you know what the ability the among us character can do after that we don't have it so this is where we're going to start for now i think that's a pretty long video already so we got the gauntlets and then the hand and other stuff done and then moving to stage four so we'll walk on this next time for the stage stage four and other power ups so whatever powerups we have here so we're done with these three first three we're gonna work on these one next okay all right all right thank you guys uh please like share and subscribe to our channel and comment in the comments below what uh about uh if you have any questions about the video or just love letting us know that you know we'll do a good job or something that would be greatly appreciated all right see you guys next time bye
