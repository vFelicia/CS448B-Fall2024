00:01 - [Music]
00:10 - hello kids welcome back to the channel
00:13 - today we will continue with our party
00:16 - animal team that we have left off with
00:18 - the scratch introduction so what we're
00:21 - going to do we're gonna make a few
00:23 - change to the game today well we're
00:25 - gonna make the at the dog the bat in the
00:28 - background for this game so that you
00:31 - know make it a little bit more animals
00:32 - right because this is an animal party
00:34 - kick game so also we're gonna change a
00:37 - little bit with the music don't like
00:39 - this music playing in the back it's
00:42 - really loud with this drum and cymbal so
00:46 - we're gonna try something different
00:48 - we're gonna change the music out so what
00:50 - I'm going to do is I don't remove all
00:52 - this as you can see there's a little
00:54 - weight here in between so we're gonna
00:56 - have to put them way back into the the
00:59 - step so that it will look a little bit
01:01 - better
01:01 - okay so we'll move the weight here back
01:06 - 0.25 which we did right and then we can
01:09 - kind of move these back in now maybe we
01:13 - can duplicate this here and then we'll
01:20 - change this forward and step the whole
01:26 - wood - ten step we'll duplicate this
01:28 - again whatever - ten step so let's let's
01:34 - remove that this so let's stop this so
01:39 - we have a moving forward ten step we 0.5
01:43 - to 5 seconds moving forward 10 step way
01:45 - again go back
01:48 - so basically going back and forth okay
01:50 - so we start again you can see from the
01:52 - cat going back and forth on the stage a
01:55 - little bit okay so we're gonna add our
01:57 - music back so this what we can do in
01:59 - pecan Sam here we can say select choose
02:03 - a new sound and maybe you can type
02:07 - dance or something okay so here we are
02:10 - about different pencil over so you hover
02:14 - over they can't place the sound book so
02:17 - you can choose any pencil that you like
02:20 - you can choose this one for now so this
02:24 - is more energetic so let's check after
02:27 - we choose that we're gonna go back here
02:28 - we're gonna create another when green
02:32 - flag is clicked because actually it is
02:34 - song playing come on mom so you don't
02:37 - want to add it into any of this block if
02:39 - you do it kind of messed up again so I
02:42 - can show you that in a bit so let's go
02:44 - to control again or add a forever loop
02:47 - so and then you go to sound and as you
02:51 - can see right it says something like
02:53 - play the sound then energetic until done
02:56 - so that mean like the sound will play
02:59 - for how many ever second or minute this
03:02 - this song has so you actually put this
03:04 - in here it will actually blocks the cat
03:07 - for moving until the sound is done so
03:10 - let me just kind of show you that let's
03:13 - just play this for once so as you can
03:15 - see the cats kind of anything with the
03:17 - music in the back so let's say if we did
03:20 - not have it as separate forever loop and
03:22 - we put it by say in here or something
03:25 - like that so you won't be a problem as
03:28 - you can see so it's kind of getting
03:31 - stuff
03:33 - that's why you don't want to do that so
03:36 - you do not want to put that into the
03:38 - same forum because this song may be
03:41 - longer here to keep it on the side so
03:44 - now that we have fixed it the cat
03:47 - movement and then added a different song
03:50 - so now we're done with a cat so now next
03:53 - what we can do is we're gonna add the
03:55 - other sprite so what you can do is go
03:57 - back here let's do a search so now we're
04:00 - gonna add the doc type top so we have
04:03 - this top we're gonna add him to the just
04:07 - to the screen so let's say we move him
04:09 - over here so so that what we can do is
04:13 - we're gonna make him kind of run back
04:15 - and forth in here right so we must start
04:18 - with this go back to the event when
04:21 - green flag is clicked meaning that we'll
04:23 - never play a click on this green flag
04:25 - this toe will execute so we're gonna
04:27 - have another forever loop so put in here
04:32 - so let's say we're gonna move the dog 10
04:36 - step and then what we want to do is when
04:39 - it get to the edge we want to bounce so
04:42 - uh if on edge bounce many of the dot run
04:45 - all the way over here it will bounce
04:46 - back so while we try this and see what
04:49 - happened also before we do it let's
04:52 - change the costume as well so we're
04:54 - gonna create another one here I should
04:59 - make this bigger actually sorry about
05:02 - that
05:02 - let me make this bigger I always forgot
05:05 - about that so it's easier for everyone
05:07 - to see so here we're gonna make it
05:10 - another forever loop here so this time
05:16 - we're gonna change the custom just like
05:17 - how we did with a cat or a check in a
05:19 - costume
05:20 - so those look like a dog is running so
05:23 - we can put out a little bit wait here go
05:25 - back to here control you can say wait
05:30 - 0.2 second okay so now if we run it you
05:35 - can turn a quick look at the dog see
05:37 - what happened
05:38 - you can see this new stuff right
05:43 - incorrectly is
05:45 - so you see how the top is flipped over
05:47 - so that's not what we won right so I'm
05:50 - sure that dark is actually kind of run
05:53 - correctly right so what we can do we can
05:56 - fix that so we can do move the dog back
05:59 - to this position so maybe before we
06:01 - start we're gonna move into this
06:03 - position as you can when you track this
06:06 - you can see this change so what you can
06:08 - do is you can first track the dog and
06:11 - then you can move this over here so now
06:13 - we're gonna make the dog start at this
06:14 - position one more thing is the doc is
06:17 - are rotating right so we don't want him
06:19 - to do that click on this here click on
06:22 - this you see this there's a one button
06:24 - in the middle select this so this one
06:28 - will not make the dog rotate so the top
06:30 - only bounce back and forth so now we're
06:32 - done so let's save it run it again
06:39 - [Music]
06:41 - so which is what we want okay so we got
06:44 - the doc going so now let's try to add
06:47 - the pad when we can fly' the bad around
06:50 - the stage as well so let's try that will
06:55 - type in back okay we have this back tear
07:00 - and if you want a different custom with
07:02 - the bat maybe you can choose another one
07:04 - Oh again we don't have another one I
07:06 - think the old scratch has a different
07:08 - bat looking bad but I think this one
07:10 - does not let me just try again okay so
07:15 - we only have this bat
07:16 - perfect oops
07:35 - okay so I only have this bat so we'll go
07:39 - back
07:44 - okay so in here we have the bats the
07:49 - bats what we want to do is we can become
07:52 - a little smaller to want can't put 50%
07:54 - so the bad is are the smaller so what
07:57 - we're gonna do is we're gonna make the
07:58 - black pad chemical eye around so again
08:01 - what that's starting from this position
08:03 - so in here I go back to event on clicked
08:11 - we can say okay more the back to this
08:13 - position okay and then say we're ready
08:19 - set the size if not you can also do this
08:21 - right here you can say set
08:24 - set size here if let's say you did not
08:27 - change it here you and change it over
08:29 - here as well so let's say you say change
08:31 - it to 157 let's say we put this 100%
08:35 - back so you see how the bat is small but
08:40 - when we click on this it will actually
08:42 - make the bat smaller so the bat actually
08:46 - is smaller so because of this code you
08:48 - can do it with a CO or you can do it
08:49 - over here so same thing so what we're
08:52 - gonna do is we're gonna have a forever
08:53 - loop okay so what we're going to do is
08:59 - we're gonna point the bat at 90 degree
09:02 - so that you know the bat will be flying
09:05 - this way because if the bat is uh you
09:10 - see how he ate this way he's come like
09:12 - this way I think some of the yeah the
09:15 - bats like this is not a good example
09:16 - actually well let's say let's let's
09:21 - change the the sprite because I'm gonna
09:23 - show you this now let's change this
09:25 - brightness use the bat let's use the
09:27 - butterfly
09:32 - okay let's use this putter fight and
09:35 - this is better so what we're going to do
09:38 - is we're gonna copy the code actually
09:40 - over so we can do is drag this tone you
09:44 - see how it's kind of moving moving just
09:47 - let go so now the code get copied over
09:50 - here so you know what they're typing and
09:51 - so he can now can trash ahead so now
09:54 - we're the butterfly so what we're going
09:56 - to do is we're gonna make the path I go
09:58 - up and then back so what we're going to
10:02 - do is we're gonna put him into it
10:04 - direction so we got a point to 90 so as
10:07 - you can see you see here 90 and then you
10:10 - can go negative 90
10:12 - you see his hats in the front so what we
10:14 - gonna do is we're going when he's flying
10:16 - this way his hat is gonna point this way
10:18 - when it's flying back this way we at
10:20 - some point this way so we're gonna set
10:21 - that right now 90 so which is pointing
10:25 - to the right so gum stay glide let's say
10:30 - we want the butterfly to start here
10:32 - right
10:33 - this is 161 let's say negative 161 as
10:37 - you can see the negative 161 right so we
10:39 - can find make him go up so you see this
10:43 - one changes up now to say cry one second
10:46 - to here and then maybe we're gonna say
10:48 - over here that was a cry one second to
10:53 - this location and then finally we're
10:56 - gonna over here and it was a cry one
11:01 - second to here so now the butterfly will
11:03 - be moving like this right so what we're
11:06 - gonna do is we're gonna make him go back
11:07 - so what we can do is come on turn him
11:10 - around
11:11 - say opponent Direction negative 90 so as
11:16 - you can see it's pointing to the left
11:17 - now so we're gonna fly him back all the
11:21 - way over here where he stopped from so
11:24 - unless a glide to this one you can
11:27 - change it to two seconds if you want so
11:30 - now I run it you can actually see the
11:32 - bad it's kind of cold out there so up or
11:35 - cross up down and he'll turn around and
11:38 - come back here okay so let's say this
11:41 - and let's run
11:49 - [Music]
11:52 - do you remember what we did with a doc
12:05 - [Music]
12:07 - [Applause]
12:09 - actually turn around because we put
12:12 - negative 90 point interaction which is
12:14 - left side so what we have accomplished
12:18 - this is a really simple game where you
12:20 - have a couple of sprite on the screen we
12:21 - added some music and we kind of learn
12:24 - about the direction right how the point
12:26 - left and right and depending on where
12:30 - you're facing from right so that's about
12:33 - it for this game so thanks for watching
12:37 - please don't forget to subscribe like
12:40 - and share so that everyone can also
12:44 - learn thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello kids welcome back to the channel today we will continue with our party animal team that we have left off with the scratch introduction so what we're going to do we're gonna make a few change to the game today well we're gonna make the at the dog the bat in the background for this game so that you know make it a little bit more animals right because this is an animal party kick game so also we're gonna change a little bit with the music don't like this music playing in the back it's really loud with this drum and cymbal so we're gonna try something different we're gonna change the music out so what I'm going to do is I don't remove all this as you can see there's a little weight here in between so we're gonna have to put them way back into the the step so that it will look a little bit better okay so we'll move the weight here back 0.25 which we did right and then we can kind of move these back in now maybe we can duplicate this here and then we'll change this forward and step the whole wood ten step we'll duplicate this again whatever ten step so let's let's remove that this so let's stop this so we have a moving forward ten step we 0.5 to 5 seconds moving forward 10 step way again go back so basically going back and forth okay so we start again you can see from the cat going back and forth on the stage a little bit okay so we're gonna add our music back so this what we can do in pecan Sam here we can say select choose a new sound and maybe you can type dance or something okay so here we are about different pencil over so you hover over they can't place the sound book so you can choose any pencil that you like you can choose this one for now so this is more energetic so let's check after we choose that we're gonna go back here we're gonna create another when green flag is clicked because actually it is song playing come on mom so you don't want to add it into any of this block if you do it kind of messed up again so I can show you that in a bit so let's go to control again or add a forever loop so and then you go to sound and as you can see right it says something like play the sound then energetic until done so that mean like the sound will play for how many ever second or minute this this song has so you actually put this in here it will actually blocks the cat for moving until the sound is done so let me just kind of show you that let's just play this for once so as you can see the cats kind of anything with the music in the back so let's say if we did not have it as separate forever loop and we put it by say in here or something like that so you won't be a problem as you can see so it's kind of getting stuff that's why you don't want to do that so you do not want to put that into the same forum because this song may be longer here to keep it on the side so now that we have fixed it the cat movement and then added a different song so now we're done with a cat so now next what we can do is we're gonna add the other sprite so what you can do is go back here let's do a search so now we're gonna add the doc type top so we have this top we're gonna add him to the just to the screen so let's say we move him over here so so that what we can do is we're gonna make him kind of run back and forth in here right so we must start with this go back to the event when green flag is clicked meaning that we'll never play a click on this green flag this toe will execute so we're gonna have another forever loop so put in here so let's say we're gonna move the dog 10 step and then what we want to do is when it get to the edge we want to bounce so uh if on edge bounce many of the dot run all the way over here it will bounce back so while we try this and see what happened also before we do it let's change the costume as well so we're gonna create another one here I should make this bigger actually sorry about that let me make this bigger I always forgot about that so it's easier for everyone to see so here we're gonna make it another forever loop here so this time we're gonna change the custom just like how we did with a cat or a check in a costume so those look like a dog is running so we can put out a little bit wait here go back to here control you can say wait 0.2 second okay so now if we run it you can turn a quick look at the dog see what happened you can see this new stuff right incorrectly is so you see how the top is flipped over so that's not what we won right so I'm sure that dark is actually kind of run correctly right so what we can do we can fix that so we can do move the dog back to this position so maybe before we start we're gonna move into this position as you can when you track this you can see this change so what you can do is you can first track the dog and then you can move this over here so now we're gonna make the dog start at this position one more thing is the doc is are rotating right so we don't want him to do that click on this here click on this you see this there's a one button in the middle select this so this one will not make the dog rotate so the top only bounce back and forth so now we're done so let's save it run it again so which is what we want okay so we got the doc going so now let's try to add the pad when we can fly' the bad around the stage as well so let's try that will type in back okay we have this back tear and if you want a different custom with the bat maybe you can choose another one Oh again we don't have another one I think the old scratch has a different bat looking bad but I think this one does not let me just try again okay so we only have this bat perfect oops okay so I only have this bat so we'll go back okay so in here we have the bats the bats what we want to do is we can become a little smaller to want can't put 50% so the bad is are the smaller so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make the black pad chemical eye around so again what that's starting from this position so in here I go back to event on clicked we can say okay more the back to this position okay and then say we're ready set the size if not you can also do this right here you can say set set size here if let's say you did not change it here you and change it over here as well so let's say you say change it to 157 let's say we put this 100% back so you see how the bat is small but when we click on this it will actually make the bat smaller so the bat actually is smaller so because of this code you can do it with a CO or you can do it over here so same thing so what we're gonna do is we're gonna have a forever loop okay so what we're going to do is we're gonna point the bat at 90 degree so that you know the bat will be flying this way because if the bat is uh you see how he ate this way he's come like this way I think some of the yeah the bats like this is not a good example actually well let's say let's let's change the the sprite because I'm gonna show you this now let's change this brightness use the bat let's use the butterfly okay let's use this putter fight and this is better so what we're going to do is we're gonna copy the code actually over so we can do is drag this tone you see how it's kind of moving moving just let go so now the code get copied over here so you know what they're typing and so he can now can trash ahead so now we're the butterfly so what we're going to do is we're gonna make the path I go up and then back so what we're going to do is we're gonna put him into it direction so we got a point to 90 so as you can see you see here 90 and then you can go negative 90 you see his hats in the front so what we gonna do is we're going when he's flying this way his hat is gonna point this way when it's flying back this way we at some point this way so we're gonna set that right now 90 so which is pointing to the right so gum stay glide let's say we want the butterfly to start here right this is 161 let's say negative 161 as you can see the negative 161 right so we can find make him go up so you see this one changes up now to say cry one second to here and then maybe we're gonna say over here that was a cry one second to this location and then finally we're gonna over here and it was a cry one second to here so now the butterfly will be moving like this right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make him go back so what we can do is come on turn him around say opponent Direction negative 90 so as you can see it's pointing to the left now so we're gonna fly him back all the way over here where he stopped from so unless a glide to this one you can change it to two seconds if you want so now I run it you can actually see the bad it's kind of cold out there so up or cross up down and he'll turn around and come back here okay so let's say this and let's run do you remember what we did with a doc actually turn around because we put negative 90 point interaction which is left side so what we have accomplished this is a really simple game where you have a couple of sprite on the screen we added some music and we kind of learn about the direction right how the point left and right and depending on where you're facing from right so that's about it for this game so thanks for watching please don't forget to subscribe like and share so that everyone can also learn thank you
