00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back to the channel tickets
00:08 - quickly route today we'll be doing a
00:10 - hangman game in scratch
00:12 - um so hangman is like a game where you
00:14 - try to guess um words and try to guess
00:16 - the word and you try not to let it drop
00:19 - draw the man if it draws up the man that
00:21 - means you lose so we'll be doing that in
00:23 - scratch so without further ado let's
00:25 - demonstrate the game so
00:27 - green flag let's click new okay so in
00:29 - the beginning you get eight attempts
00:31 - okay let's guess usually in hangman you
00:32 - want to guess the vowels first let's get
00:34 - some a
00:35 - okay it looks like there are two a's in
00:37 - this thing
00:39 - so
00:40 - let's see what else maybe
00:43 - a c
00:45 - nope no c so as you can see if you get
00:47 - something wrong it will draw the circle
00:49 - in black so the gray is just the outline
00:52 - so
00:52 - it will just draw each of the things on
00:55 - top of the gray and you'll lose one
00:56 - attempt if you get the right answer then
00:58 - you don't lose an attempt so let's go
01:01 - g
01:02 - nope
01:03 - i mean i okay there is an i
01:06 - so what could this board possibly be
01:07 - let's see oh
01:09 - a something i okay
01:11 - let's go for a b i'm just guessing
01:13 - nope five more times
01:15 - l
01:16 - okay there's an l
01:19 - oh
01:20 - a
01:25 - let's see t
01:27 - nope
01:29 - n
01:31 - and animal yes animal okay there you go
01:33 - see as you can see i got i got the word
01:35 - right so it says good job you won
01:37 - so if you get it before the attempts
01:39 - gets to zero then you win so that's
01:40 - pretty much it for the game and if you
01:42 - want to start a new game just click new
01:44 - and the word will be completely
01:45 - randomized to a new word
01:48 - i'm going to show you guys how it looks
01:50 - like if you lose so i'm just going to
01:51 - spam one letter i guess okay so what if
01:55 - you just don't guess anything right it
01:57 - will draw the entire man so you can see
02:00 - and then you have zero attempts and at
02:01 - the end i'll show you the word
02:03 - um that you had and you'll say sorry you
02:06 - lost okay so that's what we have let's
02:09 - start a new project
02:11 - before we begin on this tutorial here's
02:13 - your friendly reminder to subscribe to
02:15 - kids coding play run because only 6.6 of
02:18 - our viewers in the last 28 days are
02:20 - subscribed to our channel and 93.4 are
02:23 - not subscribed so please help us
02:27 - increase our subscribed
02:28 - viewers
02:29 - to at least 10 that's our goal
02:34 - before we start coding in our game um i
02:36 - would like to
02:37 - ask you guys a question so we have a we
02:40 - were thinking about doing a uh christmas
02:42 - themed coding like project competition
02:46 - on our kids coding playground official
02:49 - studio in scratch so let us know what
02:52 - you think about it in the comment
02:53 - section below or you can join our
02:54 - discord and vote there if you would like
02:58 - if enough people say yes then we might
03:00 - do it and we might have a prize for the
03:01 - winner so
03:02 - yeah that's pretty much it what i have
03:04 - to say
03:05 - okay now let's start coding let's rename
03:07 - the project to hang man
03:10 - or let's make it capital h
03:12 - hang man and let's delete the scratch
03:13 - cat we'll never need it then this one i
03:16 - guess
03:17 - we never really need it
03:18 - and then we have uh all these sprites we
03:20 - need to get so we have the process logic
03:22 - this is basically the you win and lose
03:24 - and all the logic
03:26 - behind the hangman game
03:28 - and then we have the new sprites this is
03:29 - starting a new game you click that
03:32 - and then we have the
03:33 - hangman itself
03:35 - right there
03:37 - and then right here we have the backdrop
03:39 - and then we just drag this one in so
03:42 - you can just download this or you can
03:43 - draw it yourself so what we did in the
03:46 - background was we'd have let's duplicate
03:48 - it i'll show you what we have
03:49 - so
03:50 - right here we have
03:52 - two
03:53 - h's so as you can see we have two
03:54 - hanging ins the gray one just looks like
03:56 - a little shadow behind the black one
03:58 - and then right here we have the
03:59 - remaining attempts we have a box and
04:01 - then we'll put the variable inside here
04:03 - and then right here for the sections for
04:05 - each letter there is
04:07 - we just drew a rectangle
04:09 - and then we used the reshape tool
04:11 - and rounded out the edges so i'm going
04:14 - to show you what we did so just draw
04:16 - like that
04:18 - reshape
04:19 - unlikely one like that
04:21 - that
04:22 - maybe like that
04:24 - that
04:26 - just like pull out the edges
04:28 - a little
04:31 - to make it a little bit round
04:36 - yeah so there you go it's not the best
04:38 - but
04:39 - some like something like that we just
04:40 - did something like that and then we just
04:42 - duplicate ctrl c ctrl v six times uh
04:44 - five times
04:46 - for each one and then we get all of that
04:49 - so yeah that's pretty much how you do
04:50 - the backdrop so we're gonna delete that
04:52 - and you see this is the hangman thing is
04:55 - a little bit overlapping this so we're
04:56 - just going to like move this up a little
04:58 - bit you can just like
05:01 - here you know it's a little bit too high
05:03 - like about right here should be fine
05:05 - right
05:07 - okay
05:08 - now let's go on to our other sprite
05:11 - our hangman so what we have
05:13 - what we did was just draw a straight
05:15 - line of 10 using this color
05:18 - straight so you hold down shift to make
05:20 - a straight line
05:21 - and then we made another line right here
05:23 - and then another line down same
05:24 - thickness hold down shift to make a
05:26 - straight one and then right here we just
05:28 - have a box
05:29 - with the same outline drew box like that
05:31 - like a rectangle and then right here we
05:33 - have the costumes for each one so
05:36 - costume one
05:37 - and then we have the
05:38 - each hangman
05:40 - costume with a gray outline and we'll
05:41 - just color over it with the black and
05:43 - then right here
05:44 - we don't you don't want to make so as
05:46 - you can see when you like do this
05:48 - um it's like you draw something like
05:50 - this
05:52 - um you don't want to connect it like
05:53 - that because it will change the color
05:55 - for the entire thing
05:56 - instead oops
05:58 - like that instead you want to do this
06:02 - like that and then just get the select
06:04 - tool and drag it on like that
06:07 - or drag it on like that
06:09 - something like that so then it doesn't
06:11 - change the color for the entire thing
06:14 - uh yeah so basically you should draw the
06:15 - gray before you do the black because you
06:17 - want the black on top
06:18 - so remember to draw the gray first okay
06:21 - so it's basically the same thing for all
06:23 - these you just go over in black
06:25 - yeah so that's pretty much it
06:27 - for the hangman
06:29 - and then right here
06:31 - process logic we have the button we got
06:34 - the blue and orange button we dragged it
06:36 - out a little bit and then we just wrote
06:38 - good job you won for the blue one and
06:40 - then sorry you lost for the other one
06:42 - and then the new sprite is just
06:43 - just box reshape and then new in the
06:46 - middle okay and we also did some
06:48 - readjusting of the um
06:50 - all these sprites off camera so it looks
06:52 - a little bit better because as you could
06:54 - see this thing was overlapping on that
06:56 - and maybe if you move this all up this
06:58 - will show up in the bottom so it will
07:00 - look better so now this is our full
07:03 - thing we just moved it up a little bit
07:04 - so it's not centered now
07:06 - okay
07:07 - let's start coding in the new sprite so
07:09 - inside the new sprite we're going to
07:10 - start when this sprite is clicked
07:15 - let's zoom in a little so when this
07:16 - right is clicked we're gonna change the
07:18 - x by two so we're just to make it look
07:21 - like when you click it there's a little
07:22 - bit animation
07:23 - so i change the x by two
07:27 - change the y by negative two
07:31 - then we're gonna wait until not mouse
07:33 - down so you can
07:34 - spam it
07:36 - so we're gonna wait until not mouse down
07:42 - not mouse down no not messed up and then
07:45 - after that
07:46 - we're going to change the x back
07:48 - by negative 2 and change the y by 2 so
07:50 - it goes back to its original position
07:53 - let's duplicate that
07:55 - and then we're just going to change the
07:56 - x by negative two
07:58 - and then the y by two and then broadcast
08:01 - a message and name it new game so it'll
08:03 - start a new game
08:06 - new game
08:09 - and then right here let's save it um
08:11 - i'll show you when you click on it as
08:12 - you can see it moves down a little bit
08:14 - like that looks like it's being clicked
08:15 - on so that's what we want and then we go
08:18 - to the process
08:19 - um
08:20 - uh logic sprite okay
08:23 - so when we receive the new game inside
08:25 - here
08:27 - and receive new game we are going to
08:29 - make some new blocks so we're going to
08:31 - make
08:32 - a new block we're going to make uh four
08:34 - new blocks actually
08:36 - we'll define them all we're going to
08:38 - name the first one initialize
08:41 - initialize like that and then click ok
08:45 - we will make another one
08:47 - process answer
08:51 - and
08:52 - aw
08:53 - and sir
08:57 - and then process answer and then we're
08:59 - going to do
09:01 - process
09:03 - uh correct guess so this is if you get
09:05 - the correct uh guess and then we have
09:08 - another one process wrong wrong guess
09:11 - process
09:13 - process
09:14 - wrong
09:15 - guess
09:18 - and then
09:19 - we have the four custom blocks
09:21 - and then first let's define initialize
09:23 - okay
09:25 - so inside initialize we're going to hide
09:27 - in the beginning
09:28 - we're going to hide this right in the
09:30 - beginning
09:31 - and then we're going to make
09:33 - some new variables
09:37 - we're going to make a variable called
09:38 - display word so this is the word that's
09:40 - going to be displayed
09:41 - and we're going to name it six question
09:43 - marks and must be six because we're
09:44 - doing six letter words
09:46 - and after that we're gonna set each
09:48 - each uh let each little slot right here
09:51 - the variable to assign to a different
09:53 - letter so
09:54 - we're gonna display word to exactly six
09:57 - question marks
09:59 - like that six question marks and then
10:01 - we're gonna set the remaining attempts
10:02 - which is another variable we're gonna
10:04 - name it renaming attempts
10:09 - okay
10:11 - oh forgot that oops
10:13 - tenths i think that's right
10:15 - um and then we're gonna set the
10:17 - remaining attempts
10:20 - we're gonna set it to eight so we have
10:22 - eight remaining attempts
10:23 - and then we're gonna set the secret word
10:25 - which is another variable i'm forgetting
10:28 - uh secret word and it's gonna be for
10:30 - this word for the sprite only so secret
10:32 - word anything we have the first letter
10:35 - and lowercase will be for the sprite
10:36 - only okay
10:38 - we're going to set the secret word
10:42 - secret word and then we're going to
10:43 - make a list so we're gonna make a list
10:45 - we're gonna name it word list for this
10:47 - sprite only as you can see you can
10:49 - notice that the first letter is
10:51 - lowercase
10:52 - and then uh we're going to
10:54 - put words into the word list so
10:56 - you know we could just do one green file
10:58 - clicked and put all the different words
11:00 - like that but we're not going to do that
11:02 - because people can just look inside and
11:04 - see inside the code and see all the
11:06 - words and it won't be fun so what we're
11:08 - going to do is just going to put the
11:09 - words so
11:10 - i'm just going to go
11:13 - open up the list
11:15 - and we're going to
11:17 - fill out some of the words so
11:22 - okay so we just got five words so you
11:23 - know how you just click the plus and you
11:25 - type whatever you want right there we
11:27 - just got five sample words you can add
11:28 - as much as you would want so what we
11:30 - just have five right now
11:32 - and then
11:33 - right here we just want to set the
11:35 - secret word
11:37 - and then we're gonna do item
11:40 - okay so we're gonna get the item
11:43 - of the word list right here
11:45 - we're gonna have to pick random one to
11:46 - five because we have five words
11:49 - so it's gonna be
11:50 - item pick random one to five of word
11:52 - list
11:53 - and then we're gonna broadcast another
11:55 - message we're gonna name it update so
11:57 - it's gonna keep on updating
11:59 - um
12:00 - what to do next we'll need this after
12:04 - oh update and wait sorry i forgot about
12:06 - that
12:08 - has me to wait
12:11 - and then uh after that we have to
12:13 - broadcast another message and wait and
12:15 - we're gonna name it reset
12:19 - okay
12:20 - and then
12:21 - inside the new game
12:23 - we are going to
12:25 - initialize
12:28 - and we will need to add more code to it
12:32 - um but first we have to
12:34 - define all of these guys so let me move
12:36 - all these guys down leave this up
12:40 - okay now let's define um
12:44 - process answer
12:46 - we will finish um up this new game thing
12:49 - after we finish this
12:51 - these three first i'm going to start on
12:52 - this one
12:54 - okay so let's make some new variables
12:57 - we're going to name a new variable this
12:59 - is for the sprite only as well
13:01 - we're going to name it got letter
13:05 - got letter and then we're just going to
13:07 - do another one this is also for the
13:08 - sprite only question mark count
13:14 - make that capital
13:18 - so first one is lowercase for the sprite
13:20 - only
13:21 - question mark count
13:23 - and then we're gonna make another one
13:24 - called temp this is a temporary variable
13:26 - it's gonna be an attempt for the sprite
13:27 - only because it's lowercase and then
13:29 - another one uh index
13:33 - and then we're just going to put it
13:34 - lowercase for the sprite only and click
13:36 - ok
13:37 - ok so now we have all our variables
13:39 - let's get defining on this one so we're
13:42 - going to first we're going to set the
13:43 - got letter
13:45 - to zero
13:46 - and then we're going to set the question
13:47 - mark down
13:49 - to zero so and then we're gonna set the
13:51 - temporary to nothing for now
13:54 - temp to nothing
13:56 - we're gonna set it to blank
13:59 - and then we're gonna set the
14:01 - index to one so it's on the first
14:04 - first one on the index
14:06 - okay so now let's get a repeat so we're
14:09 - gonna repeat
14:10 - um and then we're gonna do the length of
14:12 - the secret word which is six letters so
14:14 - we can just go repeat one
14:17 - of the secret word
14:20 - length of the secret word like that so
14:22 - it's going to repeat six times
14:24 - and then we're going to set
14:26 - a new variable i'm gonna name it
14:28 - character
14:30 - for the sprite only as well
14:33 - so character we're going to set
14:35 - character
14:36 - right here
14:37 - to the letter position
14:39 - i mean index of the secret word so we're
14:42 - going to set
14:43 - the character we're going to get the
14:44 - letter
14:47 - and then we're going to get the index
14:50 - and then secret word so
14:52 - what this says okay let's let's put the
14:55 - secret word first okay
14:57 - all right so we're going to set the
14:58 - character to the letter of the index so
15:00 - the index is one right now so it will go
15:02 - to the first letter
15:04 - of the secret word so
15:06 - assuming we had bridge as our word right
15:09 - it will get the first letters because
15:11 - the index is equal to one right now and
15:12 - you'll get b
15:14 - okay
15:15 - and then we're going to get an if else
15:17 - if else statement
15:19 - inside here
15:21 - so if the character is equal to the
15:24 - answer of the person like whatever the
15:25 - person puts in
15:27 - so if the character
15:30 - is equal to answer
15:32 - of whatever the player puts in
15:34 - then we're going to set the
15:36 - a new the variable.letter i thought it
15:39 - was gonna be a new one
15:40 - so i said they got letter to one so that
15:43 - means they have got the letter so
15:45 - assuming the uh word was bridge they
15:47 - type in b it's equal to the character so
15:49 - you'll get the letter
15:51 - else if you do not get the letter we're
15:53 - going to set the variable character
15:56 - to the letter
15:59 - letter
16:00 - index
16:02 - of the display word
16:06 - so the display word is a question mark
16:09 - because
16:10 - up here remember we set the display word
16:12 - to six question marks well it's gonna be
16:14 - down here so it's gonna
16:15 - set the index a letter index or one of
16:19 - so the first slot is gonna be a question
16:21 - mark if you don't get it
16:23 - okay
16:24 - and then we're going to get a
16:26 - set the
16:28 - right here we're going to set the
16:30 - temporary variable
16:32 - and then we're going to join the
16:33 - temporary plus the character so the
16:35 - character could either be this one
16:37 - or this one so we're gonna join it
16:39 - uh with the temporary and the temporary
16:42 - is nothing right now so let's say you
16:43 - don't get it then it'll be blank
16:45 - question mark but if you do get it then
16:47 - it'll have a letter plus the question
16:49 - mark so we're going to join
16:54 - uh these two variables
16:56 - so it could be either blank question
16:58 - mark or blank a letter and after that
17:00 - it'll just keep on putting question
17:01 - marks at the end
17:03 - until you get the letters so
17:05 - remember we just have to put the temp we
17:08 - join the temp with the
17:10 - character
17:13 - and then after that we're going to get
17:15 - an if then statement so if the character
17:17 - is equal to question mark
17:19 - if character
17:21 - is equal to question mark
17:25 - character
17:30 - if the character is equal to question
17:31 - mark then we're going to change the
17:32 - question mark count by one
17:36 - so if the whatever the player puts
17:39 - so what this is used to is to check if
17:42 - there's any question marks in the
17:44 - word so if there are question marks the
17:46 - game will continue running else if there
17:49 - are no no more question marks left then
17:50 - the player should win
17:52 - so we're right here we're going to
17:54 - change the question mark count
17:57 - question mark counts by one
17:58 - and then we're gonna change
18:00 - the index by one so it'll go to the next
18:02 - letter of the word
18:04 - so the index we're gonna change it by
18:06 - one
18:07 - and then we're gonna set the display
18:08 - word
18:10 - to temp
18:11 - whatever this is temp is gonna be the
18:14 - character joined
18:15 - with that thing so the blank plus the
18:17 - letter or blank plus the question mark
18:20 - so that's what it's going to be
18:25 - so at the final
18:26 - at the end it'll just be some question
18:28 - marks or some letters
18:30 - and so it could be just like question
18:32 - mark question mark a question mark
18:34 - question mark question mark so
18:36 - at the end it will change it to that so
18:38 - we're done defining our process answer
18:40 - so this is the hardest part of this
18:42 - project
18:44 - and then next we have the
18:46 - project correct yes and the project
18:47 - rhonda so let's code these two
18:50 - so for the project correct guess
18:53 - we're gonna broadcast and wait a message
18:55 - called update
18:58 - oh wait we already have update sorry uh
18:59 - update
19:00 - and then
19:02 - if then so we're gonna if
19:04 - so if the question mark count is equal
19:05 - to zero meaning the player has gotten
19:07 - all the letters correct
19:09 - so if the question mark count is equal
19:11 - to zero
19:15 - if it's equal to zero we're going to
19:16 - switch the costume to win
19:19 - which is the costume that says
19:22 - you win good job you won
19:24 - and then we're gonna show this sprites
19:27 - and then we're gonna stop all
19:31 - and then if you get a wrong guess
19:34 - then we're gonna broadcast and wait
19:37 - a message called
19:38 - wrong guess
19:43 - and we're gonna change the attempts by
19:45 - negative one so you'll lose an attempt
19:47 - for getting a wrong answer
19:50 - i'm gonna change the remaining attempts
19:53 - minus one
19:55 - and we're gonna get an if then else
19:57 - statement
19:58 - so if else
20:00 - if
20:01 - the remaining attempts is equal to zero
20:03 - so you have no more attempts left
20:06 - remaining attempts equals a zero then
20:08 - we're going to set the display word
20:12 - set display word
20:14 - to the secret word so let's say you out
20:16 - of attempts it'll just show the word
20:18 - just to show you guys show you what the
20:20 - word is after you lost
20:22 - so the secret to the secret word and
20:24 - then we're just gonna
20:26 - update we're gonna broadcast and wait
20:27 - update so it'll update
20:29 - uh the new sprite we'll have to code in
20:31 - there after
20:33 - and after that we're going to switch the
20:35 - costume to loose
20:37 - which is the sorry you lose costume
20:39 - and then we're going to show it and then
20:41 - stop all
20:44 - else we're still going to have to update
20:45 - it regardless so
20:47 - we're just gonna put the broadcast and
20:48 - wait
20:49 - update
20:51 - okay since we're done defining stuff we
20:53 - can go back into the new game area and
20:55 - then we can finish uh coding here
20:58 - and then we're gonna get forever loop
21:00 - that's forever
21:01 - and then we're gonna
21:02 - always ask an answer so we're gonna ask
21:06 - guess a letter
21:10 - guess a letter and then we're gonna
21:12 - go to my blocks and process the answer
21:15 - which is this entire chunk
21:18 - of code used to process whatever the
21:20 - answer the player puts is
21:22 - we're going to put that and then we're
21:23 - going to hit if statements if then so if
21:26 - the got letter is equal to zero
21:29 - i got letter
21:33 - got header is equal to zero
21:37 - so for us zero is false one is true i
21:39 - should have told you guys this earlier
21:41 - but
21:42 - um so basically if
21:44 - the god letter is false
21:46 - then
21:47 - wait this is supposed to be if
21:49 - uh else even sorry about that uh if else
21:52 - so if it's like that then we're going to
21:56 - wrong we're going gonna process wrong
21:58 - answer so
21:59 - it'll go down here
22:01 - to run this code right here
22:02 - else
22:03 - it'll run the correct guess
22:05 - right here
22:06 - okay
22:07 - i'm gonna zoom out
22:09 - so in case you have anything you do not
22:11 - get you can put it down in your code you
22:14 - can check your code
22:17 - okay
22:18 - so now let's go to our new sprite
22:20 - i mean not the new sprite we have to
22:22 - make a new sprite
22:24 - yeah new sprite yeah okay
22:26 - all right so we're gonna have to paint a
22:27 - new sprite we're just gonna rename it
22:29 - display
22:32 - typing
22:34 - display and then we don't have to put
22:35 - anything just go to the code
22:39 - okay so inside our display sprite we're
22:40 - going to receive the update thing
22:43 - update message and then we're going to
22:44 - make a few new variables we need six for
22:46 - each slot on the hangman thing so we're
22:49 - going to use c1 for the sprite only
22:52 - c2 for this sprite only
22:55 - c3 for the sprite only
22:58 - c4 for the sprite only
23:01 - c5
23:03 - the sprite only
23:04 - and finally c6 for the sprite only
23:09 - okay
23:10 - so now we have all the variables
23:12 - for all the letters we just have to um
23:14 - let's hide the word list for now
23:18 - let me hide that real quick so we can go
23:20 - into our display and then we can
23:22 - basically just double click and then get
23:24 - the c1
23:26 - c2 double click
23:29 - c3
23:32 - uh
23:34 - c4 and just put all the variables into
23:37 - the box
23:38 - uh
23:39 - c3
23:41 - let's move this down a little bit i move
23:43 - this inside a little bit c4 c5 and c6
23:53 - there you go
23:54 - and then right here
23:56 - uh we can just uh
23:59 - double click that put that in here
24:02 - and then next we can do
24:04 - set the c1 to the letter one of the
24:07 - display word which is going to be the
24:08 - question mark so
24:10 - in the beginning it'll in the beginning
24:12 - it'll be question mark but when you
24:13 - you'll always update so let's say you
24:15 - get a question right
24:16 - then it will set the letter one of the
24:18 - display word as c1
24:21 - so we always want to set it as whatever
24:23 - you put here so
24:25 - we're gonna get the letter
24:26 - one of display word
24:31 - and we can just duplicate this instead
24:33 - c2 we're going to change the c2 instead
24:35 - we're going to get letter two
24:37 - so what you do is just duplicate all
24:39 - this
24:40 - and we need six of them so i'm just
24:42 - gonna do that
24:43 - c3 c4 c5
24:46 - c6
24:48 - and then we have the 2 3 4 5 6.
24:52 - okay
24:55 - so in summary these are the six letters
24:57 - of your word so assuming you get bridge
24:59 - it could be like b question mark
25:01 - question mark r question mark like
25:03 - something like that it could be
25:05 - like that so that's what we have here
25:09 - and then so i think that's all the code
25:11 - we have
25:13 - let's hide all these variables so let's
25:15 - go to
25:16 - these hide all these variables
25:20 - okay oh wait we have to show this one
25:23 - there we go let's save our project and
25:26 - show our game
25:29 - click new we have a new word so let's
25:31 - guess s
25:32 - that's not a word
25:34 - oh yeah and i forgot one last thing
25:37 - so basically for this one you have to
25:38 - make it go to the next costume so
25:41 - remember we broadcasted the message
25:43 - reset well basically right here when you
25:45 - reset you just want to switch the
25:46 - costume back to the first costume
25:50 - and and then when we get the wrong
25:52 - answer we have to draw the
25:54 - hangman receive
25:57 - wrong and wrong guess we're gonna next
26:00 - costume
26:02 - there we go now it should work
26:04 - save
26:05 - stop the project let's go full screen
26:07 - okay
26:08 - new
26:10 - let's guess a
26:12 - okay that is one of them i think this is
26:14 - animal i think
26:16 - yeah it is animal
26:17 - okay i think we have to get another one
26:19 - okay
26:21 - okay let's let's just like yeah see as
26:23 - you can see if he gets the wrong answer
26:24 - i put k it's
26:26 - wrong so we'll do that
26:29 - so a a
26:32 - so let's say you do let's see let's say
26:34 - you get all of them wrong okay
26:39 - so as you can see you get them all wrong
26:42 - okay so you get them all wrong you draws
26:44 - the entire man it says sorry you lost it
26:47 - shows the word which is shaman and your
26:49 - remaining attempts is zero
26:51 - so our game is working completely
26:54 - so this is our hangman game in scratch

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back to the channel tickets quickly route today we'll be doing a hangman game in scratch um so hangman is like a game where you try to guess um words and try to guess the word and you try not to let it drop draw the man if it draws up the man that means you lose so we'll be doing that in scratch so without further ado let's demonstrate the game so green flag let's click new okay so in the beginning you get eight attempts okay let's guess usually in hangman you want to guess the vowels first let's get some a okay it looks like there are two a's in this thing so let's see what else maybe a c nope no c so as you can see if you get something wrong it will draw the circle in black so the gray is just the outline so it will just draw each of the things on top of the gray and you'll lose one attempt if you get the right answer then you don't lose an attempt so let's go g nope i mean i okay there is an i so what could this board possibly be let's see oh a something i okay let's go for a b i'm just guessing nope five more times l okay there's an l oh a let's see t nope n and animal yes animal okay there you go see as you can see i got i got the word right so it says good job you won so if you get it before the attempts gets to zero then you win so that's pretty much it for the game and if you want to start a new game just click new and the word will be completely randomized to a new word i'm going to show you guys how it looks like if you lose so i'm just going to spam one letter i guess okay so what if you just don't guess anything right it will draw the entire man so you can see and then you have zero attempts and at the end i'll show you the word um that you had and you'll say sorry you lost okay so that's what we have let's start a new project before we begin on this tutorial here's your friendly reminder to subscribe to kids coding play run because only 6.6 of our viewers in the last 28 days are subscribed to our channel and 93.4 are not subscribed so please help us increase our subscribed viewers to at least 10 that's our goal before we start coding in our game um i would like to ask you guys a question so we have a we were thinking about doing a uh christmas themed coding like project competition on our kids coding playground official studio in scratch so let us know what you think about it in the comment section below or you can join our discord and vote there if you would like if enough people say yes then we might do it and we might have a prize for the winner so yeah that's pretty much it what i have to say okay now let's start coding let's rename the project to hang man or let's make it capital h hang man and let's delete the scratch cat we'll never need it then this one i guess we never really need it and then we have uh all these sprites we need to get so we have the process logic this is basically the you win and lose and all the logic behind the hangman game and then we have the new sprites this is starting a new game you click that and then we have the hangman itself right there and then right here we have the backdrop and then we just drag this one in so you can just download this or you can draw it yourself so what we did in the background was we'd have let's duplicate it i'll show you what we have so right here we have two h's so as you can see we have two hanging ins the gray one just looks like a little shadow behind the black one and then right here we have the remaining attempts we have a box and then we'll put the variable inside here and then right here for the sections for each letter there is we just drew a rectangle and then we used the reshape tool and rounded out the edges so i'm going to show you what we did so just draw like that reshape unlikely one like that that maybe like that that just like pull out the edges a little to make it a little bit round yeah so there you go it's not the best but some like something like that we just did something like that and then we just duplicate ctrl c ctrl v six times uh five times for each one and then we get all of that so yeah that's pretty much how you do the backdrop so we're gonna delete that and you see this is the hangman thing is a little bit overlapping this so we're just going to like move this up a little bit you can just like here you know it's a little bit too high like about right here should be fine right okay now let's go on to our other sprite our hangman so what we have what we did was just draw a straight line of 10 using this color straight so you hold down shift to make a straight line and then we made another line right here and then another line down same thickness hold down shift to make a straight one and then right here we just have a box with the same outline drew box like that like a rectangle and then right here we have the costumes for each one so costume one and then we have the each hangman costume with a gray outline and we'll just color over it with the black and then right here we don't you don't want to make so as you can see when you like do this um it's like you draw something like this um you don't want to connect it like that because it will change the color for the entire thing instead oops like that instead you want to do this like that and then just get the select tool and drag it on like that or drag it on like that something like that so then it doesn't change the color for the entire thing uh yeah so basically you should draw the gray before you do the black because you want the black on top so remember to draw the gray first okay so it's basically the same thing for all these you just go over in black yeah so that's pretty much it for the hangman and then right here process logic we have the button we got the blue and orange button we dragged it out a little bit and then we just wrote good job you won for the blue one and then sorry you lost for the other one and then the new sprite is just just box reshape and then new in the middle okay and we also did some readjusting of the um all these sprites off camera so it looks a little bit better because as you could see this thing was overlapping on that and maybe if you move this all up this will show up in the bottom so it will look better so now this is our full thing we just moved it up a little bit so it's not centered now okay let's start coding in the new sprite so inside the new sprite we're going to start when this sprite is clicked let's zoom in a little so when this right is clicked we're gonna change the x by two so we're just to make it look like when you click it there's a little bit animation so i change the x by two change the y by negative two then we're gonna wait until not mouse down so you can spam it so we're gonna wait until not mouse down not mouse down no not messed up and then after that we're going to change the x back by negative 2 and change the y by 2 so it goes back to its original position let's duplicate that and then we're just going to change the x by negative two and then the y by two and then broadcast a message and name it new game so it'll start a new game new game and then right here let's save it um i'll show you when you click on it as you can see it moves down a little bit like that looks like it's being clicked on so that's what we want and then we go to the process um uh logic sprite okay so when we receive the new game inside here and receive new game we are going to make some new blocks so we're going to make a new block we're going to make uh four new blocks actually we'll define them all we're going to name the first one initialize initialize like that and then click ok we will make another one process answer and aw and sir and then process answer and then we're going to do process uh correct guess so this is if you get the correct uh guess and then we have another one process wrong wrong guess process process wrong guess and then we have the four custom blocks and then first let's define initialize okay so inside initialize we're going to hide in the beginning we're going to hide this right in the beginning and then we're going to make some new variables we're going to make a variable called display word so this is the word that's going to be displayed and we're going to name it six question marks and must be six because we're doing six letter words and after that we're gonna set each each uh let each little slot right here the variable to assign to a different letter so we're gonna display word to exactly six question marks like that six question marks and then we're gonna set the remaining attempts which is another variable we're gonna name it renaming attempts okay oh forgot that oops tenths i think that's right um and then we're gonna set the remaining attempts we're gonna set it to eight so we have eight remaining attempts and then we're gonna set the secret word which is another variable i'm forgetting uh secret word and it's gonna be for this word for the sprite only so secret word anything we have the first letter and lowercase will be for the sprite only okay we're going to set the secret word secret word and then we're going to make a list so we're gonna make a list we're gonna name it word list for this sprite only as you can see you can notice that the first letter is lowercase and then uh we're going to put words into the word list so you know we could just do one green file clicked and put all the different words like that but we're not going to do that because people can just look inside and see inside the code and see all the words and it won't be fun so what we're going to do is just going to put the words so i'm just going to go open up the list and we're going to fill out some of the words so okay so we just got five words so you know how you just click the plus and you type whatever you want right there we just got five sample words you can add as much as you would want so what we just have five right now and then right here we just want to set the secret word and then we're gonna do item okay so we're gonna get the item of the word list right here we're gonna have to pick random one to five because we have five words so it's gonna be item pick random one to five of word list and then we're gonna broadcast another message we're gonna name it update so it's gonna keep on updating um what to do next we'll need this after oh update and wait sorry i forgot about that has me to wait and then uh after that we have to broadcast another message and wait and we're gonna name it reset okay and then inside the new game we are going to initialize and we will need to add more code to it um but first we have to define all of these guys so let me move all these guys down leave this up okay now let's define um process answer we will finish um up this new game thing after we finish this these three first i'm going to start on this one okay so let's make some new variables we're going to name a new variable this is for the sprite only as well we're going to name it got letter got letter and then we're just going to do another one this is also for the sprite only question mark count make that capital so first one is lowercase for the sprite only question mark count and then we're gonna make another one called temp this is a temporary variable it's gonna be an attempt for the sprite only because it's lowercase and then another one uh index and then we're just going to put it lowercase for the sprite only and click ok ok so now we have all our variables let's get defining on this one so we're going to first we're going to set the got letter to zero and then we're going to set the question mark down to zero so and then we're gonna set the temporary to nothing for now temp to nothing we're gonna set it to blank and then we're gonna set the index to one so it's on the first first one on the index okay so now let's get a repeat so we're gonna repeat um and then we're gonna do the length of the secret word which is six letters so we can just go repeat one of the secret word length of the secret word like that so it's going to repeat six times and then we're going to set a new variable i'm gonna name it character for the sprite only as well so character we're going to set character right here to the letter position i mean index of the secret word so we're going to set the character we're going to get the letter and then we're going to get the index and then secret word so what this says okay let's let's put the secret word first okay all right so we're going to set the character to the letter of the index so the index is one right now so it will go to the first letter of the secret word so assuming we had bridge as our word right it will get the first letters because the index is equal to one right now and you'll get b okay and then we're going to get an if else if else statement inside here so if the character is equal to the answer of the person like whatever the person puts in so if the character is equal to answer of whatever the player puts in then we're going to set the a new the variable.letter i thought it was gonna be a new one so i said they got letter to one so that means they have got the letter so assuming the uh word was bridge they type in b it's equal to the character so you'll get the letter else if you do not get the letter we're going to set the variable character to the letter letter index of the display word so the display word is a question mark because up here remember we set the display word to six question marks well it's gonna be down here so it's gonna set the index a letter index or one of so the first slot is gonna be a question mark if you don't get it okay and then we're going to get a set the right here we're going to set the temporary variable and then we're going to join the temporary plus the character so the character could either be this one or this one so we're gonna join it uh with the temporary and the temporary is nothing right now so let's say you don't get it then it'll be blank question mark but if you do get it then it'll have a letter plus the question mark so we're going to join uh these two variables so it could be either blank question mark or blank a letter and after that it'll just keep on putting question marks at the end until you get the letters so remember we just have to put the temp we join the temp with the character and then after that we're going to get an if then statement so if the character is equal to question mark if character is equal to question mark character if the character is equal to question mark then we're going to change the question mark count by one so if the whatever the player puts so what this is used to is to check if there's any question marks in the word so if there are question marks the game will continue running else if there are no no more question marks left then the player should win so we're right here we're going to change the question mark count question mark counts by one and then we're gonna change the index by one so it'll go to the next letter of the word so the index we're gonna change it by one and then we're gonna set the display word to temp whatever this is temp is gonna be the character joined with that thing so the blank plus the letter or blank plus the question mark so that's what it's going to be so at the final at the end it'll just be some question marks or some letters and so it could be just like question mark question mark a question mark question mark question mark so at the end it will change it to that so we're done defining our process answer so this is the hardest part of this project and then next we have the project correct yes and the project rhonda so let's code these two so for the project correct guess we're gonna broadcast and wait a message called update oh wait we already have update sorry uh update and then if then so we're gonna if so if the question mark count is equal to zero meaning the player has gotten all the letters correct so if the question mark count is equal to zero if it's equal to zero we're going to switch the costume to win which is the costume that says you win good job you won and then we're gonna show this sprites and then we're gonna stop all and then if you get a wrong guess then we're gonna broadcast and wait a message called wrong guess and we're gonna change the attempts by negative one so you'll lose an attempt for getting a wrong answer i'm gonna change the remaining attempts minus one and we're gonna get an if then else statement so if else if the remaining attempts is equal to zero so you have no more attempts left remaining attempts equals a zero then we're going to set the display word set display word to the secret word so let's say you out of attempts it'll just show the word just to show you guys show you what the word is after you lost so the secret to the secret word and then we're just gonna update we're gonna broadcast and wait update so it'll update uh the new sprite we'll have to code in there after and after that we're going to switch the costume to loose which is the sorry you lose costume and then we're going to show it and then stop all else we're still going to have to update it regardless so we're just gonna put the broadcast and wait update okay since we're done defining stuff we can go back into the new game area and then we can finish uh coding here and then we're gonna get forever loop that's forever and then we're gonna always ask an answer so we're gonna ask guess a letter guess a letter and then we're gonna go to my blocks and process the answer which is this entire chunk of code used to process whatever the answer the player puts is we're going to put that and then we're going to hit if statements if then so if the got letter is equal to zero i got letter got header is equal to zero so for us zero is false one is true i should have told you guys this earlier but um so basically if the god letter is false then wait this is supposed to be if uh else even sorry about that uh if else so if it's like that then we're going to wrong we're going gonna process wrong answer so it'll go down here to run this code right here else it'll run the correct guess right here okay i'm gonna zoom out so in case you have anything you do not get you can put it down in your code you can check your code okay so now let's go to our new sprite i mean not the new sprite we have to make a new sprite yeah new sprite yeah okay all right so we're gonna have to paint a new sprite we're just gonna rename it display typing display and then we don't have to put anything just go to the code okay so inside our display sprite we're going to receive the update thing update message and then we're going to make a few new variables we need six for each slot on the hangman thing so we're going to use c1 for the sprite only c2 for this sprite only c3 for the sprite only c4 for the sprite only c5 the sprite only and finally c6 for the sprite only okay so now we have all the variables for all the letters we just have to um let's hide the word list for now let me hide that real quick so we can go into our display and then we can basically just double click and then get the c1 c2 double click c3 uh c4 and just put all the variables into the box uh c3 let's move this down a little bit i move this inside a little bit c4 c5 and c6 there you go and then right here uh we can just uh double click that put that in here and then next we can do set the c1 to the letter one of the display word which is going to be the question mark so in the beginning it'll in the beginning it'll be question mark but when you you'll always update so let's say you get a question right then it will set the letter one of the display word as c1 so we always want to set it as whatever you put here so we're gonna get the letter one of display word and we can just duplicate this instead c2 we're going to change the c2 instead we're going to get letter two so what you do is just duplicate all this and we need six of them so i'm just gonna do that c3 c4 c5 c6 and then we have the 2 3 4 5 6. okay so in summary these are the six letters of your word so assuming you get bridge it could be like b question mark question mark r question mark like something like that it could be like that so that's what we have here and then so i think that's all the code we have let's hide all these variables so let's go to these hide all these variables okay oh wait we have to show this one there we go let's save our project and show our game click new we have a new word so let's guess s that's not a word oh yeah and i forgot one last thing so basically for this one you have to make it go to the next costume so remember we broadcasted the message reset well basically right here when you reset you just want to switch the costume back to the first costume and and then when we get the wrong answer we have to draw the hangman receive wrong and wrong guess we're gonna next costume there we go now it should work save stop the project let's go full screen okay new let's guess a okay that is one of them i think this is animal i think yeah it is animal okay i think we have to get another one okay okay let's let's just like yeah see as you can see if he gets the wrong answer i put k it's wrong so we'll do that so a a so let's say you do let's see let's say you get all of them wrong okay so as you can see you get them all wrong okay so you get them all wrong you draws the entire man it says sorry you lost it shows the word which is shaman and your remaining attempts is zero so our game is working completely so this is our hangman game in scratch don't forget to like share and subscribe um thank
