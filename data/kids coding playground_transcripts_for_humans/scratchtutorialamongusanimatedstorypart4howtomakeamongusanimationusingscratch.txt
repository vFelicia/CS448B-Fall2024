00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to
00:09 - fitzcalling playground
00:11 - so today we are going to continue with
00:14 - this series
00:15 - um the uh among us animation this is
00:18 - part four
00:19 - so um let's just go over what we had
00:22 - last time we did the club we did the
00:25 - uh the shooting with the laser gun
00:28 - the infinity garnets right so now we can
00:31 - work on the lightsaber
00:32 - and then also we'll finish the stage one
00:35 - to stage three we can work on stage four
00:38 - so as you can see these are the the code
00:40 - for the uh
00:41 - the cyan sprite so far
00:45 - so if you miss anything you can kind of
00:47 - pause it and kind of take a look
00:50 - okay and the manga sprite this is the uh
00:55 - the one that they have multiple costumes
00:57 - that you could like kill them
01:00 - and then door here okay
01:04 - orange i don't think we have anything i
01:06 - don't think any of these have anything i
01:08 - don't think so
01:09 - and they might have some like just
01:11 - moving here and there but nothing much
01:13 - uh the sonic power this is that
01:17 - then i think we have the portal this is
01:20 - how you go into the portal from stage to
01:22 - stage
01:23 - this is the club we have that call ready
01:27 - the gauntlet so this is
01:30 - uh the code for number three on it
01:34 - and then we don't have this i don't
01:36 - think so
01:37 - nope not yet not yet
01:40 - and we have the story continue this is
01:44 - the beginning when we switching the
01:47 - the uh when the starting the episode
01:51 - and then the power one yeah we have this
01:55 - when we at stage four will hide it
01:58 - okay that's about it okay
02:02 - and then we have some code in the
02:03 - background okay
02:05 - so so let me take this out so that the
02:08 - sound will not come
02:09 - you know a little bit better while we're
02:12 - testing
02:13 - okay all right um
02:16 - okay so we'll start with the cyan i
02:19 - think i want to get to the
02:21 - full stage we need to put them at some
02:24 - position
02:24 - right so what we're going to do is we're
02:28 - going to go to the
02:29 - fourth stage i mean you can select the
02:32 - stage 4 here
02:34 - and then just kind of you want to put
02:35 - them at whatever stage you want
02:38 - so like let's say you want him to be on
02:39 - this side or this side doesn't matter
02:43 - um i think on my code i had it on this
02:46 - side
02:47 - so we'll just keep it like that for now
02:50 - okay we just duplicate this call this uh
02:54 - stage four
02:56 - right back grab four we'll put him at
02:58 - negative 192
03:01 - 98 is fine then we have 198 here
03:05 - on this one and then with the mixture
03:06 - we'll point in direction
03:08 - 90 because we want to face the right
03:10 - side
03:12 - and then switch costs to one and show
03:15 - okay so it'll be somewhere here
03:18 - okay and then i'm going to go to the uh
03:22 - the among the sprite which is this one
03:27 - so for my manga sprite and i had on him
03:29 - on this side so we'll keep it on this
03:31 - side so as you can see the door can't
03:33 - come up because i push the uh
03:35 - i push to start and then i switch it to
03:37 - that one so the door shouldn't be here
03:38 - for stage four
03:39 - so don't worry about that when we run
03:41 - the code will be fixed
03:44 - so let's duplicate this let's put this
03:46 - for
03:47 - stage four we kind of have it nicely
03:49 - organized so that way you know you kind
03:51 - of
03:52 - know where things are
03:55 - so what i'm at this point is fine and
03:59 - that's fine so hope he's somewhere on
04:01 - the right here
04:02 - okay and then he's facing this side
04:06 - so negative 90 meaning he's facing this
04:08 - side
04:09 - finn's left so what we're going to do
04:12 - next is uh work on the uh
04:14 - the lightsaber okay so the lightsaber
04:18 - has
04:18 - old cold i think the lightsaber and the
04:21 - rings always work on both
04:23 - so the ring is kind of like a circle
04:26 - kind of thing of blue thing okay so
04:28 - we're gonna make that kind of
04:30 - next to a lifesaver so um
04:33 - what we want to do is uh when start
04:37 - okay event when green flag is start
04:42 - screen file is clicked so what we want
04:46 - to do
04:46 - is we want to hide it in the beginning
04:49 - we don't want to show that
04:51 - the sword right and what we want to
04:55 - i'm going to grab a forever loop here
04:59 - and motion we'll say go to
05:03 - cyan
05:07 - okay and then point in direction
05:10 - just like how we did before right in
05:12 - direction of the
05:14 - cyan character okay so we'll take this
05:18 - take this put here select cyan and back
05:22 - and then select direction okay
05:26 - and then we'll grab some if an else
05:28 - statement uh basically we're trying to
05:30 - match
05:31 - the sword chart on his hand so you can't
05:33 - move it so i already did it
05:35 - so i know the coordinates for it so
05:38 - what we'll do is we're going to grab the
05:41 - equal here
05:42 - nope sorry great
05:43 - [Music]
05:46 - okay so we are going to take this
05:50 - so you remember we were talking about
05:52 - the direction right it was um
05:55 - sorry stop so uh when we
05:58 - say it's a greater than zero meaning is
06:01 - actually pointing to the right
06:03 - then what we want to do is we want to
06:06 - move the sort somewhere to the right
06:08 - here right
06:09 - okay so you have to say set
06:13 - set x duplicate this
06:17 - say cyan exposition
06:21 - uh and then a weather add some value
06:24 - because this kind of
06:25 - would have moved into a little bit
06:26 - further because if you put it just
06:28 - exhale be in the middle of your stomach
06:30 - so that doesn't look good
06:32 - over 75 push it out a little bit
06:36 - okay and then we'll duplicate this
06:40 - and what we want to do is on the other
06:42 - side we're going to push it to negative
06:46 - 75.
06:48 - [Music]
06:52 - okay and then we want to set the y
06:56 - sorry now we'll set the y
06:58 - [Music]
07:01 - set y outside here
07:05 - and then we're going to use the inside x
07:08 - position we'll use the y
07:09 - position and then we'll move it up a
07:12 - little bit
07:13 - so i'm going to say plus 25
07:17 - move the y position okay
07:20 - all right so so if i click on this so
07:24 - let me move him over here if i click on
07:25 - this guy
07:27 - i'm gonna go back to my lightsaber you
07:28 - don't have to run the whole call again
07:30 - so what you do is hey where's the code
07:36 - oops that was my mistake
07:39 - click on the wrong sprite when i was
07:41 - coding so we're going gonna just drag
07:43 - this
07:44 - all the way put it on this guy we're
07:46 - gonna go here okay
07:47 - instead of d3 so we're gonna clean up
07:50 - the code in the ring
07:51 - sorry about that that was my mistake
07:54 - drop this
07:55 - okay should be in this site saver so
07:57 - we're working on the
07:58 - lightsaber at the moment okay
08:02 - and then we are going to use event
08:06 - [Music]
08:08 - when the number four key is pressed
08:12 - we want to show this guy and it is not
08:15 - in progress
08:16 - okay if nothing is not talking or
08:19 - something like that
08:20 - so grab this over here
08:24 - and then operator not
08:28 - and then we use the equal
08:32 - variable outlook in progress
08:36 - not yes meaning no okay
08:40 - and we're gonna say go to front layer
08:44 - show
08:48 - okay we're gonna have to broadcast a
08:50 - message here
08:55 - say saber spin
08:58 - so this will spin the saber uh wait for
09:03 - two seconds and then
09:07 - hi okay so let's just try it out
09:11 - so when we run it okay we're gonna push
09:15 - four
09:16 - so you can see that it actually here
09:18 - right it's in the side so you see
09:21 - if i'm on the right side on the left
09:22 - side right uh
09:24 - right side the saw is facing left when
09:26 - i'm on the
09:27 - on the on this side the soil is facing
09:29 - the other way okay so the light saber is
09:31 - working
09:32 - so what we want to do is we're going to
09:33 - put the little ring around the right
09:35 - lightsaber
09:37 - uh we're gonna go back to the ring the
09:39 - cover the ring
09:40 - so similarly you know like the cold for
09:43 - the uh
09:45 - for the sword so we want to do something
09:48 - similar but we will not be using this
09:50 - cyan we're gonna have to look at the
09:51 - position of the lightsaber
09:53 - so what we can do is take this code drag
09:56 - it to the ring
09:57 - okay so now the ring has this code so
10:00 - what we want to do
10:01 - is we want to go to the lifesaver
10:04 - instead
10:06 - okay and then you have to use the
10:09 - direction of the lifesaver
10:11 - okay and then same thing right the
10:14 - lightsaber
10:15 - is greater than zero
10:19 - okay the direction then we would put the
10:22 - tens in lifesaver here so make sure you
10:25 - change all of them okay
10:27 - here's a plus 10 and this
10:30 - i will do a lifesaver minus 10.
10:35 - okay and then we want to move it up a
10:37 - little bit so
10:39 - lifesaver 25 is good okay
10:42 - and this one make sure you select the y
10:44 - position okay
10:45 - sometimes when you copy over this thing
10:47 - get messed up and
10:48 - it changes the the code a bit so
10:52 - so this is so far that so this part is
10:55 - done
10:56 - so zoom out a little bit we'll the
10:59 - effect of a spin right
11:02 - so but before that let's grab the uh one
11:05 - grab another stop when it's like flap is
11:07 - clicked
11:09 - what we want to do is we're gonna say
11:10 - clear the graphics effect
11:13 - then say hi
11:16 - [Music]
11:18 - and then say forever
11:19 - [Music]
11:23 - okay we are going to change the
11:28 - you know we're going to change the uh
11:30 - the
11:31 - little bit on the on the ring
11:34 - so some effect but let's just use the
11:37 - fish eye
11:38 - [Music]
11:40 - okay okay
11:42 - by 50
11:43 - [Music]
11:46 - and then we're gonna wait
11:49 - [Music]
11:54 - zero one so we're gonna make it pretty
11:56 - fast
11:57 - okay like one tenth number one ten maybe
12:01 - 100 of a second here
12:04 - i guess you can try different way see
12:06 - which one looks
12:07 - better for you so let me just i think
12:10 - this is what i had earlier
12:12 - so let me just try like this first see
12:14 - how it looks if
12:15 - we need to change it we can change it
12:18 - so put it back
12:21 - next 50 so positive 50 other 50 negative
12:25 - 50 negative 50
12:26 - okay so let's see how it actually
12:29 - looks so you see that
12:34 - so when it runs
12:40 - so you see how it kind of like this
12:43 - blinking kind of thing so that's kind of
12:45 - what we want
12:46 - okay all right so when we receive
12:50 - we remember we have a saber spin right
12:52 - so we're gonna call this for this guy
12:54 - so when we receive
12:59 - saber spin uh you're gonna make it go to
13:03 - the front layer
13:04 - so in front of the sword say show
13:09 - and then wait
13:13 - uh two seconds for it to show up and
13:15 - then we'll
13:16 - hide it hide the ring okay so let's
13:20 - test it out so now when we save
13:24 - number four you can see it's kind of
13:26 - like like that
13:28 - so like that so as you can see the
13:32 - among the sky is not dying right when we
13:34 - do the sword so what a call that
13:36 - so let's stop here and then go to the uh
13:42 - among us sprite what we need to do is
13:45 - kind of
13:45 - let's duplicate this one actually
13:48 - so instead of club uh select saber spin
13:52 - and now we'll say we're touching the
13:54 - rain actually
13:57 - so basically touching this ring
13:59 - [Music]
14:01 - what we want to do is um yeah repeat 205
14:03 - is fine
14:04 - uh we can select a different effect like
14:06 - pixelated
14:08 - and let's try for five not completely
14:11 - gone right
14:13 - uh and then this one same thing so if it
14:16 - actually
14:17 - kill this one then it will open the door
14:20 - allows you to open the door open the
14:21 - portal let's just try it out so number
14:24 - four
14:25 - so you see how it pixelated it kind of
14:27 - died
14:28 - you can go into the door right
14:31 - so that's what we want to do so you can
14:34 - see
14:35 - and then it kind of got to kill him
14:39 - okay all right so this is working fine
14:44 - okay uh right now we're gonna call for
14:47 - backdrop number five which is like the
14:50 - group of uh among us kind of discussion
14:53 - in the uh voting right that's what we
14:55 - had in the beginning
14:56 - i mean on my um animation so we'll
15:00 - do that so go to here and
15:03 - we can just duplicate number four push
15:06 - it to number five
15:07 - so we want to kind of put him at this
15:10 - position so i had the
15:12 - coordinates already so i will just say
15:14 - 989
15:15 - i mean it is 68 negative 68
15:18 - and negative 10 so it will be somewhere
15:21 - like right
15:22 - here and then we're gonna put a table
15:24 - here and then put the other guys around
15:26 - and we're gonna face not even being put
15:28 - into the right
15:30 - okay and one thing is i want to make him
15:32 - to go to the back layer because he's in
15:34 - the back of the other
15:36 - guys right so let's put him in the back
15:37 - layer okay
15:39 - so in stage five you'll be at this
15:41 - position
15:42 - so same thing you know for other sprite
15:45 - that you have the code for right
15:47 - so stage five where to do something as
15:50 - well here
15:51 - okay we might not need to do anything
15:52 - with this among us i don't think stage
15:54 - five
15:55 - we're killing any of the manga so we
15:57 - might not need that
15:58 - so it'll be automatically high so what
16:01 - we need to do is we're gonna
16:02 - create the table right so the table
16:05 - let's select this
16:06 - first costume and then we're gonna have
16:09 - to put the
16:09 - among us uh guys around it so let's
16:12 - let's just hide this one for now
16:15 - so hide this one and we're going to hide
16:18 - this one so we'll get a little
16:19 - more space let's put on stage five here
16:22 - just see how it looks
16:24 - and we are going to put the table and
16:27 - let's see how that looks
16:28 - so in in stage five so you want to test
16:31 - something right
16:32 - so what you can do is you don't actually
16:34 - have to do all of them
16:35 - to to start from the beginning to the
16:37 - end right to test
16:38 - uh what you can do is go to your
16:40 - backdrop right
16:42 - and then you just say switch to say
16:45 - backdrop stage five so when you do that
16:49 - they will have all the code put it in
16:51 - place so when i hit this
16:53 - it actually runs the code for stage five
16:55 - here right
16:56 - so here's right here so what we see you
16:59 - see the tables coming
17:00 - we'll put some code for the table as
17:02 - well so the table i just showed it right
17:04 - so where to say
17:05 - you know like in the beginning of the
17:07 - table shouldn't show right only at stage
17:09 - five will show
17:10 - so let's go in the beginning first when
17:12 - green flag is clicked
17:14 - so we want to move the table is not
17:17 - broken
17:18 - like the table and then
17:21 - we want to say i think the dialogue
17:25 - setting i don't know where i have that
17:28 - about setting maybe here okay
17:32 - so here at this stage we want to um
17:36 - let's see the setting
17:40 - okay the dialog settings already know
17:42 - here so i think we do it with that so we
17:44 - don't need anything like
17:46 - that here says let's put them at this
17:48 - position
17:49 - or whatever position you like just grab
17:52 - that
17:53 - put it here and then we will say
17:58 - hi
18:00 - so high this so this in the beginning
18:03 - will high
18:04 - and then a stage five one one two one
18:06 - show it right so
18:07 - let's say switch back to stage five
18:13 - uh what we want to do is we're going to
18:14 - set this dialogue to yes i think that is
18:17 - actually talking
18:19 - so we don't want the uh the sign guy to
18:21 - attack them
18:23 - okay set dialog in progress
18:27 - say yes okay
18:30 - and then we're gonna show this variable
18:32 - i think the we had among
18:34 - us like that they choose thing like who
18:36 - was the uh
18:37 - the imposter i think uh so we'll
18:41 - put it somewhere here so we use that i
18:43 - think in the
18:44 - the first uh episode you actually use
18:46 - that later on and use the gold team so
18:48 - we'll just keep it the same
18:51 - okay and then uh we have a list
18:55 - so we want to show the list the name
18:57 - list on the side
18:58 - i think i have pre-populated this list
19:01 - with this
19:02 - and i think before actually we were
19:04 - going to pick a random
19:06 - but since we are going right now we are
19:08 - going to just make the gray guy to fly
19:10 - in space
19:12 - so what we're going to do is it's going
19:13 - to be always great okay
19:16 - so anyway we'll show this list
19:19 - so you say show if let's say the list is
19:22 - high
19:22 - you want to show it okay so we can say
19:25 - show this
19:29 - so when the stage file will show the
19:31 - list
19:33 - and then
19:36 - we'll say and then um
19:42 - we'll have to show the uh show this uh
19:44 - table
19:45 - right so what does it look show table
19:50 - and then we have to broadcast a message
19:57 - say vote so we're gonna vote
20:01 - here for this thing okay
20:04 - so when i receive
20:07 - vote um just gonna wait for a couple of
20:12 - seconds let's say three seconds
20:13 - it's trying to make it look like it's
20:15 - everybody's voting
20:17 - and then we have to say set
20:22 - so set the imposter i mean before
20:25 - actually we
20:26 - i actually had that pick a item you can
20:29 - say pick an item
20:30 - like i said right create an item and you
20:32 - can say that random right
20:34 - uh from this list right let's say two to
20:37 - six or something like that that's
20:39 - initially what the code has but since we
20:41 - have the uh
20:42 - the animation saying the great fly out
20:45 - right so we're not gonna do that so
20:46 - no need to do that so we're just gonna
20:48 - hot code this to
20:50 - gray so hardcode meaning you just
20:54 - put the same thing over and over again
20:56 - that's what we call hard code
20:58 - okay and then we're gonna broadcast
21:00 - another message
21:02 - we're gonna save new message say
21:05 - vote finish finish poll or whatever
21:07 - finish vote
21:11 - reporting okay all right stop this
21:15 - so that's done
21:18 - okay now let's call the uh the among us
21:21 - uh
21:21 - the brown one we'll put them you see
21:22 - when i click it it's over here
21:24 - so what we're going to do is
21:28 - let's finish up the table with all the
21:30 - uh
21:32 - among us sprite right so we'll say
21:34 - custom number one
21:36 - so brown one custom number one is this
21:39 - because number two is kind
21:40 - of is mad or something i just created
21:42 - that just draw a little
21:44 - you know draw a little squiggly line red
21:47 - squiggly line okay i group them together
21:51 - so so we're gonna stay with the first
21:55 - one and then we say clear graphic effect
21:58 - just in case you know they don't they
22:00 - destroy the uh
22:02 - the brown white so stage i mean episode
22:04 - three
22:05 - so we need to make sure that we have the
22:07 - clear graphics effect
22:09 - and then position we'll just keep it at
22:11 - this position
22:13 - and then we'll say hi so we'll hide in
22:16 - the beginning
22:17 - okay and then you know we have a
22:21 - backdrop five right just like how we did
22:23 - for the other one
22:24 - so i say when it's backdrop number five
22:28 - we wanna go to the front layer since he
22:31 - is like
22:31 - right here right he's right here so one
22:33 - making the front layer
22:35 - of in front of the cyan guy so say
22:40 - go here go to front layer
22:43 - and then show okay so we're done with
22:46 - him
22:48 - for now we'll buy to go back to him
22:50 - later to do some more code let's go to
22:52 - the green one
22:52 - so the green one is like somewhere here
22:54 - as you can see right
22:56 - okay so the green one same thing
23:01 - let's do
23:06 - one green flag click
23:09 - i don't know why i have the set rotation
23:13 - style
23:13 - on the green one not sure why i think
23:15 - maybe it's needed because he's spitting
23:17 - later on or something
23:19 - uh so i think uh after spinning right so
23:22 - i don't
23:23 - want him to spin again so that's why
23:24 - what this set rotation style left and
23:27 - right
23:28 - on number uh on backdrop on the under on
23:31 - the beginning
23:32 - right okay so just keep it like that
23:35 - okay
23:36 - and then we have switch to custom number
23:40 - one
23:41 - in the beginning so green as what so the
23:44 - other one is just put two water
23:46 - chocolate on him
23:47 - just draw the little uh
23:50 - you know the uh oval kind of thing and
23:52 - then it's like use the
23:54 - this tool so draw a circle and use this
23:56 - tool to
23:57 - reshape to the pull up to drop creative
24:01 - droplets okay so he's kind of scared
24:05 - so next is i want to clear the graphics
24:07 - effect
24:09 - and then we are going to put him at this
24:11 - whatever position that he is in right
24:13 - now
24:14 - and then we want him to point to the
24:17 - left side
24:19 - so negative 90
24:23 - and then we'll hide them in the
24:25 - beginning
24:27 - okay and then when it hit backdrop five
24:30 - will show
24:33 - so we'll put back up number five
24:37 - uh what we want to do we want we want to
24:40 - put it at the same position just in case
24:42 - you know later on we
24:43 - these guys runs around we want to put
24:44 - them back in the same position
24:46 - right so so that way you know when
24:49 - you're testing you can just
24:50 - click on like a switch icon switch i
24:53 - mean switch the
24:54 - like this and then it will run the same
24:56 - code so it's always good to
24:59 - put the same position that you want
25:04 - okay and we also want him to go to the
25:06 - back layer actually
25:07 - for this guy
25:12 - because sense he's actually over here on
25:14 - this side
25:16 - we're here see if he is in the front
25:18 - there he'll be on the
25:19 - thunder table so we want to make sure
25:21 - that he goes to the back layer
25:23 - okay and then we'll say show
25:28 - okay so so far that's what we have
25:31 - okay so after green will work on purple
25:37 - so similarly purple also have the
25:40 - similar code
25:41 - let's just drag this to purple
25:45 - and let's drag this to purple
25:48 - okay let's fix it so purple will put at
25:52 - the different position
25:55 - um so i think where's purple
25:59 - propose this one okay so negative 90.
26:02 - so this is good so we'll put a different
26:05 - position for him
26:07 - okay so but same one same thing here
26:11 - and then we have the custom one we have
26:13 - to clear the graphics effect
26:15 - put him at this position pointing
26:18 - negative 90 meaning left side
26:20 - and then high him okay
26:25 - and then uh at the backdrop number five
26:27 - we can
26:28 - put the similar thing here
26:34 - just in case we need to reuse it later
26:38 - and then we want to make them go to the
26:39 - front layer actually purple's in the
26:41 - front
26:42 - all right
26:46 - and we can keep this actually we want
26:49 - that's fine just reset them just in case
26:53 - okay so because you can make him like
26:55 - turn around talking
26:57 - left and right so it's always good to
26:59 - have it the same so that you can retest
27:01 - it
27:01 - you don't want to start from the
27:02 - beginning okay
27:04 - so this is done
27:06 - [Music]
27:08 - um for now so purple will talk later
27:11 - but let's go to blue so
27:15 - similarly for blue
27:18 - we have the similar code let's grab
27:20 - purple's code let's
27:22 - move it to blue and then we'll grab the
27:26 - same thing move it to gray
27:28 - let's do that purple blue
27:32 - and great okay so next let's we'll come
27:35 - to
27:36 - first so blue similar
27:40 - okay i don't think blue have more than
27:41 - one costume so we don't really need but
27:44 - it's fine to put that no harm
27:47 - okay click graphical effect i don't
27:50 - think
27:51 - we need that we may not need that well
27:53 - we're probably good to have
27:55 - in case you know blue get killed later
27:57 - on or something
27:59 - uh with the hope uh with the portal and
28:01 - then final quarter right they sucked it
28:03 - yeah yeah
28:04 - right maybe blue will be part of that
28:05 - don't remember so yeah let's keep it
28:08 - okay let's keep that let's keep this
28:11 - this position with the change
28:14 - right and then blue house blue looking
28:17 - like
28:17 - he's pointing to the right side right so
28:20 - let's point into
28:21 - 90. okay
28:25 - [Music]
28:26 - so similarly we'll use the same thing
28:30 - about this part so blue should be going
28:33 - to the back layer
28:34 - send it back on the table we'll take
28:37 - this
28:38 - this here okay so we are
28:42 - good with that so far okay so blue is
28:45 - here
28:46 - and then what else we have gray like
28:49 - gray so let's take the same color as
28:53 - multi-gray oh i think we're ready
28:57 - so clear i have to go okay custom one
29:00 - that's fine
29:01 - so gray is what it is right here so
29:04 - we'll
29:04 - move to this position negative nine is
29:08 - good
29:10 - throw this away duplicate this one
29:14 - throw this away go to the front layer
29:19 - okay this is good so blue should be
29:22 - back layer okay this guy should be front
29:24 - layer bubbles from there
29:27 - okay looks okay so for gray he's gonna
29:30 - be the one who's getting bowled off
29:32 - right
29:32 - so we need to say
29:38 - when i receive vote
29:41 - uh finished voting okay
29:45 - so uh okay before actually i have a if
29:49 - condition because
29:50 - you know the impossible was randomly
29:52 - picked but um
29:54 - so we don't so you have to check it but
29:58 - since we we know it's always him so it
30:01 - might not need it but i had it before
30:04 - so we'll just keep it so let's
30:07 - go to variable
30:08 - [Music]
30:10 - uh imposter
30:14 - it's great so since we're setting grade
30:16 - right in the
30:17 - in here right then on the table right
30:21 - was selling crazy imposter
30:22 - right so it was great then you say
30:29 - or say something say
30:32 - no no
30:36 - [Music]
30:48 - gonna broadcast a message here
30:53 - okay i'm gonna do a broadcast and wait
30:57 - i think either one is fine we don't
30:59 - watch i don't think it matters
31:02 - okay so we'll say new message
31:06 - say see ya so this is for the uh
31:11 - for the for the uh scion to talk back
31:14 - so let's go back to cyan now
31:23 - okay so we'll coat it in the bottom here
31:28 - see ya okay let me zoom in a little bit
31:33 - so let's say take a look say here
31:37 - and we're going to use the join to get
31:39 - the variable name
31:42 - okay let's see put a module in here
31:45 - i think you guys played one of the uh
31:47 - question of the week right we said last
31:49 - time
31:49 - my apple banana how the joint looks
31:51 - right so
31:53 - this is basically this one joining this
31:55 - one putting it together
31:56 - plus another one here so let's say c
32:00 - yeah comma you can put a space
32:04 - so you want to join this variable
32:07 - imposter so impossible variable have
32:10 - what you actually have the word gray
32:12 - right in here right so
32:13 - we'll do that and then we say
32:18 - put a space here
32:23 - okay so put that
32:27 - so see a great space imposter okay
32:32 - so that's how it would look like so
32:36 - after this what we're going to do is
32:40 - we're going to test it once so we don't
32:42 - actually have to go from the beginning
32:44 - so just kind of click on this
32:48 - as you can see all the all the sprites
32:50 - are here
32:52 - okay that is incorrect since we did not
32:55 - click the start flag so this guy had
32:57 - this
32:58 - this icon right let's just click the
32:59 - start black once
33:01 - okay and then stop and that won't click
33:04 - on this
33:05 - [Music]
33:07 - so you see when you click on this you
33:09 - see how how the door is here so yeah
33:12 - so what we can do is this well to make
33:15 - sure that
33:16 - hides it away so let's just put just for
33:19 - now let's put this here
33:22 - okay and you don't really need it but
33:24 - since we we don't want to go from the
33:25 - beginning
33:26 - so we're going to kind of hide them like
33:27 - this so and
33:29 - let's put this also
33:33 - let's say drop 5 will hide this one
33:36 - because we're not using him
33:38 - right okay and then
33:42 - the door let's just say back your fiber
33:44 - let's hide the door
33:46 - for now okay so that way
33:49 - you know we can test it without the goal
33:50 - from the beginning
33:53 - and this one we have back up five high
33:56 - okay
33:57 - good so let's run it again
34:00 - right okay i'll stop it
34:04 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
34:05 - click on this so you can see it hide
34:08 - everything and this one the list
34:10 - shows up and then say no uh
34:13 - so we're still missing something okay we
34:15 - need this imposter
34:17 - text right okay that's what we're
34:19 - missing
34:20 - okay let's go to the imposter text so
34:27 - you can control here so in the beginning
34:30 - we'll hide it
34:32 - okay and then
34:35 - when we get to uh backdrop number five
34:37 - we want to show it right
34:39 - so backdrop number five
34:43 - we're gonna make it go to this position
34:47 - where i see right now okay that's the
34:50 - emergence that's too high
34:52 - let's go to negative
34:57 - [Music]
35:00 - 18. and then say 150.
35:07 - and we want to use this costume imposter
35:11 - okay so we have to say switch to
35:15 - custom number one
35:18 - and then we'll say show
35:21 - [Music]
35:23 - okay now let's see how
35:26 - so we are going to click on this again
35:31 - so oh that's good so no no no
35:34 - it's not b so we'll still have some
35:36 - problem right so this
35:38 - variable is not showing
35:41 - the variable imposter it's not showing
35:44 - up so we need to
35:45 - make sure that show up when it's stage
35:47 - five i don't know when
35:49 - let's see i think it's at the table
35:52 - right so we'll show the list
35:57 - and then we have something like finished
35:59 - voting or something right
36:01 - we can use that okay let's
36:04 - do this in the beginning we'll say
36:07 - behind this hidey list also
36:11 - and hide the
36:14 - variable imposter okay
36:18 - when actually wait
36:20 - [Music]
36:23 - when we back to backdrop five we'll show
36:26 - it
36:27 - so show the this and
36:30 - the imposter how about that okay all
36:33 - right
36:34 - let's try it again so let's say this is
36:37 - high oops doesn't matter we'll
36:40 - get reset so let's say we we did not
36:43 - have this
36:44 - right and let's see what happened
36:48 - okay background five you see
36:54 - so so when it goes to backdrop five
36:57 - right
36:57 - let's see i think i have one mistake
37:00 - here
37:00 - so we we we need to clear this right in
37:03 - the beginning so whether
37:05 - say set
37:08 - okay enclosure to
37:12 - blank okay so now should be better
37:16 - so now let's try
37:21 - okay this will not clear because it
37:22 - doesn't stop right
37:24 - so yeah and then click start first
37:28 - so let's click start okay
37:31 - i'm gonna go here and hit background
37:33 - five
37:34 - so wait three seconds you can't pick say
37:37 - great
37:38 - no it's not me right okay
37:41 - so please say see ya
37:45 - okay
37:48 - so cyan the science say something
37:54 - okay let's try again
38:04 - okay how come that's so fast oh
38:08 - sorry put on the wrong spot
38:13 - okay okay now it's correct
38:16 - okay let's try it okay
38:20 - so no it's not me see a
38:23 - great imposter okay good so we're good
38:25 - here
38:27 - so we are going to stop right here uh
38:30 - the video is not too long
38:31 - so next we are going to kick him out on
38:35 - the space
38:35 - gonna make him kind of turn turn turn
38:38 - and then
38:38 - we will be done after that will actually
38:41 - will
38:42 - show the uh you know the uh
38:45 - this costume oops not this one i think
38:48 - it was this one so it will show this
38:50 - that you know he's
38:52 - flying through space and then we're
38:54 - gonna continue the other one
38:56 - all right okay so thanks uh for watching
38:59 - please like
39:00 - share and subscribe to our channel and
39:02 - comment down
39:04 - below you know if you have any questions
39:08 - all right
39:08 - see you guys next time bye
39:15 - [Music]
39:22 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys and welcome back to fitzcalling playground so today we are going to continue with this series um the uh among us animation this is part four so um let's just go over what we had last time we did the club we did the uh the shooting with the laser gun the infinity garnets right so now we can work on the lightsaber and then also we'll finish the stage one to stage three we can work on stage four so as you can see these are the the code for the uh the cyan sprite so far so if you miss anything you can kind of pause it and kind of take a look okay and the manga sprite this is the uh the one that they have multiple costumes that you could like kill them and then door here okay orange i don't think we have anything i don't think any of these have anything i don't think so and they might have some like just moving here and there but nothing much uh the sonic power this is that then i think we have the portal this is how you go into the portal from stage to stage this is the club we have that call ready the gauntlet so this is uh the code for number three on it and then we don't have this i don't think so nope not yet not yet and we have the story continue this is the beginning when we switching the the uh when the starting the episode and then the power one yeah we have this when we at stage four will hide it okay that's about it okay and then we have some code in the background okay so so let me take this out so that the sound will not come you know a little bit better while we're testing okay all right um okay so we'll start with the cyan i think i want to get to the full stage we need to put them at some position right so what we're going to do is we're going to go to the fourth stage i mean you can select the stage 4 here and then just kind of you want to put them at whatever stage you want so like let's say you want him to be on this side or this side doesn't matter um i think on my code i had it on this side so we'll just keep it like that for now okay we just duplicate this call this uh stage four right back grab four we'll put him at negative 192 98 is fine then we have 198 here on this one and then with the mixture we'll point in direction 90 because we want to face the right side and then switch costs to one and show okay so it'll be somewhere here okay and then i'm going to go to the uh the among the sprite which is this one so for my manga sprite and i had on him on this side so we'll keep it on this side so as you can see the door can't come up because i push the uh i push to start and then i switch it to that one so the door shouldn't be here for stage four so don't worry about that when we run the code will be fixed so let's duplicate this let's put this for stage four we kind of have it nicely organized so that way you know you kind of know where things are so what i'm at this point is fine and that's fine so hope he's somewhere on the right here okay and then he's facing this side so negative 90 meaning he's facing this side finn's left so what we're going to do next is uh work on the uh the lightsaber okay so the lightsaber has old cold i think the lightsaber and the rings always work on both so the ring is kind of like a circle kind of thing of blue thing okay so we're gonna make that kind of next to a lifesaver so um what we want to do is uh when start okay event when green flag is start screen file is clicked so what we want to do is we want to hide it in the beginning we don't want to show that the sword right and what we want to i'm going to grab a forever loop here and motion we'll say go to cyan okay and then point in direction just like how we did before right in direction of the cyan character okay so we'll take this take this put here select cyan and back and then select direction okay and then we'll grab some if an else statement uh basically we're trying to match the sword chart on his hand so you can't move it so i already did it so i know the coordinates for it so what we'll do is we're going to grab the equal here nope sorry great okay so we are going to take this so you remember we were talking about the direction right it was um sorry stop so uh when we say it's a greater than zero meaning is actually pointing to the right then what we want to do is we want to move the sort somewhere to the right here right okay so you have to say set set x duplicate this say cyan exposition uh and then a weather add some value because this kind of would have moved into a little bit further because if you put it just exhale be in the middle of your stomach so that doesn't look good over 75 push it out a little bit okay and then we'll duplicate this and what we want to do is on the other side we're going to push it to negative 75. okay and then we want to set the y sorry now we'll set the y set y outside here and then we're going to use the inside x position we'll use the y position and then we'll move it up a little bit so i'm going to say plus 25 move the y position okay all right so so if i click on this so let me move him over here if i click on this guy i'm gonna go back to my lightsaber you don't have to run the whole call again so what you do is hey where's the code oops that was my mistake click on the wrong sprite when i was coding so we're going gonna just drag this all the way put it on this guy we're gonna go here okay instead of d3 so we're gonna clean up the code in the ring sorry about that that was my mistake drop this okay should be in this site saver so we're working on the lightsaber at the moment okay and then we are going to use event when the number four key is pressed we want to show this guy and it is not in progress okay if nothing is not talking or something like that so grab this over here and then operator not and then we use the equal variable outlook in progress not yes meaning no okay and we're gonna say go to front layer show okay we're gonna have to broadcast a message here say saber spin so this will spin the saber uh wait for two seconds and then hi okay so let's just try it out so when we run it okay we're gonna push four so you can see that it actually here right it's in the side so you see if i'm on the right side on the left side right uh right side the saw is facing left when i'm on the on the on this side the soil is facing the other way okay so the light saber is working so what we want to do is we're going to put the little ring around the right lightsaber uh we're gonna go back to the ring the cover the ring so similarly you know like the cold for the uh for the sword so we want to do something similar but we will not be using this cyan we're gonna have to look at the position of the lightsaber so what we can do is take this code drag it to the ring okay so now the ring has this code so what we want to do is we want to go to the lifesaver instead okay and then you have to use the direction of the lifesaver okay and then same thing right the lightsaber is greater than zero okay the direction then we would put the tens in lifesaver here so make sure you change all of them okay here's a plus 10 and this i will do a lifesaver minus 10. okay and then we want to move it up a little bit so lifesaver 25 is good okay and this one make sure you select the y position okay sometimes when you copy over this thing get messed up and it changes the the code a bit so so this is so far that so this part is done so zoom out a little bit we'll the effect of a spin right so but before that let's grab the uh one grab another stop when it's like flap is clicked what we want to do is we're gonna say clear the graphics effect then say hi and then say forever okay we are going to change the you know we're going to change the uh the little bit on the on the ring so some effect but let's just use the fish eye okay okay by 50 and then we're gonna wait zero one so we're gonna make it pretty fast okay like one tenth number one ten maybe 100 of a second here i guess you can try different way see which one looks better for you so let me just i think this is what i had earlier so let me just try like this first see how it looks if we need to change it we can change it so put it back next 50 so positive 50 other 50 negative 50 negative 50 okay so let's see how it actually looks so you see that so when it runs so you see how it kind of like this blinking kind of thing so that's kind of what we want okay all right so when we receive we remember we have a saber spin right so we're gonna call this for this guy so when we receive saber spin uh you're gonna make it go to the front layer so in front of the sword say show and then wait uh two seconds for it to show up and then we'll hide it hide the ring okay so let's test it out so now when we save number four you can see it's kind of like like that so like that so as you can see the among the sky is not dying right when we do the sword so what a call that so let's stop here and then go to the uh among us sprite what we need to do is kind of let's duplicate this one actually so instead of club uh select saber spin and now we'll say we're touching the rain actually so basically touching this ring what we want to do is um yeah repeat 205 is fine uh we can select a different effect like pixelated and let's try for five not completely gone right uh and then this one same thing so if it actually kill this one then it will open the door allows you to open the door open the portal let's just try it out so number four so you see how it pixelated it kind of died you can go into the door right so that's what we want to do so you can see and then it kind of got to kill him okay all right so this is working fine okay uh right now we're gonna call for backdrop number five which is like the group of uh among us kind of discussion in the uh voting right that's what we had in the beginning i mean on my um animation so we'll do that so go to here and we can just duplicate number four push it to number five so we want to kind of put him at this position so i had the coordinates already so i will just say 989 i mean it is 68 negative 68 and negative 10 so it will be somewhere like right here and then we're gonna put a table here and then put the other guys around and we're gonna face not even being put into the right okay and one thing is i want to make him to go to the back layer because he's in the back of the other guys right so let's put him in the back layer okay so in stage five you'll be at this position so same thing you know for other sprite that you have the code for right so stage five where to do something as well here okay we might not need to do anything with this among us i don't think stage five we're killing any of the manga so we might not need that so it'll be automatically high so what we need to do is we're gonna create the table right so the table let's select this first costume and then we're gonna have to put the among us uh guys around it so let's let's just hide this one for now so hide this one and we're going to hide this one so we'll get a little more space let's put on stage five here just see how it looks and we are going to put the table and let's see how that looks so in in stage five so you want to test something right so what you can do is you don't actually have to do all of them to to start from the beginning to the end right to test uh what you can do is go to your backdrop right and then you just say switch to say backdrop stage five so when you do that they will have all the code put it in place so when i hit this it actually runs the code for stage five here right so here's right here so what we see you see the tables coming we'll put some code for the table as well so the table i just showed it right so where to say you know like in the beginning of the table shouldn't show right only at stage five will show so let's go in the beginning first when green flag is clicked so we want to move the table is not broken like the table and then we want to say i think the dialogue setting i don't know where i have that about setting maybe here okay so here at this stage we want to um let's see the setting okay the dialog settings already know here so i think we do it with that so we don't need anything like that here says let's put them at this position or whatever position you like just grab that put it here and then we will say hi so high this so this in the beginning will high and then a stage five one one two one show it right so let's say switch back to stage five uh what we want to do is we're going to set this dialogue to yes i think that is actually talking so we don't want the uh the sign guy to attack them okay set dialog in progress say yes okay and then we're gonna show this variable i think the we had among us like that they choose thing like who was the uh the imposter i think uh so we'll put it somewhere here so we use that i think in the the first uh episode you actually use that later on and use the gold team so we'll just keep it the same okay and then uh we have a list so we want to show the list the name list on the side i think i have prepopulated this list with this and i think before actually we were going to pick a random but since we are going right now we are going to just make the gray guy to fly in space so what we're going to do is it's going to be always great okay so anyway we'll show this list so you say show if let's say the list is high you want to show it okay so we can say show this so when the stage file will show the list and then we'll say and then um we'll have to show the uh show this uh table right so what does it look show table and then we have to broadcast a message say vote so we're gonna vote here for this thing okay so when i receive vote um just gonna wait for a couple of seconds let's say three seconds it's trying to make it look like it's everybody's voting and then we have to say set so set the imposter i mean before actually we i actually had that pick a item you can say pick an item like i said right create an item and you can say that random right uh from this list right let's say two to six or something like that that's initially what the code has but since we have the uh the animation saying the great fly out right so we're not gonna do that so no need to do that so we're just gonna hot code this to gray so hardcode meaning you just put the same thing over and over again that's what we call hard code okay and then we're gonna broadcast another message we're gonna save new message say vote finish finish poll or whatever finish vote reporting okay all right stop this so that's done okay now let's call the uh the among us uh the brown one we'll put them you see when i click it it's over here so what we're going to do is let's finish up the table with all the uh among us sprite right so we'll say custom number one so brown one custom number one is this because number two is kind of is mad or something i just created that just draw a little you know draw a little squiggly line red squiggly line okay i group them together so so we're gonna stay with the first one and then we say clear graphic effect just in case you know they don't they destroy the uh the brown white so stage i mean episode three so we need to make sure that we have the clear graphics effect and then position we'll just keep it at this position and then we'll say hi so we'll hide in the beginning okay and then you know we have a backdrop five right just like how we did for the other one so i say when it's backdrop number five we wanna go to the front layer since he is like right here right he's right here so one making the front layer of in front of the cyan guy so say go here go to front layer and then show okay so we're done with him for now we'll buy to go back to him later to do some more code let's go to the green one so the green one is like somewhere here as you can see right okay so the green one same thing let's do one green flag click i don't know why i have the set rotation style on the green one not sure why i think maybe it's needed because he's spitting later on or something uh so i think uh after spinning right so i don't want him to spin again so that's why what this set rotation style left and right on number uh on backdrop on the under on the beginning right okay so just keep it like that okay and then we have switch to custom number one in the beginning so green as what so the other one is just put two water chocolate on him just draw the little uh you know the uh oval kind of thing and then it's like use the this tool so draw a circle and use this tool to reshape to the pull up to drop creative droplets okay so he's kind of scared so next is i want to clear the graphics effect and then we are going to put him at this whatever position that he is in right now and then we want him to point to the left side so negative 90 and then we'll hide them in the beginning okay and then when it hit backdrop five will show so we'll put back up number five uh what we want to do we want we want to put it at the same position just in case you know later on we these guys runs around we want to put them back in the same position right so so that way you know when you're testing you can just click on like a switch icon switch i mean switch the like this and then it will run the same code so it's always good to put the same position that you want okay and we also want him to go to the back layer actually for this guy because sense he's actually over here on this side we're here see if he is in the front there he'll be on the thunder table so we want to make sure that he goes to the back layer okay and then we'll say show okay so so far that's what we have okay so after green will work on purple so similarly purple also have the similar code let's just drag this to purple and let's drag this to purple okay let's fix it so purple will put at the different position um so i think where's purple propose this one okay so negative 90. so this is good so we'll put a different position for him okay so but same one same thing here and then we have the custom one we have to clear the graphics effect put him at this position pointing negative 90 meaning left side and then high him okay and then uh at the backdrop number five we can put the similar thing here just in case we need to reuse it later and then we want to make them go to the front layer actually purple's in the front all right and we can keep this actually we want that's fine just reset them just in case okay so because you can make him like turn around talking left and right so it's always good to have it the same so that you can retest it you don't want to start from the beginning okay so this is done um for now so purple will talk later but let's go to blue so similarly for blue we have the similar code let's grab purple's code let's move it to blue and then we'll grab the same thing move it to gray let's do that purple blue and great okay so next let's we'll come to first so blue similar okay i don't think blue have more than one costume so we don't really need but it's fine to put that no harm okay click graphical effect i don't think we need that we may not need that well we're probably good to have in case you know blue get killed later on or something uh with the hope uh with the portal and then final quarter right they sucked it yeah yeah right maybe blue will be part of that don't remember so yeah let's keep it okay let's keep that let's keep this this position with the change right and then blue house blue looking like he's pointing to the right side right so let's point into 90. okay so similarly we'll use the same thing about this part so blue should be going to the back layer send it back on the table we'll take this this here okay so we are good with that so far okay so blue is here and then what else we have gray like gray so let's take the same color as multigray oh i think we're ready so clear i have to go okay custom one that's fine so gray is what it is right here so we'll move to this position negative nine is good throw this away duplicate this one throw this away go to the front layer okay this is good so blue should be back layer okay this guy should be front layer bubbles from there okay looks okay so for gray he's gonna be the one who's getting bowled off right so we need to say when i receive vote uh finished voting okay so uh okay before actually i have a if condition because you know the impossible was randomly picked but um so we don't so you have to check it but since we we know it's always him so it might not need it but i had it before so we'll just keep it so let's go to variable uh imposter it's great so since we're setting grade right in the in here right then on the table right was selling crazy imposter right so it was great then you say or say something say no no gonna broadcast a message here okay i'm gonna do a broadcast and wait i think either one is fine we don't watch i don't think it matters okay so we'll say new message say see ya so this is for the uh for the for the uh scion to talk back so let's go back to cyan now okay so we'll coat it in the bottom here see ya okay let me zoom in a little bit so let's say take a look say here and we're going to use the join to get the variable name okay let's see put a module in here i think you guys played one of the uh question of the week right we said last time my apple banana how the joint looks right so this is basically this one joining this one putting it together plus another one here so let's say c yeah comma you can put a space so you want to join this variable imposter so impossible variable have what you actually have the word gray right in here right so we'll do that and then we say put a space here okay so put that so see a great space imposter okay so that's how it would look like so after this what we're going to do is we're going to test it once so we don't actually have to go from the beginning so just kind of click on this as you can see all the all the sprites are here okay that is incorrect since we did not click the start flag so this guy had this this icon right let's just click the start black once okay and then stop and that won't click on this so you see when you click on this you see how how the door is here so yeah so what we can do is this well to make sure that hides it away so let's just put just for now let's put this here okay and you don't really need it but since we we don't want to go from the beginning so we're going to kind of hide them like this so and let's put this also let's say drop 5 will hide this one because we're not using him right okay and then the door let's just say back your fiber let's hide the door for now okay so that way you know we can test it without the goal from the beginning and this one we have back up five high okay good so let's run it again right okay i'll stop it what i'm going to do is i'm going to click on this so you can see it hide everything and this one the list shows up and then say no uh so we're still missing something okay we need this imposter text right okay that's what we're missing okay let's go to the imposter text so you can control here so in the beginning we'll hide it okay and then when we get to uh backdrop number five we want to show it right so backdrop number five we're gonna make it go to this position where i see right now okay that's the emergence that's too high let's go to negative 18. and then say 150. and we want to use this costume imposter okay so we have to say switch to custom number one and then we'll say show okay now let's see how so we are going to click on this again so oh that's good so no no no it's not b so we'll still have some problem right so this variable is not showing the variable imposter it's not showing up so we need to make sure that show up when it's stage five i don't know when let's see i think it's at the table right so we'll show the list and then we have something like finished voting or something right we can use that okay let's do this in the beginning we'll say behind this hidey list also and hide the variable imposter okay when actually wait when we back to backdrop five we'll show it so show the this and the imposter how about that okay all right let's try it again so let's say this is high oops doesn't matter we'll get reset so let's say we we did not have this right and let's see what happened okay background five you see so so when it goes to backdrop five right let's see i think i have one mistake here so we we we need to clear this right in the beginning so whether say set okay enclosure to blank okay so now should be better so now let's try okay this will not clear because it doesn't stop right so yeah and then click start first so let's click start okay i'm gonna go here and hit background five so wait three seconds you can't pick say great no it's not me right okay so please say see ya okay so cyan the science say something okay let's try again okay how come that's so fast oh sorry put on the wrong spot okay okay now it's correct okay let's try it okay so no it's not me see a great imposter okay good so we're good here so we are going to stop right here uh the video is not too long so next we are going to kick him out on the space gonna make him kind of turn turn turn and then we will be done after that will actually will show the uh you know the uh this costume oops not this one i think it was this one so it will show this that you know he's flying through space and then we're gonna continue the other one all right okay so thanks uh for watching please like share and subscribe to our
