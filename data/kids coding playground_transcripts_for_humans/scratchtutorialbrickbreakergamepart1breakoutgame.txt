00:01 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to kiss
00:11 - coding playground today we'll be working
00:14 - on a new game called break breakers the
00:18 - skin basically we want to balance the
00:20 - paw of the paddle to break the breaks
00:22 - and then if you get the star as a bonus
00:26 - point you don't have to get them one saw
00:29 - the brakes are gone the next stage will
00:33 - come on but before we do that where they
00:35 - get the basic working first just getting
00:38 - the breaks the ball and the paddle
00:41 - walking first later on we'll work on the
00:44 - star when I was a kid I remember I play
00:49 - this game called break out so break out
00:55 - is like game that I used to play you
00:59 - bounce a ball up and then you break the
01:01 - break so this is way similar to a
01:03 - breakout so basically we there's some
01:07 - breaks on the top of the stage we want
01:09 - to hit it with a baseball and bounce it
01:12 - off and hit the breaks ones of the
01:15 - player breaks all the breaks then the
01:17 - player wins the game later on we'll add
01:20 - that the star for the bonus this is
01:23 - still actually a push start here that's
01:25 - wrong so the star for the bonus and keep
01:28 - the game going and continue with the
01:30 - next stage so let's get the basic of the
01:34 - game working first okay so let me go
01:37 - over here to kind of show you how the
01:40 - game looks like okay so let me start the
01:45 - game as you can see right on the screen
01:49 - and we want to break as much breaks as
01:52 - possible once we bring a loss I did
01:56 - break on a break but as you can see
01:58 - there's a number of breaks left here and
02:01 - total score that I have basically have
02:04 - to break all the breaks get the star and
02:07 - then if I don't get a star that's fine
02:10 - but if I break all the breaks it will go
02:12 - to the next level but before that we'll
02:14 - get the regular bar and the power
02:18 - the brakes working force then we can
02:21 - stop having the brakes
02:23 - later on I'm in the stall later on okay
02:28 - let's begin the lesson or create a new
02:31 - project okay
02:35 - we have the new project created we need
02:38 - to find a background we can either draw
02:41 - a background or such a background here
02:45 - before MIT would I be the first Kim I
02:47 - did draw the background for this time
02:50 - maybe we can just pick one of the
02:52 - background so I love it easier we can
02:54 - either use the sky or city or something
02:58 - like that so let's try this one
03:01 - this might look good let's delete the
03:03 - cat what we need to do is we are going
03:08 - to have to draw out brakes so there's a
03:12 - paint and your sprite okay here we'll
03:17 - mix our own brakes but they use this
03:19 - rectangular shape we can use we're going
03:24 - to have the power line
03:27 - okay so let's draw brakes first and
03:29 - we'll change the color in a bit
03:31 - so which our little break here so as you
03:35 - can see this is blue that's not kind of
03:37 - not what we wanted if I want to bring
03:39 - out red let me get up smaller can zoom
03:43 - in a little bit so we can put it in the
03:47 - center here they're a little smaller
03:51 - okay
03:53 - what we do whether increase this to one
03:57 - or two if you like doesn't matter maybe
03:59 - three just this is like outer color so
04:05 - we can select a different color for the
04:08 - feel so let's select this is inside
04:12 - we'll select some color here
04:19 - maybe here and then this is a and then
04:24 - this is looks okay looks okay right the
04:27 - brakes looks good and then the outer one
04:30 - we can select a darker red maybe like
04:38 - this so you can see right there's a
04:41 - thicker out of red I'm not sure the back
04:45 - background was good let's see
04:50 - still with a lighter background let's
04:52 - use a blue sky blue sky maybe better or
04:58 - you can paint your own let me remove the
05:02 - other one so let's delete this and will
05:07 - delete this so we'll use a blue sky blue
05:09 - sky looks good
05:10 - no and see the another breaks so now we
05:16 - are done with that break so all we need
05:19 - to do next we need to add the baseball
05:26 - okay you get the baseball okay so with
05:32 - the breaks with a baseball then we need
05:35 - the paddle okay I was using a button do
05:45 - we actually have a paddle I see yeah we
05:48 - do have a paddle similar to the beach
05:51 - all right yeah we're getting use there
05:53 - so the button doesn't really matter
05:55 - let's just use the paddle let's try with
05:58 - a pair of this time so we have the ball
06:00 - without their great and we have that
06:03 - paddle all right what we do is we start
06:08 - to coat the baseball okay before we move
06:14 - on I like you guys to please like share
06:19 - and subscribe to our channel and if you
06:22 - know any friend that would like to learn
06:25 - about scratch please forward our
06:27 - channels to them alright so let's begin
06:29 - now
06:29 - today okay I will walk on the baseball
06:34 - first okay
06:37 - make sure when a baseball we're gonna
06:39 - move this adjust this around a little
06:40 - bit let's go to the co what we need is
06:45 - always when they suddenly cold start
06:47 - when Greek life is quick that means you
06:50 - know when you click on this green flag
06:52 - this code executes okay we also need a
06:56 - variable actually now we can rename this
06:58 - to score or can create new one
07:02 - as a matter in the beginning we also
07:05 - also want us to reset the score 2-0 so
07:08 - that you know when we when we begin the
07:10 - game we always preset the score then we
07:13 - also want to resize the baseball bit and
07:16 - then the baseball too big to it 50% then
07:21 - we have to say point in directions of
07:26 - what we go into this point direction
07:28 - zero meaning the baseball gonna point
07:31 - upwards so the baseball fly up okay then
07:35 - we say okay let's move on that is your
07:37 - zero position so this will be dead
07:41 - center and here somewhere
07:43 - then we say we're gonna use a control
07:48 - let's repeat ten time we'll move five
07:54 - step so that's total is 50 step so
07:57 - basically the ball will move up when the
08:01 - game stopped or move up and bounce off
08:03 - and then so that gives a play a little
08:05 - bit more time to adjust the paddle okay
08:10 - after that we are going to have this
08:13 - repeat until loop so we're gonna make it
08:17 - really simple for us to make sure that
08:20 - we get the basic of the game first then
08:22 - go in Krita will change it in a bit so
08:25 - here what we are going to do is we are
08:28 - going to check if the score so basically
08:31 - if the score is equal to a hundred when
08:33 - we get a hundred points for the gamble
08:36 - in okay so 100
08:41 - that so I'll repeat until the scores 100
08:44 - what is the boss going to do so whatever
08:46 - before hundred this is what it's going
08:49 - to do in here we'll say if on edge
08:54 - bounce okay and then we will put move
08:59 - ten step so basically this ball when I
09:02 - hit the edge okay just bounce around and
09:06 - then we need an if statement here okay
09:12 - whoa check the y position of the ball so
09:18 - Y position is basically you know where
09:20 - the ball is at so let's let's say now
09:23 - right now that you see the pores at 5959
09:26 - right so this is the Y position what we
09:29 - need to check here before it's like
09:31 - somewhere below here I'd like 130 or 160
09:35 - or whatever it is then we want to say
09:37 - the game is ended right we don't want to
09:40 - fall the drop down basically we want to
09:42 - keep the paddle up keep the ball up as
09:45 - much as possible if the balls drop down
09:48 - then we lose the game
09:50 - okay let's go back to the ball I was
09:52 - just slightly click on the panel what we
09:56 - need to do is so we're gonna check this
10:00 - X Y position where the boys at use this
10:06 - operator sold on uses less then go back
10:12 - to the same thing in motion so Y
10:20 - position if the y position is less than
10:23 - let's say 160 somewhere down the bottom
10:28 - that will gone
10:29 - what casts the events saying that you
10:33 - know the agam is over so what guess the
10:36 - new message see came over
10:43 - else more podcasts the message that the
10:48 - message you win you won okay all right
11:00 - so we have the baseball so far so
11:04 - basically this is the code at the
11:05 - baseball just kind of move around the
11:08 - screen and it bounced off the edges okay
11:13 - so next we will also need someone or
11:17 - cohere
11:22 - okay so need the when the message flag
11:27 - when it's clay so when the game is over
11:31 - what we need to do is with a stop not a
11:34 - scrip in the sprite basically stopping
11:39 - anything else so that we don't want the
11:41 - ball to keep on using like so stop our
11:44 - script in the sprite and we will say
11:52 - game over and then we can play some
11:58 - sound okay can i play this so this is a
12:10 - sound that we will play when the game is
12:12 - over go back to sound okay and then we
12:21 - go and stop everything all right so so
12:26 - far with us what we have then we have to
12:30 - catch to data you can as well okay all
12:37 - right so we have this other event
12:48 - right if the players win maybe I should
12:53 - change to win so doesn't matter you
13:02 - can't change this out so you went okay
13:05 - okay all right so this part is also we
13:10 - want to do something similar we also
13:12 - wanted to stop on the script and the
13:18 - sprite then we'll similar to this when
13:24 - we're singing over I came over right
13:26 - we're going to say okay and then we have
13:36 - a stop ball as well okay so this is
13:39 - these two code really similar one it's
13:41 - not game over and one is to play away so
13:44 - we're is similar so I just say this
13:47 - hopefully have to save and what they
13:50 - call this okay maybe I have to call
13:56 - break with the two because I have okay
14:01 - okay so far we got the baseball
14:05 - we got the baseball coach somewhat
14:09 - working look into the paddle if you want
14:14 - to test your game you can click on this
14:16 - as you can see the ball gonna bounce it
14:19 - off the edge right bounce it up and then
14:22 - down right we haven't work on the paddle
14:24 - you see you have a bouncing off the
14:26 - paddle all the breaks so let the walk on
14:29 - the paddle and the breaks
14:30 - next we will walk on the paddle so
14:36 - paddle same thing we'll have to use this
14:39 - maybe zoom in a little bit we can move
14:44 - the paddle anywhere we want maybe
14:46 - somewhere here so what you can do is you
14:51 - can set the Y at this position I think
14:56 - this is about right let's do
14:59 - 137 138 maybe yay and then we'll set the
15:06 - size I think the size looks okay we
15:09 - don't really ever set the size then
15:10 - we'll leave it then what to use this
15:14 - control forever so what we want to do is
15:19 - we want to make the paddle kind of
15:20 - follow the mouse whenever we move the
15:22 - mouse side-to-side a paddle kind of
15:24 - follow us around so what we need to do
15:28 - it we need to set the eggs so set X 2
15:36 - will go sensing Mouse eggs and then we
15:47 - need an if statement here so what we
15:51 - need to check is make sure if the if the
15:54 - baseball hit this paddle we want to
15:56 - bounce it off okay well okay we'll go
16:02 - back to sensing you remember just
16:03 - sensing this always there's something
16:06 - there to test of this something Kalai so
16:10 - we will check them as touching the
16:12 - baseball what we're going to do is we've
16:16 - got vehicle to make the baseball bounce
16:18 - so since we're here in this paddle we
16:20 - cannot make him bounce right what we
16:24 - need to do is we need to make a new
16:26 - message say bounce so this will call the
16:32 - message balance of broadcast a message
16:34 - bouncing and if the baseball received a
16:36 - message bounce or bounce it off we
16:39 - haven't worked on that yet that will
16:42 - then we want to put a sound okay we do
16:48 - have a sound already here okay great
16:50 - point okay we will say now start a sound
16:56 - okay so it uses so there's two things
17:00 - here this one is until done and this so
17:03 - we use this it doesn't kind of wait if
17:06 - you use until done then your the way
17:07 - into this music is done Daniel
17:10 - so we don't want to wait actually so we
17:13 - will just use stop the sample and also
17:18 - if we receive the message game over
17:23 - so what we also want to do is we want to
17:26 - stop are the scrip and sprite we don't
17:29 - want to stop all because we still want
17:30 - to let the let the baseball say yeah you
17:36 - win no you lose right so that's why we
17:38 - don't want to do that we want to just
17:40 - simply stop the scrip is a little one
17:42 - anything to run here all here so this
17:46 - one so that's what we need so so far we
17:50 - have this someone came over we want to
17:52 - stop the script is it with scrapping a
17:54 - script not make him follow not making a
17:57 - profile miles anymore
17:59 - okay let's test it a little bit real
18:02 - quick so as you can see my paddle is
18:05 - kind of moving with my mouse but it's
18:07 - not bouncing off the baseball yet what
18:10 - we need to do is we have the core
18:13 - already right what chess right so we
18:15 - need to go to the baseball to work on
18:17 - that okay so in the baseball with this
18:26 - code you look it up
18:28 - we are going to add one when I receive
18:33 - bounce okay
18:39 - I'm going to say turn let's do this turn
18:46 - but we can do so Oh changing later on
18:48 - too little bit better for for now we'll
18:51 - use it like this we're gonna use it
18:56 - random
18:57 - 150 to 210 degree okay and then we say
19:06 - move 30 steps or 1000 become I mean the
19:11 - mall but when the ball hits some it said
19:14 - something or more would faster so 30
19:16 - speed
19:18 - imadori step okay and then we need
19:26 - something similar so for the brakes I
19:30 - mean for the brake later we'll walk on
19:33 - close but now let's just test it out
19:35 - first so as you can see the ball is
19:38 - bouncing off the panel right but it's
19:44 - not hitting the brakes yet so we'll need
19:47 - diameter so and also the ball hits the
19:50 - bottom this game over and plays that
19:52 - Elian quick same way just that one we
19:54 - did here okay next we'll walk on the
20:02 - brakes now oh they're breaking and we
20:09 - have the track this black one green
20:12 - flashes click hmm
20:16 - the brake yes I think - set the size
20:22 - let's see I say 50 house 50 low 50s this
20:26 - boy
20:26 - yeah 75 maybe yes semi-finals good so
20:31 - you can just play around with you with
20:33 - your size and a dependent of the how big
20:37 - the brakes you drawl so it could be
20:40 - different right okay so we've got the
20:45 - brakes so we wanted to have 75 all right
20:48 - you can do it over here as well you can
20:50 - just change it here primarily change it
20:52 - either way also we want to hide a break
20:57 - when I can stop and we will want to use
21:02 - a loop here so what we want to do okay
21:05 - we want repeat sa 20 breaks and then we
21:10 - will call create call myself basically
21:14 - this will create a clone of the brake
21:17 - and also when the game is over we want
21:21 - to also stop this part we also
21:25 - this saying game over but remember we
21:30 - were using this stop all we let it do
21:33 - the same thing when it's a stockholder
21:35 - I'll just write in the script just like
21:38 - how we did for the other one now we have
21:43 - to create the troll for the clone this
21:46 - move is to be here okay when I start as
21:52 - a clone so basically this one what calls
21:55 - this okay so what do we want to do so
21:59 - we're repeating 20 times was and it's
22:01 - going to call this 20 time whatever you
22:03 - put in here so since we have hi before
22:08 - so we have the show and then we will say
22:13 - go to so with it with some random
22:16 - decision for this right we don't want it
22:19 - the brakes to be in the same place so
22:21 - say random so the X we are going to make
22:25 - the breaks between here and here right
22:27 - so this is like so you can see we call
22:29 - the motion you can see this is 200
22:32 - negative 200 and this is you know how
22:35 - positive 200 or something right
22:37 - what's the whole negative 200 to
22:41 - positive 200 for the eggs and then for
22:46 - the wine we want to keep it up right
22:48 - above this line right whatever like 50
22:50 - or whatever right - maybe 35 35 here
22:56 - what 1 1 160 150 we need we can do the
23:01 - random and then I am going to say 35 to
23:13 - 150 so 35 is like maybe maybe here I say
23:19 - this is negative so though are we here
23:21 - right so it's like here right you see 35
23:25 - 34 so here to the top of here so the
23:28 - breaks can generate around this area
23:31 - here okay and then
23:36 - we need a forever loop so forever loop
23:42 - is something that's going to happen over
23:44 - and over again we need to check so we
23:51 - will want to check if it's touching a
23:53 - baseball so injectors here we have to
23:57 - change it to baseball so we're gonna say
24:01 - okay then touch the baseball we wanna
24:03 - hide the brakes also you're going to
24:08 - change the score by five within five
24:11 - points because we are working at 100
24:14 - right there's 20 breaks and we are
24:16 - testing the baseball I had 100 point we
24:18 - win right so we do that's why then we
24:22 - have podcasts so when we hit the
24:26 - baseball hit the break we also wanted to
24:29 - bounce so we had a cast bounce then we
24:38 - have to play a sound pop up with a
24:40 - proper ready so we'll say start sound
24:45 - do you remember I tweeted earlier we
24:48 - don't want to use them until done so sit
24:50 - six pop then also when you do when you
24:56 - walk on chrome you have to remember to
24:59 - delete the clock if not he'll keep on
25:02 - generating it will be correct so we need
25:05 - this all right so let's save this that's
25:08 - test it out you can see it generated
25:12 - some breaks on top okay let me try again
25:17 - I think there are 20 probably something
25:22 - 20 so we can always test it so let's try
25:31 - a little bit yes okay let's say 10 10
25:34 - breaks we can use a variable later so we
25:37 - will to change this up so give 10 points
25:41 - because we're testing on 100 points so
25:43 - let's see how it looks
25:45 - lol
25:52 - this thing is hotter than once so as you
26:02 - can see my father's always balance that
26:04 - side which is not theory what we are
26:07 - going to do is we're gonna have to
26:09 - change that right in later okay
26:13 - you see okay almost there oh wow okay
26:19 - come on okay right okay what happened it
26:23 - did not say when let me check the score
26:25 - ah okay the score oh I say set score 210
26:32 - C and mistake here so I just say change
26:35 - score by 10 because setting score 10 is
26:39 - always going to be 10 raise those
26:41 - incorrect drop this out as I change
26:45 - score by 10 points so yo some time I
26:51 - don't mean mistake so let's try it again
26:56 - honestly hopefully we can get harder
27:05 - than I think yes okay let's get it by
27:15 - rest of the five okay and we are going
27:20 - to change it since at 100 or say okay 50
27:23 - points okay we're gonna have five times
27:26 - ten points so 50 let's try to get in
27:29 - this just make sure that
27:44 - okay yeah I'm not good at this as you
27:48 - can see come on you know I don't fall
28:02 - them oh come on
28:04 - so sometimes the point you can see is
28:06 - China getting stuck here so it's not
28:10 - perfect because you know how how this
28:13 - change let's let me change something to
28:16 - this Co to make it a little bit better
28:19 - just a sec okay we're gonna make it more
28:23 - random let's go back over here the
28:26 - bounce will change this our little bit
28:29 - actually
28:30 - instead of it's always going on one
28:33 - direction what we're going to do is
28:35 - we're gonna have if statement here we
28:41 - were to use an if-else sorry
28:46 - so we'll say
28:58 - basically what you want to do is them if
29:02 - it's between one and two or pick up one
29:04 - nut number let's duplicate this actually
29:10 - we don't have to
29:11 - we cannot duplicate knows the churn is
29:14 - different so put this in the bottom get
29:20 - another turn to keep this so now we will
29:26 - say okay this one will turn to the right
29:31 - if it's two it will turn to them that
29:34 - and then we'll move 30 step now let's
29:36 - try it again see how the ball looks
29:39 - better so as you can see there the
29:43 - bullet does gonna get better with this
29:46 - random so okay okay
30:02 - you see wow I'm finally got it you win
30:04 - right
30:05 - so you win we stopped everything because
30:07 - we check the scores 50 points and we are
30:11 - creating only 5 clones sorry if I braked
30:14 - in each break we get 10 points or 30
30:16 - point you win
30:18 - so next time we'll walk on lesson 2
30:21 - basically having the extra bonus stage
30:25 - who a bonus point with a star and also
30:28 - after the we wanna make that we make it
30:32 - in such a way that after you break all
30:34 - the breaks then you can go to the next
30:37 - level basically they'll start and
30:39 - regenerate or the breaks again with the
30:41 - star and then creating continuously and
30:44 - then if the player drops the ball down
30:46 - and then they lose so this is about it
30:49 - for this lesson and we'll continue next
30:52 - time thank you please subscribe and like
30:55 - our videos and let us know your feedback
30:59 - thank you very much bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys and welcome back to kiss coding playground today we'll be working on a new game called break breakers the skin basically we want to balance the paw of the paddle to break the breaks and then if you get the star as a bonus point you don't have to get them one saw the brakes are gone the next stage will come on but before we do that where they get the basic working first just getting the breaks the ball and the paddle walking first later on we'll work on the star when I was a kid I remember I play this game called break out so break out is like game that I used to play you bounce a ball up and then you break the break so this is way similar to a breakout so basically we there's some breaks on the top of the stage we want to hit it with a baseball and bounce it off and hit the breaks ones of the player breaks all the breaks then the player wins the game later on we'll add that the star for the bonus this is still actually a push start here that's wrong so the star for the bonus and keep the game going and continue with the next stage so let's get the basic of the game working first okay so let me go over here to kind of show you how the game looks like okay so let me start the game as you can see right on the screen and we want to break as much breaks as possible once we bring a loss I did break on a break but as you can see there's a number of breaks left here and total score that I have basically have to break all the breaks get the star and then if I don't get a star that's fine but if I break all the breaks it will go to the next level but before that we'll get the regular bar and the power the brakes working force then we can stop having the brakes later on I'm in the stall later on okay let's begin the lesson or create a new project okay we have the new project created we need to find a background we can either draw a background or such a background here before MIT would I be the first Kim I did draw the background for this time maybe we can just pick one of the background so I love it easier we can either use the sky or city or something like that so let's try this one this might look good let's delete the cat what we need to do is we are going to have to draw out brakes so there's a paint and your sprite okay here we'll mix our own brakes but they use this rectangular shape we can use we're going to have the power line okay so let's draw brakes first and we'll change the color in a bit so which our little break here so as you can see this is blue that's not kind of not what we wanted if I want to bring out red let me get up smaller can zoom in a little bit so we can put it in the center here they're a little smaller okay what we do whether increase this to one or two if you like doesn't matter maybe three just this is like outer color so we can select a different color for the feel so let's select this is inside we'll select some color here maybe here and then this is a and then this is looks okay looks okay right the brakes looks good and then the outer one we can select a darker red maybe like this so you can see right there's a thicker out of red I'm not sure the back background was good let's see still with a lighter background let's use a blue sky blue sky maybe better or you can paint your own let me remove the other one so let's delete this and will delete this so we'll use a blue sky blue sky looks good no and see the another breaks so now we are done with that break so all we need to do next we need to add the baseball okay you get the baseball okay so with the breaks with a baseball then we need the paddle okay I was using a button do we actually have a paddle I see yeah we do have a paddle similar to the beach all right yeah we're getting use there so the button doesn't really matter let's just use the paddle let's try with a pair of this time so we have the ball without their great and we have that paddle all right what we do is we start to coat the baseball okay before we move on I like you guys to please like share and subscribe to our channel and if you know any friend that would like to learn about scratch please forward our channels to them alright so let's begin now today okay I will walk on the baseball first okay make sure when a baseball we're gonna move this adjust this around a little bit let's go to the co what we need is always when they suddenly cold start when Greek life is quick that means you know when you click on this green flag this code executes okay we also need a variable actually now we can rename this to score or can create new one as a matter in the beginning we also also want us to reset the score 20 so that you know when we when we begin the game we always preset the score then we also want to resize the baseball bit and then the baseball too big to it 50% then we have to say point in directions of what we go into this point direction zero meaning the baseball gonna point upwards so the baseball fly up okay then we say okay let's move on that is your zero position so this will be dead center and here somewhere then we say we're gonna use a control let's repeat ten time we'll move five step so that's total is 50 step so basically the ball will move up when the game stopped or move up and bounce off and then so that gives a play a little bit more time to adjust the paddle okay after that we are going to have this repeat until loop so we're gonna make it really simple for us to make sure that we get the basic of the game first then go in Krita will change it in a bit so here what we are going to do is we are going to check if the score so basically if the score is equal to a hundred when we get a hundred points for the gamble in okay so 100 that so I'll repeat until the scores 100 what is the boss going to do so whatever before hundred this is what it's going to do in here we'll say if on edge bounce okay and then we will put move ten step so basically this ball when I hit the edge okay just bounce around and then we need an if statement here okay whoa check the y position of the ball so Y position is basically you know where the ball is at so let's let's say now right now that you see the pores at 5959 right so this is the Y position what we need to check here before it's like somewhere below here I'd like 130 or 160 or whatever it is then we want to say the game is ended right we don't want to fall the drop down basically we want to keep the paddle up keep the ball up as much as possible if the balls drop down then we lose the game okay let's go back to the ball I was just slightly click on the panel what we need to do is so we're gonna check this X Y position where the boys at use this operator sold on uses less then go back to the same thing in motion so Y position if the y position is less than let's say 160 somewhere down the bottom that will gone what casts the events saying that you know the agam is over so what guess the new message see came over else more podcasts the message that the message you win you won okay all right so we have the baseball so far so basically this is the code at the baseball just kind of move around the screen and it bounced off the edges okay so next we will also need someone or cohere okay so need the when the message flag when it's clay so when the game is over what we need to do is with a stop not a scrip in the sprite basically stopping anything else so that we don't want the ball to keep on using like so stop our script in the sprite and we will say game over and then we can play some sound okay can i play this so this is a sound that we will play when the game is over go back to sound okay and then we go and stop everything all right so so far with us what we have then we have to catch to data you can as well okay all right so we have this other event right if the players win maybe I should change to win so doesn't matter you can't change this out so you went okay okay all right so this part is also we want to do something similar we also wanted to stop on the script and the sprite then we'll similar to this when we're singing over I came over right we're going to say okay and then we have a stop ball as well okay so this is these two code really similar one it's not game over and one is to play away so we're is similar so I just say this hopefully have to save and what they call this okay maybe I have to call break with the two because I have okay okay so far we got the baseball we got the baseball coach somewhat working look into the paddle if you want to test your game you can click on this as you can see the ball gonna bounce it off the edge right bounce it up and then down right we haven't work on the paddle you see you have a bouncing off the paddle all the breaks so let the walk on the paddle and the breaks next we will walk on the paddle so paddle same thing we'll have to use this maybe zoom in a little bit we can move the paddle anywhere we want maybe somewhere here so what you can do is you can set the Y at this position I think this is about right let's do 137 138 maybe yay and then we'll set the size I think the size looks okay we don't really ever set the size then we'll leave it then what to use this control forever so what we want to do is we want to make the paddle kind of follow the mouse whenever we move the mouse sidetoside a paddle kind of follow us around so what we need to do it we need to set the eggs so set X 2 will go sensing Mouse eggs and then we need an if statement here so what we need to check is make sure if the if the baseball hit this paddle we want to bounce it off okay well okay we'll go back to sensing you remember just sensing this always there's something there to test of this something Kalai so we will check them as touching the baseball what we're going to do is we've got vehicle to make the baseball bounce so since we're here in this paddle we cannot make him bounce right what we need to do is we need to make a new message say bounce so this will call the message balance of broadcast a message bouncing and if the baseball received a message bounce or bounce it off we haven't worked on that yet that will then we want to put a sound okay we do have a sound already here okay great point okay we will say now start a sound okay so it uses so there's two things here this one is until done and this so we use this it doesn't kind of wait if you use until done then your the way into this music is done Daniel so we don't want to wait actually so we will just use stop the sample and also if we receive the message game over so what we also want to do is we want to stop are the scrip and sprite we don't want to stop all because we still want to let the let the baseball say yeah you win no you lose right so that's why we don't want to do that we want to just simply stop the scrip is a little one anything to run here all here so this one so that's what we need so so far we have this someone came over we want to stop the script is it with scrapping a script not make him follow not making a profile miles anymore okay let's test it a little bit real quick so as you can see my paddle is kind of moving with my mouse but it's not bouncing off the baseball yet what we need to do is we have the core already right what chess right so we need to go to the baseball to work on that okay so in the baseball with this code you look it up we are going to add one when I receive bounce okay I'm going to say turn let's do this turn but we can do so Oh changing later on too little bit better for for now we'll use it like this we're gonna use it random 150 to 210 degree okay and then we say move 30 steps or 1000 become I mean the mall but when the ball hits some it said something or more would faster so 30 speed imadori step okay and then we need something similar so for the brakes I mean for the brake later we'll walk on close but now let's just test it out first so as you can see the ball is bouncing off the panel right but it's not hitting the brakes yet so we'll need diameter so and also the ball hits the bottom this game over and plays that Elian quick same way just that one we did here okay next we'll walk on the brakes now oh they're breaking and we have the track this black one green flashes click hmm the brake yes I think set the size let's see I say 50 house 50 low 50s this boy yeah 75 maybe yes semifinals good so you can just play around with you with your size and a dependent of the how big the brakes you drawl so it could be different right okay so we've got the brakes so we wanted to have 75 all right you can do it over here as well you can just change it here primarily change it either way also we want to hide a break when I can stop and we will want to use a loop here so what we want to do okay we want repeat sa 20 breaks and then we will call create call myself basically this will create a clone of the brake and also when the game is over we want to also stop this part we also this saying game over but remember we were using this stop all we let it do the same thing when it's a stockholder I'll just write in the script just like how we did for the other one now we have to create the troll for the clone this move is to be here okay when I start as a clone so basically this one what calls this okay so what do we want to do so we're repeating 20 times was and it's going to call this 20 time whatever you put in here so since we have hi before so we have the show and then we will say go to so with it with some random decision for this right we don't want it the brakes to be in the same place so say random so the X we are going to make the breaks between here and here right so this is like so you can see we call the motion you can see this is 200 negative 200 and this is you know how positive 200 or something right what's the whole negative 200 to positive 200 for the eggs and then for the wine we want to keep it up right above this line right whatever like 50 or whatever right maybe 35 35 here what 1 1 160 150 we need we can do the random and then I am going to say 35 to 150 so 35 is like maybe maybe here I say this is negative so though are we here right so it's like here right you see 35 34 so here to the top of here so the breaks can generate around this area here okay and then we need a forever loop so forever loop is something that's going to happen over and over again we need to check so we will want to check if it's touching a baseball so injectors here we have to change it to baseball so we're gonna say okay then touch the baseball we wanna hide the brakes also you're going to change the score by five within five points because we are working at 100 right there's 20 breaks and we are testing the baseball I had 100 point we win right so we do that's why then we have podcasts so when we hit the baseball hit the break we also wanted to bounce so we had a cast bounce then we have to play a sound pop up with a proper ready so we'll say start sound do you remember I tweeted earlier we don't want to use them until done so sit six pop then also when you do when you walk on chrome you have to remember to delete the clock if not he'll keep on generating it will be correct so we need this all right so let's save this that's test it out you can see it generated some breaks on top okay let me try again I think there are 20 probably something 20 so we can always test it so let's try a little bit yes okay let's say 10 10 breaks we can use a variable later so we will to change this up so give 10 points because we're testing on 100 points so let's see how it looks lol this thing is hotter than once so as you can see my father's always balance that side which is not theory what we are going to do is we're gonna have to change that right in later okay you see okay almost there oh wow okay come on okay right okay what happened it did not say when let me check the score ah okay the score oh I say set score 210 C and mistake here so I just say change score by 10 because setting score 10 is always going to be 10 raise those incorrect drop this out as I change score by 10 points so yo some time I don't mean mistake so let's try it again honestly hopefully we can get harder than I think yes okay let's get it by rest of the five okay and we are going to change it since at 100 or say okay 50 points okay we're gonna have five times ten points so 50 let's try to get in this just make sure that okay yeah I'm not good at this as you can see come on you know I don't fall them oh come on so sometimes the point you can see is China getting stuck here so it's not perfect because you know how how this change let's let me change something to this Co to make it a little bit better just a sec okay we're gonna make it more random let's go back over here the bounce will change this our little bit actually instead of it's always going on one direction what we're going to do is we're gonna have if statement here we were to use an ifelse sorry so we'll say basically what you want to do is them if it's between one and two or pick up one nut number let's duplicate this actually we don't have to we cannot duplicate knows the churn is different so put this in the bottom get another turn to keep this so now we will say okay this one will turn to the right if it's two it will turn to them that and then we'll move 30 step now let's try it again see how the ball looks better so as you can see there the bullet does gonna get better with this random so okay okay you see wow I'm finally got it you win right so you win we stopped everything because we check the scores 50 points and we are creating only 5 clones sorry if I braked in each break we get 10 points or 30 point you win so next time we'll walk on lesson 2 basically having the extra bonus stage who a bonus point with a star and also after the we wanna make that we make it in such a way that after you break all the breaks then you can go to the next level basically they'll start and regenerate or the breaks again with the star and then creating continuously and then if the player drops the ball down and then they lose so this is about it for this lesson and we'll continue next time thank you please subscribe and like our videos and let us know your feedback thank you very much bye bye
