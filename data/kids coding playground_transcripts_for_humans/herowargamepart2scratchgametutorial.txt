00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids playground
00:09 - here and today we're back for another
00:10 - video in scratch and today we are
00:12 - recording our second part for the hero
00:15 - war game so if you have not checked out
00:17 - how hero War works and the concepts of
00:19 - it go to our YouTube channel and there
00:22 - is the demo for the hero war game that
00:24 - I'll be teaching you in this part so we
00:26 - also posted part one so if you not
00:28 - checked out part one yet go check it out
00:30 - it's the drawing of all the Sprites and
00:33 - um yeah so the first thing we're going
00:36 - to start on is the elf portrait and
00:39 - we're going to work down all the way
00:40 - there but we will come back to work on
00:42 - more on each of
00:44 - [Music]
00:46 - them so I'm going to make a new
00:50 - variable which is
00:53 - lives so live Sprite I mean variable so
00:57 - when the green flag is clicked
01:01 - set
01:03 - lives to 1,200 because the default is
01:06 - just the L Warrior so that's just our
01:08 - first part of
01:10 - code so we also need a new variable
01:18 - heroed so when the green flag is clicked
01:21 - it will set the hero selected to one
01:26 - which is the default elf so we just do
01:28 - that to for extra check this is just
01:30 - extra so and it'll go to this position
01:32 - you can put any position to the left so
01:35 - that's just where it'll go and then
01:37 - after that it will
01:39 - show and it'll switch costume to costume
01:42 - one because you've not selected any hero
01:45 - which is this is the selected version
01:46 - and there's a confirm button after that
01:48 - so yeah that's
01:50 - it and then now we will have this piece
01:53 - of code when this this Sprite is
01:57 - clicked we're going to switch costume to
01:59 - cost costume
02:01 - 2 and then we're going to
02:04 - broadcast a message since this is more
02:07 - simpler uh to switch
02:12 - others oh yeah new message switch o
02:17 - switch
02:20 - others
02:25 - elf yeah so switch others
02:28 - Al and it will set hero selected to one
02:31 - so when you click on this it's going to
02:33 - be hero selected one Al is the first
02:37 - hero then now let's move on to the Mage
02:40 - so the Mage when this Sprite is clicked
02:44 - no when the green flag is clicked it
02:45 - will go to this position but you need
02:47 - put anywhere in the middle and it will
02:52 - show it will also switch costume to
02:54 - costume one which is the unselected
02:56 - version and it also when this Sprite is
02:59 - clicked when this PR clicked it will
03:01 - switch costume to costume 2 a selected
03:04 - version and then
03:06 - broadcast and
03:08 - then
03:11 - broadcast switch others
03:19 - Mage
03:23 - Mitch and when it says switch up Mage it
03:26 - will set the hero selected to two
03:27 - because this is the second
03:30 - hero and it'll set the lives of this
03:33 - hero to 1,000 so Mage has a little bit
03:36 - less than elf Warrior because some of
03:39 - its abilities are better and then let's
03:43 - move on to the fairy we'll come back to
03:47 - each of the portraits to add more code
03:49 - later when the green flag is clicked for
03:51 - the
03:53 - fairy it will go to put anywhere on the
03:56 - right but I just put this position and
03:58 - it will show
04:00 - and switch costume to costume
04:04 - one when this spite is
04:07 - clicked so when it's clicked it will
04:10 - switch costume to costume 2 the selected
04:13 - version and then broadcast another
04:17 - message switch others
04:23 - fairy and then the fairy is the third
04:26 - hero so set hero selected to three
04:30 - and then set lives to 850 because the
04:34 - hero Fair uh the fairy Queen's abilities
04:36 - are very
04:38 - good now let's go back to the elf
04:41 - so in the elf we will now have these
04:44 - pieces of new code when I receive switch
04:48 - others Mage so when you click on the
04:51 - Mage it'll switch costume back to
04:53 - costume one so the deselected one and
04:58 - then
05:01 - and then it will stop other scripts in
05:04 - the
05:05 - Sprite the same with the fairy so switch
05:08 - cost switch others
05:10 - fairy
05:12 - so let's us do this for the Mage so when
05:16 - I
05:18 - receive when I receive switch others elf
05:23 - so when elf it will do switch costume
05:26 - back to costume one and stop other
05:29 - script in the
05:31 - Sprite same with the fairy so this is
05:34 - the elf and the
05:35 - Fairy and then in the
05:38 - fairy when I receive switch others elf
05:43 - it
05:44 - will switch costume to costume
05:49 - one and stop other scripts in Sprite and
05:54 - then same with the Mage o
05:57 - Mage there we go
06:00 - that is the portraits but we will come
06:02 - back later to do some more so now we'll
06:06 - move on to the confirm buttons for each
06:07 - of the corresponding Heroes so when the
06:10 - green flag is clicked for this is the
06:12 - elf elf's um confirm button when the
06:16 - green flag is clicked it will hide but
06:18 - it will go to the front layer so it
06:20 - doesn't hide behind the elf where is
06:23 - that go to front layer and it'll switch
06:26 - costume to costume one
06:31 - which is this one so
06:33 - yeah and we also changed the size to
06:37 - this one to 45 cuz that's the size that
06:40 - I want for the button and then it will
06:43 - go to I have a position for it which is
06:46 - like near the bottom of the elf which
06:48 - looks the best I think in my opinion for
06:51 - the position of the button as you can
06:53 - see well it'll show up later but yeah
06:57 - okay and then after that it will do when
07:02 - I receive switch others elf it will
07:05 - show while when I receive switch others
07:09 - Mage it will oop
07:12 - hide and same with the
07:16 - fairy so that's that and then when this
07:20 - right is clicked it will
07:23 - wait 05
07:26 - seconds and broadcast
07:30 - hide all
07:32 - others a new message
07:35 - so hide all others which is just
07:39 - basically the start of the game but I
07:41 - named that because it's
07:44 - yeah and then it will set the hero
07:46 - selected to
07:50 - one and then when I receive hide all
07:52 - others it also
07:58 - hide
08:00 - okay never mind hide all others is
08:03 - sounds confusing to me I'm not going to
08:05 - lie so I'm going to change it to start
08:07 - game game so that's basically the start
08:10 - of the game it'll broadcast start game
08:12 - and when I receive start game it will
08:13 - hide so that is the confirm button for
08:18 - the elf so let's go back to the elf
08:21 - portrait and do this when I receive
08:24 - start
08:25 - game it will hide
08:31 - same with the Mage and the fairy let's
08:35 - see if that went
08:36 - in there we go cuz we want it to hide
08:39 - cuz it's just the portrait the
08:42 - selection so we can actually duplicate
08:44 - the button and use it for all three and
08:48 - just change and tweak some few things so
08:52 - let's just do that real quick we can
08:54 - just make new ones later we'll take this
08:58 - duplicate at
09:00 - it okay so we can just basically
09:02 - duplicate all of
09:06 - these so this is going to O I already
09:08 - made three okay so I made three so let's
09:11 - drag them up here and then this is going
09:13 - to be confirm
09:16 - Mage okay
09:20 - Mage and this is going to be
09:23 - confirm
09:25 - Queen so three confirm buttons so
09:29 - now let's go to the confirm
09:33 - Mage when the green flag is clicked I
09:35 - have also a position for this it will go
09:39 - to
09:43 - 071 that's just the position I had for
09:46 - it and then it will when I receive
09:50 - switch
09:52 - others elf it will hide instead of show
09:56 - and when I see switch others Mage it
09:58 - will show instead of hide and fairy it
10:00 - also hide and when I
10:03 - receive start game see yeah it will wait
10:07 - 25 seconds broadcast start game and set
10:10 - hero selected to
10:12 - two two and then it will
10:18 - hide and that's the
10:23 - Mage and now let's work on the confirm
10:26 - button for the queen when the green flag
10:29 - is clicked it will go to I have a
10:31 - position
10:35 - 157
10:37 - -75 and it'll go to the front layer hide
10:40 - switch costumes to the button one the
10:43 - only costume and then it will when this
10:45 - right is clicked wait. 5 Seconds Brest
10:48 - start game set here selected to
10:50 - three and
10:53 - hide and then now instead it will when I
10:58 - receive switch switch
11:00 - others um elf it will
11:03 - hide and when I receive switch others
11:05 - Mage it will hide and when I switch
11:06 - others fairy it will show
11:10 - so okay and this piece of code is like
11:13 - not useful because we already make it
11:15 - hide I don't know why I did that for the
11:17 - AL War so let's just move it up here
11:19 - this right clicked blah blah blah when I
11:21 - receive start game we don't need that so
11:23 - let's move that over
11:26 - there so this is all the the code for
11:29 - the buttons so let me Zoom this out for
11:32 - you so feel free to pause the video when
11:36 - I get this
11:42 - angle yeah okay now let's look at
11:51 - Mage and then let's look
11:54 - at the fairy so feel free to
11:57 - pause
11:59 - okay uh let's see if it works so let's
12:02 - first hide this you win you lose and
12:05 - then the death ray o
12:07 - oops that was an
12:12 - accident all right that was my bad okay
12:15 - it's hidden now though and then let's
12:17 - hide the Death Race
12:19 - so let's see and the weight sign so this
12:23 - is let's see if it
12:26 - works so we have the for when hero
12:29 - select is one and you can click the
12:31 - confirm button the Grand Master Mage and
12:34 - then the fairy queen so it
12:36 - works and yeah now let's work on the
12:39 - player
12:40 - [Music]
12:44 - movement okay let's Now work on the
12:46 - player so the player we have to add
12:48 - let's work on the movement and the
12:51 - starting so when the green fog is
12:52 - clicked it will clear graphic effects
12:55 - because um remember the poison from The
12:57 - Vineyards that does
12:59 - add into this so and then it'll also go
13:02 - to the position up here so that's just
13:05 - the selection so you can see which one
13:07 - you're looking at and then you'll also
13:10 - switch costume to costume
13:13 - one uh cuz that's just the first one and
13:16 - it's just the default elf Warrior and I
13:18 - just want to keep it like that and then
13:20 - it'll point in
13:21 - Direction
13:24 - 90 and set size to
13:27 - 45%
13:29 - so that's just like the standard and
13:31 - then
13:33 - forever it will if then the hero
13:39 - selected is equal to one so hero
13:41 - selected is equal to one which is the
13:43 - elf
13:44 - Warrior it will switch costume to
13:47 - costume one which is the elf warrior
13:50 - costume up here and then
13:53 - duplicate if hero selected is equal to
13:56 - two it switch costume to costume
14:00 - 2 and if hero selected is equal to three
14:05 - it'll switch costume to costume
14:08 - 3 and then under that it will show so we
14:12 - will come back and edit this block later
14:14 - when we get to the
14:16 - vineyard and when I receive so when I
14:20 - receive start game it will we need a new
14:24 - variable
14:27 - score
14:29 - so actually let's do this part first
14:31 - when the green flag is clicked because
14:32 - it's more simple it will set score to
14:36 - zero since you haven't killed anything
14:38 - and it will also hide the variable score
14:41 - CU I want to let it show the variable
14:42 - score after when you start the game so
14:44 - when I receive start
14:46 - game show varibles
14:49 - score then after that it will go to so
14:52 - player will go to the absolute middle 0
14:56 - 0 and then after that it will show
15:01 - and then forever so let's put this big
15:03 - block
15:05 - forever if it's on the edge it will
15:08 - bounce so you can't camp in the edge or
15:10 - anything like that and it will Point
15:12 - towards the mouse
15:14 - pointer you need if then here if then
15:19 - key W so
15:22 - w w pressed it will change y by five so
15:26 - it goes up if you click W and yeah and
15:32 - if you click s then it'll
15:37 - change and if you click
15:41 - s it will change y by ne5 just like that
15:46 - so the other one the A and D are
15:48 - different uh if
15:52 - then the key a is pressed which is the
15:56 - left one then it will change X by neg5
16:02 - change x byg five because that's left
16:06 - and right and then if key D
16:11 - WD change X by five so that's the
16:18 - classical movement of the player let's
16:22 - see how it works okay so let's um show
16:26 - you so let's see hero SEL as one sets
16:29 - the default you select as two and it
16:31 - shows you like the little person on top
16:34 - so you see fairy queen let's try the
16:36 - fairy queen you see it's the fairy queen
16:39 - and then she's moving around like
16:42 - that also one more thing I actually
16:44 - forgot all about this it's actually
16:47 - backdrop let's work on the backdrop
16:49 - right now before we end the video today
16:52 - so let's convert this to
16:54 - vector and then in
16:56 - red pure red I'm going to
16:59 - write select your legendary
17:03 - hero select a legendary hero so let's
17:05 - write that select a
17:11 - legendary
17:12 - hero hero there we
17:16 - go let's put it somewhere here near the
17:19 - middle and I like to change it to
17:21 - handwriting so let's take that make it a
17:25 - little bit larger just put it like right
17:28 - there and then that'll just be on the
17:29 - top and also let's work on the quick
17:32 - code for the
17:34 - backdrop so when the green flag is
17:37 - clicked it will switch costume to I mean
17:40 - switch backdrop to
17:44 - Galaxy and then after that when I
17:47 - receive start game it will switch
17:49 - costume to backdrop one so that's just
17:52 - there we go that's just the playing
17:55 - backdrop so let's see if it works yeah
17:59 - okay there we go so that is it for this
18:02 - video so please like share subscribe and
18:05 - comment in the comment section below
18:06 - what else games that You' like to see
18:08 - and I'll be continuing with the series
18:10 - for this project so anyway see you guys
18:13 - next
18:14 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we are recording our second part for the hero war game so if you have not checked out how hero War works and the concepts of it go to our YouTube channel and there is the demo for the hero war game that I'll be teaching you in this part so we also posted part one so if you not checked out part one yet go check it out it's the drawing of all the Sprites and um yeah so the first thing we're going to start on is the elf portrait and we're going to work down all the way there but we will come back to work on more on each of them so I'm going to make a new variable which is lives so live Sprite I mean variable so when the green flag is clicked set lives to 1,200 because the default is just the L Warrior so that's just our first part of code so we also need a new variable heroed so when the green flag is clicked it will set the hero selected to one which is the default elf so we just do that to for extra check this is just extra so and it'll go to this position you can put any position to the left so that's just where it'll go and then after that it will show and it'll switch costume to costume one because you've not selected any hero which is this is the selected version and there's a confirm button after that so yeah that's it and then now we will have this piece of code when this this Sprite is clicked we're going to switch costume to cost costume 2 and then we're going to broadcast a message since this is more simpler uh to switch others oh yeah new message switch o switch others elf yeah so switch others Al and it will set hero selected to one so when you click on this it's going to be hero selected one Al is the first hero then now let's move on to the Mage so the Mage when this Sprite is clicked no when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position but you need put anywhere in the middle and it will show it will also switch costume to costume one which is the unselected version and it also when this Sprite is clicked when this PR clicked it will switch costume to costume 2 a selected version and then broadcast and then broadcast switch others Mage Mitch and when it says switch up Mage it will set the hero selected to two because this is the second hero and it'll set the lives of this hero to 1,000 so Mage has a little bit less than elf Warrior because some of its abilities are better and then let's move on to the fairy we'll come back to each of the portraits to add more code later when the green flag is clicked for the fairy it will go to put anywhere on the right but I just put this position and it will show and switch costume to costume one when this spite is clicked so when it's clicked it will switch costume to costume 2 the selected version and then broadcast another message switch others fairy and then the fairy is the third hero so set hero selected to three and then set lives to 850 because the hero Fair uh the fairy Queen's abilities are very good now let's go back to the elf so in the elf we will now have these pieces of new code when I receive switch others Mage so when you click on the Mage it'll switch costume back to costume one so the deselected one and then and then it will stop other scripts in the Sprite the same with the fairy so switch cost switch others fairy so let's us do this for the Mage so when I receive when I receive switch others elf so when elf it will do switch costume back to costume one and stop other script in the Sprite same with the fairy so this is the elf and the Fairy and then in the fairy when I receive switch others elf it will switch costume to costume one and stop other scripts in Sprite and then same with the Mage o Mage there we go that is the portraits but we will come back later to do some more so now we'll move on to the confirm buttons for each of the corresponding Heroes so when the green flag is clicked for this is the elf elf's um confirm button when the green flag is clicked it will hide but it will go to the front layer so it doesn't hide behind the elf where is that go to front layer and it'll switch costume to costume one which is this one so yeah and we also changed the size to this one to 45 cuz that's the size that I want for the button and then it will go to I have a position for it which is like near the bottom of the elf which looks the best I think in my opinion for the position of the button as you can see well it'll show up later but yeah okay and then after that it will do when I receive switch others elf it will show while when I receive switch others Mage it will oop hide and same with the fairy so that's that and then when this right is clicked it will wait 05 seconds and broadcast hide all others a new message so hide all others which is just basically the start of the game but I named that because it's yeah and then it will set the hero selected to one and then when I receive hide all others it also hide okay never mind hide all others is sounds confusing to me I'm not going to lie so I'm going to change it to start game game so that's basically the start of the game it'll broadcast start game and when I receive start game it will hide so that is the confirm button for the elf so let's go back to the elf portrait and do this when I receive start game it will hide same with the Mage and the fairy let's see if that went in there we go cuz we want it to hide cuz it's just the portrait the selection so we can actually duplicate the button and use it for all three and just change and tweak some few things so let's just do that real quick we can just make new ones later we'll take this duplicate at it okay so we can just basically duplicate all of these so this is going to O I already made three okay so I made three so let's drag them up here and then this is going to be confirm Mage okay Mage and this is going to be confirm Queen so three confirm buttons so now let's go to the confirm Mage when the green flag is clicked I have also a position for this it will go to 071 that's just the position I had for it and then it will when I receive switch others elf it will hide instead of show and when I see switch others Mage it will show instead of hide and fairy it also hide and when I receive start game see yeah it will wait 25 seconds broadcast start game and set hero selected to two two and then it will hide and that's the Mage and now let's work on the confirm button for the queen when the green flag is clicked it will go to I have a position 157 75 and it'll go to the front layer hide switch costumes to the button one the only costume and then it will when this right is clicked wait. 5 Seconds Brest start game set here selected to three and hide and then now instead it will when I receive switch switch others um elf it will hide and when I receive switch others Mage it will hide and when I switch others fairy it will show so okay and this piece of code is like not useful because we already make it hide I don't know why I did that for the AL War so let's just move it up here this right clicked blah blah blah when I receive start game we don't need that so let's move that over there so this is all the the code for the buttons so let me Zoom this out for you so feel free to pause the video when I get this angle yeah okay now let's look at Mage and then let's look at the fairy so feel free to pause okay uh let's see if it works so let's first hide this you win you lose and then the death ray o oops that was an accident all right that was my bad okay it's hidden now though and then let's hide the Death Race so let's see and the weight sign so this is let's see if it works so we have the for when hero select is one and you can click the confirm button the Grand Master Mage and then the fairy queen so it works and yeah now let's work on the player movement okay let's Now work on the player so the player we have to add let's work on the movement and the starting so when the green fog is clicked it will clear graphic effects because um remember the poison from The Vineyards that does add into this so and then it'll also go to the position up here so that's just the selection so you can see which one you're looking at and then you'll also switch costume to costume one uh cuz that's just the first one and it's just the default elf Warrior and I just want to keep it like that and then it'll point in Direction 90 and set size to 45% so that's just like the standard and then forever it will if then the hero selected is equal to one so hero selected is equal to one which is the elf Warrior it will switch costume to costume one which is the elf warrior costume up here and then duplicate if hero selected is equal to two it switch costume to costume 2 and if hero selected is equal to three it'll switch costume to costume 3 and then under that it will show so we will come back and edit this block later when we get to the vineyard and when I receive so when I receive start game it will we need a new variable score so actually let's do this part first when the green flag is clicked because it's more simple it will set score to zero since you haven't killed anything and it will also hide the variable score CU I want to let it show the variable score after when you start the game so when I receive start game show varibles score then after that it will go to so player will go to the absolute middle 0 0 and then after that it will show and then forever so let's put this big block forever if it's on the edge it will bounce so you can't camp in the edge or anything like that and it will Point towards the mouse pointer you need if then here if then key W so w w pressed it will change y by five so it goes up if you click W and yeah and if you click s then it'll change and if you click s it will change y by ne5 just like that so the other one the A and D are different uh if then the key a is pressed which is the left one then it will change X by neg5 change x byg five because that's left and right and then if key D WD change X by five so that's the classical movement of the player let's see how it works okay so let's um show you so let's see hero SEL as one sets the default you select as two and it shows you like the little person on top so you see fairy queen let's try the fairy queen you see it's the fairy queen and then she's moving around like that also one more thing I actually forgot all about this it's actually backdrop let's work on the backdrop right now before we end the video today so let's convert this to vector and then in red pure red I'm going to write select your legendary hero select a legendary hero so let's write that select a legendary hero hero there we go let's put it somewhere here near the middle and I like to change it to handwriting so let's take that make it a little bit larger just put it like right there and then that'll just be on the top and also let's work on the quick code for the backdrop so when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to I mean switch backdrop to Galaxy and then after that when I receive start game it will switch costume to backdrop one so that's just there we go that's just the playing backdrop so let's see if it works yeah okay there we go so that is it for this video so please like share subscribe and
