00:01 - welcome back guys it's
00:02 - kidscodingplayground here and today
00:03 - we're back for our 5k
00:05 - special so today we just hit fi i mean
00:08 - couple days ago we just hit 5000
00:09 - subscribers
00:10 - thank you guys for all subscribing to
00:12 - our channel so today we'll be doing a q
00:14 - a
00:14 - we will have some minecraft gameplay of
00:16 - for the next 20 minutes yeah for us
00:18 - playing minecraft in the background
00:20 - some survival gameplay so yeah um and
00:23 - we'll be answering questions
00:24 - while you get to see some of the
00:26 - gameplay alright so now let's get
00:28 - started
00:29 - on the q a
00:32 - okay here's the first question so this
00:35 - person said congratulations
00:37 - my question uh what or who was your
00:40 - inspiration to start a youtube channel
00:42 - so i always wanted to upload we always
00:45 - wanted
00:45 - to upload videos onto youtube and
00:48 - we thought uploading videos on youtube
00:50 - would be cool and so we decided to make
00:52 - a scratch channel
00:53 - where we could teach other people how to
00:56 - learn scratch while making videos
00:59 - so it can be fun for us teaching them
01:03 - and they can also learn from us so
01:06 - our dad told us not to start a gaming
01:08 - channel because originally we wanted to
01:10 - start a gaming channel what do we
01:12 - have right now gamer territory we have
01:15 - that
01:15 - um so gaming series i forgot what it's
01:18 - called it's getting
01:18 - territory so yeah um uh yeah we wanted
01:22 - to start that but we decided that
01:23 - scratch
01:24 - would help us learn and you guys to
01:26 - learn
01:28 - so another person says my question is
01:32 - why do you target to code in scratch and
01:34 - not
01:35 - other software's like roblox studio and
01:37 - more so we target scratch because
01:39 - scratch is easier to learn and it's
01:40 - a bigger um coding platform platform
01:43 - yeah so
01:44 - that's why we chose scratch and in
01:45 - roblox duty i'm pretty sure you need
01:47 - money to buy
01:47 - robux yes and to make games so like i've
01:50 - played roblox
01:51 - games before so yeah yeah yeah
01:55 - um scratch is a better platform in my
01:57 - opinion
01:58 - uh so yeah you can create a lot of games
02:02 - and there's a lot of possibilities so
02:04 - scratch is also easier to learn than
02:06 - roblox studio i'm pretty sure
02:08 - i think i guess roblox i mean scratch
02:11 - is like for kids to learn coding so yeah
02:15 - [Music]
02:17 - okay so this one says uh this user asks
02:20 - did we have any uh experience with
02:22 - youtube before this channel
02:25 - or is this our first channel this is our
02:27 - first channel
02:28 - so we actually don't have experience
02:30 - with youtube
02:31 - we thought of maybe creating a youtube
02:34 - channel to teach kids programming
02:36 - so i started with with my kids
02:39 - to make scratch programs
02:43 - and games to share with other people
02:47 - okay so many people asked for a face
02:50 - reveal so i'll put
02:51 - all their accounts and questions up on
02:53 - the screen
02:54 - so many people ask for a face reveal we
02:56 - might do one later
02:58 - in the future if we hit like a
03:00 - subscriber milestone
03:02 - yeah subscriber milestone would be great
03:04 - yeah and we could do
03:05 - a face reveal so all of you guys yeah so
03:08 - it's just a facebook so you guys can
03:09 - stop asking us for a face reveal once we
03:11 - do it okay
03:12 - so yeah that's basically this question
03:15 - so just like the other comment
03:16 - another person asked us why are you
03:18 - interested in scratch
03:19 - or um but other programming apps so
03:23 - asking us why we like scratch better
03:26 - than other programming apps so we do do
03:28 - python videos sometimes
03:29 - we do do python on trinket.io yeah
03:32 - um but we are interested in scratch
03:35 - because it's simple for kids to learn
03:37 - and it was pretty simple for me and my
03:39 - brother to learn yeah it's just a
03:41 - block dragging type of thing python and
03:44 - like real coding is
03:45 - typing but this is a really simple uh
03:48 - thing for people to learn and also have
03:50 - fun
03:50 - so scratch is a little bit easier than
03:53 - the other
03:54 - programming languages where you have to
03:56 - use more logic
03:58 - so this person says that my question is
04:01 - did you start this channel for fun or
04:03 - you had a goal that you wanted to be a
04:05 - famous youtuber
04:06 - so we started this for fun and we also
04:10 - also wanted to help kids learn scratch
04:13 - so we wanted to teach people how to use
04:15 - scratch to code
04:17 - while also um teaching while also
04:20 - learning ourselves
04:21 - and we did not even think we'd get this
04:23 - famous are we really that famous we only
04:25 - have like 5 000 subscribers
04:27 - i mean famous is like millions of
04:29 - subscribers okay
04:30 - we only started this for fun to teach
04:32 - other people

08:23 - just do them so you guys can play them
08:25 - on your own
08:26 - and we also also have the seasons

08:33 - make games
08:34 - um according to the weather like theme
08:36 - games stuff like that
08:37 - we also look at trending topics such as
08:40 - remember among us
08:41 - was popular a couple months ago um
08:44 - so like we decided to make some projects
08:46 - on that so like we
08:47 - just find some trending topics sometimes
08:49 - we um
08:50 - look get some ideas from youtube and the
08:53 - internet
08:54 - and then we make these ideas into our
08:55 - games
08:58 - okay another person asks congratulations
09:02 - congratulations what's your real name
09:04 - and where do you live
09:06 - okay so first of all our real name is
09:09 - kids coding playground so don't question
09:11 - it it's just kids coding playground
09:13 - yeah and where do you live um we live in
09:16 - antarctica just kidding we live in the
09:17 - us
09:18 - yeah so so we live in the u.s but we're
09:20 - not going to tell you what our real name
09:22 - is but let's just say your name is kids
09:24 - coding playground for now okay
09:26 - okay so adam smith asks three more
09:28 - questions from
09:30 - so this guy already asked us another
09:31 - question earlier
09:33 - so a few more questions how long does it
09:35 - take for you to prepare
09:37 - and make a tutorial video also do you
09:39 - play any other games
09:40 - if you if so which games do you like to
09:43 - play
09:44 - and how many subscribers do you gain or
09:46 - lose a day
09:47 - so yeah nice question adam so uh
09:51 - i'll answer the first question okay so
09:53 - how long does it take you to prepare for
09:54 - a tutorial video okay
09:57 - it takes a while okay so it could take a
09:59 - couple hours two weeks
10:02 - so sometimes we have to like make the
10:04 - project and after making the project we
10:06 - have to make the video
10:07 - edit the video and post the video so if
10:10 - it's a really complicated project it'll
10:12 - take
10:12 - like a week or maybe a month i don't
10:15 - know
10:16 - um if it's a simple project we already
10:18 - have it might take a couple hours maybe
10:20 - like one or two hours
10:22 - um it'll take us like another like
10:25 - like an hour to export the video and
10:27 - post it
10:28 - and also do you play guys play any other
10:31 - games
10:33 - also let me add a couple more things to
10:35 - my the first question adam asked
10:37 - um so uh so sometimes it'll take us when
10:41 - we upload a video if they make the
10:42 - thumbnail
10:43 - and add all the sprites into the google
10:45 - drive which will take some time as well
10:48 - so remember you do not need access for
10:51 - google drive just to remind you guys
10:53 - so it might take around three hours
10:56 - actually because
10:57 - you still have to upload thumbnail yeah
11:00 - and like
11:00 - yeah so also do you guys play any other
11:03 - games if
11:04 - which if so which games you like to play
11:07 - so
11:07 - i enjoy battle cats that's also a really
11:09 - fun game and minecraft
11:11 - so what about you um i enjoy playing
11:13 - brawlstars sometimes i play minecraft as
11:15 - well
11:16 - we don't play that much games we only
11:17 - play a couple of games
11:19 - i used to also play roblox but i don't
11:21 - play anymore
11:23 - also how do you how many subscribers you
11:25 - gain or lose a day
11:27 - so we gained we gained about 30
11:29 - subscribers 30 to 40 subscribers and
11:31 - yeah
11:31 - we got like 60 70. yeah that'd be rare
11:35 - so usually we get 30 or 40 subscribers a
11:36 - day and we probably lose like
11:38 - 10 subscribers a day maybe 20 sometimes
11:40 - yeah
11:41 - so yeah please subscribe thank you guys
11:44 - for subscribing
11:45 - we put so much effort please
11:48 - what um another person asks what time do
11:50 - you sleep
11:52 - okay so what time do you sleep
11:55 - usually around 10 to 10 30 p.m
11:59 - yeah 10 23
12:03 - what no just like around 10 to 10 30
12:06 - that's what we're usually okay yeah
12:07 - done okay so art's creation
12:10 - says are you a self-taught scratcher or
12:13 - have you been taking some classes like
12:14 - white pet junior and stuff
12:16 - how do you deal with haters what are
12:18 - your thoughts that
12:20 - what age group of people watch your
12:21 - videos and been substance 1k so thank
12:24 - you for subscribing since 1k
12:26 - that's pretty early thank you for
12:28 - subscribing
12:29 - and are you a self-taught scratcher no
12:31 - i'm not my dad
12:33 - um teaches scratch at a school before
12:36 - used to teach there so i i
12:38 - also used to learn with him and my
12:40 - brother also learned with him so
12:41 - second question how do you deal with
12:43 - haters um we sometimes
12:45 - ignore them or we just reply back to
12:48 - them why do you hate our videos
12:50 - yeah that's a hater yeah so like we
12:52 - don't get much haters but every once in
12:54 - a while we will see one we usually just
12:55 - ignore them now yeah
12:57 - um what are your thoughts that
13:00 - what age group of people watch your
13:02 - videos um
13:03 - i think my thoughts are fine on it
13:06 - usually
13:07 - around like nine to like 10 11 11 years
13:10 - old yeah yeah
13:11 - we could see a what age group and some
13:13 - people we have 65
13:16 - plus people yeah we have like we have
13:18 - like a chart where shows the age group
13:20 - of her
13:21 - channel but some people use her parents
13:23 - account so it's not completely accurate
13:25 - but my thoughts aren't fine i i mean any
13:28 - person can learn scratch and you age in
13:31 - any age so

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back for our 5k special so today we just hit fi i mean couple days ago we just hit 5000 subscribers thank you guys for all subscribing to our channel so today we'll be doing a q a we will have some minecraft gameplay of for the next 20 minutes yeah for us playing minecraft in the background some survival gameplay so yeah um and we'll be answering questions while you get to see some of the gameplay alright so now let's get started on the q a okay here's the first question so this person said congratulations my question uh what or who was your inspiration to start a youtube channel so i always wanted to upload we always wanted to upload videos onto youtube and we thought uploading videos on youtube would be cool and so we decided to make a scratch channel where we could teach other people how to learn scratch while making videos so it can be fun for us teaching them and they can also learn from us so our dad told us not to start a gaming channel because originally we wanted to start a gaming channel what do we have right now gamer territory we have that um so gaming series i forgot what it's called it's getting territory so yeah um uh yeah we wanted to start that but we decided that scratch would help us learn and you guys to learn so another person says my question is why do you target to code in scratch and not other software's like roblox studio and more so we target scratch because scratch is easier to learn and it's a bigger um coding platform platform yeah so that's why we chose scratch and in roblox duty i'm pretty sure you need money to buy robux yes and to make games so like i've played roblox games before so yeah yeah yeah um scratch is a better platform in my opinion uh so yeah you can create a lot of games and there's a lot of possibilities so scratch is also easier to learn than roblox studio i'm pretty sure i think i guess roblox i mean scratch is like for kids to learn coding so yeah okay so this one says uh this user asks did we have any uh experience with youtube before this channel or is this our first channel this is our first channel so we actually don't have experience with youtube we thought of maybe creating a youtube channel to teach kids programming so i started with with my kids to make scratch programs and games to share with other people okay so many people asked for a face reveal so i'll put all their accounts and questions up on the screen so many people ask for a face reveal we might do one later in the future if we hit like a subscriber milestone yeah subscriber milestone would be great yeah and we could do a face reveal so all of you guys yeah so it's just a facebook so you guys can stop asking us for a face reveal once we do it okay so yeah that's basically this question so just like the other comment another person asked us why are you interested in scratch or um but other programming apps so asking us why we like scratch better than other programming apps so we do do python videos sometimes we do do python on trinket.io yeah um but we are interested in scratch because it's simple for kids to learn and it was pretty simple for me and my brother to learn yeah it's just a block dragging type of thing python and like real coding is typing but this is a really simple uh thing for people to learn and also have fun so scratch is a little bit easier than the other programming languages where you have to use more logic so this person says that my question is did you start this channel for fun or you had a goal that you wanted to be a famous youtuber so we started this for fun and we also also wanted to help kids learn scratch so we wanted to teach people how to use scratch to code while also um teaching while also learning ourselves and we did not even think we'd get this famous are we really that famous we only have like 5 000 subscribers i mean famous is like millions of subscribers okay we only started this for fun to teach other people we didn't think we'd get even 100 subscribers okay so thank you guys all for subscribing yeah thank you or we wouldn't be at this goal thank you guys for 5 thousand subscribers okay so randomnub asks why are you such a good youtuber a scratch youtuber okay so first of all thank you for your support for saying our channel is good or something okay thank you and second of all i'm not sure are we um you tell me i don't know why i'm why we're so good i don't know um i don't think we're that good actually we're just mediocre for a youtuber subscriber youtuber dplus okay so uh blaster and ice or blx asks i think it's cool um my question is what is your favorite scratch game or favorite build game so our favorite my favorite scratch game at least is probably gonna be ninja five it's a pretty fun game i played that a long time ago and yeah my my favorite game is epic ninjas made by griff patch one of the most popular people you can check his channel at 19k subs um 20k i think yeah his channel is pretty good he makes cool um scratch games so yeah be sure to check him out yeah he also asked about what's your favorite build game and favorite build games probably minecraft minecraft is really fun yeah it's just really fun just builds for our next question um someone asks um congratulations which scratch project do you like the best and that you've created so far so i like this question this is a pretty good one i have a lot of um projects i like personally so i don't know which project is my favorite i'd say either the two player fighting game or the scrolling platformer or the christmas platform those three games are probably my top three favorite and so for a brother yeah um my favorite is rock blaster because i yeah that game i made that one so yeah that video blew up on our channel so thank you guys for viewing that video as well so i also like to destroy the virus game because that's a really cool game and remember wear your mask okay for me i like the center platformer that i created i thought that was really cool yeah that took us a lot of time to work on it so uh if you guys have not checked it out go check out the tutorial i'll show you how to do it or you can see the demo yeah i'll see them from uh from the beginning to and show you exactly how to how to make that game sorry if i'm pronouncing your name wrong but he says hey scratcher can you just help me with the clones ghost effect changing color topic behind a platformer i'm asking you to show it in youtube as i tried that kind of platformer several times but it didn't work okay so first of all we have a lot of videos where we use ghost effects clones and color changing we have a lot of those you can check out our playlists and our videos we have about like 200 videos so you can check that out or if you really want to learn it maybe in the future we can create a video on that so we'll see yeah we'll see this person also asks um about the change in color ghost effect on a platformer okay so in our scrolling platform remember we use the clones so like we use the clones to find where we want the spikes so we also did that among us we also did that in the mangas platformer so you guys can check that out if you want um yeah so someone asked congratulations my question is how you will get the idea for super games so i don't know if your super g our games are super but you guys can say if it's super if you want so um uh we normally look at that back at our old projects because and we just do them so you guys can play them on your own and we also also have the seasons because seasons like summer or winter because we had a christmas platform or that was for the winter we make games um according to the weather like theme games stuff like that we also look at trending topics such as remember among us was popular a couple months ago um so like we decided to make some projects on that so like we just find some trending topics sometimes we um look get some ideas from youtube and the internet and then we make these ideas into our games okay another person asks congratulations congratulations what's your real name and where do you live okay so first of all our real name is kids coding playground so don't question it it's just kids coding playground yeah and where do you live um we live in antarctica just kidding we live in the us yeah so so we live in the u.s but we're not going to tell you what our real name is but let's just say your name is kids coding playground for now okay okay so adam smith asks three more questions from so this guy already asked us another question earlier so a few more questions how long does it take for you to prepare and make a tutorial video also do you play any other games if you if so which games do you like to play and how many subscribers do you gain or lose a day so yeah nice question adam so uh i'll answer the first question okay so how long does it take you to prepare for a tutorial video okay it takes a while okay so it could take a couple hours two weeks so sometimes we have to like make the project and after making the project we have to make the video edit the video and post the video so if it's a really complicated project it'll take like a week or maybe a month i don't know um if it's a simple project we already have it might take a couple hours maybe like one or two hours um it'll take us like another like like an hour to export the video and post it and also do you play guys play any other games also let me add a couple more things to my the first question adam asked um so uh so sometimes it'll take us when we upload a video if they make the thumbnail and add all the sprites into the google drive which will take some time as well so remember you do not need access for google drive just to remind you guys so it might take around three hours actually because you still have to upload thumbnail yeah and like yeah so also do you guys play any other games if which if so which games you like to play so i enjoy battle cats that's also a really fun game and minecraft so what about you um i enjoy playing brawlstars sometimes i play minecraft as well we don't play that much games we only play a couple of games i used to also play roblox but i don't play anymore also how do you how many subscribers you gain or lose a day so we gained we gained about 30 subscribers 30 to 40 subscribers and yeah we got like 60 70. yeah that'd be rare so usually we get 30 or 40 subscribers a day and we probably lose like 10 subscribers a day maybe 20 sometimes yeah so yeah please subscribe thank you guys for subscribing we put so much effort please what um another person asks what time do you sleep okay so what time do you sleep usually around 10 to 10 30 p.m yeah 10 23 what no just like around 10 to 10 30 that's what we're usually okay yeah done okay so art's creation says are you a selftaught scratcher or have you been taking some classes like white pet junior and stuff how do you deal with haters what are your thoughts that what age group of people watch your videos and been substance 1k so thank you for subscribing since 1k that's pretty early thank you for subscribing and are you a selftaught scratcher no i'm not my dad um teaches scratch at a school before used to teach there so i i also used to learn with him and my brother also learned with him so second question how do you deal with haters um we sometimes ignore them or we just reply back to them why do you hate our videos yeah that's a hater yeah so like we don't get much haters but every once in a while we will see one we usually just ignore them now yeah um what are your thoughts that what age group of people watch your videos um i think my thoughts are fine on it usually around like nine to like 10 11 11 years old yeah yeah we could see a what age group and some people we have 65 plus people yeah we have like we have like a chart where shows the age group of her channel but some people use her parents account so it's not completely accurate but my thoughts aren't fine i i mean any person can learn scratch and you age in any age so it doesn't really matter yeah like when they're 77 they can still mark okay someone else says hi i'm a subscriber what is listed variables can you answer that please first of all thank you for subscribing and what is variables and lists so we have a lot of tutorials go check out our playlist on how to and what is we have a lot of tutorials on variables and lists so please check that out if you want to learn so someone kamala hayati says who inspired you to code and scratch that is my question and um i uh griff patch did girth patch and will wham they're really popular and they inspired me to code because in my dad because he also helped me code and yeah will win group patch had such cool games i decided to try to get cool games too so yeah okay as world says can you make a 3d game in scratch okay first of all we already have a 3d game um my friend made it it's like a 3d maze game and second of all 3d games are very complicated to make so i don't think we have time for that because we have school and all but you can check out the 3d maze my friend made if you want use the raycasting method to do it yeah so you guys can check that out if you want so the maze games on our channel videos check out our advanced tutorials i think and you'll find it uh so blaster and ice roblox another rblx i don't i don't know if that's roblox but his pfp is a roblox so he asked he says it's a comment i will watch your video q a hit your uh hit your view 100k so probably not so it's probably not going to hit 100k it's probably not going to get 100k that's hilarious we don't have like one video that just hit over okay so that's gonna be uh really tough tough yeah so just please view it thank you thank you you went 80 times okay another person asked good my question is that who taught you scratch coding website or whitehead junior okay so our dad taught us i think we already said this yeah um our dad taught us how to use scratch and white hat jr i'm not really sure about them yeah i haven't used them before so i'm not sure if they're good or bad yeah so that's why i had junior uh we've never used it so we don't know i heard from another youtuber that they said white hat is fake so it's a scam well i'm not sure about that yeah i think i think i saw a youtube video on that yeah yeah and how they had like a 13 year old not so smart okay okay whatever let's just move on to the next question case robertson also says so please make a new platformer like that so a new platformer i don't know if we have time for that but we can do that in the summer make summer instead of christmas yeah we can you can check our platform our playlist we have a couple of them in there we have like five you can check them out over there um just do the ones you haven't done i guess we have a lot of platformers if you've done them all we can make another one yeah we'll make one soon okay so thank you so aditya uh says please make a call racing game we already do have no we don't have it i mean we could make one later so yeah we don't have much time right now so i don't think we can do it right now maybe in the future we will okay so we'll keep that in mind we have a game like the failure break scene if you want to check that out it's not really a racing game but like survive out of the car and you try not to get hit by obstacles so yeah that's you can check that okay discover new things with me says he has three questions how did you know about scratch so about four years ago i think a while back um i heard we had the tech fair in where we live and then my dad told us maybe you should try out scratch because it's simple for us to learn so we did the tech fair yeah and we did scratch for the tech fair and one of the years i actually won third place for the tech fair so it was pretty cool so uh when will you do a face reveal so why do you guys want to face review five letters later later okay yeah um i don't know why people like face reveals but maybe later okay yeah are you selftaught no we are not dad taught us so yeah i think we answered the last two questions already but like we'll answer them again i guess so yeah we are not selftaught we are still learning from ourselves and progressing in scratch so yeah we we're getting kind of selftaught i guess dad kind of taught us in the beginning just started scratch so yeah okay everyone for our last question this person asks what's our
