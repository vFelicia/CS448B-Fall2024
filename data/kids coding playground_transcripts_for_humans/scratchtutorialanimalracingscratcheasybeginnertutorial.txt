00:06 - hey guys it's kids Korean playground
00:08 - here and today I'll be showing you a new
00:10 - project it's called the animal racing
00:13 - game so today we are gonna be working on
00:16 - this two-player all racing game
00:18 - basically each player controls one
00:21 - sprite hitting the arrow or D the arrow
00:24 - or D key on the keyboard to move the
00:27 - sprite the first sprite touches the
00:29 - object on the other end of the screen
00:31 - wins the game so animal racing will be
00:37 - learning these following concepts in
00:39 - scratch variables forever and repeat one
00:41 - - I don't think we learned that yet one
00:44 - key pressed touching sprite and
00:46 - broadcast message so I'll be showing you
00:50 - the demo so let's do this so it's
00:55 - actually a two-player game so it says
00:58 - one through three and it played some
01:00 - music so won't let you move what you're
01:02 - doing with one two three and then you
01:04 - control and control most right wins or
01:09 - number wins it says the cat wins and
01:12 - then you cannot move the dog while the
01:14 - cat says the Catlins so let's do it
01:17 - let's make a new project so we can
01:21 - delete this right in the beginning we
01:23 - can choose a backdrop you can just any
01:25 - of your backdrop you want but I'm gonna
01:27 - use blue sky so we can use some sprites
01:30 - you can use any sprite you want but I'm
01:33 - gonna use the cat line let's move it
01:38 - around here and you go to but we also
01:45 - might need another one so I thought the
01:48 - bear had too much costumes and it's too
01:51 - big for the thing so I decided to use
01:55 - the dog so we also need the back for the
02:02 - coach or the referee or whatever you
02:05 - call it the bat so you can change the
02:10 - costume anything you want but let's just
02:13 - the bat to 75% you want it to be more
02:16 - similar so we can also change the
02:22 - classroom to bhakti we can change this
02:27 - you might you might change the dog we
02:32 - could change the dog a spice too so
02:36 - let's we can move this around the same
02:39 - spot that's around the same so let's
02:42 - make it go to here so you can pause the
02:50 - video whenever you need it but right now
02:52 - we can take the tennis ball and the
02:54 - blues right yeah we can use this balloon
03:01 - sprite we can make the balloon smaller
03:04 - because it's a little bit too big so
03:06 - about the same size make it to 65% we
03:13 - also need the tennis ball the tennis
03:19 - ball so the tennis ball is really small
03:24 - to start out with so we can change it to
03:27 - a little bit bigger let's do let's make
03:33 - it around the same place you're out
03:36 - there yes I think that's correct but I
03:40 - have to make a variable called count the
03:47 - count bear will help us
03:48 - pop the bat count so we can so let's go
03:53 - to the bat we have to start out with the
03:56 - if green flag clicked
04:02 - it will set the count to zero we can
04:06 - hide the variable count later but we can
04:10 - do it now so we can so you cannot see
04:13 - the count or you can use the hide
04:14 - variable count on a block so I'll repeat
04:19 - three times
04:27 - it will change the count by one so keep
04:30 - on counting one two three or something
04:34 - that I know say count like you'll say
04:36 - one two three the tip of thing because
04:39 - it has to repeat the recess right those
04:41 - three times for one second or else two
04:47 - seconds to walk up to one second and
04:49 - thus a count and then you also have to
04:58 - say go afterwards because out of the
05:02 - thing so then you can so then they'll
05:10 - say go and it won't if you put in here
05:13 - I'll say it like three times so when I
05:17 - broadcast you need a broadcast message
05:21 - let's make a new message so we need the
05:24 - broadcast message named star and then
05:32 - the next thing we're gonna be working on
05:36 - is the cat flying so when I receive star
05:39 - trace oh go forever they'll wait until
05:44 - you need a wait until block the key
05:49 - right arrow you can use D for this one
05:51 - but I'm gonna use the right arrow is
05:53 - pressed then no and then you also need
05:58 - another way until and then you need to
06:02 - operator not can you write it press
06:06 - because you cannot spam the on right
06:09 - arrow so it won't be so spammy so it
06:13 - will last that so last longer so you
06:16 - cannot spam it so and then I'll move ten
06:19 - steps we can make it go to the next
06:25 - costume to make it look like it's flying
06:27 - as his two costumes the flying and then
06:33 - you can also make it do
06:36 - if then yeah if then statement touching
06:42 - the balloon or yeah the balloon or
06:45 - whatever you got for it
06:47 - just think balloon then it will
06:50 - broadcast cat wind
06:51 - they're going to be getting back to cat
06:53 - when later so we can broadcast so dog is
07:01 - exactly the same code well not exactly
07:04 - but a little bit different so we have to
07:07 - is this 4d we can use the D key whatever
07:11 - you want do you keep her this who not
07:14 - balloon what we need the tennis ball cuz
07:17 - dogs like tennis Bruce and then we also
07:20 - need a new message instead of gonna made
07:22 - this dog so next next ones back to the
07:34 - bat and then when I received cat wind
07:38 - and it'll say the cat winds and then
07:51 - I'll stop everything you can duplicate
07:59 - that dog win and say the dog and then
08:12 - for the dog and cat you always have to
08:15 - do when I receive cat wind that means
08:18 - they'll stop other scripts so you cannot
08:20 - move when you're when we stop some
08:22 - scripts in this right not stop all
08:24 - they're also back you're not safe and
08:25 - winds so we got to do this I'm cat wind
08:28 - and then we often eat dumplings we can
08:31 - move this into the cat so I got someone
08:39 - to play this for me on we can play it
08:42 - together so you click this one good
08:44 - reason
08:45 - and clicking it won't work so I'm the
08:48 - dog right now we click do to make it
08:50 - move and I'll get the tennis ball and
08:52 - the dog wins so that's basically how it
08:56 - is before we're done we also have to add
09:00 - the music when you can use any music you
09:04 - want but I'm gonna use the simple music
09:07 - eggs and then you'll go forever and play
09:14 - sound eggs so that's basically it

racing will be learning these following concepts in scratch variables forever and repeat one I don't think we learned that yet one key pressed touching sprite and broadcast message so I'll be showing you the demo so let's do this so it's actually a twoplayer game so it says one through three and it played some music so won't let you move what you're doing with one two three and then you control and control most right wins or number wins it says the cat wins and then you cannot move the dog while the cat says the Catlins so let's do it let's make a new project so we can delete this right in
