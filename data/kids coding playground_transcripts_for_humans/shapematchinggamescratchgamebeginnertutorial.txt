00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello and welcome back to kids going
00:09 - play today we'll be making a shape
00:11 - matching game in scratch so before we
00:14 - begin don't forget to like share and
00:15 - subscribe if you want to see more videos
00:17 - like this so let's show you guys the
00:20 - project so you just use the left and
00:22 - right arrow keys to move around and up
00:24 - and down arrow keys is to change the
00:26 - shape and you basically try to match the
00:27 - shape to gain points and if you don't
00:30 - match then you don't get points so say I
00:33 - don't match then it just doesn't gain
00:35 - any points and so yeah you just try to
00:38 - match it and try to get as much score as
00:40 - you can and um so yeah it's pretty much
00:43 - the game it's pretty simple game for
00:44 - beginners and let's start a new project
00:47 - guys
00:49 - so new project all right so what we want
00:53 - to do is first reame project of course
00:55 - so shape matching
00:57 - game matching game all right we're going
01:01 - to delete the scratch cat and okay so
01:04 - for I have the I have the Sprite already
01:07 - for um the shapes and stuff but I'll
01:09 - show you guys how to draw it on your own
01:11 - okay so what you want to do is get a
01:14 - paint okay and I made a different
01:17 - costume I made five different costumes
01:18 - so we have a square um a triangle a
01:22 - rhombus a circle and a rectangle so
01:25 - these are my five shapes and to make
01:27 - these um it's pretty simple so for the
01:30 - square what I did was I just took the
01:32 - square tool um I made it a certain color
01:36 - you hold down shift and then you can
01:37 - make a perfect square and what I want to
01:40 - do what you want to do is to make the um
01:43 - Square align with the Crosshair here you
01:46 - see the Crosshair down here so you want
01:48 - to make um this line up like that so you
01:51 - want to make all the Sprites like this
01:53 - you don't want to Center your Sprites
01:55 - because some Sprites are different sizes
01:57 - and shapes than others so we want to
01:59 - make it all uniform so they're all in
02:01 - the same position so you want to
02:02 - position all your Sprites like this so
02:04 - if I can go to the other Sprite you can
02:07 - see that all the Sprites are positioned
02:09 - in the same position like right above
02:11 - the Crosshair in the middle so you don't
02:13 - want to censor your Sprites so something
02:14 - like this like in the um in the ballpark
02:17 - area just do something like that so
02:19 - that's how you do a square to draw a
02:21 - triangle all you have to do is get the
02:23 - reshaped tool so select it and you can
02:25 - just uh delete one of the corners so you
02:27 - backspace and you got a triangle and
02:29 - then what you can do just rotate it um
02:31 - like that so you can hold on shift and
02:34 - then there you go you got your triangle
02:36 - all right and for um Circle uh you can
02:40 - just use the circle tool um and you want
02:43 - to make all your Sprites different
02:45 - colors um so Circle and oh rectangle uh
02:49 - Square you just draw you just duplicate
02:51 - your Square Sprite and just rotate it on
02:53 - the side and the rectangle you can just
02:55 - draw with the tool circle of course you
02:58 - just hold on shift draw draw a circle
03:00 - pick a different color and of course you
03:02 - have to make it a little bit above the
03:04 - center of the uh Crosshair like that and
03:07 - of course make different colors all
03:09 - right so that's how you draw the Sprites
03:12 - I already have it in my backpack so here
03:13 - are my five Sprites for the
03:16 - player so first let's make some
03:18 - variables let's make the variable
03:19 - score for all Sprites and then in the
03:23 - square in the player first we're going
03:24 - to go uh when green flag is clicked we
03:27 - are going to set the score to zero
03:31 - and then next I'm going to set this uh
03:33 - the Sprite to be somewhere uh near the
03:35 - center of the bottom so we're going to
03:37 - say go
03:39 - to x0 and Y 175 so that'll be somewhere
03:45 - like down here all right and then I'm
03:48 - going a forever Loop so this going to be
03:49 - the movement for the Sprite so I'm going
03:51 - to say move forever
03:54 - if uh right arrows press key right
03:59 - arrows press
04:01 - then we're going to say change the X by
04:03 - 10 so it's going to move 10 to the right
04:05 - and then we could just duplicate this
04:07 - right click duplicate if left arrow is
04:08 - pressed then we go X by
04:12 - -10 all right and then um next what
04:15 - we're going to do is uh make it so you
04:17 - can change the costume all right so
04:19 - we're going to say when the up arrows
04:22 - press so when up arrows pressed we're
04:26 - going to go next
04:27 - costume and we also want to make it so
04:30 - you can go back a costume so we're going
04:32 - to say going duplicate that so when down
04:34 - errors press we're going to say switch
04:36 - the
04:37 - costume to costume number minus one so
04:41 - it's going to go back one one costume
04:43 - number all right so we're going to say
04:45 - switch costume to costume number minus
04:48 - one costume
04:53 - number minus
04:55 - one all
04:57 - right okay so this is our player Sprite
05:00 - let's try it out so you can move left
05:01 - and right you go up it'll go next
05:03 - costume you go down it'll go back a
05:06 - costume all right so yeah so this is our
05:10 - player Sprite and then for the um shape
05:13 - that drops down all we have to do is
05:15 - just duplicate the player Sprite but we
05:17 - just delete the code so for um this one
05:20 - we're going to name it uh shape drop
05:23 - shape drop and we can just go ahead and
05:26 - delete all these blocks in the shape
05:28 - drop area and what we want to do is get
05:31 - when green flag clicked when green flag
05:33 - is clicked we can um clear graphic
05:36 - effects and the shape drop and we're
05:39 - going to make it so um the shapes will
05:41 - spawn from somewhere here to here up
05:43 - here so they'll fall from that area so
05:46 - we're going to say go to x and then
05:49 - we're going to say pick random for x -
05:51 - 180 to 180 and then we're going to say y
05:54 - 150 so it's somewhere up in the sky up
05:57 - at the top
05:59 - all right and then we're going to say
06:00 - switch costume to pick random 1 to five
06:03 - since there's five costumes so different
06:05 - shapes will fall so we're going to say
06:07 - pick random 1 to
06:09 - five and then we're going to
06:11 - say set we're going to make a new
06:13 - variable all right so we're going to
06:15 - make a new variable we're going to name
06:16 - it
06:17 - color so for color this is going to
06:20 - change the color of the Sprite so this
06:22 - doesn't really do much it's just going
06:24 - to make uh your Sprite change color so
06:27 - it's just for fun more um decoration or
06:30 - more add a little uh a little bit extra
06:33 - to your game so we're going to say set
06:34 - color to pick random 1 to 200 so be
06:38 - different colors falling down and we
06:40 - need to use a variable because uh we'll
06:42 - need to use it to control uh later
06:44 - functions all right and then so next
06:47 - we're going to say set color effect to
06:51 - the variable
06:53 - color and then we're going to
06:55 - show all right and then this is the code
06:58 - to make it draw so we're going to say
07:00 - forever we're going to say change y by
07:06 - -3 and I'm going to say we're going to
07:09 - make it so once it reaches uh the bottom
07:12 - it's going to disappear and go back to
07:13 - the top so we're going to say
07:17 - if the Y position is less than -
07:21 - 180 so we're using this instead of
07:23 - touching Edge because sometimes the
07:24 - shapes can be on the side and touch the
07:27 - side of the edge and that's not good we
07:28 - don't want it to reset because of that
07:30 - negative 180 sorry so um when the Y
07:34 - position is less than negative
07:36 - 180 we're going to
07:39 - hide and then we can just duplicate this
07:41 - code right here and uh so it will
07:44 - restart at the top and do
07:47 - that all right and then next what we
07:51 - going to do is get out one green flag
07:53 - clicked when green fly clicked we can
07:55 - get it
07:57 - forever and if
08:01 - so we're going to say if it's touching
08:02 - the player and the costume number is
08:04 - equal to the costume number of the
08:06 - player so if it's the same exact shape
08:09 - and it's touching the player then we
08:11 - have to broadcast a message and hide
08:12 - this shape drops Sprite so we're going
08:14 - to say if so we're going to get and and
08:18 - equal so let's put that like that so
08:20 - we're going to say
08:22 - if touching
08:25 - player touching
08:28 - player and
08:30 - costume number is equal to the costume
08:31 - number of the player so has to be the
08:33 - same exact costume for it to change
08:35 - color and disappear so say costume
08:37 - number is equal to the costume number of
08:39 - the player so we're going to take that
08:42 - and we have to change the second one
08:43 - before we change the first one so I say
08:44 - player and costume number then we're
08:47 - going to hide hide the
08:49 - Sprite the shape drop and then we're
08:52 - going to broadcast a message and we're
08:53 - going to name it matched so it knows
08:55 - that it
08:56 - matched matched all right
09:00 - and with the match we're going to go
09:01 - back to the player so when I receive the
09:03 - variable I mean the broadcast message
09:05 - match and we can change the score by
09:08 - five change score by five and then we're
09:11 - going to set the color effect to the
09:13 - variable color so it will switch to the
09:15 - color of the shape that
09:18 - dropped set color
09:22 - effect to the variable's color all right
09:27 - so that's all the code for the player
09:28 - and all the code for the shape drop so
09:31 - one last thing is get a backdrop so I
09:33 - think I use the um the stage I'm try to
09:37 - find it Spotlight okay yeah I use this
09:39 - one so we're going to hide the variable
09:41 - color let's keep the score all right so
09:42 - let's save let's play it so you move
09:46 - around it's not a match it won't work
09:47 - let's try to switch
09:49 - it as you can see when you touch it it
09:51 - changes the score and it changes the
09:54 - color as it
09:57 - matches there you go
10:00 - so another idea for you guys is you can
10:03 - make it so you can show when it wins and
10:05 - when you lose maybe something if you
10:07 - don't match something then you lose
10:09 - points or when you get to a certain
10:11 - score you're going to win so you can add
10:13 - that on your own and one last thing um
10:16 - one way you can clean up the code here
10:18 - as you can see there's like repeated
10:20 - code right so what we can do is make
10:22 - something called a custom
10:24 - block so with a custom block you don't
10:26 - have to repeat code it'll be easier uh
10:29 - to reuse the code later so we can name
10:30 - it like uh color
10:33 - change so that's our custom block color
10:36 - change so what we can do is take this
10:39 - code out put it right here and all we
10:42 - have to do is uh call it right here and
10:45 - we can remove that because it's the same
10:47 - exact thing and we can just call the
10:49 - function right here and it will do the
10:51 - same exact thing uh just looks more
10:53 - cleaner so let's play
10:56 - it all right
11:01 - as you can see it's uh working so yeah
11:04 - that's our simple game for today uh
11:07 - simple shape matching game for beginners
11:09 - if you have uh any questions please be
11:12 - uh sure to ask in the comment section
11:13 - below and if you did enjoy this video

11:17 - to kids going to playground and I'll see
11:19 - you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to kids going play today we'll be making a shape matching game in scratch so before we begin don't forget to like share and subscribe if you want to see more videos like this so let's show you guys the project so you just use the left and right arrow keys to move around and up and down arrow keys is to change the shape and you basically try to match the shape to gain points and if you don't match then you don't get points so say I don't match then it just doesn't gain any points and so yeah you just try to match it and try to get as much score as you can and um so yeah it's pretty much the game it's pretty simple game for beginners and let's start a new project guys so new project all right so what we want to do is first reame project of course so shape matching game matching game all right we're going to delete the scratch cat and okay so for I have the I have the Sprite already for um the shapes and stuff but I'll show you guys how to draw it on your own okay so what you want to do is get a paint okay and I made a different costume I made five different costumes so we have a square um a triangle a rhombus a circle and a rectangle so these are my five shapes and to make these um it's pretty simple so for the square what I did was I just took the square tool um I made it a certain color you hold down shift and then you can make a perfect square and what I want to do what you want to do is to make the um Square align with the Crosshair here you see the Crosshair down here so you want to make um this line up like that so you want to make all the Sprites like this you don't want to Center your Sprites because some Sprites are different sizes and shapes than others so we want to make it all uniform so they're all in the same position so you want to position all your Sprites like this so if I can go to the other Sprite you can see that all the Sprites are positioned in the same position like right above the Crosshair in the middle so you don't want to censor your Sprites so something like this like in the um in the ballpark area just do something like that so that's how you do a square to draw a triangle all you have to do is get the reshaped tool so select it and you can just uh delete one of the corners so you backspace and you got a triangle and then what you can do just rotate it um like that so you can hold on shift and then there you go you got your triangle all right and for um Circle uh you can just use the circle tool um and you want to make all your Sprites different colors um so Circle and oh rectangle uh Square you just draw you just duplicate your Square Sprite and just rotate it on the side and the rectangle you can just draw with the tool circle of course you just hold on shift draw draw a circle pick a different color and of course you have to make it a little bit above the center of the uh Crosshair like that and of course make different colors all right so that's how you draw the Sprites I already have it in my backpack so here are my five Sprites for the player so first let's make some variables let's make the variable score for all Sprites and then in the square in the player first we're going to go uh when green flag is clicked we are going to set the score to zero and then next I'm going to set this uh the Sprite to be somewhere uh near the center of the bottom so we're going to say go to x0 and Y 175 so that'll be somewhere like down here all right and then I'm going a forever Loop so this going to be the movement for the Sprite so I'm going to say move forever if uh right arrows press key right arrows press then we're going to say change the X by 10 so it's going to move 10 to the right and then we could just duplicate this right click duplicate if left arrow is pressed then we go X by 10 all right and then um next what we're going to do is uh make it so you can change the costume all right so we're going to say when the up arrows press so when up arrows pressed we're going to go next costume and we also want to make it so you can go back a costume so we're going to say going duplicate that so when down errors press we're going to say switch the costume to costume number minus one so it's going to go back one one costume number all right so we're going to say switch costume to costume number minus one costume number minus one all right okay so this is our player Sprite let's try it out so you can move left and right you go up it'll go next costume you go down it'll go back a costume all right so yeah so this is our player Sprite and then for the um shape that drops down all we have to do is just duplicate the player Sprite but we just delete the code so for um this one we're going to name it uh shape drop shape drop and we can just go ahead and delete all these blocks in the shape drop area and what we want to do is get when green flag clicked when green flag is clicked we can um clear graphic effects and the shape drop and we're going to make it so um the shapes will spawn from somewhere here to here up here so they'll fall from that area so we're going to say go to x and then we're going to say pick random for x 180 to 180 and then we're going to say y 150 so it's somewhere up in the sky up at the top all right and then we're going to say switch costume to pick random 1 to five since there's five costumes so different shapes will fall so we're going to say pick random 1 to five and then we're going to say set we're going to make a new variable all right so we're going to make a new variable we're going to name it color so for color this is going to change the color of the Sprite so this doesn't really do much it's just going to make uh your Sprite change color so it's just for fun more um decoration or more add a little uh a little bit extra to your game so we're going to say set color to pick random 1 to 200 so be different colors falling down and we need to use a variable because uh we'll need to use it to control uh later functions all right and then so next we're going to say set color effect to the variable color and then we're going to show all right and then this is the code to make it draw so we're going to say forever we're going to say change y by 3 and I'm going to say we're going to make it so once it reaches uh the bottom it's going to disappear and go back to the top so we're going to say if the Y position is less than 180 so we're using this instead of touching Edge because sometimes the shapes can be on the side and touch the side of the edge and that's not good we don't want it to reset because of that negative 180 sorry so um when the Y position is less than negative 180 we're going to hide and then we can just duplicate this code right here and uh so it will restart at the top and do that all right and then next what we going to do is get out one green flag clicked when green fly clicked we can get it forever and if so we're going to say if it's touching the player and the costume number is equal to the costume number of the player so if it's the same exact shape and it's touching the player then we have to broadcast a message and hide this shape drops Sprite so we're going to say if so we're going to get and and equal so let's put that like that so we're going to say if touching player touching player and costume number is equal to the costume number of the player so has to be the same exact costume for it to change color and disappear so say costume number is equal to the costume number of the player so we're going to take that and we have to change the second one before we change the first one so I say player and costume number then we're going to hide hide the Sprite the shape drop and then we're going to broadcast a message and we're going to name it matched so it knows that it matched matched all right and with the match we're going to go back to the player so when I receive the variable I mean the broadcast message match and we can change the score by five change score by five and then we're going to set the color effect to the variable color so it will switch to the color of the shape that dropped set color effect to the variable's color all right so that's all the code for the player and all the code for the shape drop so one last thing is get a backdrop so I think I use the um the stage I'm try to find it Spotlight okay yeah I use this one so we're going to hide the variable color let's keep the score all right so let's save let's play it so you move around it's not a match it won't work let's try to switch it as you can see when you touch it it changes the score and it changes the color as it matches there you go so another idea for you guys is you can make it so you can show when it wins and when you lose maybe something if you don't match something then you lose points or when you get to a certain score you're going to win so you can add that on your own and one last thing um one way you can clean up the code here as you can see there's like repeated code right so what we can do is make something called a custom block so with a custom block you don't have to repeat code it'll be easier uh to reuse the code later so we can name it like uh color change so that's our custom block color change so what we can do is take this code out put it right here and all we have to do is uh call it right here and we can remove that because it's the same exact thing and we can just call the function right here and it will do the same exact thing uh just looks more cleaner so let's play it all right as you can see it's uh working so yeah that's our simple game for today uh simple shape matching game for beginners if you have uh any questions please be uh sure to ask in the comment section below and if you did enjoy this video don't forget to like share and subscribe to kids going to playground and I'll see you guys in the next video
