01:59 - so
02:03 - and then say food or something
02:09 - that does not sound right but anyways
02:12 - we're
02:12 - pretty cool looks like his translated
02:15 - japanese looks like but
02:17 - it's good yep looks like if you
02:20 - select chinese parentheses simplifier
02:23 - traditional then it actually would work
02:25 - so you cannot just type chinese on there
02:28 - so it's pretty good

02:40 - so this person named scratcher saggy um
02:43 - made this project so i remember playing
02:46 - this game when it was
02:48 - new but it's kind of like um
02:51 - a platformer slash maze it's basically
02:54 - like a um
02:56 - a bunch of like red zombies i guess that
02:58 - chase the blue one
03:01 - and you try to escape them
03:05 - and when you get hit by one of them then
03:06 - you just die
03:08 - like that so that's what happens it's
