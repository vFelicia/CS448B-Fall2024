00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here today we're back for
00:10 - another video described today we'll be
00:13 - designing our own space city build a
00:15 - space city
00:18 - let's play it
00:20 - so you see there's a little character
00:22 - and you're basically the leader of the
00:24 - smaller space city and you can build
00:26 - whatever you want
00:28 - have our building here so that's one
00:30 - building
00:32 - two buildings three buildings four
00:35 - buildings or do you want five buildings
00:37 - so i'm just gonna go three buildings
00:39 - and you can click on these to design
00:42 - your own
00:44 - decorations
00:45 - so you see our trees you can on and off
00:49 - and you have our lights
00:52 - and our dome so that's pretty cool
00:56 - windmills to get some clean energy
01:00 - and none so just reset everything so if
01:02 - you use five you turn on everything
01:05 - and you click this it'll turn it back so
01:08 - this is clear all
01:10 - so yeah it's pretty cool build your own
01:13 - city
01:14 - make whatever your creativity
01:19 - says
01:20 - so yeah
01:23 - so that's what we'll be creating today
01:25 - so i'm going to create the project so
01:30 - so of course we delete the scratch cat
01:32 - and the first thing we get was
01:35 - is um
01:37 - a ripley
01:41 - so he's our astronaut
01:45 - and the size of 50 if you're not
01:47 - mistaken
01:49 - pretty sure it's 50.
01:51 - and um
01:54 - when the green flag is clicked
01:57 - it will go to this position
02:01 - and it will go to the front layer
02:05 - so now we're going to work on our
02:09 - little thing that holds up the city
02:12 - so we have our ripley so we just
02:14 - finished our ripley so now let's get all
02:16 - our sprites in so we need the dome that
02:19 - holds up the city
02:21 - the number sprite so choose how much
02:24 - buildings you want
02:25 - the building itself
02:28 - the um the tree or light or window
02:33 - and then we have our trees
02:37 - our
02:38 - our lights over here to get this one and
02:42 - our cover or slash dome
02:45 - and our windmill
02:47 - that's all our sprites we have
02:50 - so yeah
02:53 - so let's go over each sprite so we're
02:55 - gonna start with the cup the little
02:57 - thing that holds up the
03:00 - building so we have two colors we put
03:04 - the
03:05 - two colors together by using the
03:08 - function
03:09 - and i'm a duplicate so we can
03:12 - yeah it's just an oval
03:14 - with the same
03:16 - color
03:18 - and we have our lines we just draw lines
03:21 - that are the same color as the oval they
03:23 - have to blend with the same color on the
03:25 - top of the oval so it looks realistic so
03:28 - and the outline is 10 so we use that to
03:33 - so i'm gonna draw the oval for you real
03:35 - quick so we have a circle
03:39 - we have a circle
03:42 - and we just reshape it
03:45 - looks kind of like a boat
03:47 - so yeah we put it over here
03:50 - and then we click on this little dot and
03:52 - click backup space
03:54 - and then you can delete that
03:57 - and now you got your low oval
03:59 - so now let's move on to the next right
04:00 - sprite two also known as the numbers so
04:03 - it's just a circle
04:05 - and um
04:07 - all
04:07 - a number inside so one two three or four
04:10 - or five and that's how much buildings
04:11 - you want in each one
04:13 - so you can write anything inside there
04:16 - four and five in the buildings uh so my
04:19 - dad drew the buildings so all of these
04:21 - buildings so this is building two this
04:23 - is the three building one four building
04:25 - one five building one and these are just
04:28 - the individuals
04:30 - so yeah we've done the building and this
04:32 - is the one so this is tree
04:35 - and this is the lights
04:37 - this is the dome
04:39 - slash cover
04:41 - and this is the windmill which is um
04:44 - the windmills and the clear off
04:48 - so we have all of these
04:51 - and we have our trees so we draw
04:55 - a tight of a flat
04:57 - square so
04:59 - draw a flat square so we do that
05:03 - and we rotate it and reshape to make it
05:06 - look kind of like a parallelogram
05:09 - so that's the top of our tree and we do
05:12 - that with the sides
05:14 - so we can put that on and then this is
05:16 - just a line
05:19 - so
05:20 - uh yeah now we're on the lights so this
05:22 - is just a line with a circle and another
05:24 - circle and another circle so
05:27 - it's just yeah pretty easy to draw
05:31 - you see it's just a circle with outline
05:34 - and
05:36 - a green outline
05:38 - and a circle
05:40 - which is all white
05:42 - and
05:44 - a no outline and there's a little stick
05:48 - for the light which is 10 thickness and
05:52 - now we're on the cover
05:54 - so the cover is
05:57 - um just
05:59 - an oval type of shape
06:01 - cyan color no outline yeah
06:04 - and the windmills or are just
06:07 - lines
06:08 - that kind of look like nut lines um
06:11 - rectangles
06:12 - and circles that just kind of look um
06:15 - that are just
06:17 - i mean another just resh shaped so
06:20 - we see we have our reshape tool and we
06:23 - can change
06:24 - what the wings of the little
06:27 - windmill
06:29 - and the circle inside no outline gray
06:31 - color
06:33 - so yeah this is our review over this uh
06:40 - so this drawing so now let's begin but
06:42 - first let's get our backdrop
06:44 - so
06:46 - our backdrop is going to be
06:50 - search up space
06:52 - so you can either use space
06:55 - space 81 or space 82 but i'm just going
06:58 - to use space 82 for this demonstration
07:01 - and
07:02 - so let's start we have a ripley done
07:05 - and now let's do the dome so when the
07:08 - green flag is clicked
07:10 - i have the coordinates and it'll go to
07:11 - the front layer
07:16 - never done that let's get on the button
07:18 - so we can let's go the button so when
07:21 - the green flag is clicked
07:24 - we'll go to the front layer
07:27 - and it will switch costume
07:30 - to costume one
07:32 - and it'll go to
07:34 - i already have the coordinates you know
07:36 - create a clone of myself
07:39 - and then when
07:41 - um
07:43 - when i start as a clone
07:46 - it will go to the front layer
07:49 - so
07:50 - as you can see we have all the different
07:52 - numbers on one sprite
07:55 - so that's really cool so we'll teach you
07:57 - how to do that and it'll switch costume
07:59 - so we'll switch costume
08:01 - to
08:02 - costume number plus one so it'll start
08:06 - going to the next costume so
08:08 - you see costume number
08:12 - plus one because we start one two three
08:16 - four five and it'll add up all the
08:18 - costumes we'll add the costumes and
08:20 - we'll change x by 35 so between oh we
08:24 - have the first one it'll move 35 and
08:26 - then it'll go to the second one and
08:27 - third one and fourth one and fifth one
08:29 - and that's all in one sprite and it's
08:30 - pretty cool because
08:32 - it says one two three four five and now
08:34 - we're going to change x by
08:38 - 35 and
08:40 - we need if then
08:44 - if then
08:46 - you need not
08:49 - if then the costume number is equal to
08:51 - five
08:52 - can't go more than five buildings
08:54 - because that's the max we have here
08:59 - then it will create clone
09:01 - of myself
09:06 - and now when this sprite is clicked
09:11 - so um when this sprite is clicked we
09:14 - need to create a new variable so i'm
09:15 - going to create all of them in one go so
09:18 - it's called building numbers so
09:22 - whatever number your building is on
09:26 - so we have to finish up our variables so
09:28 - we have
09:29 - show
09:31 - hide
09:32 - cover so that's our dome
09:34 - we have show
09:37 - hide
09:40 - light
09:43 - we also have
09:44 - show
09:46 - hide
09:48 - tree these are the trees and we also
09:51 - have show
09:53 - hide and you guessed it windmill
09:57 - how about we have all of our variables
09:59 - down so we set building number to
10:01 - costume number so that's gonna be
10:03 - whatever costume
10:06 - you choose how many buildings you choose
10:07 - one two three whatever you know
10:09 - broadcast a new message
10:13 - called
10:14 - change building
10:19 - so the next thing we're going to work on
10:21 - is the building itself
10:23 - so let's click on that so when the green
10:26 - flag is clicked
10:28 - it will go to
10:29 - the position we already have it at
10:32 - it'll go to the back layer
10:36 - because this would be behind the dome
10:38 - you know from the donut would not look
10:40 - as good and i'll switch costume
10:43 - to building one
10:48 - and because that's the default one so it
10:50 - strips up like that
10:52 - and then when i receive change building
10:54 - so we have change building then i'll
10:55 - switch costume
10:58 - to building number
11:03 - so i'm gonna test it out real quick
11:05 - so we have our numbers already so one
11:08 - building two building three four five
11:11 - four four yeah so it seems to be working
11:14 - so
11:15 - now we're going to work on
11:17 - the
11:18 - sprite to change the trees and
11:21 - windmills and
11:22 - whatever
11:23 - so when the green flag is clicked
11:25 - you'll go to the front layer
11:28 - it'll switch costume to costume one
11:34 - and it will go to x we already have it
11:36 - the position
11:38 - and it'll create clone of myself
11:42 - and then when i start as a clone
11:44 - it will go to the front layer
11:48 - you know switch costume so this is the
11:51 - uh the same thing that we did with the
11:53 - other sprite you know switch costume
11:56 - to costume number plus one
12:00 - so you see i'm gonna add the costumes
12:03 - right now
12:08 - and now we have that it'll change x by
12:10 - 40 so it's just a little little gap
12:12 - between
12:13 - both of them
12:17 - and and then you need to if then
12:21 - so
12:21 - if then
12:23 - not
12:25 - so this is what what we did with the
12:27 - other sprite but it's just a little bit
12:29 - different so equals five
12:32 - if
12:33 - the costume number is equal to five
12:38 - then it will
12:40 - create clone of myself
12:45 - so we use five because we have five
12:47 - costumes you see
12:49 - one two three four five and if you
12:51 - wanted to add something extra like
12:54 - um
12:55 - electricity
12:57 - dome or or whatever you would have to do
13:00 - six
13:01 - uh six instead of five so
13:04 - keep in mind
13:05 - so
13:07 - when this sprite is clicked
13:12 - then it will if then
13:16 - if then costume number equals one which
13:18 - is our trees
13:20 - so if the costume number is equal to one
13:27 - then
13:28 - you'll broadcast show trees we have a
13:30 - lot of
13:31 - so and then we'll go to the trees later
13:34 - but let's just finish all of that first
13:36 - so show trees
13:38 - and then we duplicate
13:40 - so if that cost numbers equal to two
13:42 - this time then it'll show lights instead
13:44 - of showing trees
13:48 - and we just duplicate it again so we
13:51 - have five things so custom number equals
13:53 - three
13:54 - then so do show lights we have to show
13:59 - dome
13:59 - [Music]
14:01 - and
14:03 - after show dome
14:06 - if costume number is equal to four
14:09 - then it instead of showing dome it'll
14:11 - show windows
14:14 - windmills my bad show windmills
14:18 - and then if the costume number is equal
14:21 - to five which is our last costume which
14:23 - is clear off
14:25 - then it'll broadcast
14:27 - clear
14:30 - so we have all of that code done let's
14:33 - just
14:34 - organize it a little bit
14:36 - so yeah
14:38 - so yeah we have feel free to pause here
14:40 - but we also have one more last script of
14:42 - code so when i receive clear all
14:47 - then it will
14:49 - set
14:54 - a
14:55 - show hide
14:56 - windmill
14:58 - to negative one
15:01 - and then it'll also set
15:04 - show hide light
15:08 - and
15:10 - show hide cover
15:12 - and then show hide tree so we have all
15:16 - that and it will be minus one so now we
15:19 - have to go back to sprite two
15:21 - so let's go back to sprite two
15:23 - so
15:26 - so my bad it was actually not spread to
15:28 - building
15:29 - so when i receive
15:32 - not change building when i receive
15:34 - cleaner all then i'll switch costume and
15:36 - building one that's the default
15:38 - you want to switch the costume back to
15:39 - the first one
15:42 - and now we're done with that
15:44 - um we're also done with sprite six which
15:46 - is also our um
15:49 - change thing so now we can move on to
15:51 - the trees so when the green flag's
15:53 - clicked
15:54 - uh it'll hide
15:58 - because
15:58 - you might not want trees in your uh
16:00 - place but yeah you might not want trees
16:03 - inside your space city so it will hide
16:04 - in the beginning and it'll go to
16:06 - the position we have it at and it'll set
16:12 - you know set show hide tree the one that
16:14 - we made earlier
16:15 - to negative one
16:19 - and then when i receive clear all
16:25 - the no hide
16:27 - because you cleared everything
16:30 - and now when i receive
16:34 - show
16:34 - trees then it will go to the front layer
16:40 - it will go backward one layer
16:43 - because it's in the front layer but it's
16:45 - not
16:46 - uh it's not like completely in the front
16:50 - like there's still one thing in front
16:52 - you want to be behind this little you
16:54 - see this little dome over here that's
16:55 - carrying the buildings you want to be
16:56 - behind that you'll go back with one
16:58 - layer
16:59 - and it will set
17:04 - show hide tree
17:06 - to
17:10 - show high tree
17:12 - times negative one
17:18 - so
17:19 - that and then you need if then else
17:22 - so if then else if then
17:24 - show
17:26 - is equal show hide tree
17:30 - is equal to one
17:33 - then it will show
17:35 - because one is it will show
17:38 - else it will hide
17:42 - so
17:43 - the reason for this is
17:45 - we set show hide three to negative one
17:48 - and negative one times negative one is
17:50 - one
17:51 - so if show high tree is one that means
17:53 - you'll show so one is shelf negative one
17:56 - is hide so
17:57 - uh
17:59 - and the next time it'll be one times
18:01 - negative one we which equals negative
18:03 - one so it will hide because you click on
18:05 - it so let's just try this out let's just
18:07 - show so when you click on the tree
18:10 - focus on the show hide tree variables
18:11 - i'm gonna put it up here so you can
18:15 - see it so focus on this so you click on
18:18 - the tree you see it goes to positive one
18:20 - and that's when the tree spawn when you
18:22 - click on it again it'll be negative one
18:23 - and that's when the trees go so you can
18:25 - just
18:26 - yeah
18:28 - so we're done with the trees and now i'm
18:30 - gonna do the lights which is basically
18:32 - the same code but we just
18:35 - uh
18:36 - change it a little bit
18:39 - so we put in everything
18:41 - so
18:44 - so when the green flag is clicked
18:45 - instead of set show high tree with my
18:47 - bad
18:48 - oh there's a set show high tree
18:50 - oh yeah and we need to change the
18:52 - position we'll set show hide light
18:54 - because this is the lights and instead
18:56 - of going to and here it will go to here
18:59 - and then it'll clear all
19:02 - shark and then show how i treat should
19:04 - have light to negative one
19:06 - and then
19:08 - instead of show trees it's show lights
19:11 - then it'll go to the front layer and
19:12 - it'll go backwards two layers because
19:14 - it's gonna be behind the trees
19:16 - so it'll set
19:17 - show hide light
19:20 - to show hide light
19:21 - times
19:22 - negative one
19:26 - show high light times negative one and
19:28 - if show hides light
19:31 - is equal to one then those show
19:33 - elsewhere that's basically the same code
19:36 - so uh let's do it for the cover so let's
19:38 - put this in the cover
19:44 - so yeah let's do this
19:47 - so is we have to change the position
19:49 - again
19:51 - over here
19:52 - and then
19:54 - uh
19:56 - we need to go to the cover so
19:58 - and it'll set we'll actually add
20:00 - something extra and we'll set the ghost
20:02 - effect so it looks cooler
20:04 - so it will set ghost effect
20:08 - i'll set my bed
20:09 - ghost effect
20:11 - to 50
20:13 - look cooler in this have set show hide
20:16 - light
20:17 - uh it's going to be show hide cover
20:20 - and that's the same and no
20:24 - instead of
20:25 - receive show lights it's show dome
20:28 - and we don't have go to front layer or
20:31 - go backwards two layers
20:33 - and
20:34 - put this
20:35 - on
20:36 - and we go show hide light instead of
20:38 - doing show highlight we do show hide
20:40 - cover
20:41 - and we change this from the show hide
20:43 - cover
20:44 - and we change this to show hide cover
20:47 - and yeah
20:49 - so the change is variable if you don't
20:51 - know you right click and then you can
20:52 - select whatever you want but we're going
20:54 - to show hide cover because that's the
20:55 - one for this one and then uh we're going
20:58 - to do windmill so bear with me this is
21:00 - the last one
21:03 - so we're gonna drag this all in
21:07 - so let's go to our windmill here
21:10 - so
21:12 - instead of setting ghost effect we don't
21:14 - have that anymore and we'll go to a
21:16 - different position so
21:18 - by this position
21:21 - and i'll set
21:22 - show hide windmill
21:26 - and when i receive
21:28 - show hide
21:30 - show windmill
21:31 - then it will
21:33 - go to the front layer so we need that
21:35 - again go to the front layer
21:40 - go to the front layer and then it'll
21:42 - also go backwards three layers
21:44 - so it's actually going to be
21:46 - behind
21:49 - the trees and the lights
21:51 - and we have go backwards three layer and
21:53 - then in instead of set show hide cover
21:56 - it's show hide windmill instead show
21:59 - hide coverage show hide windmill over
22:01 - here
22:02 - and then show hide windmill oopsies
22:06 - show hide windmill over here
22:08 - so
22:11 - we should be done
22:13 - so let's try it out so i'm gonna hide
22:14 - all the variables first so let's go with
22:16 - variables
22:17 - bam bam bam bam bam
22:20 - so let's uh
22:21 - test it out
22:23 - full screen
22:24 - so i'm going to click on tree
22:26 - works turn it off turn it on lights work
22:29 - turn it on turn it on turn it off the
22:32 - cover
22:33 - windmill
22:35 - and clear all so let's click some random
22:37 - stuff clear all
22:39 - works as well
22:40 - so in the building number two three four
22:43 - five so let's
22:44 - do everything so yeah it seems like it

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video described today we'll be designing our own space city build a space city let's play it so you see there's a little character and you're basically the leader of the smaller space city and you can build whatever you want have our building here so that's one building two buildings three buildings four buildings or do you want five buildings so i'm just gonna go three buildings and you can click on these to design your own decorations so you see our trees you can on and off and you have our lights and our dome so that's pretty cool windmills to get some clean energy and none so just reset everything so if you use five you turn on everything and you click this it'll turn it back so this is clear all so yeah it's pretty cool build your own city make whatever your creativity says so yeah so that's what we'll be creating today so i'm going to create the project so so of course we delete the scratch cat and the first thing we get was is um a ripley so he's our astronaut and the size of 50 if you're not mistaken pretty sure it's 50. and um when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position and it will go to the front layer so now we're going to work on our little thing that holds up the city so we have our ripley so we just finished our ripley so now let's get all our sprites in so we need the dome that holds up the city the number sprite so choose how much buildings you want the building itself the um the tree or light or window and then we have our trees our our lights over here to get this one and our cover or slash dome and our windmill that's all our sprites we have so yeah so let's go over each sprite so we're gonna start with the cup the little thing that holds up the building so we have two colors we put the two colors together by using the function and i'm a duplicate so we can yeah it's just an oval with the same color and we have our lines we just draw lines that are the same color as the oval they have to blend with the same color on the top of the oval so it looks realistic so and the outline is 10 so we use that to so i'm gonna draw the oval for you real quick so we have a circle we have a circle and we just reshape it looks kind of like a boat so yeah we put it over here and then we click on this little dot and click backup space and then you can delete that and now you got your low oval so now let's move on to the next right sprite two also known as the numbers so it's just a circle and um all a number inside so one two three or four or five and that's how much buildings you want in each one so you can write anything inside there four and five in the buildings uh so my dad drew the buildings so all of these buildings so this is building two this is the three building one four building one five building one and these are just the individuals so yeah we've done the building and this is the one so this is tree and this is the lights this is the dome slash cover and this is the windmill which is um the windmills and the clear off so we have all of these and we have our trees so we draw a tight of a flat square so draw a flat square so we do that and we rotate it and reshape to make it look kind of like a parallelogram so that's the top of our tree and we do that with the sides so we can put that on and then this is just a line so uh yeah now we're on the lights so this is just a line with a circle and another circle and another circle so it's just yeah pretty easy to draw you see it's just a circle with outline and a green outline and a circle which is all white and a no outline and there's a little stick for the light which is 10 thickness and now we're on the cover so the cover is um just an oval type of shape cyan color no outline yeah and the windmills or are just lines that kind of look like nut lines um rectangles and circles that just kind of look um that are just i mean another just resh shaped so we see we have our reshape tool and we can change what the wings of the little windmill and the circle inside no outline gray color so yeah this is our review over this uh so this drawing so now let's begin but first let's get our backdrop so our backdrop is going to be search up space so you can either use space space 81 or space 82 but i'm just going to use space 82 for this demonstration and so let's start we have a ripley done and now let's do the dome so when the green flag is clicked i have the coordinates and it'll go to the front layer never done that let's get on the button so we can let's go the button so when the green flag is clicked we'll go to the front layer and it will switch costume to costume one and it'll go to i already have the coordinates you know create a clone of myself and then when um when i start as a clone it will go to the front layer so as you can see we have all the different numbers on one sprite so that's really cool so we'll teach you how to do that and it'll switch costume so we'll switch costume to costume number plus one so it'll start going to the next costume so you see costume number plus one because we start one two three four five and it'll add up all the costumes we'll add the costumes and we'll change x by 35 so between oh we have the first one it'll move 35 and then it'll go to the second one and third one and fourth one and fifth one and that's all in one sprite and it's pretty cool because it says one two three four five and now we're going to change x by 35 and we need if then if then you need not if then the costume number is equal to five can't go more than five buildings because that's the max we have here then it will create clone of myself and now when this sprite is clicked so um when this sprite is clicked we need to create a new variable so i'm going to create all of them in one go so it's called building numbers so whatever number your building is on so we have to finish up our variables so we have show hide cover so that's our dome we have show hide light we also have show hide tree these are the trees and we also have show hide and you guessed it windmill how about we have all of our variables down so we set building number to costume number so that's gonna be whatever costume you choose how many buildings you choose one two three whatever you know broadcast a new message called change building so the next thing we're going to work on is the building itself so let's click on that so when the green flag is clicked it will go to the position we already have it at it'll go to the back layer because this would be behind the dome you know from the donut would not look as good and i'll switch costume to building one and because that's the default one so it strips up like that and then when i receive change building so we have change building then i'll switch costume to building number so i'm gonna test it out real quick so we have our numbers already so one building two building three four five four four yeah so it seems to be working so now we're going to work on the sprite to change the trees and windmills and whatever so when the green flag is clicked you'll go to the front layer it'll switch costume to costume one and it will go to x we already have it the position and it'll create clone of myself and then when i start as a clone it will go to the front layer you know switch costume so this is the uh the same thing that we did with the other sprite you know switch costume to costume number plus one so you see i'm gonna add the costumes right now and now we have that it'll change x by 40 so it's just a little little gap between both of them and and then you need to if then so if then not so this is what what we did with the other sprite but it's just a little bit different so equals five if the costume number is equal to five then it will create clone of myself so we use five because we have five costumes you see one two three four five and if you wanted to add something extra like um electricity dome or or whatever you would have to do six uh six instead of five so keep in mind so when this sprite is clicked then it will if then if then costume number equals one which is our trees so if the costume number is equal to one then you'll broadcast show trees we have a lot of so and then we'll go to the trees later but let's just finish all of that first so show trees and then we duplicate so if that cost numbers equal to two this time then it'll show lights instead of showing trees and we just duplicate it again so we have five things so custom number equals three then so do show lights we have to show dome and after show dome if costume number is equal to four then it instead of showing dome it'll show windows windmills my bad show windmills and then if the costume number is equal to five which is our last costume which is clear off then it'll broadcast clear so we have all of that code done let's just organize it a little bit so yeah so yeah we have feel free to pause here but we also have one more last script of code so when i receive clear all then it will set a show hide windmill to negative one and then it'll also set show hide light and show hide cover and then show hide tree so we have all that and it will be minus one so now we have to go back to sprite two so let's go back to sprite two so so my bad it was actually not spread to building so when i receive not change building when i receive cleaner all then i'll switch costume and building one that's the default you want to switch the costume back to the first one and now we're done with that um we're also done with sprite six which is also our um change thing so now we can move on to the trees so when the green flag's clicked uh it'll hide because you might not want trees in your uh place but yeah you might not want trees inside your space city so it will hide in the beginning and it'll go to the position we have it at and it'll set you know set show hide tree the one that we made earlier to negative one and then when i receive clear all the no hide because you cleared everything and now when i receive show trees then it will go to the front layer it will go backward one layer because it's in the front layer but it's not uh it's not like completely in the front like there's still one thing in front you want to be behind this little you see this little dome over here that's carrying the buildings you want to be behind that you'll go back with one layer and it will set show hide tree to show high tree times negative one so that and then you need if then else so if then else if then show is equal show hide tree is equal to one then it will show because one is it will show else it will hide so the reason for this is we set show hide three to negative one and negative one times negative one is one so if show high tree is one that means you'll show so one is shelf negative one is hide so uh and the next time it'll be one times negative one we which equals negative one so it will hide because you click on it so let's just try this out let's just show so when you click on the tree focus on the show hide tree variables i'm gonna put it up here so you can see it so focus on this so you click on the tree you see it goes to positive one and that's when the tree spawn when you click on it again it'll be negative one and that's when the trees go so you can just yeah so we're done with the trees and now i'm gonna do the lights which is basically the same code but we just uh change it a little bit so we put in everything so so when the green flag is clicked instead of set show high tree with my bad oh there's a set show high tree oh yeah and we need to change the position we'll set show hide light because this is the lights and instead of going to and here it will go to here and then it'll clear all shark and then show how i treat should have light to negative one and then instead of show trees it's show lights then it'll go to the front layer and it'll go backwards two layers because it's gonna be behind the trees so it'll set show hide light to show hide light times negative one show high light times negative one and if show hides light is equal to one then those show elsewhere that's basically the same code so uh let's do it for the cover so let's put this in the cover so yeah let's do this so is we have to change the position again over here and then uh we need to go to the cover so and it'll set we'll actually add something extra and we'll set the ghost effect so it looks cooler so it will set ghost effect i'll set my bed ghost effect to 50 look cooler in this have set show hide light uh it's going to be show hide cover and that's the same and no instead of receive show lights it's show dome and we don't have go to front layer or go backwards two layers and put this on and we go show hide light instead of doing show highlight we do show hide cover and we change this from the show hide cover and we change this to show hide cover and yeah so the change is variable if you don't know you right click and then you can select whatever you want but we're going to show hide cover because that's the one for this one and then uh we're going to do windmill so bear with me this is the last one so we're gonna drag this all in so let's go to our windmill here so instead of setting ghost effect we don't have that anymore and we'll go to a different position so by this position and i'll set show hide windmill and when i receive show hide show windmill then it will go to the front layer so we need that again go to the front layer go to the front layer and then it'll also go backwards three layers so it's actually going to be behind the trees and the lights and we have go backwards three layer and then in instead of set show hide cover it's show hide windmill instead show hide coverage show hide windmill over here and then show hide windmill oopsies show hide windmill over here so we should be done so let's try it out so i'm gonna hide all the variables first so let's go with variables bam bam bam bam bam so let's uh test it out full screen so i'm going to click on tree works turn it off turn it on lights work turn it on turn it on turn it off the cover windmill and clear all so let's click some random stuff clear all works as well so in the building number two three four five so let's do everything so yeah it seems like it works so we've got for today so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below um what else content you want for us to post and we might do that idea so anyway see you guys next time you
