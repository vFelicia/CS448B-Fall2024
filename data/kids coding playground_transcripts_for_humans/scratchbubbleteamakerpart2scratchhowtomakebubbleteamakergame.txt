00:03 - [Music]
00:07 - thank you
00:09 - welcome back to kids clothing playground
00:11 - channel it's time to continue our
00:14 - exciting Journey with the bubble tea
00:15 - making game
00:16 - so in today's tutorial where we deep
00:19 - dive into the code for the teapot the
00:22 - tea the tea cup Sprite and start our
00:25 - bubble tea creation process so get ready
00:27 - and take your bubble tea making skill to
00:30 - the next level all right without further
00:33 - Ado let's go back and check on what we
00:35 - had last time so we had the cat let me
00:38 - just zoom in a little bit so pretty much
00:40 - here some of the code we're going to go
00:42 - through a little bit so if you guys miss
00:43 - anything be sure to click pause the
00:46 - button pause the video and check
00:47 - yourself okay so this is the cat
00:50 - this one is the customer okay
00:54 - and tapioca scoop
00:57 - [Music]
00:58 - okay tap your scoop
01:01 - and then the tapioca pearl
01:06 - okay and then I don't yeah we have some
01:09 - on the cup okay while we fill up the
01:12 - tapioca I think that is everything okay
01:15 - so today we'll be working on the teapot
01:17 - the tea the tea cup okay all right let's
01:21 - get started
01:25 - okay so what we're going to do we're
01:27 - going to start the teapot so you
01:30 - remember last time on this tapioca after
01:32 - it's done dropping topic oil we had a
01:35 - something called star T right so we're
01:37 - going to use that broadcast message so
01:38 - let's start here
01:42 - so let's start in the teapot so when
01:45 - green flag is clicked
01:48 - okay then we're gonna set the teapot to
01:51 - whatever position you can have any other
01:53 - position but here's where mine is at the
01:55 - time and I'm gonna make it point in
01:58 - Direction 90 so because later when we
02:00 - turn the teapot we're going to make sure
02:02 - that you know when we start the game
02:03 - it's always on the same position it's
02:05 - not flipped over right and then we're
02:08 - gonna say show
02:10 - [Music]
02:11 - okay and then we have the message that
02:13 - start T right we had
02:15 - so we're gonna say when I receive
02:18 - start t
02:20 - I'm gonna do the same thing make sure I
02:22 - close here again so that way I can use
02:25 - this later on to uh you know when we
02:27 - make the second T and the dirty okay I'm
02:30 - gonna use the Glide
02:32 - one second and then we want to Glide it
02:36 - like somewhere on the top here so for me
02:38 - I think I had that down negative 75 and
02:42 - 50. so as you can see you can do
02:44 - whatever kind of whatever makes sense so
02:48 - just I think this one was a little bit
02:50 - better for me it just kind of looked a
02:52 - little bit uh you know uh when it
02:55 - flipped over it looks good so I kept it
02:57 - over there this time and then I say um
03:00 - repeat 10 times
03:03 - and then here what I'm going to do is
03:06 - going to change the rotation 5 degree
03:11 - and then we'll wait for the mouse down
03:14 - just like how we did the tapioca Pro
03:17 - drop we'll make wait for the mouse down
03:19 - and then we'll start pouring the tea so
03:22 - same Midway four miles down and
03:25 - broadcast a message
03:27 - so this time we broadcast something
03:29 - called
03:30 - a message and this is called poor t okay
03:36 - and then we can play the T sound until
03:38 - done
03:40 - okay so when we broadcast party we're
03:43 - gonna go to our tea and then we're gonna
03:45 - make the T drop to the cup
03:48 - all right so next let's move it to our
03:50 - tea or we can try to do this first so
03:54 - let's say if I run this right at the
03:55 - beginning it's here if I click on this
03:57 - you can run it just to check so you can
04:00 - see the teapot gonna go there and then
04:02 - turn and then waiting for my mouse now
04:04 - when I put the mouse down then we will
04:07 - have another 14 in them right
04:10 - okay all right so that is good that part
04:14 - is working so let's click this and get
04:16 - it back over here so let's move on to
04:19 - the t uh Sprite so the tea Sprite as
04:21 - well we're gonna make the tea drop so
04:23 - let's go to the tea spray
04:25 - [Music]
04:29 - um one green black is clay
04:33 - I'm gonna hide that t so that we don't
04:36 - see it and when we receive
04:40 - quality that we just did
04:44 - 40.
04:45 - then we're gonna we're actually gonna
04:48 - create a variable first so make a
04:49 - variable called counter so this what
04:52 - we're going to do is we're going to use
04:54 - this counter to count how many T drop in
04:56 - and then when when when there's certain
04:59 - part of the T drop after certain amount
05:01 - we're gonna broadcast and start filling
05:03 - the cup so that's what we need to
05:05 - counter for that and make sure you
05:07 - create it for this Sprite only so if you
05:09 - see this T it has a t colon something
05:11 - right so this is for the Sprite only
05:13 - versus if you see something like this
05:16 - one change color change color does not
05:18 - have a Sprite name in front so this is a
05:21 - global variable and this is like a local
05:23 - variable to that Sprite okay
05:25 - all right so just hide that for now
05:29 - okay 40 we're gonna set the counter
05:33 - zero
05:35 - and we're gonna make it go to
05:38 - 20 Mega third so somewhere on top here
05:41 - so we just show it so it's like right
05:43 - here you see where the t is so I try to
05:45 - align the T where the tip of the tea
05:47 - part is after the teapot go through so
05:50 - let's say if I push this right so you
05:52 - can see so I want to align the T maybe
05:55 - it's something right here
05:58 - that's what I did okay all right so
06:02 - let's go back to the T put it back down
06:05 - okay so now let's go back to our cup
06:08 - okay so let's hide this okay all right
06:11 - so next what we're going to do is uh
06:14 - we're gonna say um repeat
06:18 - uh here we say repeat 25 times and I am
06:22 - going to create a clock myself so that
06:26 - will create more tea drop and I'll give
06:29 - it a little weight in between uh 0.1
06:33 - seconds okay and then I'm gonna change
06:36 - the counter
06:38 - so change the counter by one okay and
06:44 - then I say if
06:48 - and then we use the equal sign in the
06:50 - operator here
06:52 - and then go to the variable grab the
06:54 - counter if the counter is equal to 10
06:58 - then we're gonna broadcast another
07:00 - message
07:03 - so this one will broadcast a new message
07:05 - called fill t
07:09 - so this will fill the tea as of the tea
07:12 - will uh you know we can change the
07:14 - customer on the cup and then after the
07:16 - field and then at the very end in
07:19 - broadcast another message
07:21 - called fill a salt syrup so this is for
07:25 - us to start the syrup bottle later on so
07:28 - we don't have to worry about that right
07:30 - now we'll use that later okay
07:34 - look at this kill again so we're at the
07:36 - Portico pause if you need a little break
07:39 - okay and not continue so next we're
07:41 - gonna say whenever we create something
07:44 - when I create a clone you have to make
07:46 - sure that you have to say when I start
07:48 - as a club
07:50 - okay and when you use clone and also you
07:52 - make sure you have to delete the Clone
07:54 - as well so next we're going to use this
07:56 - thing so if so here I'm gonna add some
07:59 - code that is not going to affect the
08:01 - game right now it will affect again
08:03 - later so here we have something called
08:05 - change color so what I'm doing is uh I
08:08 - check the chain colors greater than zero
08:10 - so basically before my chain color is
08:13 - zero so when I change the cup color it
08:16 - will go on like different colors so that
08:18 - we can like don't need to draw so many
08:20 - Sprites so we can just change color
08:21 - variable to change the cup uh you know
08:24 - this bubble tea color each time the of
08:27 - the one customers serve to the next
08:29 - customer okay
08:32 - so I'm gonna say set
08:34 - setup color effect and we are going to
08:39 - set it to this variable change color so
08:41 - we're going to change it by 50 or
08:42 - whatever next time so you can see it
08:44 - I'll show you later but right now for
08:45 - now let's just continue with the code
08:50 - we're going to say uh go to
08:53 - so here we're going to say go to
08:55 - negative 20 and make it
08:59 - okay still around that and then I cannot
09:03 - say show
09:05 - okay and then what we're going to do is
09:09 - we need to repeat until
09:10 - [Music]
09:13 - okay
09:15 - and then we're going to use all
09:16 - condition from the operator
09:20 - sensing we're going to say repeat until
09:22 - it's either touching the cup
09:26 - or touching the
09:29 - teacup so basically this is the cup you
09:32 - see that no no this is the teacup with
09:35 - the tea inside okay
09:38 - [Music]
09:40 - foreign
09:51 - if not you know um scratch will have
09:54 - problem of the 300 chrome okay so we
09:57 - have that so far so right now if I play
10:00 - the game you'll see the Tea Party can
10:02 - drop T but then it doesn't change it to
10:04 - the teacup so we have to do that later
10:06 - so let's just play it for now and see
10:08 - how it looks okay so we have make bubble
10:12 - tea so the the player the customer will
10:14 - comes in
10:16 - and then we have the tapioca Pro we
10:18 - click on it so this will drop the Pearl
10:21 - here and then you see the teapot comes
10:24 - up I click on the teapot you can see the
10:26 - t is coming down so let's say this is a
10:28 - the t is a little bit low you can start
10:31 - it high so you see my T is kind of low
10:32 - right uh you can move it up like maybe
10:35 - like right here I think maybe my
10:37 - original code is a little bit different
10:38 - so maybe we can change the Y maybe
10:41 - negative five or something so instead of
10:44 - negative 30. let's change it to the
10:45 - negative thought maybe my original code
10:47 - is a little bit different than this one
10:49 - so it could be different so negative
10:51 - five so I'm going to start learning so
10:53 - now let's try this again so uh go back
10:58 - to the uh go back to the teapot I'm
11:00 - gonna say star t
11:02 - right so now you see my T is kind of
11:04 - there right so let's just hide a highly
11:07 - uh
11:08 - okay all right so when when I say start
11:11 - T it's gonna be waiting for a mouse down
11:14 - so I click on the mouse down you can see
11:16 - that he is flipping down right okay but
11:19 - right now you can see it doesn't fill up
11:21 - the T but we still have to make the tea
11:23 - fill up in the cup right so what we're
11:26 - going to do is we're going to broadcast
11:27 - a message to change the color okay
11:34 - okay so let's go back to our cup
11:37 - so our cup here when we receive a new
11:41 - message
11:42 - [Music]
11:44 - call it a portee
11:48 - then we're gonna say wait one second
11:50 - and then we're gonna broadcast a message
11:55 - new message
11:56 - called
11:58 - change
12:00 - default
12:02 - okay and then hi
12:06 - so basically we're gonna change the tea
12:09 - cup and high and so that this teacup is
12:12 - no longer there we're gonna change it to
12:14 - this teacup so now let's go to our
12:16 - teacup
12:17 - so in our teacup we can say when green
12:21 - flag is clicked
12:23 - [Music]
12:26 - say go to
12:29 - so go to the to go to the cup so that
12:32 - whenever the Cup start this key cup is
12:34 - going to be the same place and we are
12:37 - going to hide in the beginning
12:40 - okay and also when I receive a start
12:46 - is where the game start we also want to
12:48 - hide it so that way you know we don't
12:50 - want to show it and when we get our feel
12:54 - tea
12:55 - that's when we were filling up the tea
12:57 - what we can do is let's let's do it over
13:00 - here actually
13:01 - so let's say you feel tea
13:05 - here we're gonna say uh repeat
13:08 - ten times
13:10 - and then we're gonna say next cuts too
13:13 - and we're gonna do a little bit of
13:15 - weight
13:18 - 0.2 seconds then we also have this
13:22 - change tea cup that we did right so
13:25 - change tea cup so for change take up
13:27 - we're gonna say go to
13:29 - thank you
13:30 - to the cup
13:32 - okay and now we're gonna say point in
13:35 - Direction 90 so because later I'm gonna
13:37 - shake this bubble tea cup so we don't
13:40 - want to put it back on the original spot
13:42 - and also uh we're gonna put in this code
13:46 - for color change we don't need it right
13:48 - now but we will use that later so we're
13:50 - gonna say when the
13:52 - chain color
13:54 - is greater than zero double set the
13:57 - color so that way we can have like the
13:59 - green bubble tea the but you know um I
14:03 - don't know red or blue or whatever okay
14:05 - and then we're gonna change the color
14:09 - and then we are going to switch to the
14:11 - costume
14:13 - number one so that one has like no uh a
14:18 - little bit I think and then starting to
14:20 - fill up and I wanted to add the word
14:22 - shell
14:23 - okay so now let's see so now let's play
14:26 - the game again
14:29 - okay
14:31 - so you can see just zoom out a little
14:34 - bit with the code so you can see the
14:36 - tapioca pearl comes down
14:38 - so it drops down to the thing and then
14:41 - the teapot comes up and then it drops
14:44 - the T as you can see it starts
14:46 - but as you can see our our our our
14:50 - little um you know the scoop is still
14:52 - here those things were to take care of
14:54 - so now let's go back to the tapioca
14:57 - school so we're gonna have to hide it
14:59 - okay foreign
15:05 - [Music]
15:08 - happen
15:13 - [Music]
15:15 - I'm gonna hide it so hide this guy
15:19 - okay and then uh maybe we can do
15:22 - something else in the customer as well
15:24 - as
15:26 - a little change a little bit of uh you
15:29 - know costume stuff so we're gonna say
15:31 - when the tapioca drop the drop tap yoga
15:34 - we're gonna switch to
15:37 - uh costume number one we should change
15:40 - one let's duplicate this and we're gonna
15:43 - change this to Quality then we switch to
15:46 - costume number to the change one so
15:50 - let's see if we have everything
15:52 - okay so we need one more thing let's go
15:56 - back to the tea part so when we fill up
15:58 - we have something called fill the syrup
16:01 - later start the syrup so we're gonna put
16:03 - the tea light back down right after the
16:05 - tea is finished so we're gonna put the
16:07 - Pea part back down let's
16:11 - start
16:14 - start syrup
16:15 - I can change the teapot position back to
16:18 - 90 as well so that it will face to the
16:21 - right
16:22 - and we're gonna Glide one second
16:25 - back to one negative 160 and negative 25
16:31 - which is the starting position so now
16:33 - let's test the game again
16:36 - okay so let's make it bubble tea let's
16:38 - see make sure everything once
16:40 - okay here the the customer comes in
16:43 - and then we have the bubble tea cup here
16:47 - we click on this to fill the cup with
16:50 - the bubble here
16:55 - so the next part we have to work on is
16:58 - actually filling up the syrup and then
17:01 - we're going to get the straw I don't
17:03 - want to give it to the customer and then
17:04 - we also have two at this uh the icon so
17:08 - that it will show up how many how many
17:10 - persons you know to to give to to you to
17:13 - so what we can do last part is for this
17:15 - video we can add the sound so let's go
17:18 - to our backdrop
17:22 - clicked uh just say forever and then we
17:27 - can say yeah the sound a Rain Sound here
17:29 - that we can use
17:32 - rain until done and said so we test your
17:36 - game now you should hear some background
17:38 - music with the rain coming down and it
17:42 - should became a little bit interesting
17:44 - than the music and everything alright so
17:46 - you can click on this again
17:54 - and then once the tea is finished it
17:56 - Glides back and then next part will add
17:59 - this syrup and then add the lid and then
18:03 - shake the cup and then add the straw and
18:05 - give it to the customer and then make
18:07 - the icon appear finish and then go with
18:10 - the next customer and so on okay so this
18:13 - is where we're gonna stop the video for
18:15 - now and now make sure you tune in for
18:18 - the part three of this tutorial and I'll
18:21 - see you guys next time thank you bye
18:23 - [Music]
18:32 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

thank you welcome back to kids clothing playground channel it's time to continue our exciting Journey with the bubble tea making game so in today's tutorial where we deep dive into the code for the teapot the tea the tea cup Sprite and start our bubble tea creation process so get ready and take your bubble tea making skill to the next level all right without further Ado let's go back and check on what we had last time so we had the cat let me just zoom in a little bit so pretty much here some of the code we're going to go through a little bit so if you guys miss anything be sure to click pause the button pause the video and check yourself okay so this is the cat this one is the customer okay and tapioca scoop okay tap your scoop and then the tapioca pearl okay and then I don't yeah we have some on the cup okay while we fill up the tapioca I think that is everything okay so today we'll be working on the teapot the tea the tea cup okay all right let's get started okay so what we're going to do we're going to start the teapot so you remember last time on this tapioca after it's done dropping topic oil we had a something called star T right so we're going to use that broadcast message so let's start here so let's start in the teapot so when green flag is clicked okay then we're gonna set the teapot to whatever position you can have any other position but here's where mine is at the time and I'm gonna make it point in Direction 90 so because later when we turn the teapot we're going to make sure that you know when we start the game it's always on the same position it's not flipped over right and then we're gonna say show okay and then we have the message that start T right we had so we're gonna say when I receive start t I'm gonna do the same thing make sure I close here again so that way I can use this later on to uh you know when we make the second T and the dirty okay I'm gonna use the Glide one second and then we want to Glide it like somewhere on the top here so for me I think I had that down negative 75 and 50. so as you can see you can do whatever kind of whatever makes sense so just I think this one was a little bit better for me it just kind of looked a little bit uh you know uh when it flipped over it looks good so I kept it over there this time and then I say um repeat 10 times and then here what I'm going to do is going to change the rotation 5 degree and then we'll wait for the mouse down just like how we did the tapioca Pro drop we'll make wait for the mouse down and then we'll start pouring the tea so same Midway four miles down and broadcast a message so this time we broadcast something called a message and this is called poor t okay and then we can play the T sound until done okay so when we broadcast party we're gonna go to our tea and then we're gonna make the T drop to the cup all right so next let's move it to our tea or we can try to do this first so let's say if I run this right at the beginning it's here if I click on this you can run it just to check so you can see the teapot gonna go there and then turn and then waiting for my mouse now when I put the mouse down then we will have another 14 in them right okay all right so that is good that part is working so let's click this and get it back over here so let's move on to the t uh Sprite so the tea Sprite as well we're gonna make the tea drop so let's go to the tea spray um one green black is clay I'm gonna hide that t so that we don't see it and when we receive quality that we just did 40. then we're gonna we're actually gonna create a variable first so make a variable called counter so this what we're going to do is we're going to use this counter to count how many T drop in and then when when when there's certain part of the T drop after certain amount we're gonna broadcast and start filling the cup so that's what we need to counter for that and make sure you create it for this Sprite only so if you see this T it has a t colon something right so this is for the Sprite only versus if you see something like this one change color change color does not have a Sprite name in front so this is a global variable and this is like a local variable to that Sprite okay all right so just hide that for now okay 40 we're gonna set the counter zero and we're gonna make it go to 20 Mega third so somewhere on top here so we just show it so it's like right here you see where the t is so I try to align the T where the tip of the tea part is after the teapot go through so let's say if I push this right so you can see so I want to align the T maybe it's something right here that's what I did okay all right so let's go back to the T put it back down okay so now let's go back to our cup okay so let's hide this okay all right so next what we're going to do is uh we're gonna say um repeat uh here we say repeat 25 times and I am going to create a clock myself so that will create more tea drop and I'll give it a little weight in between uh 0.1 seconds okay and then I'm gonna change the counter so change the counter by one okay and then I say if and then we use the equal sign in the operator here and then go to the variable grab the counter if the counter is equal to 10 then we're gonna broadcast another message so this one will broadcast a new message called fill t so this will fill the tea as of the tea will uh you know we can change the customer on the cup and then after the field and then at the very end in broadcast another message called fill a salt syrup so this is for us to start the syrup bottle later on so we don't have to worry about that right now we'll use that later okay look at this kill again so we're at the Portico pause if you need a little break okay and not continue so next we're gonna say whenever we create something when I create a clone you have to make sure that you have to say when I start as a club okay and when you use clone and also you make sure you have to delete the Clone as well so next we're going to use this thing so if so here I'm gonna add some code that is not going to affect the game right now it will affect again later so here we have something called change color so what I'm doing is uh I check the chain colors greater than zero so basically before my chain color is zero so when I change the cup color it will go on like different colors so that we can like don't need to draw so many Sprites so we can just change color variable to change the cup uh you know this bubble tea color each time the of the one customers serve to the next customer okay so I'm gonna say set setup color effect and we are going to set it to this variable change color so we're going to change it by 50 or whatever next time so you can see it I'll show you later but right now for now let's just continue with the code we're going to say uh go to so here we're going to say go to negative 20 and make it okay still around that and then I cannot say show okay and then what we're going to do is we need to repeat until okay and then we're going to use all condition from the operator sensing we're going to say repeat until it's either touching the cup or touching the teacup so basically this is the cup you see that no no this is the teacup with the tea inside okay foreign if not you know um scratch will have problem of the 300 chrome okay so we have that so far so right now if I play the game you'll see the Tea Party can drop T but then it doesn't change it to the teacup so we have to do that later so let's just play it for now and see how it looks okay so we have make bubble tea so the the player the customer will comes in and then we have the tapioca Pro we click on it so this will drop the Pearl here and then you see the teapot comes up I click on the teapot you can see the t is coming down so let's say this is a the t is a little bit low you can start it high so you see my T is kind of low right uh you can move it up like maybe like right here I think maybe my original code is a little bit different so maybe we can change the Y maybe negative five or something so instead of negative 30. let's change it to the negative thought maybe my original code is a little bit different than this one so it could be different so negative five so I'm going to start learning so now let's try this again so uh go back to the uh go back to the teapot I'm gonna say star t right so now you see my T is kind of there right so let's just hide a highly uh okay all right so when when I say start T it's gonna be waiting for a mouse down so I click on the mouse down you can see that he is flipping down right okay but right now you can see it doesn't fill up the T but we still have to make the tea fill up in the cup right so what we're going to do is we're going to broadcast a message to change the color okay okay so let's go back to our cup so our cup here when we receive a new message call it a portee then we're gonna say wait one second and then we're gonna broadcast a message new message called change default okay and then hi so basically we're gonna change the tea cup and high and so that this teacup is no longer there we're gonna change it to this teacup so now let's go to our teacup so in our teacup we can say when green flag is clicked say go to so go to the to go to the cup so that whenever the Cup start this key cup is going to be the same place and we are going to hide in the beginning okay and also when I receive a start is where the game start we also want to hide it so that way you know we don't want to show it and when we get our feel tea that's when we were filling up the tea what we can do is let's let's do it over here actually so let's say you feel tea here we're gonna say uh repeat ten times and then we're gonna say next cuts too and we're gonna do a little bit of weight 0.2 seconds then we also have this change tea cup that we did right so change tea cup so for change take up we're gonna say go to thank you to the cup okay and now we're gonna say point in Direction 90 so because later I'm gonna shake this bubble tea cup so we don't want to put it back on the original spot and also uh we're gonna put in this code for color change we don't need it right now but we will use that later so we're gonna say when the chain color is greater than zero double set the color so that way we can have like the green bubble tea the but you know um I don't know red or blue or whatever okay and then we're gonna change the color and then we are going to switch to the costume number one so that one has like no uh a little bit I think and then starting to fill up and I wanted to add the word shell okay so now let's see so now let's play the game again okay so you can see just zoom out a little bit with the code so you can see the tapioca pearl comes down so it drops down to the thing and then the teapot comes up and then it drops the T as you can see it starts but as you can see our our our our little um you know the scoop is still here those things were to take care of so now let's go back to the tapioca school so we're gonna have to hide it okay foreign happen I'm gonna hide it so hide this guy okay and then uh maybe we can do something else in the customer as well as a little change a little bit of uh you know costume stuff so we're gonna say when the tapioca drop the drop tap yoga we're gonna switch to uh costume number one we should change one let's duplicate this and we're gonna change this to Quality then we switch to costume number to the change one so let's see if we have everything okay so we need one more thing let's go back to the tea part so when we fill up we have something called fill the syrup later start the syrup so we're gonna put the tea light back down right after the tea is finished so we're gonna put the Pea part back down let's start start syrup I can change the teapot position back to 90 as well so that it will face to the right and we're gonna Glide one second back to one negative 160 and negative 25 which is the starting position so now let's test the game again okay so let's make it bubble tea let's see make sure everything once okay here the the customer comes in and then we have the bubble tea cup here we click on this to fill the cup with the bubble here so the next part we have to work on is actually filling up the syrup and then we're going to get the straw I don't want to give it to the customer and then we also have two at this uh the icon so that it will show up how many how many persons you know to to give to to you to so what we can do last part is for this video we can add the sound so let's go to our backdrop clicked uh just say forever and then we can say yeah the sound a Rain Sound here that we can use rain until done and said so we test your game now you should hear some background music with the rain coming down and it should became a little bit interesting than the music and everything alright so you can click on this again and then once the tea is finished it Glides back and then next part will add this syrup and then add the lid and then shake the cup and then add the straw and give it to the customer and then make the icon appear finish and then go with the next customer and so on okay so this is where we're gonna stop the video for now and now make sure you tune in for the part three of this tutorial and I'll see you guys next time thank you bye thank you
