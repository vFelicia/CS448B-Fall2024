00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys in today's another
00:09 - kids coding playground video and today
00:11 - I'll be teaching you how to make a game
00:13 - called space adventures so this this
00:17 - photo right here is in 3.0 but the
00:22 - sprites are still outdated from 2.0 so
00:25 - we will be using other sprites when
00:27 - we're making the video so the point of
00:31 - the game is to survive and destroy the
00:34 - aliens we will be learning these
00:35 - following concepts keep rest I don't
00:38 - think we've learned that one yet
00:39 - position of sprite mm-hmm pick random
00:43 - touch sprite and broadcast message use
00:45 - it again so this is the demo I'll be
00:52 - showing you the demo so you use arrow
00:54 - keys to move spaces shoot and a place a
00:58 - song and then if the bug hits you you
01:02 - lose health so that's like about the
01:08 - demo and before I start please like
01:11 - share and subscribe and click the
01:13 - notification bell to support our channel
01:16 - and thank you so let's make a new
01:19 - project and let's start so the first
01:25 - thing we will get is our sprites the
01:28 - first bite will get so I was using the
01:31 - spaceship but now they don't have the
01:33 - spaceship anymore so I'll be using the
01:35 - rocket ship I want to see if this one
01:37 - works then we need the ball sprite or
01:47 - you can draw it if you want to but I'll
01:49 - be taking the ball sprite then we also
01:54 - need the ladybug sprite I think they'd
01:58 - still have this one yes they still have
02:00 - this you can use either one they also
02:03 - have the and you also have to draw one
02:07 - so you can use any font you won or any
02:10 - color I'm gonna use
02:12 - black and then we're gonna change the
02:16 - font to marker this looks a little bit
02:18 - better and then you lost so you cannot
02:24 - win in this game it's just too um just
02:28 - trying to use survive I think that's big
02:31 - enough that's around the middle yep
02:37 - around there so there we go
02:41 - and the first sprite we're gonna work on
02:43 - is the is the spaceship sprite so or the
02:50 - rocket ship sprite first we have to
02:54 - always start out with the events if flag
02:56 - clicked I think you can see that better
03:01 - point in Direction 90 um we got to make
03:12 - two variables score and feel we have to
03:23 - go and set the score to 0 so then the
03:29 - score will be 0 and then set the shield
03:31 - to 100 you can do anything you want but
03:36 - I for a hundred then we need a forever
03:41 - loop forever forever loop if on edge
03:48 - bounce so you cannot get off the screen
03:51 - then you need so you can control it with
03:55 - your arrow keys or dub yeah yeah arrow
03:59 - keys we're gonna use WASD for something
04:02 - else
04:02 - umm right arrow if key right key right
04:10 - arrow is pressed that means change X by
04:22 - ten so we can put that in duplicate it
04:26 - we can make the left don't remember not
04:29 - to overlap it I change this to negative
04:32 - 10 because left arrow and right here are
04:36 - different to get the left arrow then we
04:42 - need to make the up and down arrow if
04:44 - then you know how to do this part if
04:47 - then up arrow change X by I change Y by
04:55 - 10 and then if it's the down arrow you
05:00 - got duplicate again don't remember not
05:02 - to overlap it down arrow you need it to
05:06 - be negative 10 it's up and down are
05:09 - opposites then we also gotta use WASD
05:13 - for something else actually ad we will
05:15 - only be using a and D so forever so do
05:20 - it forever if then we need if then a key
05:30 - a not W we need only a and D and then it
05:37 - will turn 15 degrees left then we can
05:42 - duplicate that change this to D and then
05:49 - change this to by 15 degrees so you can
05:53 - pick any backdrop you won I just sat
05:55 - well let's pick a backdrop that's more
05:58 - space related so we can take you can
06:02 - take anything you want
06:03 - hmm maybe let's say space this one I
06:08 - think we should make this smaller 7 D is
06:14 - fine I guess oopsies right arrow change
06:19 - X by 10 so we're moving on to the bullet
06:24 - or the ball and we can change the color
06:29 - if you want but I'll stick with this you
06:32 - know go to and then this is the tricky
06:38 - part you need this one okay two of these
06:42 - so when you get this one you always have
06:45 - to change the back one first let's
06:46 - change it to rocket you see and then
06:48 - this one shows up but if you don't
06:51 - change that one it will work so you have
06:54 - to change the back one first and then
06:56 - you can and then you can do it and then
07:01 - so what we need exposition of rocket
07:06 - ship and then you got to go back rocket
07:11 - ship but Y position because it's the Y
07:13 - and then go hide forever
07:22 - if then key space because that's how you
07:28 - attack then go to X I guess we can
07:37 - duplicate this
07:44 - move 50 steps in show so showing the tip
07:53 - of the spaceship then we need to repeat
07:57 - until remember do not overlap them we're
08:01 - off so the game would not work actually
08:03 - this one I think we have to overlap but
08:06 - some games you don't have to overlap but
08:08 - this one we overlap a touching edge and
08:15 - move ten steps so keep up moving until
08:20 - it touches the edge then we need a hide
08:25 - right here so hide again and oh go back
08:32 - to the spaceship go to X so it's the
08:40 - same thing right so I guess this code is
08:45 - right here and then let's move on to the
08:49 - ladybug code code so let's go to the
08:52 - lead book when star or rapper you have
08:59 - to show I'll go to X we have pick random
09:07 - one pick random negative 220 2x2 222
09:17 - positive positive 220 and Y glide 1.5
09:28 - seconds
09:34 - well I would say 1 5 seconds to pick
09:41 - random 1 to 10 so we can keep that and
09:45 - then about negative on baby stick with
09:50 - that one and then I can start forever
09:57 - well you can choose any sounds you want
10:00 - I guess we can choose a space-related is
10:04 - there any space Wow mmm let's take my
10:09 - Devo let's take this one if there isn't
10:15 - a space really play medieval one until
10:18 - done so we're still in the ladybug
10:26 - forever
10:27 - we need a forever loop and you know if
10:30 - then pushing spaceship touching
10:37 - spaceship rocketship then change field
10:43 - by negative one
10:53 - then we got also have to make the other
10:56 - code so good to go if flag clicked then
11:03 - forever if then statement touching
11:09 - bullet so that's how you get score
11:12 - bullet bull then change score by one by
11:22 - one
11:22 - hi we're almost done
11:29 - you just have to go through one more
11:31 - thing that you lost sprite
11:34 - so if flag clicked hide always have to
11:40 - hide because you didn't lose in the
11:42 - beginning yet wait two seconds this wait
11:45 - two seconds is really important because
11:48 - you if you don't if you don't put the
11:51 - way two seconds I'm gonna coat it
11:53 - without the wait two seconds and then it
11:56 - doesn't work because you have to click
11:58 - the green flag twice for it to work and
12:00 - that's not good so you'll so you can
12:03 - click it once with the wait two seconds
12:05 - because oh just keep on saying that
12:08 - you've lost and you lost so because it's
12:11 - already a because you already lost the
12:12 - last one so I'd say you keep on saying
12:14 - you lost so you gotta click it twice
12:16 - that's not good
12:19 - let's change in zero I'll put in the two
12:22 - seconds later and then this one 0 so the
12:31 - shield is smaller than zero like
12:35 - negative if it will still die so show
12:39 - and stop off so I just checked it again
12:47 - and based on the different sprites and
12:50 - stuff um the ball you need a point in
12:53 - Direction 90 or
12:55 - such zero or also a be shooting out of
12:58 - another place and so we can delete this
13:03 - block of code because it doesn't really
13:04 - work so we can move on to that you loss
13:09 - you can change the color because I
13:12 - thought this colors a little bit darker
13:15 - so I'm going to change this red I think
13:17 - red looks better so and um we can also I
13:25 - think we're almost yeah so we can add
13:28 - the wait two seconds right here I think
13:34 - we can make them forgot to change the
13:38 - shift so I Stanley took out the
13:42 - shielding for testing so he has let's
13:45 - see the ball is working
13:48 - [Music]
13:51 - musics a little bit loud so I lost see
13:54 - look it works but then we can also make
13:56 - the ball smaller because this is make a
13:59 - little bit too big to make it 60 I think
14:05 - this is freaking thanks for watching
14:07 - guys and have a good day
14:10 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome back guys in today's another kids coding playground video and today I'll be teaching you how to make a game called space adventures so this this photo right here is in 3.0 but the sprites are still outdated from 2.0 so we will be using other sprites when we're making the video so the point of the game is to survive and destroy the aliens we will be learning these following concepts keep rest I don't think we've learned that one yet position of sprite mmhmm pick random touch sprite and broadcast message use it again so this is the demo I'll be showing you the demo so you use arrow keys to move spaces shoot and a place a song and then if the bug hits you you lose health so that's like about the demo and before I start please like share and subscribe and click the notification bell to support our channel and thank you so let's make a new project and let's start so the first thing we will get is our sprites the first bite will get so I was using the spaceship but now they don't have the spaceship anymore so I'll be using the rocket ship I want to see if this one works then we need the ball sprite or you can draw it if you want to but I'll be taking the ball sprite then we also need the ladybug sprite I think they'd still have this one yes they still have this you can use either one they also have the and you also have to draw one so you can use any font you won or any color I'm gonna use black and then we're gonna change the font to marker this looks a little bit better and then you lost so you cannot win in this game it's just too um just trying to use survive I think that's big enough that's around the middle yep around there so there we go and the first sprite we're gonna work on is the is the spaceship sprite so or the rocket ship sprite first we have to always start out with the events if flag clicked I think you can see that better point in Direction 90 um we got to make two variables score and feel we have to go and set the score to 0 so then the score will be 0 and then set the shield to 100 you can do anything you want but I for a hundred then we need a forever loop forever forever loop if on edge bounce so you cannot get off the screen then you need so you can control it with your arrow keys or dub yeah yeah arrow keys we're gonna use WASD for something else umm right arrow if key right key right arrow is pressed

have to overlap but this one we overlap a touching edge and move ten steps so keep up moving until it touches the edge then we need a hide right here so hide again and oh go back to the spaceship go to X so it's the same thing right so I guess this code is right here and then let's move on to the ladybug code code so let's go to the lead book when star or rapper you have to show I'll go to X we have pick random one pick random negative 220 2x2 222 positive positive 220 and Y glide 1.5 seconds well I would say 1 5 seconds to pick random 1 to 10 so we can keep that and then about negative on baby stick with that one and then I can start forever well you can choose any sounds you want I guess we can choose a spacerelated is there any space Wow mmm let's take my Devo let's take this one if there isn't a space really play medieval one until done so we're still in the ladybug forever we need a forever loop and you know if then pushing spaceship touching spaceship rocketship then change field by negative one then we got also have to make the other code so good to go if flag clicked then forever if then statement touching bullet so that's how you get score bullet bull then change score by one by one hi we're almost done you just have to go through one more thing that you lost sprite so if flag clicked hide always have to hide because you didn't lose in the beginning yet wait

seconds right here I think we can make them forgot to change the shift so I Stanley took out the shielding for testing so he has let's see the ball is working musics a little bit loud so I lost see look it works but then we can also make the ball smaller because this is make a little bit too big to make it 60 I think this is freaking thanks for watching guys and have a good day
