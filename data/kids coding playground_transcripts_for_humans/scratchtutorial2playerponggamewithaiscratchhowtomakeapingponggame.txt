00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:08 - playground and today we'll be making a
00:10 - two player pawn game with the ai so
00:13 - maybe like about a year ago we made a
00:16 - uh pond game for two players but this
00:19 - time we're going to improve the game and
00:20 - add an ai to it as well
00:23 - and some new improved features like
00:25 - making the ball move quicker when you go
00:28 - um when you play for a longer time stuff
00:30 - like that
00:31 - and so yeah so we're gonna make a more
00:34 - advanced version today so let me show
00:36 - you guys the demonstration of this so
00:38 - you can either do player versus player
00:40 - or player versus ai
00:42 - let's turn on the volume a little all
00:44 - right so player versus player
00:47 - it's just
00:48 - like as usual
00:50 - like this first the seven wins
00:53 - first seven points all right
00:55 - so
00:56 - clear versus ai so as you can see i'm
00:58 - the right side of yours
00:59 - okay so you see the ai
01:03 - so the ai is like it tries to follow
01:06 - like the position of the ball
01:10 - and once you play for like over 20
01:12 - seconds or something like that
01:14 - then they will increase the speed of the
01:15 - ball
01:19 - as you can see the ball speed is
01:20 - increased
01:22 - as if you can see that yeah
01:25 - also you can open the timer right here
01:27 - as you can see
01:29 - you plan
01:31 - like when the timer reaches a certain
01:33 - amount it resets the timer every single
01:35 - time
01:36 - uh the point is over but
01:39 - as you can see when the timer gets to 20
01:41 - the ball will speed up
01:45 - let me just get there
01:46 - [Music]
01:52 - all right so now it's 20 seconds as you
01:53 - can see the ball moves a little bit
01:55 - quicker
01:56 - so yeah um we will be creating new
01:58 - project let's create a new project
02:01 - okay
02:02 - so first let's delete the scratch cat
02:05 - and upload our backdrop so this will be
02:08 - in the link in the description
02:10 - so i actually have a uh
02:12 - something from my backpack
02:14 - this
02:15 - backdrop so
02:16 - we're gonna be using this one
02:18 - it looks like a real like ping pong
02:19 - table i guess
02:21 - and then we have the two uh
02:23 - paddles this one's for player one or the
02:25 - ai and this is the player two
02:28 - all right so that's it for the
02:32 - thing so i'll show you guys how to use
02:33 - it how to like draw it so if you want to
02:35 - draw your own i'm going to show you how
02:37 - to like draw it i guess so they actually
02:39 - already have a paddle in the sprite
02:40 - library if you want to use that you can
02:42 - use that one or you can use our own so
02:44 - what we did was just draw
02:46 - a paddle like it was just oops let me
02:49 - center it again so it's just like a
02:51 - green uh
02:52 - square but then we have some like brown
02:54 - outline around it so that's pretty much
02:56 - it it's pretty simple to draw you can
02:58 - make it any color you want it doesn't
02:59 - have to be green i guess
03:01 - but yeah it's pretty simple to draw
03:04 - i don't think you'll have any problem
03:05 - with that
03:07 - and then
03:08 - we have uh the buttons so let's
03:11 - get the buttons
03:12 - so let me find it all right button one
03:15 - let me just duplicate this and then we
03:17 - can get two buttons
03:19 - so this button one
03:21 - i'll name it player versus player so
03:24 - this button one is pvp player versus
03:26 - player
03:28 - we're going to like
03:31 - let's put like a text right here
03:34 - so
03:35 - maybe make it red so it's easier to see
03:37 - pvp
03:40 - so we have the pvp
03:43 - let's make it bigger
03:45 - center
03:46 - alright so now we have the pvp button
03:49 - and then we can do a player versus ai
03:52 - so we can name it like
03:55 - p
03:58 - v
03:59 - a ai
04:00 - maybe like pvs maybe
04:03 - yes
04:04 - [Music]
04:05 - that looks better
04:07 - that looks better i'm gonna change the
04:09 - other one too
04:11 - this makes it look a little
04:12 - better let me shrink it a little bit you
04:14 - can hold down alt so it won't move
04:16 - everywhere
04:18 - change this to player
04:20 - yes
04:22 - player and make it a little bit smaller
04:26 - there you go so now i have the two
04:27 - buttons player versus player and player
04:29 - versus ai
04:32 - all right so we're gonna first start on
04:34 - the buttons with the coding
04:36 - so we're gonna start on the player
04:38 - versus player
04:39 - so let's go to the code and in the
04:41 - beginning we're going to make it go to
04:42 - this position i already have the
04:44 - position down
04:46 - so i'm going to go to negative 75
04:48 - zoom in
04:50 - negative 75
04:52 - y90 that's the position i had from the
04:54 - game and i'm going to show
04:56 - the uh sprite in the beginning
04:58 - and then when this sprite is clicked we
05:00 - are going to
05:02 - uh when the sprite is clicked we're
05:04 - going to broadcast a message
05:07 - called
05:09 - v s
05:10 - p so player versus player and we're
05:12 - going to hide
05:14 - so once you click the button we're going
05:15 - to hide it and then we're going to
05:18 - go to the second button the button too
05:21 - i'm going to rename it
05:22 - to p
05:25 - pb
05:26 - pvs ai let me change the other name as
05:30 - well
05:31 - to ebs
05:33 - so
05:35 - player versus player and player versus
05:36 - ai so let's go to the other button
05:38 - so in the other button we are going to
05:40 - get a one green flag clicked
05:43 - we're going to go to where
05:45 - the 75
05:47 - and then we're going to 90
05:50 - and then we're going to show
05:54 - and
05:55 - when the sprite is clicked
05:57 - we're going to broadcast
05:59 - another message
06:01 - called p
06:02 - vsai
06:04 - pvs ai
06:06 - and then we're going to hide
06:08 - so when the player clicks on player
06:10 - versus player we want to hide this
06:12 - sprite as well so
06:13 - when i receive player versus player
06:15 - we're going to hide here
06:16 - and vice versa from the other one player
06:19 - vs player we are going to
06:20 - unreceive player versus ai
06:23 - we are going to hide
06:25 - all right
06:27 - now we can go to the paddles also i
06:30 - forgot to add the ball sorry about that
06:31 - we need to add the ball obviously so we
06:34 - can just get that from here
06:36 - ball
06:38 - uh how big should it be honestly maybe
06:40 - like 20 no it's too small
06:42 - maybe like 50 yeah that's probably
06:45 - better 50 50 is probably the right size
06:47 - for the ball
06:48 - so now we have the ball sprite
06:50 - and then
06:51 - so now we're going to go to our paddle
06:54 - player 1 or ai paddle
06:56 - so in the beginning
06:59 - actually let's code for the ball first
07:01 - because in the ball we have uh
07:04 - we have some code that we we're going to
07:06 - broadcast something
07:07 - into the player the paddles
07:10 - so
07:11 - oops
07:12 - sorry about that let's go to the ball
07:14 - now start coding in here
07:18 - okay so now we're in the ball
07:20 - start coding in here
07:21 - so as you can see i click the play
07:23 - button so i can make both the buttons
07:25 - like go to their position so this is the
07:26 - position
07:27 - where they are
07:29 - all right so let's start coding in here
07:31 - so
07:32 - when i receive the message
07:35 - let's see when i receive the message
07:38 - player versus player
07:40 - we're going to broadcast a message
07:42 - called start game
07:47 - start game and then we're going to
07:50 - when i receive
07:52 - player
07:53 - versus ai we're going to broadcast our
07:55 - game
07:56 - and then we are going to
07:59 - broadcast a message another message so
08:01 - we'll need this for later
08:03 - not for now but it's going to be called
08:04 - ball position
08:06 - ball position
08:08 - and
08:09 - we're going to make some more variables
08:10 - we're going to make two variables
08:12 - player
08:14 - one score for all sprites
08:17 - and we're also going to make another
08:19 - variable called player two score
08:22 - so player one score player two score
08:24 - and then so we're going to get a one
08:27 - green flag clicked
08:28 - we're going to set the
08:31 - player
08:33 - one score to zero and we're gonna set
08:36 - the player two score to zero
08:39 - and we're gonna set the size to fifty
08:40 - percent
08:42 - like i have so set the size of fifty
08:44 - percent
08:46 - and then right here we're going to when
08:49 - i receive the start game so when i
08:51 - receive start game
08:54 - we are going to wait one second so
08:56 - usually we want to wait one second so
08:57 - both players are ready
08:59 - in the beginning so we're gonna wait one
09:02 - second before starting the game
09:04 - and go again forever loop
09:06 - so we're going to make it remember the
09:07 - variable we make a new variable called
09:10 - ball speed
09:12 - ball speed so basically
09:15 - the ball speed is basically how fast the
09:17 - ball will move
09:18 - so now we have to make a
09:21 - new custom block
09:23 - before we move on to this part
09:25 - so we need the ball speed to make those
09:27 - change the speed of the ball so we'll
09:29 - need the ball speed because like
09:31 - remember i said when the timer increases
09:33 - we will increase the speed of the ball
09:35 - so that's why we'll need that so we're
09:37 - going to make a new block
09:39 - we're going to name it set
09:41 - up uh
09:42 - ball so setup ball
09:45 - okay
09:46 - so we're gonna have to define it
09:49 - so instead of ball we are going to go to
09:51 - zero zero which is the center of the
09:53 - screen
09:54 - the origin of the coordinate plane so
09:56 - zero zero and then we're going to if
09:58 - else so
10:00 - basically this is a pick random of which
10:01 - side the ball is going to go to so if
10:06 - we're going to pick random so we're
10:08 - going to need equal so we're going to
10:09 - pick random
10:12 - right here so pick a random 1 to 2 and
10:14 - if it's equal to 1 then we're going to
10:16 - point direction of 60
10:18 - which is this right side so as you can
10:20 - see
10:21 - see the direction right here 60 so it's
10:23 - gonna point this way
10:25 - so
10:26 - we're going to point direction of
10:30 - 60. yeah on
10:33 - else we're going to point direction of
10:34 - negative 60 so point the opposite
10:36 - direction
10:39 - negative 60 and then we're going to
10:42 - reset the timer so remember i said that
10:44 - we're going to need the timer later so
10:47 - we're gonna have to reset the timer and
10:48 - then we're gonna set the ball speed to
10:49 - 10 so in the beginning ball speed will
10:52 - be 10
10:53 - and we're gonna obviously need to use
10:55 - this block to use this so we're gonna
10:58 - run it right here
11:00 - okay and then next let's go back to our
11:03 - start game script right here so we're
11:04 - going to move
11:06 - the amount of balls speed steps so
11:09 - whatever this is whatever the value of
11:11 - this variables
11:12 - and then we're going to get an if on
11:14 - edge bounce so if it's on if it's
11:16 - touching the edge it'll bounce
11:18 - and
11:20 - if
11:21 - the ball is touching
11:23 - it is touching player 1 or ai the sprite
11:26 - touching player 1 or ai the sprite then
11:29 - it's going to start some pop
11:32 - just like the basic pop sound
11:35 - and
11:36 - uh
11:38 - and then it's going to turn
11:40 - we're going to make it turn so if it's
11:41 - touching
11:42 - this paddle it's going to turn this way
11:44 - so it's going to always move this way so
11:46 - we're going to make it turn 170 to 270
11:49 - degrees
11:52 - to 270
11:54 - degrees and then i'm going to get
11:56 - another if then statement and put it
11:58 - inside this one so if
12:01 - if uh the direction is greater than
12:03 - negative 179 so if it's like
12:06 - past this part
12:08 - or the direction is less than negative
12:10 - ones which is like right here
12:13 - so if it's less than negative one
12:15 - like on this side
12:17 - so it's like somewhere between here and
12:19 - here
12:20 - the direction is greater than
12:22 - negative
12:23 - or negative one so negative one's about
12:26 - right here
12:27 - then it's going to
12:29 - we're going to get this or
12:32 - we're gonna do
12:34 - greater than
12:36 - so the direction
12:39 - is greater than negative 179
12:44 - or it's
12:46 - less than negative one
12:53 - direction less than negative one then we
12:56 - are going to point direction
13:00 - of 60 to 145 so be pointing this way so
13:04 - the ball will be traveling to the side
13:06 - so one direction of 60
13:09 - to 145
13:15 - so basically 60 to 145 would be like
13:18 - somewhere right here
13:19 - to somewhere right here so it'd be like
13:22 - here to here so like basically pointing
13:26 - from
13:27 - this side going either this way or this
13:29 - way so let me set it back to 90.
13:32 - okay so
13:34 - and then next after this we want to
13:37 - broadcast the message
13:38 - ball position remember ball position
13:41 - so basically ball position is just going
13:43 - to position the ball
13:45 - like keep track of where the ball is and
13:48 - then we're going to get an if-then
13:49 - segment so another one so
13:52 - if
13:53 - the x-position is greater than 288 288
13:56 - like right here if it's greater than it
13:58 - so it's like towards this point
14:02 - if x position
14:03 - is greater than 288
14:08 - to 28 sorry 220 not 288
14:12 - um
14:13 - we're gonna have to change
14:15 - the player one score by one because the
14:17 - ball is past this area so that means
14:19 - it's touching this side so that means
14:21 - player one will get a point
14:23 - so player one
14:25 - gonna have to change the player one
14:28 - score by one and we're going to have to
14:30 - call the variable setup ball again after
14:32 - the point is over and then we're going
14:34 - to wait one second before starting up
14:36 - again and then we're going to do ball
14:37 - position
14:39 - basically we can just duplicate this put
14:41 - it under
14:43 - if ball position if x position we're
14:45 - going to change this around
14:47 - i'm going to do this so it's easier to
14:48 - see so if x position
14:51 - is less than negative
14:54 - 228
14:57 - which is the left side and that means
14:59 - we're going to change the player two
15:00 - scored by one because they scored on
15:02 - player one
15:03 - and this is just the same
15:04 - all right
15:06 - so that's what we have so far for this
15:08 - and this
15:10 - all right
15:11 - so next we want to work on the ball
15:14 - position we're going to receive the
15:16 - message
15:17 - so when this sprite receives the message
15:19 - ball position
15:21 - we're going to repeat until touching the
15:24 - player one so the ball is going to
15:26 - repeat until it's touching the player
15:28 - one or ai
15:29 - so this is to keep track of where the
15:31 - ball is
15:33 - so
15:34 - uh we're going to get a repeat until
15:38 - and then we're going to get a touching
15:41 - clear one for
15:43 - the ai
15:44 - and we're going to
15:45 - make a new variable going to name it
15:47 - ball y
15:50 - so ball wide is the y position of the
15:51 - ball
15:52 - so we're going to set the
15:54 - we're going to set the ball wide
15:57 - to the floor of y position so basically
15:59 - we don't want any decimal numbers so
16:01 - we're going to round down which is the
16:02 - floor so
16:04 - we just have to get the absolute value
16:06 - one
16:07 - select the floor which is rounding down
16:09 - oh it's right here
16:11 - it's in alphabetical order
16:13 - so we're gonna get the y position right
16:15 - here
16:16 - so the floor of the y position whatever
16:17 - the y position is and we're gonna keep
16:20 - track of this every 0.1 seconds
16:24 - so yeah
16:26 - oops all right uh so basically
16:29 - so that is it for the ball code that's
16:32 - basically it so i'm going to zoom out so
16:34 - you guys can take a look at it
16:37 - gonna go down a little bit
16:43 - so yeah okay that's and that's pretty
16:44 - much it for the ball we might come back
16:46 - and add some other stuff like maybe
16:49 - increasing the speed when the
16:51 - um timer increases
16:54 - all right
16:57 - i'm gonna uncheck these variables real
16:59 - quick and you can do this
17:02 - to represent the score for each side
17:04 - all right
17:05 - double click on them remember you can
17:07 - double click on them to
17:09 - do that
17:11 - let me make this back to zero all right
17:14 - there you go
17:15 - so that's how you make it like that you
17:17 - have to have to double click or you can
17:18 - just right click on it
17:20 - okay and then next let's go back to the
17:22 - uh paddles let's go to the paddles
17:25 - so inside the paddle for the player one
17:27 - or ai i'm going to go when green fly
17:29 - clicked
17:30 - zoom in a little when gray flat clicks
17:32 - we are going to go to
17:34 - the exposure negative 200 and y position
17:36 - of zero
17:37 - so it's like right here
17:39 - and then
17:40 - when i receive
17:43 - uh player versus
17:44 - ai then we are going to get a forever
17:47 - loop
17:49 - forever
17:50 - if on edge bounce
17:52 - so basically the
17:55 - the paddle won't like go off screen it
17:57 - would just like bounce on the sides so
17:59 - we're going to get a if on edge bounce
18:02 - and repeat
18:04 - until
18:06 - the y position is equal to the ball y
18:10 - all right so right now we want to make
18:12 - the y position of the paddle is equal to
18:14 - the ball y because we want the ai to
18:17 - like be like to the relative position of
18:20 - the ball to try to like hit it back so
18:22 - we are going to do when if the y
18:24 - position repeats of the y position is
18:26 - equal to the ball y
18:28 - the y this is the y position of the
18:30 - paddle by the way
18:31 - and we're going to fl streaming so if
18:34 - else put in here
18:36 - if y position is greater than
18:39 - the ball y
18:42 - y position so the y position is greater
18:44 - than the ball y so that means the paddle
18:47 - is like up here
18:48 - and the ball is like down here so it's
18:50 - like below it then we're going to move
18:52 - the paddle down so we're going to have
18:54 - to do
18:55 - change the y
18:56 - by negative eight
18:58 - because the paddle is above the ball so
19:00 - you want to move it down
19:02 - else you want to change it by positive
19:03 - eight because then the ball y would be
19:06 - over on
19:07 - like
19:08 - up here and the paddle will be down here
19:10 - so you want to move the ai panel up
19:13 - and then we're going to get an
19:15 - unstatement so if
19:19 - the score player one score oops
19:22 - player one score is equal to seven so
19:24 - we're gonna do first to seven
19:26 - player one score is equal to seven
19:30 - then we will broadcast a message called
19:32 - player one wins
19:35 - player
19:36 - player 1
19:41 - and then we are going to duplicate this
19:43 - right click duplicate
19:45 - when i receive player versus player
19:47 - if on edge bounce we can remove this
19:51 - part and remove this part
19:53 - we can keep this bottom part don't
19:55 - delete it
19:56 - we'll get two if not statements so if
19:59 - we're going to do w and s for the
20:01 - movement so if key w is pressed
20:04 - w is pressed then we're gonna move
20:07 - change the y
20:08 - by eight let's duplicate this
20:12 - and if
20:13 - the
20:14 - key s is pressed oops
20:17 - s
20:18 - is pressed
20:19 - then we're going to change the y by
20:21 - negative eight
20:23 - and we're going to put this in in the
20:24 - bottom
20:26 - okay so now we have the movement for the
20:28 - ai and player one
20:30 - let's move on to player two
20:32 - let's go to our player two sprite
20:34 - so for the position for player two since
20:37 - this one is negative two hundred zero
20:39 - we're going to make this one positive
20:40 - two hundred
20:41 - so we're going to get a one green flag
20:43 - clicked
20:44 - and we're going to do go to x two
20:46 - hundred and y 0.
20:49 - and what i'm going to do is just go in
20:50 - here and drag and drop this into player
20:52 - 2 so then i can just instantly duplicate
20:54 - it here
20:55 - so
20:56 - instead right here we're going to do
20:58 - when i receive start game
21:01 - because there's no ai for player 2
21:03 - it's just the player
21:05 - and forever if on edge bounce this code
21:08 - should all be the same except for this
21:10 - so we're going to do up arrows and down
21:12 - arrow instead
21:14 - and this one should be player two score
21:16 - is equal to seven then we're gonna
21:17 - broadcast another message and we're
21:19 - gonna name it player two
21:21 - wins
21:22 - okay
21:24 - so player two wins
21:26 - and we can make a you win
21:28 - uh sprite so basically we can just make
21:31 - a new sprint
21:32 - okay so now we're going to make the
21:35 - you win and you lose part for this thing
21:38 - so we just made a new sprite painted
21:40 - and then we're going to use red because
21:42 - it's easy to see and then for the first
21:44 - one we're going to do player 1 or ai
21:48 - wins
21:49 - if you want to add like
21:51 - player 1 wins and ai wins separately
21:53 - then you have to broadcast another
21:55 - message within the paddle
21:57 - so
21:58 - i'm gonna go into here
22:00 - code and basically instead right here
22:02 - you just do player the ai wins right
22:05 - here and then player one wins right here
22:08 - so basically that's pretty much it
22:10 - and then we're going to increase the
22:12 - size of this
22:15 - maybe a little bit bigger
22:17 - and then we're going to duplicate this
22:19 - this one is
22:21 - player 1
22:24 - player
22:26 - 1
22:28 - or ai
22:30 - and this one we will do
22:32 - called player 2
22:35 - and we're going to delete this and for
22:37 - player 2 wins
22:41 - move this right here
22:43 - make it a bit bigger
22:45 - that's great all right
22:47 - so that's pretty much what we want let's
22:49 - go to the code for this thing
22:51 - when green flag clicked we go to zero
22:53 - zero
22:54 - so with the center in the beginning and
22:57 - then we're gonna hide
23:00 - and then we're going to when
23:02 - i receive
23:04 - player two wins
23:05 - that we're going to switch costume to
23:07 - the player 2
23:09 - and then we're going to show and then
23:11 - we're going to stop all so basically
23:13 - it's going to switch costume to player 2
23:14 - wins if we player 2 wins and then we're
23:17 - going to stop all we're going to
23:18 - duplicate this and when player 1 wins
23:21 - we're gonna switch costumes to player
23:22 - one or ai and that's pretty much it
23:25 - okay so now
23:27 - we can add some last minute like touches
23:29 - on the game
23:30 - so we can just add different colors for
23:33 - the button
23:34 - maybe we can make this one
23:37 - the normal one but this one we can make
23:38 - it a different color
23:40 - because we can uh
23:42 - just make it look better in general so
23:44 - we're gonna make it like maybe yellow
23:47 - yeah we can make it yellow
23:49 - or you can use the this thing so you can
23:53 - mix different colors
23:55 - uh let's mix like
23:57 - some like this color i guess this color
23:59 - is pretty good
24:00 - yeah see that yeah
24:03 - and maybe on the outside we can do
24:06 - like blue
24:09 - maybe like
24:11 - swap it
24:12 - there you go
24:14 - maybe you can use this one yeah this one
24:16 - likes it like that so yeah
24:18 - that's pretty much it
24:20 - for the buttons and then next we can go
24:22 - to the
24:23 - was it the i think it's the ball yeah
24:26 - inside the ball we can do the
24:29 - the um timer thing let's zoom in
24:34 - when
24:35 - i receive the start game so whenever you
24:37 - start game we're going to forever
24:41 - uh we're going to if
24:44 - timer is greater than 20.
24:46 - so if the timer is greater than 20
24:48 - seconds
24:50 - maybe you can do 10 just for testing
24:52 - purposes uh we're going to set the ball
24:54 - speed to 12 so we're going to increase
24:56 - the speed by a little bit
25:00 - and we can just duplicate this
25:02 - and if the time is greater than 20
25:05 - i guess we can do 15.
25:07 - and you can add even more and more you
25:09 - can just keep on doing it forever if you
25:11 - wanted but yeah we're just gonna put two
25:13 - for now
25:14 - i actually forgot to put the player two
25:16 - in
25:17 - because we're working on everything else
25:18 - i forgot to use this one so we're gonna
25:20 - have to do the detection for player two
25:22 - as well so we are going to actually
25:24 - duplicate all of this
25:27 - and delete this
25:29 - and we just take this out
25:33 - and put this under
25:36 - right here and then we'll put this in
25:38 - after
25:39 - so first we are going to do if touching
25:42 - player two
25:43 - we're going to do the pop sound as well
25:46 - but instead of turning to the right
25:47 - we're gonna have to turn to the left
25:49 - because it's player two you hit to the
25:51 - left side
25:52 - so we're going to turn to the left and
25:54 - put this in
25:55 - and then if
25:57 - if the direction is like that greater
25:59 - than 179 instead because this is
26:01 - the other side so we're going to have to
26:03 - do 179 and the direction is less than
26:06 - one
26:07 - then we are going to point direction of
26:09 - negative 60 because you have to face the
26:12 - left side
26:13 - not the right because we're on the right
26:14 - side already so we're going to do that
26:17 - and then broadcast bulb position then
26:19 - just put this
26:20 - on the bottom
26:24 - you can also take this out this is not
26:26 - very necessary because we already have
26:28 - it down here it's not very necessary for
26:29 - the ai we already have it down here so
26:32 - you can take that out as well
26:33 - so
26:34 - let's go play the game
26:43 - so since we forgot to do the player two
26:45 - code i'm gonna like show you all the
26:47 - code
26:48 - so then you can
26:50 - take down any code you did not do
26:52 - earlier
26:55 - so
26:58 - that's pretty much it
27:02 - okay so now i think we demonstrate the
27:05 - game
27:07 - all right so let's do player versus ai
27:09 - first
27:11 - so you can see the ai is going towards
27:13 - the ball
27:15 - everything's working out fine
27:22 - you can see i think the ball is moving
27:23 - faster because the timer
27:26 - forgot to turn yeah i see the ball is
27:28 - going way quicker now
27:30 - see that yeah
27:32 - so yeah uh now let's try out the players
27:34 - player i think should be the same oh i
27:36 - forgot to hide that thing as well
27:39 - let me
27:42 - how did that not connect okay i don't
27:44 - know why
27:45 - okay whatever
27:47 -  i already it should have been like
27:48 - that
27:49 - i don't know how it disconnected but
27:51 - okay player versus player yeah so
27:53 - basically just like that
27:58 - yeah okay now let me score on one person
28:00 - first so we can finish this
28:06 - so i can show you what happens if you
28:08 - win or lose
28:12 - you need seven to win
28:15 - all right that's it so when you win it's
28:17 - just as player two wins
28:19 - so yeah that's pretty much it for this
28:21 - tutorial thank you guys for watching
28:23 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
28:24 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
28:28 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys to kids coding playground and today we'll be making a two player pawn game with the ai so maybe like about a year ago we made a uh pond game for two players but this time we're going to improve the game and add an ai to it as well and some new improved features like making the ball move quicker when you go um when you play for a longer time stuff like that and so yeah so we're gonna make a more advanced version today so let me show you guys the demonstration of this so you can either do player versus player or player versus ai let's turn on the volume a little all right so player versus player it's just like as usual like this first the seven wins first seven points all right so clear versus ai so as you can see i'm the right side of yours okay so you see the ai so the ai is like it tries to follow like the position of the ball and once you play for like over 20 seconds or something like that then they will increase the speed of the ball as you can see the ball speed is increased as if you can see that yeah also you can open the timer right here as you can see you plan like when the timer reaches a certain amount it resets the timer every single time uh the point is over but as you can see when the timer gets to 20 the ball will speed up let me just get there all right so now it's 20 seconds as you can see the ball moves a little bit quicker so yeah um we will be creating new project let's create a new project okay so first let's delete the scratch cat and upload our backdrop so this will be in the link in the description so i actually have a uh something from my backpack this backdrop so we're gonna be using this one it looks like a real like ping pong table i guess and then we have the two uh paddles this one's for player one or the ai and this is the player two all right so that's it for the thing so i'll show you guys how to use it how to like draw it so if you want to draw your own i'm going to show you how to like draw it i guess so they actually already have a paddle in the sprite library if you want to use that you can use that one or you can use our own so what we did was just draw a paddle like it was just oops let me center it again so it's just like a green uh square but then we have some like brown outline around it so that's pretty much it it's pretty simple to draw you can make it any color you want it doesn't have to be green i guess but yeah it's pretty simple to draw i don't think you'll have any problem with that and then we have uh the buttons so let's get the buttons so let me find it all right button one let me just duplicate this and then we can get two buttons so this button one i'll name it player versus player so this button one is pvp player versus player we're going to like let's put like a text right here so maybe make it red so it's easier to see pvp so we have the pvp let's make it bigger center alright so now we have the pvp button and then we can do a player versus ai so we can name it like p v a ai maybe like pvs maybe yes that looks better that looks better i'm gonna change the other one too this makes it look a little better let me shrink it a little bit you can hold down alt so it won't move everywhere change this to player yes player and make it a little bit smaller there you go so now i have the two buttons player versus player and player versus ai all right so we're gonna first start on the buttons with the coding so we're gonna start on the player versus player so let's go to the code and in the beginning we're going to make it go to this position i already have the position down so i'm going to go to negative 75 zoom in negative 75 y90 that's the position i had from the game and i'm going to show the uh sprite in the beginning and then when this sprite is clicked we are going to uh when the sprite is clicked we're going to broadcast a message called v s p so player versus player and we're going to hide so once you click the button we're going to hide it and then we're going to go to the second button the button too i'm going to rename it to p pb pvs ai let me change the other name as well to ebs so player versus player and player versus ai so let's go to the other button so in the other button we are going to get a one green flag clicked we're going to go to where the 75 and then we're going to 90 and then we're going to show and when the sprite is clicked we're going to broadcast another message called p vsai pvs ai and then we're going to hide so when the player clicks on player versus player we want to hide this sprite as well so when i receive player versus player we're going to hide here and vice versa from the other one player vs player we are going to unreceive player versus ai we are going to hide all right now we can go to the paddles also i forgot to add the ball sorry about that we need to add the ball obviously so we can just get that from here ball uh how big should it be honestly maybe like 20 no it's too small maybe like 50 yeah that's probably better 50 50 is probably the right size for the ball so now we have the ball sprite and then so now we're going to go to our paddle player 1 or ai paddle so in the beginning actually let's code for the ball first because in the ball we have uh we have some code that we we're going to broadcast something into the player the paddles so oops sorry about that let's go to the ball now start coding in here okay so now we're in the ball start coding in here so as you can see i click the play button so i can make both the buttons like go to their position so this is the position where they are all right so let's start coding in here so when i receive the message let's see when i receive the message player versus player we're going to broadcast a message called start game start game and then we're going to when i receive player versus ai we're going to broadcast our game and then we are going to broadcast a message another message so we'll need this for later not for now but it's going to be called ball position ball position and we're going to make some more variables we're going to make two variables player one score for all sprites and we're also going to make another variable called player two score so player one score player two score and then so we're going to get a one green flag clicked we're going to set the player one score to zero and we're gonna set the player two score to zero and we're gonna set the size to fifty percent like i have so set the size of fifty percent and then right here we're going to when i receive the start game so when i receive start game we are going to wait one second so usually we want to wait one second so both players are ready in the beginning so we're gonna wait one second before starting the game and go again forever loop so we're going to make it remember the variable we make a new variable called ball speed ball speed so basically the ball speed is basically how fast the ball will move so now we have to make a new custom block before we move on to this part so we need the ball speed to make those change the speed of the ball so we'll need the ball speed because like remember i said when the timer increases we will increase the speed of the ball so that's why we'll need that so we're going to make a new block we're going to name it set up uh ball so setup ball okay so we're gonna have to define it so instead of ball we are going to go to zero zero which is the center of the screen the origin of the coordinate plane so zero zero and then we're going to if else so basically this is a pick random of which side the ball is going to go to so if we're going to pick random so we're going to need equal so we're going to pick random right here so pick a random 1 to 2 and if it's equal to 1 then we're going to point direction of 60 which is this right side so as you can see see the direction right here 60 so it's gonna point this way so we're going to point direction of 60. yeah on else we're going to point direction of negative 60 so point the opposite direction negative 60 and then we're going to reset the timer so remember i said that we're going to need the timer later so we're gonna have to reset the timer and then we're gonna set the ball speed to 10 so in the beginning ball speed will be 10 and we're gonna obviously need to use this block to use this so we're gonna run it right here okay and then next let's go back to our start game script right here so we're going to move the amount of balls speed steps so whatever this is whatever the value of this variables and then we're going to get an if on edge bounce so if it's on if it's touching the edge it'll bounce and if the ball is touching it is touching player 1 or ai the sprite touching player 1 or ai the sprite then it's going to start some pop just like the basic pop sound and uh and then it's going to turn we're going to make it turn so if it's touching this paddle it's going to turn this way so it's going to always move this way so we're going to make it turn 170 to 270 degrees to 270 degrees and then i'm going to get another if then statement and put it inside this one so if if uh the direction is greater than negative 179 so if it's like past this part or the direction is less than negative ones which is like right here so if it's less than negative one like on this side so it's like somewhere between here and here the direction is greater than negative or negative one so negative one's about right here then it's going to we're going to get this or we're gonna do greater than so the direction is greater than negative 179 or it's less than negative one direction less than negative one then we are going to point direction of 60 to 145 so be pointing this way so the ball will be traveling to the side so one direction of 60 to 145 so basically 60 to 145 would be like somewhere right here to somewhere right here so it'd be like here to here so like basically pointing from this side going either this way or this way so let me set it back to 90. okay so and then next after this we want to broadcast the message ball position remember ball position so basically ball position is just going to position the ball like keep track of where the ball is and then we're going to get an ifthen segment so another one so if the xposition is greater than 288 288 like right here if it's greater than it so it's like towards this point if x position is greater than 288 to 28 sorry 220 not 288 um we're gonna have to change the player one score by one because the ball is past this area so that means it's touching this side so that means player one will get a point so player one gonna have to change the player one score by one and we're going to have to call the variable setup ball again after the point is over and then we're going to wait one second before starting up again and then we're going to do ball position basically we can just duplicate this put it under if ball position if x position we're going to change this around i'm going to do this so it's easier to see so if x position is less than negative 228 which is the left side and that means we're going to change the player two scored by one because they scored on player one and this is just the same all right so that's what we have so far for this and this all right so next we want to work on the ball position we're going to receive the message so when this sprite receives the message ball position we're going to repeat until touching the player one so the ball is going to repeat until it's touching the player one or ai so this is to keep track of where the ball is so uh we're going to get a repeat until and then we're going to get a touching clear one for the ai and we're going to make a new variable going to name it ball y so ball wide is the y position of the ball so we're going to set the we're going to set the ball wide to the floor of y position so basically we don't want any decimal numbers so we're going to round down which is the floor so we just have to get the absolute value one select the floor which is rounding down oh it's right here it's in alphabetical order so we're gonna get the y position right here so the floor of the y position whatever the y position is and we're gonna keep track of this every 0.1 seconds so yeah oops all right uh so basically so that is it for the ball code that's basically it so i'm going to zoom out so you guys can take a look at it gonna go down a little bit so yeah okay that's and that's pretty much it for the ball we might come back and add some other stuff like maybe increasing the speed when the um timer increases all right i'm gonna uncheck these variables real quick and you can do this to represent the score for each side all right double click on them remember you can double click on them to do that let me make this back to zero all right there you go so that's how you make it like that you have to have to double click or you can just right click on it okay and then next let's go back to the uh paddles let's go to the paddles so inside the paddle for the player one or ai i'm going to go when green fly clicked zoom in a little when gray flat clicks we are going to go to the exposure negative 200 and y position of zero so it's like right here and then when i receive uh player versus ai then we are going to get a forever loop forever if on edge bounce so basically the the paddle won't like go off screen it would just like bounce on the sides so we're going to get a if on edge bounce and repeat until the y position is equal to the ball y all right so right now we want to make the y position of the paddle is equal to the ball y because we want the ai to like be like to the relative position of the ball to try to like hit it back so we are going to do when if the y position repeats of the y position is equal to the ball y the y this is the y position of the paddle by the way and we're going to fl streaming so if else put in here if y position is greater than the ball y y position so the y position is greater than the ball y so that means the paddle is like up here and the ball is like down here so it's like below it then we're going to move the paddle down so we're going to have to do change the y by negative eight because the paddle is above the ball so you want to move it down else you want to change it by positive eight because then the ball y would be over on like up here and the paddle will be down here so you want to move the ai panel up and then we're going to get an unstatement so if the score player one score oops player one score is equal to seven so we're gonna do first to seven player one score is equal to seven then we will broadcast a message called player one wins player player 1 and then we are going to duplicate this right click duplicate when i receive player versus player if on edge bounce we can remove this part and remove this part we can keep this bottom part don't delete it we'll get two if not statements so if we're going to do w and s for the movement so if key w is pressed w is pressed then we're gonna move change the y by eight let's duplicate this and if the key s is pressed oops s is pressed then we're going to change the y by negative eight and we're going to put this in in the bottom okay so now we have the movement for the ai and player one let's move on to player two let's go to our player two sprite so for the position for player two since this one is negative two hundred zero we're going to make this one positive two hundred so we're going to get a one green flag clicked and we're going to do go to x two hundred and y 0. and what i'm going to do is just go in here and drag and drop this into player 2 so then i can just instantly duplicate it here so instead right here we're going to do when i receive start game because there's no ai for player 2 it's just the player and forever if on edge bounce this code should all be the same except for this so we're going to do up arrows and down arrow instead and this one should be player two score is equal to seven then we're gonna broadcast another message and we're gonna name it player two wins okay so player two wins and we can make a you win uh sprite so basically we can just make a new sprint okay so now we're going to make the you win and you lose part for this thing so we just made a new sprite painted and then we're going to use red because it's easy to see and then for the first one we're going to do player 1 or ai wins if you want to add like player 1 wins and ai wins separately then you have to broadcast another message within the paddle so i'm gonna go into here code and basically instead right here you just do player the ai wins right here and then player one wins right here so basically that's pretty much it and then we're going to increase the size of this maybe a little bit bigger and then we're going to duplicate this this one is player 1 player 1 or ai and this one we will do called player 2 and we're going to delete this and for player 2 wins move this right here make it a bit bigger that's great all right so that's pretty much what we want let's go to the code for this thing when green flag clicked we go to zero zero so with the center in the beginning and then we're gonna hide and then we're going to when i receive player two wins that we're going to switch costume to the player 2 and then we're going to show and then we're going to stop all so basically it's going to switch costume to player 2 wins if we player 2 wins and then we're going to stop all we're going to duplicate this and when player 1 wins we're gonna switch costumes to player one or ai and that's pretty much it okay so now we can add some last minute like touches on the game so we can just add different colors for the button maybe we can make this one the normal one but this one we can make it a different color because we can uh just make it look better in general so we're gonna make it like maybe yellow yeah we can make it yellow or you can use the this thing so you can mix different colors uh let's mix like some like this color i guess this color is pretty good yeah see that yeah and maybe on the outside we can do like blue maybe like swap it there you go maybe you can use this one yeah this one likes it like that so yeah that's pretty much it for the buttons and then next we can go to the was it the i think it's the ball yeah inside the ball we can do the the um timer thing let's zoom in when i receive the start game so whenever you start game we're going to forever uh we're going to if timer is greater than 20. so if the timer is greater than 20 seconds maybe you can do 10 just for testing purposes uh we're going to set the ball speed to 12 so we're going to increase the speed by a little bit and we can just duplicate this and if the time is greater than 20 i guess we can do 15. and you can add even more and more you can just keep on doing it forever if you wanted but yeah we're just gonna put two for now i actually forgot to put the player two in because we're working on everything else i forgot to use this one so we're gonna have to do the detection for player two as well so we are going to actually duplicate all of this and delete this and we just take this out and put this under right here and then we'll put this in after so first we are going to do if touching player two we're going to do the pop sound as well but instead of turning to the right we're gonna have to turn to the left because it's player two you hit to the left side so we're going to turn to the left and put this in and then if if the direction is like that greater than 179 instead because this is the other side so we're going to have to do 179 and the direction is less than one then we are going to point direction of negative 60 because you have to face the left side not the right because we're on the right side already so we're going to do that and then broadcast bulb position then just put this on the bottom you can also take this out this is not very necessary because we already have it down here it's not very necessary for the ai we already have it down here so you can take that out as well so let's go play the game so since we forgot to do the player two code i'm gonna like show you all the code so then you can take down any code you did not do earlier so that's pretty much it okay so now i think we demonstrate the game all right so let's do player versus ai first so you can see the ai is going towards the ball everything's working out fine you can see i think the ball is moving faster because the timer forgot to turn yeah i see the ball is going way quicker now see that yeah so yeah uh now let's try out the players player i think should be the same oh i forgot to hide that thing as well let me how did that not connect okay i don't know why okay whatever i already it should have been like that i don't know how it disconnected but okay player versus player yeah so basically just like that yeah okay now let me score on one person first so we can finish this so i can show you what happens if you win or lose you need seven to win all right that's it so when you win it's just as player two wins so yeah that's pretty much it for this tutorial
