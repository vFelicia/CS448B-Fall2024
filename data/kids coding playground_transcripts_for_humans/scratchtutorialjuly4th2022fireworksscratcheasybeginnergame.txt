00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids going
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video scratch and today we will
00:12 - be working on a july 4th game because
00:15 - that is coming up tomorrow is july 4th
00:18 - so happy july 4th everyone and the
00:20 - reason we haven't been posting lately is
00:22 - because we have we went on a vacation
00:24 - for a really long time and after that we
00:27 - got sick after that so um it took a
00:30 - while for us to recover so now we're
00:32 - back and we have created a july 4th the
00:35 - game so i'm going to demo it for you
00:37 - guys
00:39 - so if you can hear that music just a
00:41 - little bit music and you see the scratch
00:43 - cap with the firework launcher and you
00:46 - can launch fireworks
00:49 - so yeah it just shoots these fireworks
00:51 - [Music]
00:53 - with music
00:54 - this is an easy beginner tutorial
00:56 - scratch so yeah let's get started
01:04 - so create my new project and
01:06 - we're actually going to select a
01:07 - backdrop
01:11 - so we're going to select our backdrop
01:13 - here
01:17 - i think it's called like night sky yep
01:20 - night city so yeah we have that
01:23 - and we also have our scratch cow we're
01:25 - actually not going to delete the scratch
01:27 - cat
01:28 - so now we're going to drag in our
01:30 - firework launcher so we have that over
01:32 - here
01:33 - and now we're also going to ctrl
01:36 - c
01:38 - ctrl v onto our scratch cap
01:43 - now i'm going to group it
01:45 - and we're going to shrink it
01:48 - and put it on the scratch cap
01:51 - so now we have our
01:53 - firework launcher on our scratch cap so
01:56 - you see the lines are a little bit thick
01:58 - over here so now
02:01 - we're gonna group the scratch cap and
02:04 - we're gonna make him
02:05 - a little bit bigger so yeah
02:13 - so we're gonna put the rocket launcher
02:15 - back uh the firework launcher back on
02:16 - him
02:17 - make it go to the front oh
02:22 - now we're gonna make the firework
02:23 - launcher bigger so like that
02:26 - and we put it on the scratch cat
02:31 - so yeah
02:34 - now we're gonna maybe decrease the size
02:36 - to 50 because it's a little bit big and
02:39 - now we have our scratch cap
02:43 - so we have a few more sprites to make
02:46 - so we're going to show you how to draw
02:47 - the firework launcher
02:49 - so first we need a green rectangle
02:53 - so with just green rectangle
02:56 - and outline is five
02:59 - and we're gonna just draw this
03:01 - green rectangle over here like that
03:04 - like so
03:05 - and we're going to draw another
03:07 - rectangle like that but it's a little
03:09 - bit square so we might have to reshape
03:11 - it a little bit so
03:13 - kind of like that if you don't know how
03:14 - to draw it come to my project i'm
03:16 - gumball gumball098
03:18 - and you can come and export the sprite
03:20 - from my project
03:22 - so yeah we have the a little trapezoid
03:25 - for our little launcher and we just have
03:27 - to do a little bit
03:30 - reshaping oopsies
03:34 - so and
03:35 - we can duplicate that to make the back
03:40 - so we just flip this horizontally and we
03:42 - make the back so
03:44 - that's where like the back of the
03:46 - launcher
03:47 - and we have a little handle grip so
03:51 - uh just a color
03:55 - green color and then
03:56 - just a rectangle oopsies
04:01 - it'll just make a little rectangle like
04:04 - that and place it under the launcher
04:07 - and
04:08 - the red
04:09 - a little trigger
04:11 - is just red color and another rectangle
04:15 - like that
04:17 - and so right now it just looks like a
04:19 - button so we can reshape it to make it
04:22 - the size like that so
04:24 - we have our rocket launcher
04:26 - our firework launcher
04:28 - if you want to add extra design you can
04:30 - add a little um
04:32 - triggers or like something like a little
04:34 - rectangle in the middle
04:36 - yeah so let's delete this
04:45 - so now we're going to create a new
04:47 - sprite
04:48 - so we're going to paint
04:50 - a
04:51 - purple
04:52 - dot so
04:56 - uh
04:57 - purple
04:59 - to make a small oh there's outline
05:04 - i'm gonna have no outline
05:06 - i'm gonna make a six by six dot so
05:10 - it's kind of 11 by 10 so
05:12 - we're going to hold shift so we can make
05:16 - that 7x7 okay
05:20 - drag that over here to the middle so now
05:22 - we have our dot
05:24 - for the little angle
05:27 - so now we're going to create the ball
05:29 - where he shoots it out
05:32 - so
05:32 - all over here
05:35 - and we're going to duplicate this
05:39 - and we're going to make this completely
05:41 - white
05:45 - it's completely white and we're going to
05:47 - make us this one
05:51 - so this is just for design we're going
05:53 - to do this
05:55 - make about this big
05:57 - no maybe a little bit
06:00 - and then on top of the
06:02 - yeah white dot now we're gonna
06:05 - duplicate this
06:07 - from this ball
06:08 - we're going to do we're going to
06:10 - minimize
06:11 - a little bit smaller
06:13 - and put it inside so now we have our dot
06:15 - where he shoots out
06:18 - so we're going to work on the scratch
06:19 - cat so
06:22 - so we're going to make actually one more
06:23 - sprite it's just five work and we don't
06:25 - have to draw anything we're gonna rename
06:26 - this
06:30 - and then this can be called dot
06:33 - and this can be called
06:35 - the rocket
06:37 - the rocket cap
06:40 - so now we're going to work on our
06:42 - scratch guide here so
06:44 - start out with the when the green flag
06:46 - is clicked
06:47 - it'll go to
06:49 - a certain position but i guess this
06:51 - position is fine
06:52 - so and we're going to make a new
06:54 - variable
06:55 - shoot
06:58 - and
06:59 - we're going to do this and set
07:02 - shoot to zero
07:04 - and then we have a forever
07:07 - it'll point towards
07:10 - mouse pointer so it'll always point
07:12 - wherever your mouse is
07:14 - and we need if then
07:18 - if then you need and
07:21 - if then the mouse is down which is if
07:23 - you click
07:27 - then it will shoot equals zero
07:32 - shoot i have any equals
07:36 - shoot
07:37 - equals
07:39 - zero
07:40 - and then we're gonna set shoot to one
07:46 - and now we're going to create the clone
07:48 - of the ball
07:51 - so
07:52 - set shoot to 1
07:53 - and we're going to create a clone
08:02 - so now we're going to do the dot so
08:07 - the green flag is clicked
08:09 - a little bit when the green flag is
08:10 - clicked it will set
08:13 - ghost effect
08:15 - by 100
08:21 - and now it will erase all because this
08:23 - release relates to pen
08:25 - so
08:26 - oh yeah by the way if you didn't know
08:28 - how to get pen you click on this little
08:30 - extra block thing and you click on pen
08:33 - so yeah um all these other things too
08:36 - so we have our pen so we go erase all
08:40 - and then forever
08:43 - go back to our pen
08:45 - set pen color to
08:49 - what
08:54 - so we set pen color to white and then we
08:56 - erase all
08:59 - and then we have to make a my block
09:02 - so we're going to call it draw
09:05 - dotted
09:07 - line and this is very important
09:10 - click on run without screen refresh
09:14 - over here and then click ok so now we
09:16 - have our
09:17 - draw dotted line
09:19 - and we're going to
09:21 - play it over here and then we define
09:23 - draw dotted line
09:25 - we'll set
09:26 - pen size to five so
09:29 - pin size to
09:31 - five
09:32 - and then
09:33 - set dot
09:34 - to zero
09:36 - which is
09:38 - another variable
09:40 - so we're going to set dot which is for
09:42 - all rights so
09:44 - set dot to zero
09:47 - and then we'll go to
09:48 - firework plaster which is the cat i mean
09:52 - rocket cat so go to rocket cat and then
09:55 - it would change y by five
10:01 - change y by five
10:03 - and then pen down
10:08 - and then it'll show
10:15 - so it's very important please do not
10:17 - skip this part so we're about to make
10:19 - our variable
10:21 - make a variable and we're going to make
10:23 - it grab it
10:24 - so set
10:26 - and then please click for this sprite
10:28 - only
10:30 - now we have that and then we'll set
10:33 - gravity
10:34 - to zero
10:36 - point towards mass pointer
10:41 - repeat until
10:44 - just touching the edge
10:51 - and
10:52 - we need it if then
10:55 - so if then the dot
10:58 - equals two so we need equal sign
11:02 - dot
11:03 - equals two
11:05 - then it'll set dot
11:08 - to zero
11:11 - i'll show you guys what this means later
11:13 - when the code is all finished so after
11:16 - that we will have pen down
11:19 - and then pen up
11:22 - so
11:23 - and then after that
11:25 - we will have a move 15 steps
11:30 - change gravity so we made that variable
11:33 - earlier
11:36 - by
11:37 - negative 0.38
11:41 - and then change y
11:44 - by
11:46 - gravity
11:50 - after that you'll change dot by one
11:54 - and then pen up
11:59 - so i'll show you how it's working right
12:01 - now so we have our little angle
12:04 - of our little shoot angle so yeah we
12:07 - have that and i said that i'd explain to
12:10 - you later so now it's later so we're
12:13 - going to change if this was one it would
12:15 - have less space in between each dot
12:19 - so it's more closer and you want to give
12:21 - them a little bit space so choose the
12:23 - correct
12:24 - a good number for that
12:26 - but if you did something like six
12:28 - they'll be very far apart from each
12:30 - other and that will not look good so
12:32 - we're going to change
12:34 - the two
12:36 - so now
12:39 - we're going to
12:40 - work on the ball
12:42 - so let's go to the ball
12:44 - and then when the green flag is clicked
12:49 - so now we're going to make a list so
12:52 - we're going to make a list i'm going to
12:54 - change
12:55 - the name to so we're going to make a
12:56 - list so we can keep track of where the
12:58 - ball is at so we can send our firework
13:00 - there so
13:02 - we're going to change this to x position
13:06 - oh spelled it wrong
13:08 - and then we have okay so we have x
13:10 - position and we're going to make another
13:12 - one y
13:13 - position
13:15 - that's about oh my i spelled it wrong
13:16 - again all right whatever all right so
13:18 - now we have x position and y position
13:21 - so now we have our green flag
13:23 - so we're gonna make
13:25 - another gravity
13:28 - but it's for this sprite only so we have
13:30 - that gravity and then when this green
13:32 - flag is clicked it will delete all of x
13:36 - position
13:37 - and then it will delete all of y
13:40 - position and then it will hide
13:44 - and then when i start as this clone
13:48 - when i start as a clone it'll set
13:51 - gravity
13:52 - so this is the gravity that's inside the
13:55 - ball
13:56 - to zero
13:57 - and then set size to 50
14:00 - so just make a little small
14:03 - and after that we go to firework blaster
14:09 - go to
14:10 - firework blaster which is rocket cat
14:14 - and
14:15 - we'll point towards
14:17 - mouse pointer
14:20 - so now we're gonna change y by five
14:25 - and then go to
14:28 - back layer
14:31 - and now show
14:35 - and
14:36 - repeat until
14:39 - touching edge
14:41 - so the ball will be until touching edge
14:44 - i'll move 15 steps
14:51 - 3 15 steps and now we have change
14:54 - gravity so this has to be the same
14:55 - number as earlier
14:57 - so change gravity
15:02 - by negative 0.38
15:06 - and it will change y
15:09 - by graphing
15:15 - and then delete this one
15:21 - so now we get a when i start as a clone
15:24 - we wait 0.2 seconds
15:29 - and we'll set shoot
15:36 - to zero
15:38 - and then we wait
15:40 - so we have our weight here
15:43 - wait i'll pick random
15:46 - 0.5 which is 0.5
15:49 - to 1 second
15:52 - and now we're going to go back to our
15:55 - variables and go back to our lists here
15:58 - so we're going to add
16:01 - a thing so it's everything we
16:04 - replace that with
16:07 - x position sorry motion
16:10 - x position
16:12 - to x position and then
16:14 - we add
16:18 - guessed it y position to y position
16:22 - and then we're gonna broadcast
16:26 - explode
16:32 - and then we're gonna delete this one
16:36 - so now i'm going to show you how it adds
16:38 - to the list so we're going to go
16:40 - and you see whenever we shoot a ball
16:43 - it'll
16:44 - add to the list
16:45 - so
16:46 - and it'll mark where
16:48 - we shot it so
16:51 - see here
16:52 - add
16:55 - so yeah we have that all added here and
16:58 - now i'm going to hide the list so we got
17:00 - variable and then we hide these two
17:02 - lists so yeah
17:06 - and now we're gonna work on the firework
17:09 - so now we have the firework
17:11 - so when i receive
17:13 - explode
17:15 - over here
17:16 - it'll go pen up
17:19 - over here like this
17:21 - and it'll set pen
17:23 - brightness to 100 so
17:27 - pretty sure it's in here yep
17:28 - brightness 200
17:30 - and then it'll set pen color it doesn't
17:32 - matter what color it is so i set it to
17:34 - green and then we're going to change pen
17:37 - color
17:38 - by pick random
17:41 - 10 to 100 so it can be any color so just
17:43 - that's why it doesn't matter what color
17:45 - you selected default on because i'll
17:47 - pick random 10 to 100
17:50 - and i'll set pen size
17:53 - set pin size
17:55 - to
17:56 - 10.
18:00 - and now we have
18:02 - that
18:03 - so now we have go to
18:08 - go to and we go to our variable here
18:11 - go to item one
18:14 - of x position that's the first thing
18:17 - that's inside the list and that's the
18:20 - shot that you're gonna have and then
18:21 - item one of y position
18:24 - and now we mark that down
18:26 - and then now we're going to delete it
18:29 - so there's only going to be one at a
18:30 - time so delete one of x position
18:34 - we're going to delete one of y position
18:36 - just like that
18:39 - and then
18:40 - we'll point in direction
18:45 - point direction pick random
18:47 - negative five
18:50 - two five
18:52 - and then pen down
18:57 - and now we have to make some variables
19:00 - here
19:01 - so we have to have make new variable
19:05 - number of
19:07 - clones
19:08 - and don't worry this is for all sprites
19:10 - so just make it all sprites and the
19:13 - other one
19:14 - ready to
19:16 - explode
19:19 - so yeah we have two new variables here
19:21 - and we're gonna set
19:25 - number of clones to zero
19:28 - and then we're gonna set
19:30 - ready to explode to zero
19:34 - and now
19:35 - we repeat until
19:38 - and uh
19:40 - repeat until then we have
19:43 - what are these
19:46 - less than signs
19:48 - repeat until 20
19:50 - is less than
19:52 - number of clones
19:54 - so after when we have that it will
19:56 - create clone of myself
20:01 - now we have that so now we have to make
20:04 - a new variable
20:05 - explosion
20:08 - speed and this is for this sprite only
20:11 - so click on for the sprite only
20:14 - and
20:15 - we will set
20:17 - explosion speed
20:20 - to 20
20:24 - and set
20:27 - ready to explode
20:30 - to one
20:33 - so now we have that
20:35 - all done
20:37 - now we're gonna have when i start as a
20:40 - clone
20:41 - uh
20:42 - change
20:44 - number of clones
20:48 - by one
20:50 - and we'll wait until
20:54 - ready to explode
20:56 - is equal to one
21:03 - and after that
21:05 - we have to have a point in direction
21:09 - point direction
21:13 - pick random
21:14 - negative
21:16 - 180
21:18 - to positive 180
21:21 - and after when we have that done
21:24 - we have to have a repeat 15
21:28 - uh move explosion speed
21:33 - so we're gonna move
21:36 - explosion speed steps
21:39 - and after that
21:41 - change pen brightness
21:47 - by minus one
21:51 - i'll change explosion speed
21:56 - by minus one as well
22:01 - then after that
22:02 - we will delete this club
22:06 - so let's see if it works or not so
22:08 - first we're gonna hide all the variables
22:10 - because that's blocking everything
22:13 - so yeah we have all of that now we're
22:15 - gonna go to dot hide the gravity here
22:18 - ball on the gravity
22:20 - and now we have this
22:21 - so
22:23 - so it's gonna shoot you see
22:26 - as you can see
22:28 - it is shooting
22:30 - fireworks
22:32 - so the list is helping keep track
22:35 - of where
22:37 - it last was and the firework explosion
22:39 - happens on it so now let's add some
22:41 - music to liven it up
22:43 - so we have our backdrop and then when
22:45 - our green flag is clicked as always
22:48 - and
22:49 - [Music]
22:50 - i decided
22:51 - i wanted to
22:52 - use dance magic so let's use dance match
22:57 - okay this one
22:59 - so and then i'm gonna zoom in you might
23:01 - not be able to see
23:03 - and then forever
23:07 - we're gonna change play sound dance
23:09 - magic until dot
23:11 - and i forgot to change set volume set
23:14 - volume
23:15 - 25 percent so you might be able to hear
23:17 - me i'm turned down the volume a little
23:19 - bit
23:20 - just went off
23:21 - okay
23:23 - so yeah we have our music
23:24 - [Music]
23:26 - um
23:28 - so yeah this is our game here
23:31 - you see the fireworks you can hear the
23:33 - music
23:34 - turn down the volume a little bit
23:35 - so um yeah
23:37 - we have over here we have our backdrop
23:40 - our scratch cat
23:42 - our dots are making the alignment
23:45 - correct and the ball so yeah
23:48 - so this is i and also renamed your game
23:51 - to
23:53 - i just decided to name it july 4th 2022

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids going playground here and today we're back for another video scratch and today we will be working on a july 4th game because that is coming up tomorrow is july 4th so happy july 4th everyone and the reason we haven't been posting lately is because we have we went on a vacation for a really long time and after that we got sick after that so um it took a while for us to recover so now we're back and we have created a july 4th the game so i'm going to demo it for you guys so if you can hear that music just a little bit music and you see the scratch cap with the firework launcher and you can launch fireworks so yeah it just shoots these fireworks with music this is an easy beginner tutorial scratch so yeah let's get started so create my new project and we're actually going to select a backdrop so we're going to select our backdrop here i think it's called like night sky yep night city so yeah we have that and we also have our scratch cow we're actually not going to delete the scratch cat so now we're going to drag in our firework launcher so we have that over here and now we're also going to ctrl c ctrl v onto our scratch cap now i'm going to group it and we're going to shrink it and put it on the scratch cap so now we have our firework launcher on our scratch cap so you see the lines are a little bit thick over here so now we're gonna group the scratch cap and we're gonna make him a little bit bigger so yeah so we're gonna put the rocket launcher back uh the firework launcher back on him make it go to the front oh now we're gonna make the firework launcher bigger so like that and we put it on the scratch cat so yeah now we're gonna maybe decrease the size to 50 because it's a little bit big and now we have our scratch cap so we have a few more sprites to make so we're going to show you how to draw the firework launcher so first we need a green rectangle so with just green rectangle and outline is five and we're gonna just draw this green rectangle over here like that like so and we're going to draw another rectangle like that but it's a little bit square so we might have to reshape it a little bit so kind of like that if you don't know how to draw it come to my project i'm gumball gumball098 and you can come and export the sprite from my project so yeah we have the a little trapezoid for our little launcher and we just have to do a little bit reshaping oopsies so and we can duplicate that to make the back so we just flip this horizontally and we make the back so that's where like the back of the launcher and we have a little handle grip so uh just a color green color and then just a rectangle oopsies it'll just make a little rectangle like that and place it under the launcher and the red a little trigger is just red color and another rectangle like that and so right now it just looks like a button so we can reshape it to make it the size like that so we have our rocket launcher our firework launcher if you want to add extra design you can add a little um triggers or like something like a little rectangle in the middle yeah so let's delete this so now we're going to create a new sprite so we're going to paint a purple dot so uh purple to make a small oh there's outline i'm gonna have no outline i'm gonna make a six by six dot so it's kind of 11 by 10 so we're going to hold shift so we can make that 7x7 okay drag that over here to the middle so now we have our dot for the little angle so now we're going to create the ball where he shoots it out so all over here and we're going to duplicate this and we're going to make this completely white it's completely white and we're going to make us this one so this is just for design we're going to do this make about this big no maybe a little bit and then on top of the yeah white dot now we're gonna duplicate this from this ball we're going to do we're going to minimize a little bit smaller and put it inside so now we have our dot where he shoots out so we're going to work on the scratch cat so so we're going to make actually one more sprite it's just five work and we don't have to draw anything we're gonna rename this and then this can be called dot and this can be called the rocket the rocket cap so now we're going to work on our scratch guide here so start out with the when the green flag is clicked it'll go to a certain position but i guess this position is fine so and we're going to make a new variable shoot and we're going to do this and set shoot to zero and then we have a forever it'll point towards mouse pointer so it'll always point wherever your mouse is and we need if then if then you need and if then the mouse is down which is if you click then it will shoot equals zero shoot i have any equals shoot equals zero and then we're gonna set shoot to one and now we're going to create the clone of the ball so set shoot to 1 and we're going to create a clone so now we're going to do the dot so the green flag is clicked a little bit when the green flag is clicked it will set ghost effect by 100 and now it will erase all because this release relates to pen so oh yeah by the way if you didn't know how to get pen you click on this little extra block thing and you click on pen so yeah um all these other things too so we have our pen so we go erase all and then forever go back to our pen set pen color to what so we set pen color to white and then we erase all and then we have to make a my block so we're going to call it draw dotted line and this is very important click on run without screen refresh over here and then click ok so now we have our draw dotted line and we're going to play it over here and then we define draw dotted line we'll set pen size to five so pin size to five and then set dot to zero which is another variable so we're going to set dot which is for all rights so set dot to zero and then we'll go to firework plaster which is the cat i mean rocket cat so go to rocket cat and then it would change y by five change y by five and then pen down and then it'll show so it's very important please do not skip this part so we're about to make our variable make a variable and we're going to make it grab it so set and then please click for this sprite only now we have that and then we'll set gravity to zero point towards mass pointer repeat until just touching the edge and we need it if then so if then the dot equals two so we need equal sign dot equals two then it'll set dot to zero i'll show you guys what this means later when the code is all finished so after that we will have pen down and then pen up so and then after that we will have a move 15 steps change gravity so we made that variable earlier by negative 0.38 and then change y by gravity after that you'll change dot by one and then pen up so i'll show you how it's working right now so we have our little angle of our little shoot angle so yeah we have that and i said that i'd explain to you later so now it's later so we're going to change if this was one it would have less space in between each dot so it's more closer and you want to give them a little bit space so choose the correct a good number for that but if you did something like six they'll be very far apart from each other and that will not look good so we're going to change the two so now we're going to work on the ball so let's go to the ball and then when the green flag is clicked so now we're going to make a list so we're going to make a list i'm going to change the name to so we're going to make a list so we can keep track of where the ball is at so we can send our firework there so we're going to change this to x position oh spelled it wrong and then we have okay so we have x position and we're going to make another one y position that's about oh my i spelled it wrong again all right whatever all right so now we have x position and y position so now we have our green flag so we're gonna make another gravity but it's for this sprite only so we have that gravity and then when this green flag is clicked it will delete all of x position and then it will delete all of y position and then it will hide and then when i start as this clone when i start as a clone it'll set gravity so this is the gravity that's inside the ball to zero and then set size to 50 so just make a little small and after that we go to firework blaster go to firework blaster which is rocket cat and we'll point towards mouse pointer so now we're gonna change y by five and then go to back layer and now show and repeat until touching edge so the ball will be until touching edge i'll move 15 steps 3 15 steps and now we have change gravity so this has to be the same number as earlier so change gravity by negative 0.38 and it will change y by graphing and then delete this one so now we get a when i start as a clone we wait 0.2 seconds and we'll set shoot to zero and then we wait so we have our weight here wait i'll pick random 0.5 which is 0.5 to 1 second and now we're going to go back to our variables and go back to our lists here so we're going to add a thing so it's everything we replace that with x position sorry motion x position to x position and then we add guessed it y position to y position and then we're gonna broadcast explode and then we're gonna delete this one so now i'm going to show you how it adds to the list so we're going to go and you see whenever we shoot a ball it'll add to the list so and it'll mark where we shot it so see here add so yeah we have that all added here and now i'm going to hide the list so we got variable and then we hide these two lists so yeah and now we're gonna work on the firework so now we have the firework so when i receive explode over here it'll go pen up over here like this and it'll set pen brightness to 100 so pretty sure it's in here yep brightness 200 and then it'll set pen color it doesn't matter what color it is so i set it to green and then we're going to change pen color by pick random 10 to 100 so it can be any color so just that's why it doesn't matter what color you selected default on because i'll pick random 10 to 100 and i'll set pen size set pin size to 10. and now we have that so now we have go to go to and we go to our variable here go to item one of x position that's the first thing that's inside the list and that's the shot that you're gonna have and then item one of y position and now we mark that down and then now we're going to delete it so there's only going to be one at a time so delete one of x position we're going to delete one of y position just like that and then we'll point in direction point direction pick random negative five two five and then pen down and now we have to make some variables here so we have to have make new variable number of clones and don't worry this is for all sprites so just make it all sprites and the other one ready to explode so yeah we have two new variables here and we're gonna set number of clones to zero and then we're gonna set ready to explode to zero and now we repeat until and uh repeat until then we have what are these less than signs repeat until 20 is less than number of clones so after when we have that it will create clone of myself now we have that so now we have to make a new variable explosion speed and this is for this sprite only so click on for the sprite only and we will set explosion speed to 20 and set ready to explode to one so now we have that all done now we're gonna have when i start as a clone uh change number of clones by one and we'll wait until ready to explode is equal to one and after that we have to have a point in direction point direction pick random negative 180 to positive 180 and after when we have that done we have to have a repeat 15 uh move explosion speed so we're gonna move explosion speed steps and after that change pen brightness by minus one i'll change explosion speed by minus one as well then after that we will delete this club so let's see if it works or not so first we're gonna hide all the variables because that's blocking everything so yeah we have all of that now we're gonna go to dot hide the gravity here ball on the gravity and now we have this so so it's gonna shoot you see as you can see it is shooting fireworks so the list is helping keep track of where it last was and the firework explosion happens on it so now let's add some music to liven it up so we have our backdrop and then when our green flag is clicked as always and i decided i wanted to use dance magic so let's use dance match okay this one so and then i'm gonna zoom in you might not be able to see and then forever we're gonna change play sound dance magic until dot and i forgot to change set volume set volume 25 percent so you might be able to hear me i'm turned down the volume a little bit just went off okay so yeah we have our music um so yeah this is our game here you see the fireworks you can hear the music turn down the volume a little bit so um yeah we have over here we have our backdrop our scratch cat our dots are making the alignment correct and the ball so yeah so this is i and also renamed your game to i just decided to name it july 4th 2022 because that's 2022 this year so yeah so anyways please like share subscribe comment the comment section below what you might do for july 4th and anyways see you guys next time you
