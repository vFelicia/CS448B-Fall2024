00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys welcome back to kids cooling
00:10 - playground
00:10 - so uh yesterday we did our first
00:14 - platformer for the uh among us so uh
00:17 - please
00:18 - like uh share subscribe to our channel
00:20 - and give us a thumbs up on the video
00:22 - uh so far we already have two thumbs
00:24 - down on the video
00:25 - not sure why so please guys if you enjoy
00:28 - this video give us a thumbs up on all
00:30 - the
00:31 - all our video so that was a great way to
00:34 - support us
00:35 - okay all right so let's get to it
00:38 - so this is what we have for the code for
00:40 - the main character yesterday
00:42 - so you uh miss anything kind of stop
00:44 - here and then um
00:45 - uh get it down uh what we can do is um
00:48 - probably put all the uh custom block on
00:50 - the left and then go on the right or
00:52 - whatever you guys like
00:53 - you can do that so i did not give out
00:55 - the main character yesterday the sprite
00:57 - is pretty easy to draw just just
00:59 - black box right so then you guys did
01:02 - that already
01:03 - and then we have this one uh let's put
01:05 - this idle costume on the last one
01:08 - for here and set in the first because we
01:10 - are going to use it to run
01:12 - so we're going to make it in the last
01:14 - costume okay put it in the end
01:16 - 13 okay all right so for now
01:19 - let's get to it
01:22 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
01:24 - going to create some platform
01:26 - for the game so that's that way you guys
01:28 - can start learning it
01:30 - i think everybody really liked the
01:31 - platform uh so
01:33 - i can upload the backpack here but i'm
01:35 - going to show you guys how to do that
01:38 - okay so platform i will provide some of
01:40 - the platform sprite for you guys and
01:42 - then you guys can change it the way you
01:44 - like
01:44 - so let's say this is our first one uh
01:47 - let's
01:47 - just do something simple for now uh
01:51 - so let's let's just remove all
01:54 - these guys for right now okay uh we
01:57 - don't need any
01:59 - maybe one of these okay okay let's have
02:01 - first three
02:02 - first floor okay i think that's good
02:04 - should be good enough
02:05 - so we trash only the other one
02:09 - okay so we're the first four we're gonna
02:11 - even delete this
02:13 - just like that so
02:16 - i'm gonna provide the sprite for the
02:19 - first
02:19 - four level and then you guys can change
02:21 - it the way you want
02:22 - so these are just blocks right make sure
02:25 - that when you are
02:26 - creating the block let's say you need to
02:28 - make a new platform
02:30 - but you can take this base one take all
02:32 - this copy it
02:34 - make a ping a new sprite and then put in
02:36 - the bottom
02:37 - and then what you can do is uh you can
02:40 - say uh
02:40 - ungroup all this and let's say you want
02:43 - to just take this box out
02:45 - so make that as group okay it's already
02:48 - grouped
02:48 - okay copy that you can move them on top
02:51 - let's say you want to put another box
02:53 - here
02:53 - right so you can do that or you can put
02:56 - another box here
02:57 - which you can do that so you can have
02:59 - like multiple box right for the for the
03:01 - sprite to jump up
03:04 - okay as you guys can see we created two
03:06 - little box here
03:07 - it's pretty easy so um i already did
03:10 - most of the hard work here while
03:11 - creating those uh image for you
03:13 - and you can just take it and then just
03:15 - kind of mix and match it like you know
03:18 - you have the
03:19 - rectangular box you have the bowl like
03:22 - the laser
03:23 - so something similar to like that you
03:25 - can however design your screen
03:27 - you know you can have upper
03:30 - top or lower top i mean upper here you
03:33 - have something on the top
03:34 - you can have something on the bottom and
03:36 - make some gap here so that you know it
03:38 - can fall off and die
03:39 - so this is kind of how it looks like and
03:42 - you know just different thing that you
03:43 - can put
03:44 - and if you want something on the top you
03:46 - can say like this
03:48 - copy this control paste uh
03:51 - group them all make sure you cook them
03:53 - all and then you can just flip it
03:55 - and then you can have it on the top so
03:56 - you can set it like here
03:59 - something like this like that
04:02 - so you can delete that you know anything
04:04 - you like right so this is like a
04:07 - a stage like this now you can have boxes
04:09 - here
04:10 - you know stack another one or you can
04:13 - put
04:14 - one of these right
04:18 - on here you can put them like this for
04:21 - them to jump on
04:23 - and if you want to add a laser you can
04:25 - add this guy
04:28 - so this is my laser well you can add it
04:31 - over here
04:32 - let's say you wanna the laser coming
04:34 - down here
04:36 - right and this bottom you want the
04:38 - different laser
04:39 - side and you want something else here
04:43 - or you can move these two blocks and
04:46 - group this
04:48 - and group you can delete these
04:54 - and then you can put the laser on top
04:56 - oops
04:59 - so however you want to do okay and then
05:02 - you can like
05:03 - take one of these from the bottom here
05:07 - and you can put it here somewhere like
05:10 - this right so you have a laser coming
05:11 - down something like that
05:12 - okay okay now let's go back to the code
05:17 - color variable uh we are going to add
05:20 - more variable to this
05:21 - um you can say um what else
05:25 - what do we have okay player dead and
05:26 - then speed right we have that
05:28 - uh you can say uh
05:32 - global variable so we can put them all
05:34 - having a g in the front
05:36 - is good so that we can have everything
05:38 - together
05:39 - uh this is the velocity okay
05:43 - uh for all the sprite
05:46 - okay pick another variable
05:50 - on ground so this will test if the
05:53 - sprite is on the ground
05:56 - and we're gonna make another variable
05:59 - uh gravity
06:03 - so we're gonna use a variable we can
06:05 - change it later you know how
06:07 - fast or whatever you need or you can you
06:09 - don't need it
06:10 - to do that also that would be fine but
06:12 - for now we just use this gravity
06:14 - okay and let's make one more
06:17 - call jumping so this one is not a global
06:21 - variable i did not put a g in the front
06:23 - make sure you select for the sprite only
06:27 - okay all right let's go back to our main
06:31 - character
06:32 - we have the reset here so what we're
06:34 - going to do is we're going to reset some
06:36 - of these variables
06:37 - that we just created so that you know
06:40 - when the game start you know we can
06:42 - make sure we're going to reset it so
06:44 - this reset the velocity to zero
06:49 - i'll reset the underground to zero
06:53 - [Music]
06:55 - reset the gravity let's gravity gravity
07:00 - okay we're gonna do negative one for
07:01 - grab
07:04 - and then we'll have one more
07:08 - oh i should then decrease this guy i
07:11 - accidentally created jump on the ground
07:13 - okay delete that sorry about that delete
07:16 - this guy
07:16 - let's go back to the main character okay
07:19 - i'll create over here my mistake i think
07:23 - i forgot when i was creating the
07:24 - variable when i was playing with the
07:26 - platform and i forgot about that so
07:28 - great jumping
07:29 - uh variable on this this sprite only for
07:32 - the for the main character not the
07:33 - ground
07:34 - okay uh you say jumping
07:37 - we'll set this to zero
07:42 - okay all right let me uh
07:45 - take out all these we'll keep this i
07:48 - guess we can
07:49 - yes we can take it out or leave it but
07:52 - let's just take it out a little more
07:53 - space on the screen to see
07:56 - i will leave this on and this is on okay
07:59 - so we are going to
08:00 - take a look at this okay
08:04 - all right so we'll make the main sprite
08:06 - jump as well
08:08 - and walk so uh what we're going to do is
08:11 - create another block
08:14 - called jump control
08:17 - and make this run without screen refresh
08:20 - okay all right so we'll put this over
08:24 - here we'll put this on top here so the
08:27 - move controls here
08:28 - jump controls here okay so for the jump
08:31 - control what we're going to do is
08:34 - we're going to put the if statement here
08:38 - and then we're using sensing block
08:42 - okay uh if up arrows press
08:46 - so we are going to check if the player
08:48 - is on the ground or not
08:49 - um and if it's jump so we need to have a
08:54 - another if condition inside here
08:58 - okay so let's put this in here
09:02 - and then we're going to get the n
09:03 - operator
09:05 - put that here well you guys can see
09:09 - okay and then we're gonna say
09:13 - [Music]
09:15 - so on the ground we'll call it greater
09:17 - than zero so we'll use
09:18 - one z zero for the ground testing it
09:21 - okay we're just gonna say
09:23 - if the on the ground
09:26 - is greater than zero and
09:32 - it's jumping where's the jumping
09:36 - okay we're gonna use the variable
09:38 - jumping
09:40 - if it's equal to zero so this
09:43 - uh is on the ground and then it's uh
09:45 - it's jumping is zero that means not
09:47 - jumping then you can jump
09:49 - so what we're going to do is we're going
09:50 - to set
09:53 - so set
09:58 - so we're going to set the on the ground
10:01 - to zero
10:02 - because it's not on the ground anymore
10:05 - and we are going to set the
10:07 - jump to one that means it's jumping
10:12 - and we're going to set the gravity
10:14 - [Music]
10:17 - g velocity i'm gonna set it 15 to 15
10:21 - height you'll jump
10:22 - okay okay so we're gonna have to call
10:25 - this jump block over here in the all
10:27 - control
10:29 - have this away after the movement the
10:31 - jump block
10:33 - and we are going to change out this a
10:36 - little bit
10:40 - so we will say if
10:43 - and else okay we're going to check the
10:46 - arrow
10:48 - key again here
10:51 - if the up arrows press
10:57 - we're going to say change
11:00 - uh the velocity by the gravity so the
11:03 - gravity right now is negative
11:05 - one that we set up here right here
11:08 - on top okay so else
11:12 - we'll change it to two so we're gonna
11:15 - use a multiply
11:17 - so we can use the operator multiply
11:20 - the g gravity by two so it will be
11:22 - either negative one or negative two
11:24 - so it's jumping up then it's one
11:26 - negative one falling down
11:28 - if it's jumping on uh it's on the top
11:30 - falling down with big of negative two so
11:32 - it's faster you're
11:33 - falling down from the top okay all right
11:36 - and then you're gonna have to change the
11:38 - y so you change the y by the
11:43 - velocity that we're just uh changing
11:45 - right so like this
11:48 - okay so let me test it so you can see so
11:51 - when i run this it will kind of fall
11:53 - down and then we'll just follow the way
11:54 - down
11:55 - because we're not blocking it so if you
11:57 - see you see here
11:58 - it's falling down it's falling all the
12:00 - way down so what we want to do is we are
12:03 - going to um
12:05 - make him stay on the top here on the
12:07 - platform okay
12:08 - all right we'll save the project go back
12:10 - to the main character let's put this
12:12 - down
12:14 - okay so we will create another block to
12:16 - fix this
12:18 - so call this uh check
12:21 - hit ground
12:24 - okay so we're gonna have to create this
12:26 - boolean variable
12:28 - called is jumping and then click on this
12:32 - run without refresh okay make sure you
12:35 - have that
12:36 - and we are going to create it over here
12:38 - in the bottom here
12:40 - or maybe over here
12:44 - okay so we're going to use a repeat
12:45 - until loop here
12:48 - we're going to use a not operator
12:52 - now we're going to check if it's not
12:54 - touching the ground
12:56 - okay which is this right here
13:01 - and we have to check one more thing
13:05 - we'll do if and else
13:08 - and we're gonna drag this over here
13:12 - what we're going to do is uh changing
13:14 - the x
13:15 - on the y i mean change y
13:20 - change y y minus one
13:24 - okay and then
13:28 - okay so we're gonna set this variable
13:32 - [Music]
13:33 - so set the key velocity
13:38 - okay to zero here and then the else
13:41 - block
13:42 - will duplicate this and then we'll put
13:44 - one here
13:46 - sorry let me stop that accidentally do
13:49 - that
13:50 - and then we're going to say set the uh
13:54 - on the ground to one so when we touch
13:56 - the ground we'll set it to one
14:00 - and then we need another if condition
14:02 - inside here
14:06 - and then operator and check if it's
14:09 - jumping
14:10 - so we get this jump variable here
14:14 - and equal to one that means it's jumping
14:16 - then we'll set
14:19 - this back to zero
14:23 - okay okay so we're to call this new
14:26 - function that we
14:27 - just made so put it under this
14:30 - checkpoint
14:31 - from detection here and what we're going
14:34 - to do is we're going to use the operator
14:37 - using this we say if the velocity
14:41 - is greater than zero we're gonna call it
14:45 - okay okay so let me test it out
14:49 - so i think i see i start here right
14:52 - so let me go back over here and stop so
14:55 - it drops down see
14:56 - just it stays there so as you can see
14:59 - you can move it you see this kind of
15:00 - slides up
15:01 - to this we're gonna fix that actually so
15:04 - this is not good right we don't want
15:05 - this
15:05 - happening so jumping is good we have no
15:08 - animation yet
15:10 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
15:13 - going to do something here to fix that
15:16 - okay so let's go back to the hitbox okay
15:19 - stop this
15:21 - okay so we're going to move this over
15:23 - here actually we're going to call
15:24 - something for this guy
15:28 - or maybe i'll move this over here so
15:31 - that i can
15:33 - have some more coal later on for this
15:36 - put this back here okay so all my red
15:38 - custom block i put
15:40 - on the right side right except this one
15:43 - i guess this one's on the left but it's
15:45 - okay
15:45 - all right so let's continue this so
15:48 - we'll fix this part here
15:50 - um so we are going to create another
15:53 - variable
15:55 - okay so we're going to create a new
15:57 - variable actually
15:58 - make it called
16:00 - [Music]
16:02 - deviation so we're going to check some
16:06 - deviation of the sprite and the and the
16:09 - platform
16:10 - okay okay for this one
16:13 - make sure that you select for this
16:15 - bright only since we don't have a
16:16 - a g in the front right so this is a for
16:19 - this sprite only for the main character
16:21 - sprite
16:22 - okay so let's set this guy here
16:26 - set deviation to zero
16:30 - and then we're gonna use a repeat until
16:33 - [Music]
16:34 - here and we are going to be using
16:38 - operator
16:39 - nut or
16:42 - not not or and then we're going to use a
16:45 - knot here
16:48 - and then we're going to use the equal
16:49 - here okay let's
16:51 - zoom this in a little bit okay we're
16:54 - going to check this
16:55 - variable that we just created deviation
16:58 - we can open it up i guess you can see it
17:01 - okay we'll check this equal to let's say
17:03 - five or something doesn't matter
17:04 - just some number of deviation here we're
17:06 - gonna check
17:08 - and then you're gonna check this one um
17:11 - touching ground so it is not
17:14 - or the using the firewall not touching
17:17 - the ground
17:18 - so what we're going to do is we're going
17:21 - to change the y
17:24 - by one all right
17:28 - and then we say change variable
17:33 - change division by one also okay all
17:35 - right so so far this is what we have
17:38 - and then we need another if statement
17:40 - under this so if this
17:41 - is done will come out it will run this
17:44 - code below
17:46 - uh what we're going to put an equal here
17:49 - uh duplicate this put this over here go
17:52 - to
17:53 - 5 and then what we want to do is
17:58 - say change change x
18:03 - i'm going to use an operator and change
18:05 - y let's get both of them
18:08 - then we'll go back to the here we're
18:10 - going to get the minus
18:13 - operator and duplicate this again
18:17 - the minus here so we're gonna use a zero
18:21 - so minus the x speed
18:25 - and put zero here and minus that
18:28 - deviation
18:30 - okay so let's see if it's going to work
18:33 - so let me try it out
18:35 - okay so let's try this out
18:39 - okay so as you can see i can move this
18:42 - sprite
18:43 - jump and you see it doesn't fall through
18:46 - the
18:46 - lot like last time so it doesn't fall
18:49 - through right
18:49 - so it's pretty good pretty good so this
18:52 - is
18:54 - good okay
18:56 - so i think we'll stop here right now uh
18:58 - let me zoom out the code make sure you
19:00 - guys got all the code
19:02 - okay so let's go from the this side
19:07 - so you have the uh start here and then
19:09 - there's custom block here
19:11 - so this is the forever loop running this
19:14 - is the main one that calls other uh
19:16 - code and then these are all the other
19:19 - custom
19:20 - block that we have okay
19:23 - that's the jump control we work on today
19:25 - the check box the
19:27 - check the ground they will hit the
19:29 - ground the movement
19:31 - okay so this is all we have for this
19:34 - and this one is the same we don't have
19:36 - any code yet for this
19:38 - one so next next um
19:41 - video we're gonna make the among us uh
19:45 - animated character to move along with
19:48 - this box so that it looks better
19:49 - so as of right now you know it just
19:51 - cannot move like this
19:53 - you can jump so it looks okay
19:56 - so far like a square right if you're
19:58 - using a square
20:00 - uh and uh not moving then this is fine
20:02 - so you see this
20:03 - it's good it's not moving to the top
20:06 - it's great
20:07 - okay all right this is where we're gonna
20:09 - stop here so i hope you guys like this
20:11 - video
20:12 - uh please like share and subscribe to
20:14 - our channel
20:15 - and please after you view this video at
20:17 - least give us a thumbs up
20:18 - that will really help us on the video
20:20 - and thanks for supporting us
20:22 - see you guys next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome back to kids cooling playground so uh yesterday we did our first platformer for the uh among us so uh please like uh share subscribe to our channel and give us a thumbs up on the video uh so far we already have two thumbs down on the video not sure why so please guys if you enjoy this video give us a thumbs up on all the all our video so that was a great way to support us okay all right so let's get to it so this is what we have for the code for the main character yesterday so you uh miss anything kind of stop here and then um uh get it down uh what we can do is um probably put all the uh custom block on the left and then go on the right or whatever you guys like you can do that so i did not give out the main character yesterday the sprite is pretty easy to draw just just black box right so then you guys did that already and then we have this one uh let's put this idle costume on the last one for here and set in the first because we are going to use it to run so we're going to make it in the last costume okay put it in the end 13 okay all right so for now let's get to it okay so what we're going to do is we're going to create some platform for the game so that's that way you guys can start learning it i think everybody really liked the platform uh so i can upload the backpack here but i'm going to show you guys how to do that okay so platform i will provide some of the platform sprite for you guys and then you guys can change it the way you like so let's say this is our first one uh let's just do something simple for now uh so let's let's just remove all these guys for right now okay uh we don't need any maybe one of these okay okay let's have first three first floor okay i think that's good should be good enough so we trash only the other one okay so we're the first four we're gonna even delete this just like that so i'm gonna provide the sprite for the first four level and then you guys can change it the way you want so these are just blocks right make sure that when you are creating the block let's say you need to make a new platform but you can take this base one take all this copy it make a ping a new sprite and then put in the bottom and then what you can do is uh you can say uh ungroup all this and let's say you want to just take this box out so make that as group okay it's already grouped okay copy that you can move them on top let's say you want to put another box here right so you can do that or you can put another box here which you can do that so you can have like multiple box right for the for the sprite to jump up okay as you guys can see we created two little box here it's pretty easy so um i already did most of the hard work here while creating those uh image for you and you can just take it and then just kind of mix and match it like you know you have the rectangular box you have the bowl like the laser so something similar to like that you can however design your screen you know you can have upper top or lower top i mean upper here you have something on the top you can have something on the bottom and make some gap here so that you know it can fall off and die so this is kind of how it looks like and you know just different thing that you can put and if you want something on the top you can say like this copy this control paste uh group them all make sure you cook them all and then you can just flip it and then you can have it on the top so you can set it like here something like this like that so you can delete that you know anything you like right so this is like a a stage like this now you can have boxes here you know stack another one or you can put one of these right on here you can put them like this for them to jump on and if you want to add a laser you can add this guy so this is my laser well you can add it over here let's say you wanna the laser coming down here right and this bottom you want the different laser side and you want something else here or you can move these two blocks and group this and group you can delete these and then you can put the laser on top oops so however you want to do okay and then you can like take one of these from the bottom here and you can put it here somewhere like this right so you have a laser coming down something like that okay okay now let's go back to the code color variable uh we are going to add more variable to this um you can say um what else what do we have okay player dead and then speed right we have that uh you can say uh global variable so we can put them all having a g in the front is good so that we can have everything together uh this is the velocity okay uh for all the sprite okay pick another variable on ground so this will test if the sprite is on the ground and we're gonna make another variable uh gravity so we're gonna use a variable we can change it later you know how fast or whatever you need or you can you don't need it to do that also that would be fine but for now we just use this gravity okay and let's make one more call jumping so this one is not a global variable i did not put a g in the front make sure you select for the sprite only okay all right let's go back to our main character we have the reset here so what we're going to do is we're going to reset some of these variables that we just created so that you know when the game start you know we can make sure we're going to reset it so this reset the velocity to zero i'll reset the underground to zero reset the gravity let's gravity gravity okay we're gonna do negative one for grab and then we'll have one more oh i should then decrease this guy i accidentally created jump on the ground okay delete that sorry about that delete this guy let's go back to the main character okay i'll create over here my mistake i think i forgot when i was creating the variable when i was playing with the platform and i forgot about that so great jumping uh variable on this this sprite only for the for the main character not the ground okay uh you say jumping we'll set this to zero okay all right let me uh take out all these we'll keep this i guess we can yes we can take it out or leave it but let's just take it out a little more space on the screen to see i will leave this on and this is on okay so we are going to take a look at this okay all right so we'll make the main sprite jump as well and walk so uh what we're going to do is create another block called jump control and make this run without screen refresh okay all right so we'll put this over here we'll put this on top here so the move controls here jump controls here okay so for the jump control what we're going to do is we're going to put the if statement here and then we're using sensing block okay uh if up arrows press so we are going to check if the player is on the ground or not um and if it's jump so we need to have a another if condition inside here okay so let's put this in here and then we're going to get the n operator put that here well you guys can see okay and then we're gonna say so on the ground we'll call it greater than zero so we'll use one z zero for the ground testing it okay we're just gonna say if the on the ground is greater than zero and it's jumping where's the jumping okay we're gonna use the variable jumping if it's equal to zero so this uh is on the ground and then it's uh it's jumping is zero that means not jumping then you can jump so what we're going to do is we're going to set so set so we're going to set the on the ground to zero because it's not on the ground anymore and we are going to set the jump to one that means it's jumping and we're going to set the gravity g velocity i'm gonna set it 15 to 15 height you'll jump okay okay so we're gonna have to call this jump block over here in the all control have this away after the movement the jump block and we are going to change out this a little bit so we will say if and else okay we're going to check the arrow key again here if the up arrows press we're going to say change uh the velocity by the gravity so the gravity right now is negative one that we set up here right here on top okay so else we'll change it to two so we're gonna use a multiply so we can use the operator multiply the g gravity by two so it will be either negative one or negative two so it's jumping up then it's one negative one falling down if it's jumping on uh it's on the top falling down with big of negative two so it's faster you're falling down from the top okay all right and then you're gonna have to change the y so you change the y by the velocity that we're just uh changing right so like this okay so let me test it so you can see so when i run this it will kind of fall down and then we'll just follow the way down because we're not blocking it so if you see you see here it's falling down it's falling all the way down so what we want to do is we are going to um make him stay on the top here on the platform okay all right we'll save the project go back to the main character let's put this down okay so we will create another block to fix this so call this uh check hit ground okay so we're gonna have to create this boolean variable called is jumping and then click on this run without refresh okay make sure you have that and we are going to create it over here in the bottom here or maybe over here okay so we're going to use a repeat until loop here we're going to use a not operator now we're going to check if it's not touching the ground okay which is this right here and we have to check one more thing we'll do if and else and we're gonna drag this over here what we're going to do is uh changing the x on the y i mean change y change y y minus one okay and then okay so we're gonna set this variable so set the key velocity okay to zero here and then the else block will duplicate this and then we'll put one here sorry let me stop that accidentally do that and then we're going to say set the uh on the ground to one so when we touch the ground we'll set it to one and then we need another if condition inside here and then operator and check if it's jumping so we get this jump variable here and equal to one that means it's jumping then we'll set this back to zero okay okay so we're to call this new function that we just made so put it under this checkpoint from detection here and what we're going to do is we're going to use the operator using this we say if the velocity is greater than zero we're gonna call it okay okay so let me test it out so i think i see i start here right so let me go back over here and stop so it drops down see just it stays there so as you can see you can move it you see this kind of slides up to this we're gonna fix that actually so this is not good right we don't want this happening so jumping is good we have no animation yet okay so what we're going to do is we're going to do something here to fix that okay so let's go back to the hitbox okay stop this okay so we're going to move this over here actually we're going to call something for this guy or maybe i'll move this over here so that i can have some more coal later on for this put this back here okay so all my red custom block i put on the right side right except this one i guess this one's on the left but it's okay all right so let's continue this so we'll fix this part here um so we are going to create another variable okay so we're going to create a new variable actually make it called deviation so we're going to check some deviation of the sprite and the and the platform okay okay for this one make sure that you select for this bright only since we don't have a a g in the front right so this is a for this sprite only for the main character sprite okay so let's set this guy here set deviation to zero and then we're gonna use a repeat until here and we are going to be using operator nut or not not or and then we're going to use a knot here and then we're going to use the equal here okay let's zoom this in a little bit okay we're going to check this variable that we just created deviation we can open it up i guess you can see it okay we'll check this equal to let's say five or something doesn't matter just some number of deviation here we're gonna check and then you're gonna check this one um touching ground so it is not or the using the firewall not touching the ground so what we're going to do is we're going to change the y by one all right and then we say change variable change division by one also okay all right so so far this is what we have and then we need another if statement under this so if this is done will come out it will run this code below uh what we're going to put an equal here uh duplicate this put this over here go to 5 and then what we want to do is say change change x i'm going to use an operator and change y let's get both of them then we'll go back to the here we're going to get the minus operator and duplicate this again the minus here so we're gonna use a zero so minus the x speed and put zero here and minus that deviation okay so let's see if it's going to work so let me try it out okay so let's try this out okay so as you can see i can move this sprite jump and you see it doesn't fall through the lot like last time so it doesn't fall through right so it's pretty good pretty good so this is good okay so i think we'll stop here right now uh let me zoom out the code make sure you guys got all the code okay so let's go from the this side so you have the uh start here and then there's custom block here so this is the forever loop running this is the main one that calls other uh code and then these are all the other custom block that we have okay that's the jump control we work on today the check box the check the ground they will hit the ground the movement okay so this is all we have for this and this one is the same we don't have any code yet for this one so next next um video we're gonna make the among us uh animated character to move along with this box so that it looks better so as of right now you know it just cannot move like this you can jump so it looks okay so far like a square right if you're using a square uh and uh not moving then this is fine so you see this it's good it's not moving to the top it's great okay all right this is where we're gonna stop here so i hope you guys like this
