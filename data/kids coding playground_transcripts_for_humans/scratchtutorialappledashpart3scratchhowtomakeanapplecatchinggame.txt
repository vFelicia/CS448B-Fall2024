00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello and welcome back to kids coding
00:09 - playground today we'll be
00:10 - finishing up the third part for the
00:12 - apple dash game
00:13 - i think we'll have another part or so
00:15 - maybe two more parts for this game
00:17 - today we'll be working on the shop
00:19 - button and other stuff
00:22 - and so yeah so we're going to review
00:25 - from last time we did this game
00:27 - so this is the code for the player for
00:30 - the last time
00:32 - and this is the bomb
00:37 - that's the bomb this is the hp move this
00:41 - here and we have the basket
00:46 - fruit this one is the fruit
00:51 - and feel free to pause the video to put
00:54 - anything you missed
00:55 - from the last video so and then this is
00:57 - the begin button
00:59 - coin the coin
01:05 - yeah so that's the coin and hit box okay
01:09 - all right so today we're gonna be
01:11 - working on the shop
01:12 - all right so i got my shop button from
01:15 - my
01:16 - um backpack from here so i got the shop
01:19 - buttons really simple
01:21 - so all i did is just draw a circle and
01:23 - put the money
01:24 - symbol in it um so yeah that's what
01:28 - we're going to do
01:29 - the money button so in the money button
01:31 - we're going to start with a win grid
01:33 - flight clicked
01:35 - one more okay so when profile clicks we
01:37 - want to hide the button
01:40 - so in the beginning let's hide that uh
01:42 - and after that
01:43 - uh when i receive
01:47 - end game so i'm gonna receive end game
01:51 - so we're going to go to the front layer
01:55 - so once they lose we want to show the
01:57 - shop button to let them have opportunity
02:00 - to go to the shop so when i save end
02:02 - game
02:03 - we're going to go to the front layer
02:07 - and i'm gonna show
02:10 - yeah i think this should be a good place
02:12 - for the button to stay
02:14 - so i'm gonna get this
02:17 - x 115 y negative one one one
02:20 - and then i'm gonna show and i'm going to
02:23 - make it so when you hover your mouse
02:24 - over it it'll make it bigger and smaller
02:26 - so in the beginning we're going to
02:27 - set the size to 100 all right
02:30 - and after that we're going to get a
02:31 - forever loop so forever
02:35 - uh forever we're gonna change the size
02:38 - as you can see change the size we're
02:41 - gonna change the size by 100
02:43 - minus the size which is 500 of this
02:45 - thing
02:46 - divided by five so 500 divided by five
02:48 - is 100 so 100 minus 100 is zero
02:52 - so in the beginning i'm just going to
02:53 - change it by that so
02:57 - we're gonna get the subtract
03:00 - and division so put
03:04 - the subtract uh
03:07 - like put the division into the second
03:09 - one and do that
03:10 - and through that we're going to put 100
03:12 - in the first one
03:13 - we're going to subtract the size this
03:16 - block
03:17 - size so you can show it it's going to
03:20 - show the size
03:21 - of the shot button and we're going to
03:22 - divide it by five
03:25 - and after that if touching mouse pointer
03:27 - so we're gonna make it get bigger when
03:29 - it touches the mouse pointer so we're
03:30 - gonna get if
03:32 - touching mouse pointer uh then we're
03:36 - going to change
03:37 - i'm going to duplicate this we're going
03:39 - to change the size
03:40 - by 150 instead of 100
03:44 - right and we're going to get another if
03:47 - then segment
03:48 - if uh we're going to touching
03:51 - mouse pointer and mouse down so if
03:54 - you're clicking on the shot button
03:55 - so if touching mouse pointer
04:00 - and mouse down to make sure that the
04:02 - player is actually clicking on it so
04:04 - we're going to
04:04 - mess down as well and then we're going
04:07 - to set the brightness
04:08 - to negative 10 so make it let's add a
04:10 - little effect to it so
04:11 - make it less bright effects
04:14 - brightness effect to negative 10
04:17 - with that and then we're going to wait
04:19 - until the mouse is down
04:20 - before continuing into the next step
04:24 - wait until mouse down
04:27 - and after that we're going to broadcast
04:29 - a message called shop
04:30 - to let a script know that
04:33 - they're entering the shop so let's name
04:35 - it shop
04:37 - and we're going to show the variable
04:40 - money
04:40 - in case it's hidden oh actually i hit i
04:43 - showed it right there
04:44 - and actually this should be an if i'll
04:45 - statement i forgot to put this in
04:48 - if else because if else we're gonna set
04:51 - the brightness is zero
04:53 - so if else like that
04:57 - so if it's doing the if you click on it
05:00 - then it'll happen to this if you're not
05:01 - clicking on it we're going to set the
05:03 - brightness back to normal which is zero
05:06 - set the brightness back to zero okay
05:09 - like that
05:11 - and right here when i receive start
05:14 - screen
05:17 - when oops when i receive start screen
05:22 - uh start screen then we are going to
05:24 - hide
05:26 - and stop other scripts in the sprite so
05:27 - we want it to only show when you come up
05:32 - okay stop other scripts in this sprite
05:36 - other and when i receive start game
05:42 - start game we're going to hide
05:45 - and when i receive shop
05:48 - we're going to hide because you're
05:50 - entering the shop
05:52 - and you want to hide it okay so we're
05:54 - basically finished with the coding in
05:56 - the shop
05:57 - and now let's go back to the begin
05:59 - button so in the begin button
06:01 - we have to add something so i'm going to
06:04 - get a when i receive
06:06 - shop shop
06:10 - and we're going to duplicate this hide
06:14 - and stop other scripts in the sprite
06:16 - so yeah that's what we're going to do
06:18 - and let's try it out
06:22 - so i'm gonna lose on purpose right now
06:31 - so in my original game i duplicated the
06:33 - bomb so more bombs would fall down
06:36 - as you can see it shows up and when you
06:38 - hover your mouse it goes over it
06:40 - and as you can see when you click on it
06:41 - nothing happens because we didn't do
06:43 - anything with it yet
06:44 - so we're gonna make a new backdrop
06:47 - called the um
06:48 - shop backdrop so it's just a backdrop i
06:52 - got from the
06:52 - sprite library but i just uh i mean the
06:56 - um backdrop library but i made it into a
06:58 - sprite
06:59 - so we're actually going to choose a new
07:00 - backdrop
07:02 - i think i yeah jurassic this is the one
07:04 - i used okay i'm gonna use
07:05 - jurassic so what we want to do is go to
07:08 - the backdrop
07:11 - select the entire thing group it and
07:14 - copy paste ctrl c paint a new sprite
07:17 - and ctrl v then this will go into here
07:21 - and we can delete that i'm going to hide
07:23 - this for now i'm going to name
07:24 - it the shop background shop
07:28 - backdrop shot back drop let's move your
07:32 - name in
07:34 - so in the shop backdrop so once you
07:36 - click it it will switch to this backdrop
07:37 - because
07:38 - i want to make it different than the
07:39 - original one so when i receive
07:41 - shop in the shop backdrop we're coding
07:44 - here
07:45 - we're gonna go to zero zero which is the
07:48 - middle
07:51 - zero zero and we're going to show it
07:55 - and we're gonna make it go to front
07:56 - layer
07:58 - [Music]
07:59 - and then go backwards 10 layers
08:03 - go backwards i'm not really sure what
08:05 - this is necessary for but
08:07 - i put this in my original game so let's
08:10 - see
08:11 - what happens with it so this is the code
08:12 - i had so when i receive
08:14 - shop we're gonna activate all of this
08:17 - and then
08:17 - in the beginning we're also gonna when
08:19 - we go in the shop i'm gonna hide the
08:20 - variable score
08:24 - and then we're also gonna hide the
08:25 - variable high score
08:27 - my cloud variable
08:30 - and i also not want to hide the
08:33 - variable force field which we don't have
08:37 - i'm pretty sure
08:38 - but i put it there because um later
08:41 - when we can buy force fields we're going
08:43 - to have to do that okay
08:45 - and then i'm going to get a one green
08:47 - flag clicked when i when
08:48 - i collect we're going to hide the
08:49 - variable money so we only want to show
08:52 - the money in the shop
08:57 - and hide in the beginning
09:00 - and um when i receive start game
09:07 - then we're going to show the variable
09:10 - money and hide
09:12 - some start game
09:16 - money and hide so we're going to hide
09:19 - after this
09:21 - and when i receive endgame we're going
09:22 - to show them as well
09:28 - we're going to show the variable bunny
09:31 - show variable money okay
09:35 - so there we have our shop background
09:37 - money uh thing so
09:39 - i'm gonna lose on purpose and show you
09:41 - that it switches the bathroom
09:43 - to this once you get to the shop okay
09:48 - hopefully
09:54 - so now the shop appears click on it
09:57 - switches the shop backdrop and shows you
09:59 - the money
10:00 - of how much money you have left as you
10:02 - can see so the reason we hide the money
10:04 - in the beginning is to hide it in here
10:07 - so the beginning
10:08 - a starting screen looks a bit more fresh
10:11 - and then when you start this will happen
10:14 - up again
10:15 - then there will show so yes that's what
10:17 - we want
10:19 - we also want an exit button okay so exit
10:22 - button
10:24 - so when you get to the shop we probably
10:26 - want to exit button so you can go back
10:28 - to the game the home page so in the exit
10:31 - button i am going to get it for my
10:33 - backpack
10:34 - okay so i just got my exit button for my
10:35 - backdrop
10:37 - so for this one i just got an image from
10:39 - online like this exit thing
10:41 - and inserted it into a circle with color
10:44 - to make it look better
10:45 - um you guys can make this yourself it's
10:47 - pretty simple or you can even just draw
10:49 - an arrow with a circle or something like
10:51 - that
10:52 - but i just got this image png from
10:53 - online and threw a circle around it's
10:55 - really simple
10:57 - um so this is the exit button let's go
10:59 - to the code for the exit button
11:00 - let's go to 100 clicks in the beginning
11:04 - and hide so we'll hide the exit button
11:07 - and when i receive start game
11:10 - we want to hide this
11:14 - as well
11:17 - and then i want to receive shop
11:22 - so when you're in the shop then we want
11:24 - this to go to the front layer
11:28 - where is it that looks like a perfect
11:30 - spot for the thing as well
11:32 - probably because i got in the backpack
11:33 - it automatically positions it for me
11:35 - so this is the spot i had it originally
11:37 - so i'm just gonna make it go to this
11:38 - position it looks like a good spot
11:40 - to me i'm gonna show
11:43 - [Music]
11:44 - set the size to 100 because i'm going to
11:46 - make it big and small
11:49 - so remember this code right here
11:52 - from this thing drag and drop this
11:57 - right here yeah that
12:00 - okay you might have to change some code
12:02 - okay
12:04 - so this can be kept as normal this
12:09 - can be kept except we can have to take
12:11 - out this shop thing
12:13 - and then in this script and the if
12:15 - statement right here we're going to set
12:16 - the hit bomb to no
12:18 - so you can't get hit by bombs to
12:22 - make sure that the player is not getting
12:24 - hit by a bomb
12:25 - inside the shop so i'm going to set it
12:27 - to no
12:28 - and i'm going to show the variable money
12:31 - pretty sure we showed it in the other
12:32 - one but i'm going to do it again
12:34 - just in case and i'm going to start
12:36 - broadcast start game
12:38 - because you're going back so when they
12:40 - click on you you want it to go back to
12:41 - the home page
12:43 - so that's what this thing does
12:46 - all right see this is the code
12:50 - pretty simple okay so we have finished
12:52 - our exits right
12:54 - so now let's try it out something got
12:57 - messed up and this thing got really big
13:00 - because i have to set this to 100.
13:05 - okay so i found the mistake i did on the
13:08 - button
13:09 - that made it really big as you can see
13:11 - so what you have to do
13:12 - is actually in the shop i did it like
13:15 - this
13:17 - but in the button it has to be like this
13:19 - so
13:20 - as you can see it has to be like
13:24 - holds up okay yeah so let's go back to
13:26 - exit so
13:27 - you want to make it this subtract
13:30 - here you want to make this into the
13:33 - first
13:34 - section of the divide as you can see
13:35 - there's a difference this one is
13:37 - subtracting
13:38 - this divided by this but this is the
13:41 - opposite this is
13:42 - subtracting and then dividing like that
13:45 - so we're going to do that
13:47 - so we want to reverse it put this into
13:50 - the first
13:51 - and then you got that so now let's show
13:53 - you
13:54 - let me hide the size
14:04 - [Music]
14:10 - okay chop as you can see it goes to the
14:13 - backdrop and as you can see the button
14:16 - works now you click it you go back to
14:18 - the beginning
14:18 - right here so yeah that's what we want
14:22 - so it's little things like this that can
14:23 - actually make a difference inside the
14:25 - game
14:26 - so yeah that's basically today's
14:28 - tutorial on apple dash part 3 so today
14:31 - we worked in the shop backdrop
14:33 - the actual shop button and the exit
14:35 - button
14:37 - so yes that's what we have for today
14:39 - thank you guys for watching
14:40 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
14:43 - and i'll see you guys in the next
14:45 - tutorial
14:47 - [Music]
14:55 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to kids coding playground today we'll be finishing up the third part for the apple dash game i think we'll have another part or so maybe two more parts for this game today we'll be working on the shop button and other stuff and so yeah so we're going to review from last time we did this game so this is the code for the player for the last time and this is the bomb that's the bomb this is the hp move this here and we have the basket fruit this one is the fruit and feel free to pause the video to put anything you missed from the last video so and then this is the begin button coin the coin yeah so that's the coin and hit box okay all right so today we're gonna be working on the shop all right so i got my shop button from my um backpack from here so i got the shop buttons really simple so all i did is just draw a circle and put the money symbol in it um so yeah that's what we're going to do the money button so in the money button we're going to start with a win grid flight clicked one more okay so when profile clicks we want to hide the button so in the beginning let's hide that uh and after that uh when i receive end game so i'm gonna receive end game so we're going to go to the front layer so once they lose we want to show the shop button to let them have opportunity to go to the shop so when i save end game we're going to go to the front layer and i'm gonna show yeah i think this should be a good place for the button to stay so i'm gonna get this x 115 y negative one one one and then i'm gonna show and i'm going to make it so when you hover your mouse over it it'll make it bigger and smaller so in the beginning we're going to set the size to 100 all right and after that we're going to get a forever loop so forever uh forever we're gonna change the size as you can see change the size we're gonna change the size by 100 minus the size which is 500 of this thing divided by five so 500 divided by five is 100 so 100 minus 100 is zero so in the beginning i'm just going to change it by that so we're gonna get the subtract and division so put the subtract uh like put the division into the second one and do that and through that we're going to put 100 in the first one we're going to subtract the size this block size so you can show it it's going to show the size of the shot button and we're going to divide it by five and after that if touching mouse pointer so we're gonna make it get bigger when it touches the mouse pointer so we're gonna get if touching mouse pointer uh then we're going to change i'm going to duplicate this we're going to change the size by 150 instead of 100 right and we're going to get another if then segment if uh we're going to touching mouse pointer and mouse down so if you're clicking on the shot button so if touching mouse pointer and mouse down to make sure that the player is actually clicking on it so we're going to mess down as well and then we're going to set the brightness to negative 10 so make it let's add a little effect to it so make it less bright effects brightness effect to negative 10 with that and then we're going to wait until the mouse is down before continuing into the next step wait until mouse down and after that we're going to broadcast a message called shop to let a script know that they're entering the shop so let's name it shop and we're going to show the variable money in case it's hidden oh actually i hit i showed it right there and actually this should be an if i'll statement i forgot to put this in if else because if else we're gonna set the brightness is zero so if else like that so if it's doing the if you click on it then it'll happen to this if you're not clicking on it we're going to set the brightness back to normal which is zero set the brightness back to zero okay like that and right here when i receive start screen when oops when i receive start screen uh start screen then we are going to hide and stop other scripts in the sprite so we want it to only show when you come up okay stop other scripts in this sprite other and when i receive start game start game we're going to hide and when i receive shop we're going to hide because you're entering the shop and you want to hide it okay so we're basically finished with the coding in the shop and now let's go back to the begin button so in the begin button we have to add something so i'm going to get a when i receive shop shop and we're going to duplicate this hide and stop other scripts in the sprite so yeah that's what we're going to do and let's try it out so i'm gonna lose on purpose right now so in my original game i duplicated the bomb so more bombs would fall down as you can see it shows up and when you hover your mouse it goes over it and as you can see when you click on it nothing happens because we didn't do anything with it yet so we're gonna make a new backdrop called the um shop backdrop so it's just a backdrop i got from the sprite library but i just uh i mean the um backdrop library but i made it into a sprite so we're actually going to choose a new backdrop i think i yeah jurassic this is the one i used okay i'm gonna use jurassic so what we want to do is go to the backdrop select the entire thing group it and copy paste ctrl c paint a new sprite and ctrl v then this will go into here and we can delete that i'm going to hide this for now i'm going to name it the shop background shop backdrop shot back drop let's move your name in so in the shop backdrop so once you click it it will switch to this backdrop because i want to make it different than the original one so when i receive shop in the shop backdrop we're coding here we're gonna go to zero zero which is the middle zero zero and we're going to show it and we're gonna make it go to front layer and then go backwards 10 layers go backwards i'm not really sure what this is necessary for but i put this in my original game so let's see what happens with it so this is the code i had so when i receive shop we're gonna activate all of this and then in the beginning we're also gonna when we go in the shop i'm gonna hide the variable score and then we're also gonna hide the variable high score my cloud variable and i also not want to hide the variable force field which we don't have i'm pretty sure but i put it there because um later when we can buy force fields we're going to have to do that okay and then i'm going to get a one green flag clicked when i when i collect we're going to hide the variable money so we only want to show the money in the shop and hide in the beginning and um when i receive start game then we're going to show the variable money and hide some start game money and hide so we're going to hide after this and when i receive endgame we're going to show them as well we're going to show the variable bunny show variable money okay so there we have our shop background money uh thing so i'm gonna lose on purpose and show you that it switches the bathroom to this once you get to the shop okay hopefully so now the shop appears click on it switches the shop backdrop and shows you the money of how much money you have left as you can see so the reason we hide the money in the beginning is to hide it in here so the beginning a starting screen looks a bit more fresh and then when you start this will happen up again then there will show so yes that's what we want we also want an exit button okay so exit button so when you get to the shop we probably want to exit button so you can go back to the game the home page so in the exit button i am going to get it for my backpack okay so i just got my exit button for my backdrop so for this one i just got an image from online like this exit thing and inserted it into a circle with color to make it look better um you guys can make this yourself it's pretty simple or you can even just draw an arrow with a circle or something like that but i just got this image png from online and threw a circle around it's really simple um so this is the exit button let's go to the code for the exit button let's go to 100 clicks in the beginning and hide so we'll hide the exit button and when i receive start game we want to hide this as well and then i want to receive shop so when you're in the shop then we want this to go to the front layer where is it that looks like a perfect spot for the thing as well probably because i got in the backpack it automatically positions it for me so this is the spot i had it originally so i'm just gonna make it go to this position it looks like a good spot to me i'm gonna show set the size to 100 because i'm going to make it big and small so remember this code right here from this thing drag and drop this right here yeah that okay you might have to change some code okay so this can be kept as normal this can be kept except we can have to take out this shop thing and then in this script and the if statement right here we're going to set the hit bomb to no so you can't get hit by bombs to make sure that the player is not getting hit by a bomb inside the shop so i'm going to set it to no and i'm going to show the variable money pretty sure we showed it in the other one but i'm going to do it again just in case and i'm going to start broadcast start game because you're going back so when they click on you you want it to go back to the home page so that's what this thing does all right see this is the code pretty simple okay so we have finished our exits right so now let's try it out something got messed up and this thing got really big because i have to set this to 100. okay so i found the mistake i did on the button that made it really big as you can see so what you have to do is actually in the shop i did it like this but in the button it has to be like this so as you can see it has to be like holds up okay yeah so let's go back to exit so you want to make it this subtract here you want to make this into the first section of the divide as you can see there's a difference this one is subtracting this divided by this but this is the opposite this is subtracting and then dividing like that so we're going to do that so we want to reverse it put this into the first and then you got that so now let's show you let me hide the size okay chop as you can see it goes to the backdrop and as you can see the button works now you click it you go back to the beginning right here so yeah that's what we want so it's little things like this that can actually make a difference inside the game so yeah that's basically today's tutorial on apple dash part 3 so today we worked in the shop backdrop the actual shop button and the exit button so yes that's what we have for today thank you guys for watching don't forget to like
