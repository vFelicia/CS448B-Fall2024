00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:10 - playground here and today we're back for
00:12 - another video
00:13 - dress the turkey we worked on this
00:15 - yesterday
00:16 - if um yeah we worked on this yesterday i
00:19 - made the first part yesterday so if you
00:20 - haven't watched that
00:22 - you can watch that right now right here
00:25 - so and the last part we coded the turkey
00:29 - the scarf choice and scarf
00:31 - so this is the code for the turkey
00:36 - so feel free to pause if you uh
00:40 - if you um i want to pause it because you
00:43 - don't have all this
00:44 - code and that's all the code for the
00:45 - turkey
00:47 - and i think we can zoom in one more
00:51 - and the scarf choice this is all the
00:53 - code for the scarf choice
00:58 - this is the scarf choice and the scarf
01:03 - last but not least the scar so if you do
01:06 - not have this code
01:08 - if you not have this code
01:13 - so if you do not have this code if you
01:15 - do not have this code then you should
01:17 - code it right now because
01:18 - we're going to work on the second part
01:20 - because this is the second part so
01:22 - feel free to pause again so
01:25 - anyways before i start please like share
01:29 - subscribe and comment in the comment
01:30 - section below for what else content you
01:32 - want
01:32 - so anyways let's start on the glasses
01:37 - so um oh yeah before i start i gotta
01:40 - show you something
01:40 - so my rooster which was originally the
01:43 - turkey
01:44 - um as you could see no not you can't see
01:47 - right now but
01:48 - um the rooster it was missing a piece of
01:52 - the leg
01:53 - and the bottom so i drew another piece
01:56 - of leg for the bottom
01:58 - of the leg so because this has like
02:01 - this little uh talon and this doesn't
02:05 - have the talon
02:06 - so i drew the little talon for the
02:09 - rooster as well so so you just have to
02:13 - copy and paste this
02:15 - it's going to ungroup it first
02:21 - and ungroup and then you can just copy
02:24 - and paste this ctrl c
02:26 - ctrl v and then add it on here and then
02:28 - shift it around
02:32 - so yeah that's basically how you do the
02:34 - rooster like if you want
02:36 - so anyways let's get started on the
02:37 - glasses so
02:40 - uh we can delete glasses e because this
02:42 - is like a rabbit
02:43 - so we can delete glasses e and then
02:46 - there's glasses a b
02:47 - and c that we're gonna use so i'm gonna
02:50 - try to use that because i think we could
02:52 - use the rabbit one
02:53 - only if we took out the glasses so
02:56 - uh and then we can just control z this
03:01 - so we can
03:04 - control see this rabbit face no not
03:06 - control z
03:07 - delete that rabbit face and we have the
03:09 - glasses so we could use the glasses and
03:11 - improvise if you want
03:12 - and i just figured out a bug it says
03:14 - glasses e it's supposed to be d
03:16 - because there's four costumes a b c d
03:19 - and it says
03:20 - e so that makes no sense but whatever um
03:24 - let's get on to the code so a b c e
03:27 - not d so let's get started so when the
03:30 - green flag is clicked
03:33 - it will switch costume to glasses b
03:36 - so glasses b is the one that's like this
03:40 - so i wanted to start out with this
03:42 - because i just want to
03:44 - and it'll go to a position i have
03:47 - written down negative 165
03:50 - positive y88 and it'll go to
03:55 - front layer because it's always in the
03:57 - front because if it's in the back layer
03:59 - it won't be on the turkey's
04:00 - face it'll be on the turkey's back so
04:04 - go to black in front later
04:07 - and then when this sprite is clicked
04:13 - so i'm going to code something and show
04:15 - you this so
04:16 - it will glide one second
04:19 - to x y
04:23 - so i'm gonna show you this so when the
04:26 - one glide one second to
04:29 - so you need the tricky block
04:33 - backdrop of stage duplicate this
04:36 - so i'm going to show you how to use this
04:40 - these types of things so x plus you
04:42 - could change the back
04:43 - um turkey exposition of the turkey
04:47 - and y position of the turkey
04:50 - so this is how you use it so i'm gonna
04:53 - start
04:55 - and as you can see if i click on the
04:56 - glasses it won't be on its eyes and you
04:59 - want the glasses to be on the eyes
05:00 - because no one wears glasses on the tail
05:02 - so we need to be up here so
05:06 - we need to add some things like uh
05:10 - add plus 30 like what we did for the
05:12 - scarf to
05:13 - move it to the so originally it was
05:17 - it would glide over here we need to move
05:19 - it to the left and up
05:20 - so x position minus 35
05:25 - because if this is the negative side
05:27 - this is the positive side and you want
05:28 - it to move left
05:30 - so i'm gonna do that right now x
05:33 - position minus let's say around 35
05:38 - because
05:39 - why not and the y position
05:45 - it's plus 45 because you want it to go
05:47 - up a little bit so
05:48 - i'm gonna try plus 45 and see if it
05:51 - works
05:52 - so plus 45
05:57 - so let's see if this will work
06:01 - definitely i was really lucky for those
06:03 - coordinates so
06:05 - not scripted okay so let's just continue
06:09 - so so you can adjust it if it's not
06:12 - right
06:13 - but that was definitely scripted because
06:14 - i have done this project before
06:16 - so when if then else you know if then
06:19 - else so we're actually going to be
06:21 - coding this so we got to put this in the
06:22 - else because
06:23 - it's on the left so
06:26 - if the direction
06:29 - of turkey
06:36 - of turkey is more than
06:40 - zero which is that includes one two
06:42 - three four five
06:43 - uh et cetera oh not negative so it's up
06:46 - here right side
06:48 - so and i'll glide one second so we can
06:51 - just duplicate this and just change a
06:52 - little bit
06:53 - so glide one second to x position of
06:55 - turkey
06:56 - plus 35 because it's positive so you
06:59 - need a plus
07:06 - let's take third i meant three okay this
07:08 - is scripted
07:09 - so um and then y position plus 45 that's
07:12 - correct
07:13 - and also let's try
07:17 - bam right on the eyes but we haven't
07:20 - done the moving code for it yet so
07:24 - so we're so we're gonna move the chicken
07:27 - to the
07:27 - i mean the rooster to the turkey to the
07:30 - uh
07:30 - right side and the left side so
07:34 - that's where it is so anyways we're
07:36 - gonna coat it to follow the
07:38 - turkey as you can see right there right
07:40 - on the spot
07:41 - and if i moved it like here
07:45 - right on the spot right on the spot so
07:48 - we're going to keep on coating so it
07:49 - will follow the turkey
07:50 - or the rooster no the turkey yeah the
07:53 - turkey
07:54 - uh yeah and it'll go forever
07:59 - if then else
08:03 - then i also duplicate this whole entire
08:05 - block but we're going to change it up a
08:06 - little bit
08:07 - it's an outstanding direction of turkey
08:09 - is less is more than zero that's correct
08:12 - and this forever we do not need and we
08:14 - do not need this
08:16 - or this so we delete all that you know
08:19 - set x
08:20 - to uh x position
08:25 - plus 30. so we can just duplicate that
08:27 - put that in there
08:28 - and then we can duplicate this but then
08:30 - make it nega
08:31 - minus 35 so we can put that right in
08:34 - here wait we don't have that yet
08:35 - so set x to
08:39 - exposition of turkey minus 35 and then
08:42 - we also need this
08:43 - for the end and then also set y instead
08:46 - of
08:47 - x from the bottom not inside
08:50 - to y position a turkey plus 45
08:55 - so let's try out this project so i have
08:57 - the turkey moving frequently right here
09:00 - all the little movements and if you do
09:02 - not move him he looks at you
09:04 - and bam they're going him he's following
09:07 - him great
09:08 - and then the scarf bam following him
09:11 - change the scarf up
09:13 - yeah and then we're gonna work on the
09:16 - glasses change so
09:17 - the glasses change is quite different
09:20 - from the scarf change so
09:23 - when the when this sprite when the green
09:25 - flag is clicked
09:27 - it will go to a certain position so
09:30 - i'm gonna drag this over here let's say
09:33 - around
09:34 - here let's put it over here
09:41 - then we're going to move the hat up and
09:42 - then we're going to work on that later
09:43 - so the glass is choice
09:45 - and the green flag is clicked it will go
09:47 - to
09:48 - this position and then when the sprite
09:50 - is clicked
09:52 - guess what will happen it will broadcast
09:55 - switch glasses
09:56 - because we did that for the scarf so
09:59 - broadcast
10:01 - switch glasses glasses choice
10:09 - i think we had that for this card uh
10:12 - switch glasses
10:19 - i we have scarf choice we can rename
10:22 - this
10:24 - yeah i'll be r i'll rename that
10:27 - so i'm going to finish the glasses right
10:30 - here
10:32 - so um i'm going to finish the glasses
10:36 - oh
10:39 - so for this part you need a when i
10:42 - receive
10:44 - glasses switch glasses which is
10:45 - basically glasses choice
10:48 - it'll go to the next costume
10:52 - so glasses choice glasses choice
10:56 - glasses choice bunny
11:01 - so that's basically what it is
11:05 - i know that glasses d which basically
11:08 - glasses e is not in the
11:12 - exact position so you gotta copy this
11:14 - paste
11:15 - that and we're gonna adjust it so um
11:18 - we're gonna group
11:20 - all this together because i already
11:23 - grouped
11:24 - and then we're gonna do this and adjust
11:27 - it
11:27 - adjust it a little bit
11:32 - so i'm gonna try adjusting this
11:37 - these glasses i noticed that the glasses
11:39 - weren't completely in the
11:41 - spot we'll see
11:47 - i noticed that the glasses weren't
11:49 - completely
11:51 - over there so
11:56 - we can center it
12:00 - so right in the center
12:09 - oopsies so you put your finger on the
12:12 - screen and then we're gonna move
12:14 - glasses e up so i think i have to group
12:16 - classes e now
12:20 - or b and then move it up a little bit
12:25 - right in the middle directly so i think
12:27 - that's great
12:28 - i think that's good i think we're done
12:30 - with the glasses
12:32 - so that's basically it
12:36 - and then we're gonna work on the hat now
12:39 - or we can just change this to scarf
12:41 - choice
12:41 - or we can we can change that instead of
12:44 - writing a scarf choice we can do
12:48 - switch scarf
12:52 - so because i did scarf choice instead of
12:55 - the other one so switch
12:59 - scarf yeah i don't think you can delete
13:02 - broadcasts
13:04 - but it'll go away later because it's not
13:07 - used
13:08 - so we're gonna use the hat
13:11 - so we're gonna do the hat so the hat
13:18 - so um we're gonna work on the hat now so
13:22 - the hat so when the green flag is
13:26 - clicked
13:27 - it'll switch costume to hat
13:30 - b and it'll go to i have a coordinate
13:33 - already written
13:36 - go to negative 63
13:40 - positive 145 y
13:43 - you can make it go to a different spot
13:44 - if you want it'll go to the front layer
13:47 - so it'll be in front of everything but
13:51 - it'll go backward one layer so it'll be
13:53 - behind the glasses because
13:55 - i'm pretty sure hats are behind glasses
13:58 - when you wear them
13:59 - because you don't want your glasses to
14:00 - be everywhere and also
14:02 - when the sprite is clicked
14:08 - you need it so let's let's adjust it so
14:11 - glide one second
14:12 - to exposition of turkey
14:22 - turkey exposition
14:26 - turkey y position so glide this way so
14:29 - let's see how
14:30 - where it'll go right here no one wears
14:34 - hats on their bodies
14:35 - only on the head so let's adjust it a
14:38 - little bit
14:39 - so let's adjust it
14:43 - so since i already taught you last time
14:45 - let's just get to it
14:47 - so i'm gonna put a plus
14:51 - x position plus 35
14:54 - because i already have it written down
14:58 - in a y position plus 70.
15:03 - i think that that would be right on the
15:05 - head let's see
15:10 - that's in the head great
15:14 - so if then else
15:18 - but then son if then the direction
15:24 - of turkey
15:31 - is greater than zero
15:34 - then it will do this
15:39 - else it will go one second
15:43 - so let's delete this save
15:46 - this minus this negative
15:50 - no minus x position minus 28.
15:53 - i already have that written down and
15:56 - this
15:57 - also plus 70. so i'm gonna it doesn't
16:00 - look like it's
16:01 - correct because look at this it's not
16:02 - completely on the head
16:04 - so i'm gonna see if this dude can be a
16:07 - 35
16:09 - and this to become a 30. let's see if it
16:12 - works now
16:15 - it's working and as you can see
16:18 - when you're removing you click on the
16:20 - hat i'll move where i
16:22 - am and then if i'm on the left side
16:25 - it'll also do the same thing
16:26 - and also let's keep on working so you
16:29 - need a forever as always
16:32 - you need if then else
16:38 - if then else then else the direction of
16:40 - the turkey is
16:41 - more than zero that's correct we don't
16:44 - need this
16:45 - bam bam it'll set
16:49 - x to
16:52 - x position of turkey plus 30.
16:57 - and the other one will set
17:01 - x position of turkey instead it's
17:04 - a set x position minus 35
17:14 - and else it will set y
17:19 - to y position of turkey
17:24 - plus 70. so that's basically all the
17:26 - code but we have still other code to do
17:28 - like the hat choice the actual should be
17:31 - pretty simple so
17:33 - let's get it ready so when
17:36 - i'm gonna drag it around here
17:40 - so when the green flag is clicked
17:44 - it will go to this position
17:47 - and then when this sprite is clicked
17:50 - the broadcast switch hat
18:01 - and then whenever we're one inch away
18:04 - from finishing
18:05 - when i receive
18:09 - switch hat it will
18:13 - obviously go to the next costume so
18:18 - right there and we just have to add the
18:21 - music
18:22 - so when the green flag is clicked
18:28 - okay it'll go forever
18:32 - and play some music so i think i used
18:36 - dance something
18:40 - i think i used um
18:44 - sitar so
18:48 - put dan satar in here and you're
18:51 - basically
18:52 - done with the game so i'm gonna show you
18:54 - how this works
18:56 - [Music]
19:11 - [Music]
19:15 - so there we go basically done but i will
19:17 - show you how to make the drop down
19:19 - so let's make the drop down okay so
19:23 - you can always use a drop down because
19:26 - it's always better for your game it
19:28 - always looks better
19:29 - so as you can see on my screen i am
19:31 - painting
19:32 - so a paint and you can just duplic
19:36 - get this jungle so the jungle ctrl c
19:41 - ctrl v and make the drop down so we're
19:43 - going to make that it's precisely
19:46 - almost there and we're going to change
19:48 - it up a little bit
19:49 - like that and this is just the drop down
19:52 - so it's different
19:53 - and it looks like it's a little bent
19:56 - over but we will do that
19:58 - uh we will change that so
20:03 - uh we're also gonna add the turkey
20:07 - so the turkey get the whole entire thing
20:13 - uh ctrl c ctrl ctrl c
20:16 - ctrl v whole entire turkeys here group
20:23 - so you can either face it left or right
20:25 - or looking at you so
20:26 - it'll flip horizontal so you can make it
20:29 - left right left
20:30 - right left right and also you can add
20:33 - like the little decorations to make it
20:35 - look better so the hat you can get any
20:38 - hat you want
20:39 - i'm use the bear hat because
20:42 - it's a bear hat so regroup that
20:47 - and put that on top and then i'll get
20:50 - the glasses
20:53 - you can take this glasses pick any
20:55 - glasses you want you can even use the
20:57 - rabbit glasses
20:59 - and then add them on
21:02 - i'm pretty sure that one's harder to
21:04 - drag
21:10 - and then we can also do the scarfy
21:14 - any scarf you want i'm going to use
21:15 - scarf a because
21:17 - it's scarf a and
21:22 - put the scarf and since he's facing on
21:23 - the left flip horizontal
21:25 - flip horizontal place it right on him
21:33 - so there we go and then the text you can
21:36 - always use text
21:38 - and make it white because why not you
21:44 - can use any
21:45 - um font you want but i'm gonna use
21:48 - curly because curly looks good
21:59 - so yeah uh so i'm gonna
22:02 - do that and make this larger
22:12 - uh so
22:16 - so just the turkey
22:20 - and then we have some code for this
22:21 - because drop downs always look better
22:23 - than the original game
22:25 - so when the green flag is clicked
22:28 - it will go to the middle no not
22:31 - basically the middle but
22:33 - the um coordinate i have
22:36 - will go up
22:40 - x0 y300
22:44 - i'll hide
22:48 - go forever
22:52 - and reset timer because we're using
22:53 - timer to use it
22:55 - reset timer and when the timer
23:02 - the timer is more than 0.1
23:06 - then it'll go to this position
23:12 - and i'll go to front later
23:17 - also show
23:21 - and glide 0.5 seconds
23:29 - seconds to x0 y0 so glide down
23:33 - so let's see so i'm gonna
23:37 - do this so as you can see everything is
23:39 - working really well
23:41 - glasses scarf so all of this is working
23:45 - pretty well
23:46 - you can move around and then when you
23:47 - click the stop dress the turkey
23:50 - awesome you can start it all over again
23:52 - and the thumbnail comes down
23:54 - because it's always better for the game
23:56 - always better
23:57 - better for the game please like share
24:00 - subscribe and comment in the comment
24:01 - section below what else content you want
24:03 - anyway see you guys

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video dress the turkey we worked on this yesterday if um yeah we worked on this yesterday i made the first part yesterday so if you haven't watched that you can watch that right now right here so and the last part we coded the turkey the scarf choice and scarf so this is the code for the turkey so feel free to pause if you uh if you um i want to pause it because you don't have all this code and that's all the code for the turkey and i think we can zoom in one more and the scarf choice this is all the code for the scarf choice this is the scarf choice and the scarf last but not least the scar so if you do not have this code if you not have this code so if you do not have this code if you do not have this code then you should code it right now because we're going to work on the second part because this is the second part so feel free to pause again so anyways before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways let's start on the glasses so um oh yeah before i start i gotta show you something so my rooster which was originally the turkey um as you could see no not you can't see right now but um the rooster it was missing a piece of the leg and the bottom so i drew another piece of leg for the bottom of the leg so because this has like this little uh talon and this doesn't have the talon so i drew the little talon for the rooster as well so so you just have to copy and paste this it's going to ungroup it first and ungroup and then you can just copy and paste this ctrl c ctrl v and then add it on here and then shift it around so yeah that's basically how you do the rooster like if you want so anyways let's get started on the glasses so uh we can delete glasses e because this is like a rabbit so we can delete glasses e and then there's glasses a b and c that we're gonna use so i'm gonna try to use that because i think we could use the rabbit one only if we took out the glasses so uh and then we can just control z this so we can control see this rabbit face no not control z delete that rabbit face and we have the glasses so we could use the glasses and improvise if you want and i just figured out a bug it says glasses e it's supposed to be d because there's four costumes a b c d and it says e so that makes no sense but whatever um let's get on to the code so a b c e not d so let's get started so when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to glasses b so glasses b is the one that's like this so i wanted to start out with this because i just want to and it'll go to a position i have written down negative 165 positive y88 and it'll go to front layer because it's always in the front because if it's in the back layer it won't be on the turkey's face it'll be on the turkey's back so go to black in front later and then when this sprite is clicked so i'm going to code something and show you this so it will glide one second to x y so i'm gonna show you this so when the one glide one second to so you need the tricky block backdrop of stage duplicate this so i'm going to show you how to use this these types of things so x plus you could change the back um turkey exposition of the turkey and y position of the turkey so this is how you use it so i'm gonna start and as you can see if i click on the glasses it won't be on its eyes and you want the glasses to be on the eyes because no one wears glasses on the tail so we need to be up here so we need to add some things like uh add plus 30 like what we did for the scarf to move it to the so originally it was it would glide over here we need to move it to the left and up so x position minus 35 because if this is the negative side this is the positive side and you want it to move left so i'm gonna do that right now x position minus let's say around 35 because why not and the y position it's plus 45 because you want it to go up a little bit so i'm gonna try plus 45 and see if it works so plus 45 so let's see if this will work definitely i was really lucky for those coordinates so not scripted okay so let's just continue so so you can adjust it if it's not right but that was definitely scripted because i have done this project before so when if then else you know if then else so we're actually going to be coding this so we got to put this in the else because it's on the left so if the direction of turkey of turkey is more than zero which is that includes one two three four five uh et cetera oh not negative so it's up here right side so and i'll glide one second so we can just duplicate this and just change a little bit so glide one second to x position of turkey plus 35 because it's positive so you need a plus let's take third i meant three okay this is scripted so um and then y position plus 45 that's correct and also let's try bam right on the eyes but we haven't done the moving code for it yet so so we're so we're gonna move the chicken to the i mean the rooster to the turkey to the uh right side and the left side so that's where it is so anyways we're gonna coat it to follow the turkey as you can see right there right on the spot and if i moved it like here right on the spot right on the spot so we're going to keep on coating so it will follow the turkey or the rooster no the turkey yeah the turkey uh yeah and it'll go forever if then else then i also duplicate this whole entire block but we're going to change it up a little bit it's an outstanding direction of turkey is less is more than zero that's correct and this forever we do not need and we do not need this or this so we delete all that you know set x to uh x position plus 30. so we can just duplicate that put that in there and then we can duplicate this but then make it nega minus 35 so we can put that right in here wait we don't have that yet so set x to exposition of turkey minus 35 and then we also need this for the end and then also set y instead of x from the bottom not inside to y position a turkey plus 45 so let's try out this project so i have the turkey moving frequently right here all the little movements and if you do not move him he looks at you and bam they're going him he's following him great and then the scarf bam following him change the scarf up yeah and then we're gonna work on the glasses change so the glasses change is quite different from the scarf change so when the when this sprite when the green flag is clicked it will go to a certain position so i'm gonna drag this over here let's say around here let's put it over here then we're going to move the hat up and then we're going to work on that later so the glass is choice and the green flag is clicked it will go to this position and then when the sprite is clicked guess what will happen it will broadcast switch glasses because we did that for the scarf so broadcast switch glasses glasses choice i think we had that for this card uh switch glasses i we have scarf choice we can rename this yeah i'll be r i'll rename that so i'm going to finish the glasses right here so um i'm going to finish the glasses oh so for this part you need a when i receive glasses switch glasses which is basically glasses choice it'll go to the next costume so glasses choice glasses choice glasses choice bunny so that's basically what it is i know that glasses d which basically glasses e is not in the exact position so you gotta copy this paste that and we're gonna adjust it so um we're gonna group all this together because i already grouped and then we're gonna do this and adjust it adjust it a little bit so i'm gonna try adjusting this these glasses i noticed that the glasses weren't completely in the spot we'll see i noticed that the glasses weren't completely over there so we can center it so right in the center oopsies so you put your finger on the screen and then we're gonna move glasses e up so i think i have to group classes e now or b and then move it up a little bit right in the middle directly so i think that's great i think that's good i think we're done with the glasses so that's basically it and then we're gonna work on the hat now or we can just change this to scarf choice or we can we can change that instead of writing a scarf choice we can do switch scarf so because i did scarf choice instead of the other one so switch scarf yeah i don't think you can delete broadcasts but it'll go away later because it's not used so we're gonna use the hat so we're gonna do the hat so the hat so um we're gonna work on the hat now so the hat so when the green flag is clicked it'll switch costume to hat b and it'll go to i have a coordinate already written go to negative 63 positive 145 y you can make it go to a different spot if you want it'll go to the front layer so it'll be in front of everything but it'll go backward one layer so it'll be behind the glasses because i'm pretty sure hats are behind glasses when you wear them because you don't want your glasses to be everywhere and also when the sprite is clicked you need it so let's let's adjust it so glide one second to exposition of turkey turkey exposition turkey y position so glide this way so let's see how where it'll go right here no one wears hats on their bodies only on the head so let's adjust it a little bit so let's adjust it so since i already taught you last time let's just get to it so i'm gonna put a plus x position plus 35 because i already have it written down in a y position plus 70. i think that that would be right on the head let's see that's in the head great so if then else but then son if then the direction of turkey is greater than zero then it will do this else it will go one second so let's delete this save this minus this negative no minus x position minus 28. i already have that written down and this also plus 70. so i'm gonna it doesn't look like it's correct because look at this it's not completely on the head so i'm gonna see if this dude can be a 35 and this to become a 30. let's see if it works now it's working and as you can see when you're removing you click on the hat i'll move where i am and then if i'm on the left side it'll also do the same thing and also let's keep on working so you need a forever as always you need if then else if then else then else the direction of the turkey is more than zero that's correct we don't need this bam bam it'll set x to x position of turkey plus 30. and the other one will set x position of turkey instead it's a set x position minus 35 and else it will set y to y position of turkey plus 70. so that's basically all the code but we have still other code to do like the hat choice the actual should be pretty simple so let's get it ready so when i'm gonna drag it around here so when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position and then when this sprite is clicked the broadcast switch hat and then whenever we're one inch away from finishing when i receive switch hat it will obviously go to the next costume so right there and we just have to add the music so when the green flag is clicked okay it'll go forever and play some music so i think i used dance something i think i used um sitar so put dan satar in here and you're basically done with the game so i'm gonna show you how this works so there we go basically done but i will show you how to make the drop down so let's make the drop down okay so you can always use a drop down because it's always better for your game it always looks better so as you can see on my screen i am painting so a paint and you can just duplic get this jungle so the jungle ctrl c ctrl v and make the drop down so we're going to make that it's precisely almost there and we're going to change it up a little bit like that and this is just the drop down so it's different and it looks like it's a little bent over but we will do that uh we will change that so uh we're also gonna add the turkey so the turkey get the whole entire thing uh ctrl c ctrl ctrl c ctrl v whole entire turkeys here group so you can either face it left or right or looking at you so it'll flip horizontal so you can make it left right left right left right and also you can add like the little decorations to make it look better so the hat you can get any hat you want i'm use the bear hat because it's a bear hat so regroup that and put that on top and then i'll get the glasses you can take this glasses pick any glasses you want you can even use the rabbit glasses and then add them on i'm pretty sure that one's harder to drag and then we can also do the scarfy any scarf you want i'm going to use scarf a because it's scarf a and put the scarf and since he's facing on the left flip horizontal flip horizontal place it right on him so there we go and then the text you can always use text and make it white because why not you can use any um font you want but i'm gonna use curly because curly looks good so yeah uh so i'm gonna do that and make this larger uh so so just the turkey and then we have some code for this because drop downs always look better than the original game so when the green flag is clicked it will go to the middle no not basically the middle but the um coordinate i have will go up x0 y300 i'll hide go forever and reset timer because we're using timer to use it reset timer and when the timer the timer is more than 0.1 then it'll go to this position and i'll go to front later also show and glide 0.5 seconds seconds to x0 y0 so glide down so let's see so i'm gonna do this so as you can see everything is working really well glasses scarf so all of this is working pretty well you can move around and then when you click the stop dress the turkey awesome you can start it all over again and the thumbnail comes down because it's always better for the game always better better for the game please like share
