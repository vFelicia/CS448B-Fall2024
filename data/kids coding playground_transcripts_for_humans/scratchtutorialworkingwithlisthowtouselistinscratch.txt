00:01 - [Music]
00:08 - hello and welcome back to kids coding
00:11 - playground Channel today we'll be
00:13 - looking with a new project
00:16 - learning to use this in scratch so I
00:20 - know that there are many kids struggling
00:23 - with this and how this works in scratch
00:26 - so hopefully after seeing this video you
00:29 - be you'll be more familiar with it and
00:31 - you're able to understand what Allah
00:33 - says in scratch ok so here's what we
00:36 - have we have a list of name in here and
00:39 - and if you click on this sprite here
00:42 - Giga she will tell you what is the
00:45 - shortest and what is the longest name in
00:47 - the list and there's ass button we we
00:52 - added here if you click on this it will
00:53 - tell you if that name you can type of
00:55 - name and it will tell you that name is
00:57 - in the list Allah so unless you go over
01:00 - some other function with lists so what
01:03 - we can do with this is you can add
01:05 - something to a Miss you can delete
01:08 - something in the list you can insert
01:11 - something into a list somewhere between
01:15 - two two elements you can replace
01:19 - something in Alice and this one is the
01:23 - item number on the list just how you are
01:26 - what the item number is but on this and
01:30 - then this one is checks if the object is
01:32 - in the list basically if that whatever
01:34 - the name is that in the listener and
01:37 - this one tells you how how many items
01:40 - are hidden this and this one is check if
01:44 - it contains the item in this
01:47 - this one actually tells you the number
01:49 - of the object in the list so basically
01:52 - let's say go back to this first page so
01:55 - message gems gems will give you this
01:57 - number five the index of five so let's
02:01 - jump into the game let me just demo it a
02:05 - little bit okay so this is the waffle
02:10 - witness
02:12 - we have these names here if you click on
02:15 - this ear she'll tell you like the
02:18 - longest name is Isabelle and showing
02:20 - them is Kega and now you can click on
02:24 - this that asks ok find that item in the
02:26 - list so you can say
02:28 - let's say jeans I type in James here
02:33 - push enter it'll tell you ok Jim is in
02:36 - the list so let's say if I type in
02:38 - something else like
02:41 - either
02:43 - so it will say Hiba is not in the list
02:46 - so you guys non-delivery that's how how
02:49 - how some of the function within there so
02:51 - we'll go through some of the function
02:54 - that we could call with listen how we
02:55 - work with it okay so let's get stopped
02:59 - with a new project
03:01 - ok before I start up please like share
03:04 - and subscribe to our Channel and give us
03:07 - some feedback and comment below our
03:09 - video go pretty appreciate that ok
03:13 - alright
03:14 - what we need to do is we are going to
03:17 - select a background you can use any
03:20 - background you like we were just using
03:22 - the classroom background
03:25 - right and then you can use the sprite
03:30 - you like
03:32 - for me I already had the sprite Giga so
03:36 - I'll blow her
03:39 - okay let me upload that sprite
03:43 - ok
03:47 - ok I have to go here let me delete the
03:51 - cap
03:53 - and then the tree
03:58 - and then we have blown
04:01 - the other sprite I had
04:12 - okay back you hit the wrong button
04:15 - and my past sprite
04:20 - okay so I have all the spray I need I'll
04:23 - move the tree stump here or over here
04:28 - okay alright
04:31 - so what I did was for her please he just
04:36 - used the sprite that you have and I just
04:40 - added this hat to her so I just created
04:45 - it downloaded a hat and then just erased
04:47 - the back yeah background and then just
04:49 - put a hat on her and then this thing is
04:52 - another like here a
04:55 - diploma or something you just put it on
04:58 - her hand so you can get that if you like
05:00 - you know from online you can erase the
05:03 - background head
05:05 - so that's what we have for her okay the
05:08 - tree stump same thing it's got the form
05:10 - online and I just use arrange the
05:13 - background and then this ask is pretty
05:16 - easy just draw the background and then
05:18 - put the text text box you want just type
05:22 - on a text one okay so make you're making
05:26 - it faster so I imported some of the
05:28 - assets I have okay so we have these
05:33 - sprites with me look in the background
05:36 - can also add like
05:40 - walking with lists or something like
05:42 - that if you like
05:43 - you can just put the text here
05:48 - so you say
05:56 - so one less oh you can have a different
06:00 - font if you want
06:02 - right but this something like this
06:07 - put it in the backboard that chalkboard
06:11 - okay
06:13 - okay we have we have that so far
06:16 - okay
06:18 - what we need to do is we'll go back to
06:21 - the code now what did it create some
06:23 - variable
06:25 - in the variable we'll make some variable
06:28 - so first one will make the kernel name
06:35 - we'll make another variable longest
06:39 - name
06:41 - so to find the longest name in the
06:43 - shortest night night so we need that so
06:46 - this one is the
06:49 - shortest name
06:52 - so we have longest name shortest name
06:55 - and current name so using the current
06:57 - name we can go through the loop after
06:59 - this and then we can find out what the
07:01 - what the name what is the shorter said
07:04 - what is the longest and what is the
07:07 - comparing to the current name right so
07:09 - let me just put all three on top here so
07:11 - you see to see in a bit
07:14 - okay
07:18 - so wouldn't we'll need another miss
07:21 - variable so I make the list variable
07:24 - call nameless or something
07:27 - okay in my nameless so you see the
07:31 - currently the nameless is empty you can
07:33 - put some name in there let's say you can
07:36 - say click on this Add button
07:38 - okay one and let's say you put Emma
07:41 - right and you hit enter okay the next
07:45 - one
07:47 - all right
07:50 - and James
07:55 - okay
07:57 - okay so so far we have these names on
08:01 - the list and you can make it a little
08:04 - bit bigger by dragging this here
08:07 - okay so so far we have six over one more
08:13 - okay wave Oliver so these are the name
08:16 - end of this so far
08:20 - I'll go to some of the thing that we
08:23 - could do with this okay first Wow we on
08:27 - this right we wanna make her go to the
08:29 - front just in case she go to the back
08:31 - you know was her standing in front of
08:34 - the chalkboard and then the the tree
08:37 - spring so we can say go to the front
08:41 - layer
08:42 - okay and then let's look at some of the
08:46 - this we can do with operation with this
08:50 - so you go back to variable you have
08:54 - something say delete all right if I
08:56 - click on this it will actually delete
08:57 - all the names in the list I should have
09:01 - done that before I did all this but uh
09:02 - let's try anyway so let's say I click on
09:06 - this right you see them this here or
09:08 - delete all so you see that this is now
09:12 - empty and you can do something with this
09:16 - also insert list this is insert and
09:19 - there's hat right let's try that so
09:22 - let's say I want to say I add something
09:24 - I said had
09:26 - Emma
09:30 - so if I if I click on this you add a
09:33 - Matilda's you can see that it added Emma
09:35 - let's say I had another one James
09:42 - and then I click on this so you can use
09:45 - a program right you have the stock like
09:48 - when stock it's correct you can put all
09:49 - your name and then every time it run
09:51 - they'll add it in so you can also do
09:54 - something called insert let's say I want
09:56 - to insert in position two under this so
09:59 - what happened is they can't push James
10:01 - down and put this whatever name I put in
10:04 - here will go there as I put here
10:07 - so and then I hit enter I click on this
10:10 - so you can see digger goes through the
10:12 - number two position or move James down
10:14 - right so this is how you do something
10:17 - called insert
10:19 - so we come to that so there's something
10:21 - called a leap so what delete does is
10:25 - number you want delete from the list you
10:27 - can click on this so let's say I want to
10:30 - delete number three right well I said
10:33 - put number four what happened never done
10:34 - before right what do you didn't happen
10:37 - nothing right nothing happened because
10:39 - we don't have number four but if I put
10:41 - number three I click on it it'll remove
10:44 - James since James is number three so as
10:48 - you can see you can do something like
10:51 - this right there's something called
10:52 - replace also I can say replace number
10:56 - two right
10:58 - with
10:59 - Oliver so what happened is it will
11:03 - replay Kega this name here here with
11:05 - hover so if I click on this once you can
11:08 - see that every place it with Oliver so
11:10 - these are the different function that
11:13 - you could call witless so delete all
11:16 - would clear everything out and basically
11:18 - have it where but the bottom is so if I
11:21 - say at James again it will go to the
11:23 - bottom so it will always go to the
11:25 - bottom of the list insert we can insert
11:28 - in any position into this you giving the
11:30 - number so what do you think that
11:33 - happened when you say insert can go to
11:35 - six
11:37 - so if you do this it will not insert
11:40 - anywhere so it doesn't go anywhere since
11:43 - six is not a valid on the list
11:46 - but if you say app then you add to the
11:49 - bottom
11:50 - so we can say I have to four
11:56 - so we'll go to the fourth position
11:58 - okay so we have we have understanding
12:03 - that these some of this function here
12:06 - okay and then there's something called
12:10 - um this thing here the item item in the
12:15 - list so if I say one of the less what
12:19 - happened is it will bring up Emma
12:21 - because that's number one if I could and
12:25 - one you see that am i right I pray for
12:27 - it
12:29 - will say here
12:31 - by foot five
12:34 - it won't have anything because we don't
12:36 - have five right
12:38 - so we have gone through most of these
12:40 - here right and then there's here also
12:43 - this is things the nameless so whatever
12:47 - you want to check let's say I want to
12:49 - check if
12:51 - you guys into this let's put on this
12:54 - I'll say zero it was there's no no no
12:58 - position for for diva do I say yeah
13:01 - James
13:04 - it will tell me that is in position
13:06 - three position three that is so this one
13:09 - gives you the number the position of the
13:12 - object the element in the list okay and
13:17 - then what is that length of the list so
13:21 - this one will tell you
13:23 - oops
13:24 - this one will tell you how many items in
13:27 - there or how many elements so if you
13:29 - click on this it'll tell you C is 4 so
13:32 - if I ask something else to it
13:35 - let's talk
13:39 - well I had time to so you see tom is 5
13:42 - if I click on this again now it tells me
13:45 - okay have five correct and you can also
13:48 - click on this and delete give you one
13:51 - put on this to delete it okay
13:54 - okay so we have
13:57 - gone through some of these function and
14:00 - then
14:02 - last one here this one contained that
14:05 - means it will check if something belongs
14:08 - to the list so let's put however
14:12 - if I say contain was return true because
14:16 - Oliver is in the Miss rate if I say
14:20 - let's say some other name like mine
14:27 - right
14:29 - so it says false because Mike it's not
14:31 - into this right okay I hope you
14:35 - understand these this function we have
14:38 - gone through all of them so let's do our
14:41 - game now
14:44 - with all these things
14:48 - okay
14:50 - all right
14:52 - so we'll go throughout him see how we
14:55 - can create him to find the longest and
14:58 - the shortest name the endless
15:02 - okay
15:04 - alright
15:06 - so what we need to do is when this
15:09 - sprite is clicked so we want to do
15:12 - something so we'll click on Kega she'll
15:14 - tell us what is the longest and shortest
15:16 - name and we'll leave one more variable
15:20 - we did the position index so call index
15:24 - or keep track of
15:27 - where we are in unless doing using a
15:30 - loop
15:31 - or later so you remember scratch indexes
15:35 - always starts at one as you can see one
15:37 - two three four if someone so what we
15:40 - need to do is in the beginning you can
15:42 - say
15:43 - so we'll reset the index at one
15:46 - we can set the current name to plain
15:50 - just delete this
15:53 - and we can do this again and duplicate
15:59 - again we will select the longest name
16:02 - and the shortest name so we just
16:06 - initialize everything basically making
16:09 - it to default or what reset again every
16:15 - time you click on this uh Giga sprite
16:18 - okay so what we need this we will need a
16:21 - loop
16:22 - or still repeat until
16:27 - you remember we were playing with the
16:30 - length of the list I won't go through
16:32 - all the item in the list and find each
16:35 - name and compare right so all we needed
16:37 - there was we need to use this operator
16:41 - will say the index
16:47 - let me decide the index now
16:50 - okay maybe not we'll show you guys since
16:53 - index is one obviously so this is the
16:57 - okay we'll say that linked up in this
17:02 - so basically we'll repeat until the
17:06 - index is greater than the length of the
17:08 - list so let's say if I put this
17:11 - something here say hello
17:13 - and then I'm gonna say I they get one of
17:17 - the name so let's say
17:19 - here say set
17:22 - current name so to get their item where
17:26 - to say item right here
17:29 - so item of the list so can I use one
17:32 - because one is will always get em all
17:35 - right so what we need to do it we're
17:36 - gonna use index
17:39 - so right now index is one so we will
17:43 - pick the first one which is Emma and
17:45 - then what we can do it we can change the
17:48 - index
17:51 - change index by one that will go to two
17:54 - and then we'll go get Oliver so if I say
17:58 - I put this and in here and what I do is
18:00 - I'm going to put current name if I do
18:04 - this what happen you'll see that Kia
18:07 - will repeat em our James and Geeta go by
18:11 - clicking her let's just try and then you
18:13 - can see this index go up one two three
18:17 - four so like the corner you can see Emma
18:20 - Oliver James and
18:23 - Giga so as you can see every time it
18:26 - goes it increase the index by one until
18:29 - it gets to five so five is greater than
18:32 - four right that's only for item so five
18:36 - is greater than four or stop so you see
18:39 - again Oliver James and Tia and then this
18:43 - stuff so it go through all the name in
18:46 - the list so now we know how to go
18:48 - through all the name in the list and we
18:50 - know how to get the chronium littlest
18:52 - what happened now is we have to save the
18:55 - name and compare them
18:58 - so what we can do is we can use the if
19:01 - statement control here
19:07 - so if
19:15 - okay um we're gonna use the operator
19:19 - here to compare okay we're gonna have to
19:22 - compare them linked what we're going to
19:25 - do is
19:27 - we're gonna use something called length
19:29 - you remember we use that on the previous
19:32 - lesson before with the variable and
19:34 - loops and index what you can do is you
19:38 - can put this current name
19:42 - so let's say your current name is Giga
19:44 - if you click on this it'll reach one for
19:46 - a which is the length of the word name
19:50 - so you say if the link of the name is
19:54 - greater than
19:56 - is the operator again
19:59 - the length of the name of
20:03 - the longest him so basically if the
20:07 - current name is longer than the longest
20:09 - name what do you wanna do we wanna set I
20:15 - wanna set the longest name equals to the
20:19 - current name so basically if the
20:22 - whatever name that picks up if it's
20:24 - longer than the name
20:26 - that is in the longest name it will set
20:29 - that him so the first time what it does
20:31 - it will set Emma right because the
20:33 - longest name is zero we can we don't
20:35 - have anything right and then after that
20:38 - longest name well Emma and then I'll go
20:40 - on and check with Oliver and then check
20:42 - with James and then check with TIA so if
20:45 - I run through the Coe again just pay
20:48 - attention to the longest name you can
20:50 - see that it will change initially will
20:52 - be Emma and they will compare down and
20:54 - maybe one can add one more say value
20:56 - right
20:58 - and then we'll have one more say
21:06 - John
21:08 - okay
21:10 - so what happened you'll see that will
21:12 - you'll know stop at William SL for
21:14 - longest name the current name next so
21:16 - we'll have John but it will not set so
21:18 - let's just run through one time and pay
21:21 - attention to the longest name so you can
21:23 - see oh it's already so quick because I
21:26 - didn't have any uh any way to write any
21:29 - say for two second or whatever so it go
21:32 - through world quick as you can see it go
21:34 - through and they already found out that
21:36 - will miss the longest name if you want
21:38 - to have some break in between right just
21:41 - like before we can but I just say you're
21:43 - right say
21:45 - the current name right and then we can
21:48 - kind of slow down the loop and you can
21:50 - kind of see and that's still for one
21:53 - second
21:54 - so if I do this
21:56 - I'll write me again I'll click on her
21:59 - should say mo you can see him all over
22:01 - okay come here and comparing kamandalu
22:04 - young so you can see that it said well
22:06 - you miss the longest name so let's look
22:09 - at it again let's run again so you see
22:12 - Emma
22:13 - Oliver Oliver is longer than Nemo right
22:15 - and then Williams longer than our it
22:18 - says William right so that's how how it
22:20 - works so we have so far we've found the
22:23 - longest name in the list right so let's
22:26 - remove this again sorry I was just
22:30 - demonstrating that piece so now we'll
22:33 - put this back in so now let us set the
22:36 - shortest name so similarly we need some
22:39 - operator right in control as well
22:42 - so this time we have to check
22:46 - we'll use the equal
22:49 - and we'll have to use another one called
22:52 - order
22:55 - so what we want to do is the
22:58 - we're gonna check the link
23:04 - ok the length of the shortest name
23:10 - it's equal to zero basically in the
23:13 - beginning so what we want to do is
23:15 - actually in the beginning we need to set
23:17 - both the longer then and the shoulders
23:19 - name to the current name so this will
23:22 - ensure that the shortest name will
23:24 - always get set so in the beginning
23:26 - assess okay there's nothing in the
23:28 - shortest name if that link is 0-1 set it
23:30 - or
23:32 - we need t another operator here
23:37 - or the link to pay this the length of
23:43 - their
23:44 - current name
23:49 - okay so current name here
23:54 - so basically or check if the length of
23:58 - the current name whatever name we had is
24:01 - shorter than the shortest name then we
24:03 - have to also set it right or if it's in
24:06 - the beginning we also set it so those
24:08 - are the two condition so they said
24:13 - the shortest name
24:16 - equals to the current name so what
24:20 - happened it'll go through the first
24:22 - Hamlet it doesn't have anything for sure
24:24 - shortest name it was said that whatever
24:26 - the current name has and next time
24:28 - onward it will check if the current name
24:30 - is actually shorter than the shortest
24:31 - name give me this then I'll set the
24:33 - curtain into the shortest name
24:35 - okay so if I run this again you can see
24:39 - just pay attention to the shortest name
24:41 - here go try to find the shortest name so
24:44 - first or set Emma as the longest name
24:47 - Emma the longest name and the shortest
24:49 - name and then they'll start from pairing
24:51 - so if you I have to put the weight here
24:55 - right because
24:56 - well let me put this here and
25:04 - then I'll put this current name so just
25:07 - kind of go through and you can see okay
25:10 - let me click on her again let's go so
25:14 - you see Emma is the first one who set
25:16 - both Emma shortest name and the longest
25:19 - name and then start comparing so Kega is
25:21 - shorter now
25:25 - okay so we'll make it one second we'll
25:28 - try again
25:30 - what happened is um here I will see that
25:34 - Emma has four letter
25:36 - John or the whole letter so what it
25:39 - happened is when Kiki also I told her
25:42 - who happened and so we'll pick the first
25:43 - one once that
25:45 - first one is satisfied it will not pick
25:47 - it since it's not less than that right
25:49 - so if we if we add something else in
25:53 - there like I said we had Ava or
25:55 - something like that then we'll put pick
25:57 - Ava so right now we run this again so
26:00 - you see Emma is the shortest name so
26:03 - even though Kega is also for will not
26:05 - pick that because Emma already these
26:07 - been set as a shortest name what we can
26:10 - do is let's say we had a new name to it
26:15 - like anger or something
26:17 - right so if we do that then it will
26:21 - definitely will pick up Eva is the
26:23 - shortest name because that's three
26:24 - character ID so let's run it again so
26:26 - you can see Emma it's the shortest name
26:29 - right now it's not changing anything
26:30 - right John now Ava so paid us the
26:34 - shortest name so you can see Williams
26:36 - longest then he was the shortest name
26:38 - and if we add more it doesn't matter we
26:42 - had more
26:44 - Sofie right
26:47 - it will not I will not pick that because
26:50 - they've already been set right so let's
26:52 - render again just try understand change
26:55 - go through the name and then once if I
26:59 - never I've said that as a shortest name
27:01 - and then that's it so pretty much that's
27:04 - it and then you can just say right
27:08 - go back to you for look you can say say
27:14 - you can use the joint statement here
27:20 - you can say
27:25 - longest
27:27 - name is
27:30 - and then we just put the variable
27:34 - longest name
27:36 - and we'll duplicate that
27:41 - and
27:44 - shortest name
27:46 - or use the
27:49 - shortest name here so we can hide this
27:52 - variable now
27:54 - and if we run it again Oh
27:58 - see come on oh we still have this loop
28:01 - here so we need to remove that right so
28:06 - what we can do is take this out for a
28:08 - minute
28:10 - remove that put this back in so let me
28:15 - zoom back out you can see the whole Co
28:17 - weekend so now click on her you'll see
28:23 - the longest name is William short its
28:25 - name is ava so it finds the longest and
28:28 - shortest name in the list and we can do
28:31 - one more thing right with the testing
28:33 - this last
28:34 - what we can do is same thing
28:39 - when the sprite is clicked
28:42 - we can use call another this function
28:47 - here let's go back to a variable well we
28:49 - can ask first
28:52 - we'll say fine
28:55 - item in this
28:59 - and then we have to use the if an else
29:04 - statement here and then we can use this
29:09 - contain
29:11 - right so the name is contain the answer
29:15 - whatever the user typed in
29:18 - if it contained and we can say
29:21 - join
29:23 - was safer's
29:27 - and we are going to use the join joining
29:31 - two things together
29:32 - one who can say
29:35 - answer
29:38 - okay answer
29:40 - space open space is into this
29:45 - okay and okay this and we can say answer
29:50 - whatever user Titan is not into this
29:56 - okay
29:57 - so let's stop this will suck again will
30:02 - click on this and I'll say fine item you
30:04 - know this and let's say we said John
30:08 - says John is into this right
30:15 - okay and then let's say we put in liam
30:19 - or something
30:22 - sadly and it's not under this and liam
30:24 - is not under this right okay so that's
30:27 - pretty much it for the for the walking
30:30 - witless I hope you guys understand this
30:32 - and release like share and subscribe to
30:35 - our channel see you guys next time thank
30:37 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to kids coding playground Channel today we'll be looking with a new project learning to use this in scratch so I know that there are many kids struggling with this and how this works in scratch so hopefully after seeing this video you be you'll be more familiar with it and you're able to understand what Allah says in scratch ok so here's what we have we have a list of name in here and and if you click on this sprite here Giga she will tell you what is the shortest and what is the longest name in the list and there's ass button we we added here if you click on this it will tell you if that name you can type of name and it will tell you that name is in the list Allah so unless you go over some other function with lists so what we can do with this is you can add something to a Miss you can delete something in the list you can insert something into a list somewhere between two two elements you can replace something in Alice and this one is the item number on the list just how you are what the item number is but on this and then this one is checks if the object is in the list basically if that whatever the name is that in the listener and this one tells you how how many items are hidden this and this one is check if it contains the item in this this one actually tells you the number of the object in the list so basically let's say go back to this first page so message gems gems will give you this number five the index of five so let's jump into the game let me just demo it a little bit okay so this is the waffle witness we have these names here if you click on this ear she'll tell you like the longest name is Isabelle and showing them is Kega and now you can click on this that asks ok find that item in the list so you can say let's say jeans I type in James here push enter it'll tell you ok Jim is in the list so let's say if I type in something else like either so it will say Hiba is not in the list so you guys nondelivery that's how how how some of the function within there so we'll go through some of the function that we could call with listen how we work with it okay so let's get stopped with a new project ok before I start up please like share and subscribe to our Channel and give us some feedback and comment below our video go pretty appreciate that ok alright what we need to do is we are going to select a background you can use any background you like we were just using the classroom background right and then you can use the sprite you like for me I already had the sprite Giga so I'll blow her okay let me upload that sprite ok ok I have to go here let me delete the cap and then the tree and then we have blown the other sprite I had okay back you hit the wrong button and my past sprite okay so I have all the spray I need I'll move the tree stump here or over here okay alright so what I did was for her please he just used the sprite that you have and I just added this hat to her so I just created it downloaded a hat and then just erased the back yeah background and then just put a hat on her and then this thing is another like here a diploma or something you just put it on her hand so you can get that if you like you know from online you can erase the background head so that's what we have for her okay the tree stump same thing it's got the form online and I just use arrange the background and then this ask is pretty easy just draw the background and then put the text text box you want just type on a text one okay so make you're making it faster so I imported some of the assets I have okay so we have these sprites with me look in the background can also add like walking with lists or something like that if you like you can just put the text here so you say so one less oh you can have a different font if you want right but this something like this put it in the backboard that chalkboard okay okay we have we have that so far okay what we need to do is we'll go back to the code now what did it create some variable in the variable we'll make some variable so first one will make the kernel name we'll make another variable longest name so to find the longest name in the shortest night night so we need that so this one is the shortest name so we have longest name shortest name and current name so using the current name we can go through the loop after this and then we can find out what the what the name what is the shorter said what is the longest and what is the comparing to the current name right so let me just put all three on top here so you see to see in a bit okay so wouldn't we'll need another miss variable so I make the list variable call nameless or something okay in my nameless so you see the currently the nameless is empty you can put some name in there let's say you can say click on this Add button okay one and let's say you put Emma right and you hit enter okay the next one all right and James okay okay so so far we have these names on the list and you can make it a little bit bigger by dragging this here okay so so far we have six over one more okay wave Oliver so these are the name end of this so far I'll go to some of the thing that we could do with this okay first Wow we on this right we wanna make her go to the front just in case she go to the back you know was her standing in front of the chalkboard and then the the tree spring so we can say go to the front layer okay and then let's look at some of the this we can do with operation with this so you go back to variable you have something say delete all right if I click on this it will actually delete all the names in the list I should have done that before I did all this but uh let's try anyway so let's say I click on this right you see them this here or delete all so you see that this is now empty and you can do something with this also insert list this is insert and there's hat right let's try that so let's say I want to say I add something I said had Emma so if I if I click on this you add a Matilda's you can see that it added Emma let's say I had another one James and then I click on this so you can use a program right you have the stock like when stock it's correct you can put all your name and then every time it run they'll add it in so you can also do something called insert let's say I want to insert in position two under this so what happened is they can't push James down and put this whatever name I put in here will go there as I put here so and then I hit enter I click on this so you can see digger goes through the number two position or move James down right so this is how you do something called insert so we come to that so there's something called a leap so what delete does is number you want delete from the list you can click on this so let's say I want to delete number three right well I said put number four what happened never done before right what do you didn't happen nothing right nothing happened because we don't have number four but if I put number three I click on it it'll remove James since James is number three so as you can see you can do something like this right there's something called replace also I can say replace number two right with Oliver so what happened is it will replay Kega this name here here with hover so if I click on this once you can see that every place it with Oliver so these are the different function that you could call witless so delete all would clear everything out and basically have it where but the bottom is so if I say at James again it will go to the bottom so it will always go to the bottom of the list insert we can insert in any position into this you giving the number so what do you think that happened when you say insert can go to six so if you do this it will not insert anywhere so it doesn't go anywhere since six is not a valid on the list but if you say app then you add to the bottom so we can say I have to four so we'll go to the fourth position okay so we have we have understanding that these some of this function here okay and then there's something called um this thing here the item item in the list so if I say one of the less what happened is it will bring up Emma because that's number one if I could and one you see that am i right I pray for it will say here by foot five it won't have anything because we don't have five right so we have gone through most of these here right and then there's here also this is things the nameless so whatever you want to check let's say I want to check if you guys into this let's put on this I'll say zero it was there's no no no position for for diva do I say yeah James it will tell me that is in position three position three that is so this one gives you the number the position of the object the element in the list okay and then what is that length of the list so this one will tell you oops this one will tell you how many items in there or how many elements so if you click on this it'll tell you C is 4 so if I ask something else to it let's talk well I had time to so you see tom is 5 if I click on this again now it tells me okay have five correct and you can also click on this and delete give you one put on this to delete it okay okay so we have gone through some of these function and then last one here this one contained that means it will check if something belongs to the list so let's put however if I say contain was return true because Oliver is in the Miss rate if I say let's say some other name like mine right so it says false because Mike it's not into this right okay I hope you understand these this function we have gone through all of them so let's do our game now with all these things okay all right so we'll go throughout him see how we can create him to find the longest and the shortest name the endless okay alright so what we need to do is when this sprite is clicked so we want to do something so we'll click on Kega she'll tell us what is the longest and shortest name and we'll leave one more variable we did the position index so call index or keep track of where we are in unless doing using a loop or later so you remember scratch indexes always starts at one as you can see one two three four if someone so what we need to do is in the beginning you can say so we'll reset the index at one we can set the current name to plain just delete this and we can do this again and duplicate again we will select the longest name and the shortest name so we just initialize everything basically making it to default or what reset again every time you click on this uh Giga sprite okay so what we need this we will need a loop or still repeat until you remember we were playing with the length of the list I won't go through all the item in the list and find each name and compare right so all we needed there was we need to use this operator will say the index let me decide the index now okay maybe not we'll show you guys since index is one obviously so this is the okay we'll say that linked up in this so basically we'll repeat until the index is greater than the length of the list so let's say if I put this something here say hello and then I'm gonna say I they get one of the name so let's say here say set current name so to get their item where to say item right here so item of the list so can I use one because one is will always get em all right so what we need to do it we're gonna use index so right now index is one so we will pick the first one which is Emma and then what we can do it we can change the index change index by one that will go to two and then we'll go get Oliver so if I say I put this and in here and what I do is I'm going to put current name if I do this what happen you'll see that Kia will repeat em our James and Geeta go by clicking her let's just try and then you can see this index go up one two three four so like the corner you can see Emma Oliver James and Giga so as you can see every time it goes it increase the index by one until it gets to five so five is greater than four right that's only for item so five is greater than four or stop so you see again Oliver James and Tia and then this stuff so it go through all the name in the list so now we know how to go through all the name in the list and we know how to get the chronium littlest what happened now is we have to save the name and compare them so what we can do is we can use the if statement control here so if okay um we're gonna use the operator here to compare okay we're gonna have to compare them linked what we're going to do is we're gonna use something called length you remember we use that on the previous lesson before with the variable and loops and index what you can do is you can put this current name so let's say your current name is Giga if you click on this it'll reach one for a which is the length of the word name so you say if the link of the name is greater than is the operator again the length of the name of the longest him so basically if the current name is longer than the longest name what do you wanna do we wanna set I wanna set the longest name equals to the current name so basically if the whatever name that picks up if it's longer than the name that is in the longest name it will set that him so the first time what it does it will set Emma right because the longest name is zero we can we don't have anything right and then after that longest name well Emma and then I'll go on and check with Oliver and then check with James and then check with TIA so if I run through the Coe again just pay attention to the longest name you can see that it will change initially will be Emma and they will compare down and maybe one can add one more say value right and then we'll have one more say John okay so what happened you'll see that will you'll know stop at William SL for longest name the current name next so we'll have John but it will not set so let's just run through one time and pay attention to the longest name so you can see oh it's already so quick because I didn't have any uh any way to write any say for two second or whatever so it go through world quick as you can see it go through and they already found out that will miss the longest name if you want to have some break in between right just like before we can but I just say you're right say the current name right and then we can kind of slow down the loop and you can kind of see and that's still for one second so if I do this I'll write me again I'll click on her should say mo you can see him all over okay come here and comparing kamandalu young so you can see that it said well you miss the longest name so let's look at it again let's run again so you see Emma Oliver Oliver is longer than Nemo right and then Williams longer than our it says William right so that's how how it works so we have so far we've found the longest name in the list right so let's remove this again sorry I was just demonstrating that piece so now we'll put this back in so now let us set the shortest name so similarly we need some operator right in control as well so this time we have to check we'll use the equal and we'll have to use another one called order so what we want to do is the we're gonna check the link ok the length of the shortest name it's equal to zero basically in the beginning so what we want to do is actually in the beginning we need to set both the longer then and the shoulders name to the current name so this will ensure that the shortest name will always get set so in the beginning assess okay there's nothing in the shortest name if that link is 01 set it or we need t another operator here or the link to pay this the length of their current name okay so current name here so basically or check if the length of the current name whatever name we had is shorter than the shortest name then we have to also set it right or if it's in the beginning we also set it so those are the two condition so they said the shortest name equals to the current name so what happened it'll go through the first Hamlet it doesn't have anything for sure shortest name it was said that whatever the current name has and next time onward it will check if the current name is actually shorter than the shortest name give me this then I'll set the curtain into the shortest name okay so if I run this again you can see just pay attention to the shortest name here go try to find the shortest name so first or set Emma as the longest name Emma the longest name and the shortest name and then they'll start from pairing so if you I have to put the weight here right because well let me put this here and then I'll put this current name so just kind of go through and you can see okay let me click on her again let's go so you see Emma is the first one who set both Emma shortest name and the longest name and then start comparing so Kega is shorter now okay so we'll make it one second we'll try again what happened is um here I will see that Emma has four letter John or the whole letter so what it happened is when Kiki also I told her who happened and so we'll pick the first one once that first one is satisfied it will not pick it since it's not less than that right so if we if we add something else in there like I said we had Ava or something like that then we'll put pick Ava so right now we run this again so you see Emma is the shortest name so even though Kega is also for will not pick that because Emma already these been set as a shortest name what we can do is let's say we had a new name to it like anger or something right so if we do that then it will definitely will pick up Eva is the shortest name because that's three character ID so let's run it again so you can see Emma it's the shortest name right now it's not changing anything right John now Ava so paid us the shortest name so you can see Williams longest then he was the shortest name and if we add more it doesn't matter we had more Sofie right it will not I will not pick that because they've already been set right so let's render again just try understand change go through the name and then once if I never I've said that as a shortest name and then that's it so pretty much that's it and then you can just say right go back to you for look you can say say you can use the joint statement here you can say longest name is and then we just put the variable longest name and we'll duplicate that and shortest name or use the shortest name here so we can hide this variable now and if we run it again Oh see come on oh we still have this loop here so we need to remove that right so what we can do is take this out for a minute remove that put this back in so let me zoom back out you can see the whole Co weekend so now click on her you'll see the longest name is William short its name is ava so it finds the longest and shortest name in the list and we can do one more thing right with the testing this last what we can do is same thing when the sprite is clicked we can use call another this function here let's go back to a variable well we can ask first we'll say fine item in this and then we have to use the if an else statement here and then we can use this contain right so the name is contain the answer whatever the user typed in if it contained and we can say join was safer's and we are going to use the join joining two things together one who can say answer okay answer space open space is into this okay and okay this and we can say answer whatever user Titan is not into this okay so let's stop this will suck again will click on this and I'll say fine item you know this and let's say we said John says John is into this right okay and then let's say we put in liam or something sadly and it's not under this and liam is not under this right okay so that's pretty much it for the for the walking witless I hope you guys understand this and release like share and subscribe to our channel see you guys next time thank you
