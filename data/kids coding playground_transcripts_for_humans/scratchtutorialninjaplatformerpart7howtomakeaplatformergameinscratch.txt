00:09 - hello and welcome back to the
00:11 - kids calling playground channel today
00:14 - we'll continue working on this uh
00:16 - platform ninja game um i think we're
00:19 - almost done just a
00:20 - couple more uh things to do with the
00:23 - ninja and then changing the uh
00:26 - the uh the platform once we you know get
00:30 - the portal get into the portal
00:32 - and also you know putting the enemy in
00:34 - place i think we're
00:35 - maybe a couple more lessons okay so
00:38 - before we begin
00:38 - please uh like share and subscribe to
00:40 - our channel and uh
00:42 - tell your friend also like you know
00:44 - anyone is interested
00:45 - learning scratch and uh uh please tell
00:49 - them and then they get subscribed
00:50 - subscribe to our channel
00:52 - as well okay let's begin
00:55 - okay so what where we left off last time
00:57 - was we worked on the ninja throw
00:59 - and then the ninja attack also uh we can
01:02 - go over to co
01:03 - a little bit um just to see make sure
01:06 - that you know you're missing anything
01:07 - you can take a look
01:09 - so we're gonna move through pretty quick
01:11 - here uh just some of the code you can
01:13 - pause the video
01:14 - if needed right to just check the code
01:19 - okay and we have this on top and here
01:23 - so this is our main ninja and this one
01:26 - is our attack ninja
01:31 - this is the ninja for the throw
01:34 - uh throw in the knife
01:38 - this is the platform don't have anything
01:41 - for the sign
01:42 - the crate we have this kill water
01:45 - set uh very simple and then there's a
01:48 - hitbox one
01:50 - and this is that small knife that will
01:52 - be thrown out from the ninja
01:55 - okay so uh let's begin i will work on
01:57 - the uh
01:59 - the code for the ninja gliding down
02:02 - uh what you can do is you can create a
02:05 - new sprite or you can just duplicate the
02:07 - one that you had earlier
02:09 - let's just duplicate this one we'll put
02:11 - it over here we'll call ninja
02:13 - clay okay we'll go inside here
02:17 - we'll change the costume we'll trash on
02:20 - this guy here
02:24 - and then we'll upload the sprite that we
02:28 - have
02:29 - um let's see um here
02:35 - okay we'll do the glide so we're using
02:37 - this guy here
02:39 - so zero to nine open that up
02:44 - okay we'll trash the first one this no
02:47 - we need
02:47 - okay same thing we're doing zero
02:52 - g zero g one
02:55 - two
02:59 - three uh
03:02 - four five
03:11 - six
03:16 - seven
03:19 - eight and nine
03:25 - so g zero to g nine this is the gliding
03:29 - okay all right we have the uh sprite for
03:32 - that
03:32 - okay let's go to the code um
03:36 - so now once more let's take a look this
03:38 - is pretty much
03:39 - sim uh sanding as before not much change
03:42 - here
03:43 - uh same thing right go to front lane go
03:46 - following the ninja
03:47 - same thing we don't need this
03:50 - we are going to change this
03:54 - instead of um
03:57 - this will do number three
04:01 - here we'll do three
04:05 - and we'll broadcast a new message call
04:07 - glide
04:10 - three let's call it three because that's
04:11 - number three
04:13 - okay and we'll go back over here this
04:16 - ninja
04:17 - we'll select glide three okay if he's
04:20 - not dying
04:21 - uh what we're going to do is um we're
04:24 - gonna add something
04:25 - we're gonna have to change the gravity
04:28 - so we won't
04:29 - go down as fast okay that's a
04:33 - set gravity set
04:36 - okay we can put that over here
04:40 - um set gravity
04:44 - well i think default is like one
04:46 - alternate negative
04:48 - 0.15 something like that negative one
04:51 - was the default
04:53 - and um after that
04:56 - uh we have to uh here
05:00 - this replete we are going to have
05:02 - another one actually
05:04 - we want to glide all the way to the
05:05 - bottom so we have to say
05:09 - this will copy this we'll throw in here
05:13 - this is until it goes to the end let's
05:16 - drag all this out
05:18 - put this uh repeat until it goes to
05:20 - touching the platform and
05:22 - keep on repeating this costume so if
05:24 - it's higher it'll go
05:25 - longer okay
05:31 - okay and then we'll put these in
05:36 - okay all right okay let's go back to the
05:41 - uh
05:41 - ninja um we'll insert show two
05:44 - we are going to make a new message that
05:47 - is show three
05:52 - so this is going to tell the ninja to
05:54 - show back up
05:55 - after this is done we'll duplicate this
05:57 - here
05:58 - we'll call it show three you can zoom in
06:01 - a little bit
06:04 - okay with one for the attack two for the
06:07 - throw
06:08 - three for the glide okay
06:12 - and also we want to set the gravity back
06:15 - to one since we change that rate
06:17 - so let's say set
06:23 - gravity back to negative one
06:26 - okay okay let's test it out real quick
06:31 - and see how it goes okay we'll jump up
06:35 - and push three as you can see he can't
06:37 - glide down
06:42 - i slowly come down okay
06:48 - all right we're done with the glide
06:52 - so um so you can see it's kind of slow
06:56 - down a little bit right before it drops
06:57 - okay
06:58 - all right we're done with glide right
07:00 - now now we're gonna work next on the gym
07:03 - uh the after we um you know destroy the
07:06 - crate
07:07 - well we want to uh we will broadcast
07:10 - something called crate broken right
07:12 - so we'll walk on the the gym so
07:14 - basically we're gonna
07:15 - make a colorful gym here uh what i
07:19 - already had i already had a sprite for
07:21 - that
07:22 - if you don't just download one online or
07:25 - clear the background whatever you like
07:27 - or something else doesn't have to be a
07:28 - gym
07:29 - but uh we'll just put a magic gym there
07:33 - okay so what we say is uh
07:36 - in the beginning when start
07:39 - uh we're gonna clear the graphics so
07:42 - we're gonna make this gym kind of
07:44 - flashing
07:45 - okay so we'll clear it back to normal
07:48 - and then we'll have to throw in this
07:50 - forever loop in here
07:53 - and what we're going to do is kind of
07:54 - change the look
07:58 - the color back effect by 25
08:01 - and then we're gonna check if it touch
08:04 - the ninja
08:05 - so the ninja touch it
08:08 - okay so we'll say sensing
08:14 - touching the ninja so we'll
08:17 - add a sound here okay fairy dust is
08:20 - already added earlier
08:21 - okay so we just say stop sound
08:28 - you don't have to do wait until done
08:30 - because you let it run in the back it's
08:32 - fine and it will continue to move on to
08:35 - the next code
08:36 - and let's say we just say think
08:42 - for one second say again
08:45 - [Music]
08:47 - obtain okay
08:52 - and then after that we want to hide this
08:54 - gym
08:56 - then we have to broadcast a message
09:01 - okay we're gonna podcast a message here
09:09 - and a new message say jim
09:17 - okay so that means the ninja picked up
09:21 - the gym
09:22 - okay um we are going to have some
09:27 - check here so the beginning is high when
09:30 - the crate is broken
09:31 - or show
09:36 - okay and then also um
09:40 - i think uh we it checks it right it
09:42 - broadcasts when the
09:44 - where the crate is at right yeah okay so
09:47 - what you can do is um
09:50 - you can wait for the setup for where the
09:51 - crate is going to be set up
09:53 - so what we're going to do is we can do
09:55 - this go back to the gym
09:57 - you don't need another message
09:58 - broadcasting from the crate where it is
10:00 - because the crate cannot wait for the
10:02 - map to generate before it creates right
10:04 - and the gym has a way for the crate to
10:06 - be generated before the
10:07 - gym can go there so what you can do is
10:10 - just you can use the same
10:11 - um uh wait
10:14 - message that setup message is fine
10:18 - what you can do is you can
10:22 - also hide it in the beginning right so
10:24 - in the beginning you can say hi
10:29 - okay and you can say here when i set up
10:32 - i also want to hide as well
10:34 - because let's say you move on to the
10:36 - next stage you want to do that
10:38 - and you can put a weight
10:42 - we'll wait for two seconds for
10:44 - everything to uh set up
10:46 - anyway the ninja's not gonna be able to
10:48 - get to the crate
10:50 - i guess i guess maybe this map he can
10:51 - get into two seconds
10:53 - but if it's like jumping now we have to
10:55 - get there we'll get there two seconds
10:56 - now let's put him one second okay
10:58 - i think it's good enough and then we
11:02 - will say
11:02 - go to i think that will be enough let's
11:05 - just see if it's enough
11:07 - go to create okay let's stop this game
11:10 - so if i break the crate you'll see the
11:12 - gym
11:12 - if it all works out okay let's try it
11:14 - out
11:17 - okay so i move over here so you can see
11:20 - right
11:21 - after i get the crate after i break the
11:23 - crate you see the gym
11:25 - and then i can walk the ninja there to
11:26 - obtain the gym
11:28 - so that is pretty much it so what we
11:31 - can do is when this gym obtain gym
11:34 - broadcast
11:35 - we can create the portal so what we can
11:38 - do
11:38 - right now is we are going to create a
11:40 - portal sprite
11:43 - i think i already have it downloaded let
11:45 - me see
11:46 - if not you can just um did a couple
11:50 - times long time back i don't remember
11:52 - let me see what it is
11:54 - so okay this is the portal i download
11:56 - from the website so what you can do is
11:58 - you can just import this gif what it
11:59 - does it'll actually
12:00 - create all the um
12:03 - all the uh icons custom for you in the
12:06 - gym
12:07 - so we create all this custom you see
12:11 - like a kind of spinning right effect for
12:13 - the portal
12:15 - so what you want to do is after the uh
12:18 - the
12:18 - the gym is obtained we're going to
12:20 - create a portal for the ninja to move to
12:22 - the next level
12:24 - okay so what we want to do is go to the
12:28 - code
12:30 - we will go control say start
12:35 - when green flat calc
12:38 - okay we're saying
12:42 - well we can go to the back layer
12:45 - because we want him not to hide the uh
12:48 - hide the ninja or something
12:50 - so go back to black layer one time
12:54 - okay and then um when green flat
12:57 - click right well i'll go back to the
12:59 - back layer
13:00 - and also on one high in the beginning as
13:04 - well
13:06 - all right okay
13:09 - then we will i guess that depending on
13:12 - where we want to put him
13:13 - it might be a different location let's
13:15 - say if they obtain the gym we'll want to
13:17 - put the portal here
13:18 - uh maybe i don't know
13:22 - 50 let's see 50 still kind of big
13:26 - [Music]
13:28 - okay maybe 40 will put them at this
13:29 - position as you can see you can put the
13:32 - portal in different location right
13:34 - it could be here this map but not here
13:36 - on the other map
13:38 - 35 and 35 is good
13:42 - okay so for now for the starting map we
13:46 - can put it at this position but later on
13:48 - we can
13:49 - depend on the map where generally we can
13:51 - put them in different locations
13:53 - okay so what we can do is um
13:58 - we will um have forever loop
14:05 - okay so hi i'll go to the forever loop
14:10 - and here we'll say if same thing right
14:13 - touching the ninja
14:18 - so basically when the ninja walk into
14:20 - the portal we wanna
14:21 - wanna make him go to the next stage so
14:25 - ninja when touching this ninja
14:29 - and then you can say um
14:33 - so let's say you have like two different
14:35 - level
14:36 - and then you want to make sure that okay
14:38 - at the third level you kind of stop and
14:40 - you want to make the game in
14:42 - so what you can do is you can use like a
14:43 - if statement let's say we have three
14:45 - level right now
14:46 - so what we can do is say hey um we're
14:49 - going to check the level
14:50 - actually
14:54 - we are going to check the level um
14:58 - if the level is less than three then
15:01 - what we can do is say broadcast
15:06 - we are going to broadcast the events and
15:09 - go to the next level
15:12 - new message next
15:16 - level okay
15:20 - the house of podcasts
15:24 - you win so with that it's like you have
15:27 - got to the last level right
15:28 - and then you can say what cash you win
15:31 - and we can do different things with that
15:34 - okay
15:35 - so and then we also need this um message
15:38 - when we obtain the gym right
15:41 - when the gyms obtain okay and then you
15:44 - can say
15:45 - um depending on different level
15:48 - and you can put like a portal in
15:50 - different level
15:51 - let's say in let's say we're in level
15:54 - two let me change the platform once
16:00 - let's say level two and
16:03 - changes hit box because i'm using that
16:06 - so let's say
16:07 - in level two we want the portal to go
16:10 - back here right let's say here
16:12 - then what you can do is like when jim
16:15 - here you can check the level right
16:19 - and you can see the control here
16:22 - say when you obtain the gym if
16:26 - uh you can use the operator here
16:30 - so level one we write taking care of
16:32 - right so if it's level two
16:36 - we can check this variable level if
16:39 - level is
16:39 - two we want to uh
16:42 - move it to this position now so
16:46 - so before it was this position that's
16:48 - level one so level two
16:49 - goes to this position and then
16:53 - it can say show
16:57 - okay so um and then
17:00 - also when we receive a next level we
17:03 - want to hide this
17:04 - right
17:09 - um because once we go to the next level
17:11 - we also want to hide this right
17:13 - so we don't want to show right so go
17:15 - back here say
17:17 - when i receive this next level this
17:19 - guy's broadcasting
17:22 - next level i also want to hide sprayed
17:27 - okay we can put them here okay this one
17:30 - let's finish this
17:31 - we'll show and then what we can do is uh
17:35 - using a forever
17:40 - control whatever and you can repeat
17:47 - i think we don't need a really small
17:49 - weight because this thing actually has a
17:51 - lot of
17:51 - costume if you can look it has like 24
17:56 - so it's a lot of custom so we don't
17:58 - really need like point wave
17:59 - point zero one second what you can do is
18:02 - um
18:02 - just say next custom so let's just if
18:06 - you want to
18:07 - test it out right just click on this you
18:09 - can see this is turning
18:11 - so you wanna execute the code just do
18:13 - that and we'll do that
18:15 - okay let's try it one time i mean we
18:18 - haven't
18:18 - fixed everything with the level right
18:21 - let's just just try one time
18:25 - so we'll obtain the gym you see the
18:26 - portal comes out
18:28 - we'll go to the portal if podcasts yeah
18:31 - let's go to the next level but we have
18:32 - not do the coding right for the uh
18:34 - platform to change the next level and
18:36 - all which we can do that next time
18:39 - uh so today what we did was we kind of
18:41 - work on the ninja gliding
18:44 - right and we worked on the uh
18:47 - the gym and then we worked on the portal
18:50 - i think next time we can
18:51 - work on changing the level and then
18:54 - maybe the monster
18:55 - the medusa comes out you can attack them
18:59 - and that would be pretty much it for the
19:01 - for the series
19:02 - this is a ninja platformer okay we can
19:05 - change this
19:07 - to a portal right okay
19:10 - all right i think we're done here uh
19:12 - okay thanks for watching see you guys
19:13 - next time bye
19:24 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome back to the kids calling playground channel today we'll continue working on this uh platform ninja game um i think we're almost done just a couple more uh things to do with the ninja and then changing the uh the uh the platform once we you know get the portal get into the portal and also you know putting the enemy in place i think we're maybe a couple more lessons okay so before we begin please uh like share and subscribe to our channel and uh tell your friend also like you know anyone is interested learning scratch and uh uh please tell them and then they get subscribed subscribe to our channel as well okay let's begin okay so what where we left off last time was we worked on the ninja throw and then the ninja attack also uh we can go over to co a little bit um just to see make sure that you know you're missing anything you can take a look so we're gonna move through pretty quick here uh just some of the code you can pause the video if needed right to just check the code okay and we have this on top and here so this is our main ninja and this one is our attack ninja this is the ninja for the throw uh throw in the knife this is the platform don't have anything for the sign the crate we have this kill water set uh very simple and then there's a hitbox one and this is that small knife that will be thrown out from the ninja okay so uh let's begin i will work on the uh the code for the ninja gliding down uh what you can do is you can create a new sprite or you can just duplicate the one that you had earlier let's just duplicate this one we'll put it over here we'll call ninja clay okay we'll go inside here we'll change the costume we'll trash on this guy here and then we'll upload the sprite that we have um let's see um here okay we'll do the glide so we're using this guy here so zero to nine open that up okay we'll trash the first one this no we need okay same thing we're doing zero g zero g one two three uh four five six seven eight and nine so g zero to g nine this is the gliding okay all right we have the uh sprite for that okay let's go to the code um so now once more let's take a look this is pretty much sim uh sanding as before not much change here uh same thing right go to front lane go following the ninja same thing we don't need this we are going to change this instead of um this will do number three here we'll do three and we'll broadcast a new message call glide three let's call it three because that's number three okay and we'll go back over here this ninja we'll select glide three okay if he's not dying uh what we're going to do is um we're gonna add something we're gonna have to change the gravity so we won't go down as fast okay that's a set gravity set okay we can put that over here um set gravity well i think default is like one alternate negative 0.15 something like that negative one was the default and um after that uh we have to uh here this replete we are going to have another one actually we want to glide all the way to the bottom so we have to say this will copy this we'll throw in here this is until it goes to the end let's drag all this out put this uh repeat until it goes to touching the platform and keep on repeating this costume so if it's higher it'll go longer okay okay and then we'll put these in okay all right okay let's go back to the uh ninja um we'll insert show two we are going to make a new message that is show three so this is going to tell the ninja to show back up after this is done we'll duplicate this here we'll call it show three you can zoom in a little bit okay with one for the attack two for the throw three for the glide okay and also we want to set the gravity back to one since we change that rate so let's say set gravity back to negative one okay okay let's test it out real quick and see how it goes okay we'll jump up and push three as you can see he can't glide down i slowly come down okay all right we're done with the glide so um so you can see it's kind of slow down a little bit right before it drops okay all right we're done with glide right now now we're gonna work next on the gym uh the after we um you know destroy the crate well we want to uh we will broadcast something called crate broken right so we'll walk on the the gym so basically we're gonna make a colorful gym here uh what i already had i already had a sprite for that if you don't just download one online or clear the background whatever you like or something else doesn't have to be a gym but uh we'll just put a magic gym there okay so what we say is uh in the beginning when start uh we're gonna clear the graphics so we're gonna make this gym kind of flashing okay so we'll clear it back to normal and then we'll have to throw in this forever loop in here and what we're going to do is kind of change the look the color back effect by 25 and then we're gonna check if it touch the ninja so the ninja touch it okay so we'll say sensing touching the ninja so we'll add a sound here okay fairy dust is already added earlier okay so we just say stop sound you don't have to do wait until done because you let it run in the back it's fine and it will continue to move on to the next code and let's say we just say think for one second say again obtain okay and then after that we want to hide this gym then we have to broadcast a message okay we're gonna podcast a message here and a new message say jim okay so that means the ninja picked up the gym okay um we are going to have some check here so the beginning is high when the crate is broken or show okay and then also um i think uh we it checks it right it broadcasts when the where the crate is at right yeah okay so what you can do is um you can wait for the setup for where the crate is going to be set up so what we're going to do is we can do this go back to the gym you don't need another message broadcasting from the crate where it is because the crate cannot wait for the map to generate before it creates right and the gym has a way for the crate to be generated before the gym can go there so what you can do is just you can use the same um uh wait message that setup message is fine what you can do is you can also hide it in the beginning right so in the beginning you can say hi okay and you can say here when i set up i also want to hide as well because let's say you move on to the next stage you want to do that and you can put a weight we'll wait for two seconds for everything to uh set up anyway the ninja's not gonna be able to get to the crate i guess i guess maybe this map he can get into two seconds but if it's like jumping now we have to get there we'll get there two seconds now let's put him one second okay i think it's good enough and then we will say go to i think that will be enough let's just see if it's enough go to create okay let's stop this game so if i break the crate you'll see the gym if it all works out okay let's try it out okay so i move over here so you can see right after i get the crate after i break the crate you see the gym and then i can walk the ninja there to obtain the gym so that is pretty much it so what we can do is when this gym obtain gym broadcast we can create the portal so what we can do right now is we are going to create a portal sprite i think i already have it downloaded let me see if not you can just um did a couple times long time back i don't remember let me see what it is so okay this is the portal i download from the website so what you can do is you can just import this gif what it does it'll actually create all the um all the uh icons custom for you in the gym so we create all this custom you see like a kind of spinning right effect for the portal so what you want to do is after the uh the the gym is obtained we're going to create a portal for the ninja to move to the next level okay so what we want to do is go to the code we will go control say start when green flat calc okay we're saying well we can go to the back layer because we want him not to hide the uh hide the ninja or something so go back to black layer one time okay and then um when green flat click right well i'll go back to the back layer and also on one high in the beginning as well all right okay then we will i guess that depending on where we want to put him it might be a different location let's say if they obtain the gym we'll want to put the portal here uh maybe i don't know 50 let's see 50 still kind of big okay maybe 40 will put them at this position as you can see you can put the portal in different location right it could be here this map but not here on the other map 35 and 35 is good okay so for now for the starting map we can put it at this position but later on we can depend on the map where generally we can put them in different locations okay so what we can do is um we will um have forever loop okay so hi i'll go to the forever loop and here we'll say if same thing right touching the ninja so basically when the ninja walk into the portal we wanna wanna make him go to the next stage so ninja when touching this ninja and then you can say um so let's say you have like two different level and then you want to make sure that okay at the third level you kind of stop and you want to make the game in so what you can do is you can use like a if statement let's say we have three level right now so what we can do is say hey um we're going to check the level actually we are going to check the level um if the level is less than three then what we can do is say broadcast we are going to broadcast the events and go to the next level new message next level okay the house of podcasts you win so with that it's like you have got to the last level right and then you can say what cash you win and we can do different things with that okay so and then we also need this um message when we obtain the gym right when the gyms obtain okay and then you can say um depending on different level and you can put like a portal in different level let's say in let's say we're in level two let me change the platform once let's say level two and changes hit box because i'm using that so let's say in level two we want the portal to go back here right let's say here then what you can do is like when jim here you can check the level right and you can see the control here say when you obtain the gym if uh you can use the operator here so level one we write taking care of right so if it's level two we can check this variable level if level is two we want to uh move it to this position now so so before it was this position that's level one so level two goes to this position and then it can say show okay so um and then also when we receive a next level we want to hide this right um because once we go to the next level we also want to hide this right so we don't want to show right so go back here say when i receive this next level this guy's broadcasting next level i also want to hide sprayed okay we can put them here okay this one let's finish this we'll show and then what we can do is uh using a forever control whatever and you can repeat i think we don't need a really small weight because this thing actually has a lot of costume if you can look it has like 24 so it's a lot of custom so we don't really need like point wave point zero one second what you can do is um just say next custom so let's just if you want to test it out right just click on this you can see this is turning so you wanna execute the code just do that and we'll do that okay let's try it one time i mean we haven't fixed everything with the level right let's just just try one time so we'll obtain the gym you see the portal comes out we'll go to the portal if podcasts yeah let's go to the next level but we have not do the coding right for the uh platform to change the next level and all which we can do that next time uh so today what we did was we kind of work on the ninja gliding right and we worked on the uh the gym and then we worked on the portal i think next time we can work on changing the level and then maybe the monster the medusa comes out you can attack them and that would be pretty much it for the for the series this is a ninja platformer okay we can change this to a portal right okay all right i think we're done here uh okay thanks for watching see you guys next time bye you
