this is what we're making today ah look at him go he's fabulous okay let's do it okay let's go ahead and create this really fun minecraft blocks game in scratch so the first thing that i want to do is create a really good block for us to use i'm going to use canva to do this you can do this right inside of scratch but canva is free and i always encourage my students to use it so i just opened up canva.com and typed in box just on one of its little white templates you don't have to have any particular size then in the search i typed in grass and i turned the box a nice deep brown color so this is the little box uh block that we're going to be using in our little minecraft game today so isn't it cute now i'm going to type in rock and there's a cool rock right there i like it but i don't like the color so at the top left i'm going to go ahead and edit the colors there are four shades of gray and they're i'm just going to turn them different shades of brown and that looks really cute and then i get rid of that guy and then copy paste so one block has two like little rocks in it and some grass on top if i can get this to copy and paste there we go and i'm gonna save that and i'm going to download it from canva as a png and it's free to download and you can build anything you want in canva then i'm going to add it to my photos and now i'm going to go ahead and open scratch and i go to upload sprite and photo library and there it be awesome and so i import it and this is going to be our terrain and then we're going to have another costume called soil and that's just going to be the exact same thing without grass on it all right now let's go ahead and draw steve he's just our little minecraft dude so let's start out with a nice little aqua color and let's do a box for his chest then let's do two brownish colored um blocks for his arms and i'm going to put them right in the middle of my block for his chest for his shirt and i sort of made a rectangle then copy and paste and put one on the right and left sides and that's just going to be a simple little symbol for his arms then i made a fourth block and that's going to be his a block for his legs and i turned that like an electric blue now i just copied and paste from his arms and then make a bigger block for his head and i'll zoom in here and i make just a nice little rectangle of black for his um hair and then i will make two block eyes so i just did one then copy and pasted the other to the other side and i just did a straight line for his mouth and then i'll do copy and paste and turn um a little or block white so it just gives him a little bit of dimension that he's like really alive there we go oh he's looking more human and humanesque as we go awesome oh i like steve he's very fantastic he's not quite the right size but we will fix the size all right let me make his i selected his mouth and made it size five just so we can see it a little bit better all right now let's go ahead and make two costumes for our terrain so one is the one that we just downloaded from canva with the pretty grass and the blocks and we're going to duplicate that and we are going to call this first one with the grass terrain and so we duplicate it and then we are in our bitmap um so not vector and i just went ahead and grabbed a square of that brown and i'm going to go ahead and plop it right over the grass so we keep it the same size and now this is going to be called soil so we have terrain with the grass and soil with just brown and so we have two different costumes that we can go between and so if you want to add on to this game and make inventory like in a creative mode for minecraft you can make both costumes about 198x171 now let's go ahead and make more costumes for our steve's because steve is going to be moving moving moving moving okay so there is steve and i want to make him a little bit smaller because so i go ahead and and select all of him then i make steve about 34 by 16 and i do that just so he can move along our game quickly you don't want the only thing with scratches that it can lag so if we do ten too many blocks at a time it will start um just not working so we want to keep these um pictures a little bit smaller so steve is 34 by 16. hi steve bye steve okay let's do um we're gonna go ahead and do five duplicates of steve so this is duplicate number one and this is gonna be costume up so just take his little arms and flip them up so he's just pointing up so this is costume up all right costume down i think we can just go ahead and move his arms to the side a little bit and that'll be it for costume down costume right let's go ahead and move his arms to the right hand side of our screen and angle them costume left let's go ahead and do the same thing with costume left let's angle his arms to the left so when he's moving we're going to call upon these costumes and we'll see his arms moving to that side and it just looks a little bit more fun oh i'm having trouble getting this over to the left a little bit and um it just gives an indication of the direction that we're going in since he's just sort of a block his arms sort of give us more of a directional sense then okay i think i i think i like that oh move both of them over here come on and you can see him right there on top of the blocks and he's starting to be a little bit okay let's go ahead and do one more and let's call this costume start and so he can just be in the costume down position but let's make his mouth an oval or a circle okay so up down right left and start up down right left cool okay cool okay now you know what i noticed is um you're gonna see when we do this code let's go ahead and for left let's put his arms in an open pacman face to the right and you'll see when we go ahead and make the code all right terrain code we'll talk about that in a minute let's go ahead and go to our code blocks for our terrain so when green flag is clicked set size to 25 percent then let's switch the costume to terrain then let's go to x 215 by y negative 65. oh that's much better okay if we play around we can press play anytime we want okay let's go ahead and get a repeat 10 times and create clone of myself so we're going to get this terrain looking really fun and then we're going to erase it change x by 10. and let's do change x by 49 instead of 10. and then go to 215 by let's take negative 215 where is it oh i did negative 210 by negative 100 and we might play around with that as i press play as i press the green flag so that's down a little bit too far oh i know what i did okay we're gonna have to play with these numbers a little bit okay let's go ahead and do negative 215 okay so let's do negative 215 by negative 100 i'm sorry negative 225 by negative 100 that's still not right but that's okay i'm going to keep playing with this let's go back to 215 negative 215. and then let's move on let's go to switch costume to soil and just regular i'm sorry switch costume to regular soil so there's somehow a soil too in there you can just ignore that and then grab our repeat again so repeat by 10 and this is just going to make our soil go in nice little blocks underneath steve create clone of myself um we're gonna do create clone of myself change by x by 49 again paste those right into our repeat we're almost done then tell our blocks where to go again so negative 215 by this one's a little larger negative 140. okay that's still not quite lining up the way i want it to so i think i have to adjust the very first one but we'll do that in a minute all right let's add another repeat block so repeat 10 times and create a clone of myself change x by 49 and let's create another row x go to 215 and 155 okay looking good just have to fix that first row and we can play along with these numbers and you can play around with them depending upon how big your block is so you can do really big blocks you can do really small ones all right let's go ahead and fix that very first one i think i know which one is wrong let's do negative 2 to 12. so instead of positive i think i forgot a little negative there we go okay now the blocks are lining up nicely under steve now we just have to tell him so we're still in the terrain code and it's looking really good and we have to tell our code what's going to happen with this terrain as we move our steve around we want it to disappear just like it does in minecraft and then we want to recreate it so we need to do some more coding to do that all right so when i receive broadcast disappear ooh can you can you guess what's gonna happen something's going to disappear if then and dragging my touch um when it touches the soil then okay actually when i touch steve then delete this clone so when steve touches the soil it's gonna go byebye and then when green flagged is clicked let's do a forever code okay um when green flag is clicked let's do a forever loop then an if then and then when the um f key is pressed we are actually going to create more blocks so go to steve so everything that steve touches will then create a terrain block fabulous and then we can um go ahead and switch between terrain and soil so go ahead and clone of myself save i'm i always save your project you don't want to end up with doing a whole lot of work and you didn't save it now go to 215 and why by 155. oh looky looky let's hit play and those blocks are lining up nicely and let's just do one more thing let's grab when the sprite is clicked so when we click that terrain block let's just do next costume so it will go to soil so some will have grass and some will just be dirt all right let's hit steve's code now okay so go to steve and in his code window drag over when green flag is clicked forever loop forever and ever and if then statement and key pressed let's do all right let's leave it space uh key and let's do broadcast disappear okay so let's try it out here i don't know if anything's gonna happen all right when green flag is clicked let's tell him where to go go to negative 215 by y negative 70. and then point in direction 90 and then switch costume to costume start yay okay now let's put a forever loop and if then move up so we can see what we're doing go to our sensing and what are we going to do now key i think i'm gonna do my arrows some people like to use different letters i i like to use the up down right and left on my keyboard i don't know about you what do you like to use all right so um key up arrow switch costume two you guessed it costume up costume up costume up why am i waiting okay costume my um code is lagging a little bit i don't know if it's my connection or i've just started to make a lot of blocks okay point in direction so up is zero not negative 15. it is zero up is zero and for up remember our little costume is his is steve with his arms raised so when we press the up arrow steve goes up with his arms raised and hopefully we'll be able to see that very clearly and move ten steps so it's not just a little up it's a big up with ten steps okay let's move up a little bit let's duplicate that um that if then block not the forever block let me get that out of there we just want that if then block okay there we go oh get out of there forever bye okay we just need one forever okay now we just did up let's go ahead and do down all right switch costume two costume down fabulous now this will not point in the same direction as costume up obviously can you guess before i type it where costume down will point it will point down so how many degrees is that bump 180 yay and again move 10 steps or else it'll just be the tiniest little movement okay let's duplicate again now let's do right and left pull down so we can see what we're doing and key pressed left arrow can you guess the degrees on the left costume left and this is where we're going to put in an extra piece of code here too we're going to put in set rotation style to left right and i played with this okay so our point of direction is negative 90 for everybody who said negative 90 congratulations you were right um and i played with this and it does make him go left so i like that and he looks like he's going left all right let's add one more if then block i don't know why i didn't duplicate this i just felt like typing key and this is gonna be right so think about what my degrees are gonna be if i go right right arrow switch costume to right switch costume to costume right awesome point in direction of 90 degrees perfect and move 10 steps when we do that 90 degrees awesome and i'm playing with it right now oh and look there he's going he's going okay there he's going yay and it looks like the space bar is working all right i'm pressing the space bar and now i'm just now i'm just going up and down and now i'm pressing the space bar yay and he is deleting the grass as we go and then i'm pressing the f because he is now adding blocks awesome adding blocks adding blocks adding blocks and i am seeing a little lag in my computer so like if all of a sudden your or your my ipad if all of a sudden your scratch stops working that's okay save it make sure you're saving it as you go and it will be fine thank you so much for watching what can you make leave me a comment
