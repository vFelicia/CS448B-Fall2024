so the first thing that we want to do is get rid of this little sprite cat right here we do not want him we don't need him so let's go ahead and click on this x over our sprite cat byebye okay the next thing that we want to do is we want to choose the sprites of our first names so I have a long first name it's Stephanie so I'm just gonna do stuff but you do whatever first name you'd like so if that's your whole name or if it's a nickname whatever you'd like go ahead and let's grab those sprites so what I do here is I go to my sprite window which is right down here in my bottom righthand corner and I click on choose a sprite now we have all kinds of different categories of sprites the category that I'm most interested right now for this assignment is called litterers so I click on this letters tab right here so I hit s there is my little s sprite right there awesome so I just click on it and there it is next to my s and I can see it up here in my preview menu and my preview window so I'm going to go ahead and move it over a little bit just so they have their own space and now I go ahead and here I click choose sprite again and I go to letters and my next letter is an e and I like them sort of staggered like that and then I click on choose sprite again and I go to letters and I choose P and I move that over and then I go to choose sprite and I choose H and that'll do it stuff I'm gonna go ahead and pick on the first letter of my first name and that's where I'm going to add some coding so I am going to say when I click on this piece of code it's gonna go ahead and perform the code that I am telling it to perform so let me drag out say hello so when I click on this my s says hello so when I click on this my s says hello okay so I don't want to have to click on my piece of code I just want to click on something to initiate or to start all of my code at once so I'm gonna do a kick off event so I'm gonna go down here into my yellow events and I am going to drag over the very first event that says when green flag is clicked so I can click here and when green flag is clicked my little s says hello awesome okay now let's go back into the looks because this has a lot of cool things in it okay so instead of it just saying hello on the letter s for two seconds let's go ahead and do change size by ten and we'll put that right underneath hello I'm the letter S so let's see what happens shall we click on this hello on the letter S and it grew bigger by ten now it's a little bit of a slight movement so it just grew bigger just a little tiny bit so we couldn't see it that much so every time I click that green flag the S grows a little bit bigger but what if I want to play this over and over again I don't want that s to get huge huge huge huge so why don't I have it get bigger and wait for a second and then get smaller again what do you think pretty cool okay I think it's pretty useful too to understand how that works so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go over here into our orange control underneath events so our orange control here and it says wait it's the very first code let's go ahead and stick that under change size by 10 and it's wait one second okay so let's go ahead and make that wait two seconds and let's change the size by 100 now if I wanted to it took shoot to 100 like make it huge and then wait and then go small again and go to like it's normal size what do you think I would need to do to make that size change back so for every action there is a reaction and maybe an equal reaction so maybe I should do a negative 100 so I'll go into my looks and I will go to change size by if there's a negative equal reaction it would be negative 100 okay and now we can check it really super easily all we have to do is just click the green flag so it says hello then it grows weights two seconds and goes back awesome okay so now that's all for letter s oh let's do one more thing on that s let's add a sound effect so let's go over here to our pink sounds and let's do the pop sound hello I'm the letter S grow big grow small awesome okay so we have a quite a little bit of code under s let's do something for T so I want to go ahead and click on that T let's do the same thing when the green flag is clicked it's gonna kick off a series of events and what series of events do we want it to do turn 15 degrees then how about instead of 15 degrees we turn 90 degrees and then we wait so go into our orange put our weight down here and let's wait for two seconds okay then let's turn back again okay so we could either do this 90 degrees not negative 90 degrees so it's an equal turning back or let's see what other motions we have let's turn it together right then let's turn it the other way 90 degrees again okay Armel just experiment so let's see what this looks like so I'll click my green flag okay so my ass does all of its little goodies and let's look at T it turns it rotates and then it wrote to init weights and then it rotates back hmm it's okay it's a start but I don't it's real small and it just goes bloop bloop okay so I don't necessarily think that that's a lot of bang for our buck let's go into looks let's do change color so let's do after it rotate change color effect by 25 okay that's pretty cool so it turns from this aqua color to this negative or to this dark blue color so let's see this all together okay let's click it again and see what color it goes to now because it's gonna keep changing colors I bet oh no it's the color effect did not change that okay let's try instead of color let's try fishtail no fisheye let's try whirl okay the effect is pretty like slight and subtle so let's do world by 50 okay now I can see the T is definitely a little bit more crooked instead of whirl lets do ghost see what happens oh it's fit it's faded quite a bit here let's go back to color let's turn more purple now let's see if it stays purple okay it's sort of a dark purple when we do it okay I like that let's add a sound to that sound effects now I don't want to use the pop sound so let's go ahead and click on our sound tab and let's go in to choose a sound let's try our trumpet so I just click on it it's okay let's do alert hmm that's cool okay let's try that one okay so that's alert so we go into code yeah and play sound alert so let's see here let's do this let's put it towards the end so we don't have two sounds on top of each other let's see if it works okay so we had the pop on s as soon as we clicked and that alert sound doesn't go until maybe like three seconds later so that's good okay cool give them some room here okay now let's go to letter e let's click on letter E and let's do our kickoff event of this green flag and let's still look and let's do let's do a set color so let's do instead of a 50 because we have the 50 for the T let's do 10 and see what this looks like so this turned like a lighter blue so I like that now let's make it let's do set size by a hundred and fifty percent then let's wait so we'll go to our control and let's get wait and let's wait two seconds and then let's do an equal reaction the other way so let's go to looks set size and we'll do negative 150 and then let's try it out it shrunk way way way way way down so it didn't go back to its original size so let's go back to its original size which is just a hundred percent so let's try it out okay that's better so we went to set set size to 150 percent we wait two seconds and then we say okay set it back to its original size which is a hundred percent okay so I like that that's much better you know let's give this guy its own sound let's give eat its own sound so let's go into sounds and let's do choose a sound and let's go to the category wacky which is it on the end here and oh let's try to da that's kind of cute okay so let's go into our code yeah and we have the e here and let's set sound to da okay so let's click on the green flag hello I'm the letter okay now alert sound and the tada sound are playing at the same time so I don't like that so let's do instead of let's hit another wait in here let's wait two seconds and let's try it out okay so we have the S growing bigger making a sound the T changing a color the e changing a color and making a sound and growing bigger and going back to its original size what should we do for the letter P okay maybe we do something simple like let's move ten steps well let's do our kick off of that when green flag is clicked move ten steps and then let's wait and we'll wait two seconds and then let's move ten steps again in the other direction so we'll do negative ten and let's do let's try it out okay let's try it out oh I see it it's okay let's try it it's B and then negative 50 let's try it okay I like that and then finally let's do our each so we go to events and we go ahead and click that when green flag is clicked now let's see let's go to our can let's go to our motion and let's go to point in direction let's see what happens when we point in direction nothing much happened huh let's have the letter H instead of pointing her in a direction let's still say goodbye now it's sort of too busy it doesn't say goodbye right at the end of the sequence of everything happening so let's do a wait here and let's do a wait for 10 seconds hmmm that's okay but it's a little long let's do okay not bad not bad at all okay but let's see the pH are too similar for me there there's a pink color so in this age let's go into costumes and we see that letter each there I wonder if I can change that to be a little bit different costume so instead of the fill being this aqua color why don't we change it to be a nice sort of reddish color what do you think okay so let's see if we can do that oh that looks good okay let's go back into our code and let's hit our go again hello I'm the letter F here and then each says goodbye okay that is all for lesson 2 I can't wait to see what you've done check out our little quiz on lesson 2 and come back for lesson 3 because we're going to take all these things that we have just learned and learned even more I can't wait
