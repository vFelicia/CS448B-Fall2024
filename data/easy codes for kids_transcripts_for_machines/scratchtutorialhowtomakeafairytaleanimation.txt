I love to make animations in scratch it is so much fun and it's so easy once you get down a couple of main steps so let's take the classic fairy tale Hansel and Gretel and let's put our own little spin on this fantastic tale we'll write our own version and in our own version there's only going to be Gretel just going to be her mom in this version her mom actually might be trying to tell her something and create some values in her instead of just trying to get rid of her because they're so poor as in the original fairy tale version welcome to my modern day play based on the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel I'm Gretel my mom sat me down to chat about not doing my homework and chores because while she worked I just played on my phone one day my mom decided to test my skills we headed to camp on your own in the middle of the park to test my survival skills I had heard rumors that there was a witch deep in the woods here but who believes in witches anymore it didn't take me long to see that finding food and shelter was a big deal I missed my mom and my home and the meals she gave to me even the veggies I started wandering around and fell asleep as soon as it became night in the morning I was lost cold and so hungry I started looking for a house anyhow at all when I saw a house made of candy I had been warned to never go near strangers but I didn't listen to my mom and soon found myself trapped inside of a witch's kitchen she magically locked all the doors and said she was going to cook me for dinner I outsmarted her though by pretending I didn't know how to use wood and fire to cook Oh mrs. witch I don't know how to use fire and wood to cook things hello I use a microwave he started laughing at me with a very familiar laugh I looked at her and took off her big wig and glasses and it was my mom he told me how to light the open fire and we made delicious veggie burgers and ate ice cream and then went for a wonderful evening stroll I loved every minute of spending time with her we decided that we would go camping together more often and that when we got home I would do my homework and cheerfully do my chores sometimes the end I hope you loved this version of Hansel and Gretel and write your own you hello okay so this is part 2 of how to make an animation with scratch so the first thing that I did with this I love to create assignments using fairytales because you can go a million different directions with them so for this assignment we are going to follow along with Hansel and Gretel and that's going to be the overall fairy tale theme but we are actually going to create an adaptive fairy tale where we are going to tell our story that we've brainstormed and the script that we've written and we're going to use scratch to make a character and different backgrounds and then step our character through our version of Hansel and Gretel so the first thing that I did was say you know I love the classic fairy tale Hansel and Gretel and now let's go ahead and write our own version open scratch and then I'm giving the project link of my scratch project of this of my version of Hansel and Gretel right here and I will make sure that it's in the description as well so the characters in our modern version include Gretel and her mother that's it only Gretel is shown the backgrounds include one white background a living room background which is gradalls living room a forest background a witch's house and the last scene is a party room so there are five different backgrounds I have a challenge in here to go ahead and draw your own version of the witch's house and what you believe Gretel looks like so I went ahead and did it myself and then I have a house for the kiddos to color and then I have Gretel for the kiddos to color and they can also import these into scratch if they want to or they can use them as they can just look at them just just for fun so what I did was I brainstormed out a script before I started anything and changing around how Gretel would actually move through the story and move through the backgrounds I decided that I would record her talking and then also record the words on screen and now I've gone ahead and here's this script and then I have every single scene and the code that I've used for each scene so this should be a good guide once you read this and once you see how I'm doing every single scene with when clicked play sounds which background plays sound and how I've recorded everything that you should be able to do this with any adaptive fairytale so I have five different scenes one for each background that's how I decided to break up my animation then I wrote everything down the script that I have beforehand and that's those are all my seis and then I recorded myself going ahead and reading my script and I only read one piece or one line of the script per little tiny bit per se so I didn't feel like I was rushed and I didn't feel like I had to read something really big where I was gonna like flub the lines or get really overwhelmed by it so basically all it is is just a wait and then play the be recorded sentence or two sentences and then this day and attach the say to it for a couple of seconds and then another wait and then play the sound and that's the exact I heard rumors I heard rumors these are the exact same things so she's saying them out loud and the kiddos he rehearsed hear her talking and then they can also read her words and those are those days so basically the code is a lot of weights and playing sounds and then saying the words which means typing the words on screen and then you go through the different backgrounds and that's how I broke it up she days she stays still I don't have her walking around and I don't have her conversing with anybody else I wanted the emphasis to be on the different types of seams so this gives you a behindthescenes tour of how I created this animation in scratch and I am going to download this and I will create a PDF if you would like to have the PDF you can just go ahead and email me and I will email you the PDF okay
