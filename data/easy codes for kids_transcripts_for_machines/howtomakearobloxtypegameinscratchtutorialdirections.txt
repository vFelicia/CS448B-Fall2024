hi let's make a roblox type game in scratch this tutorial is not for beginners the objective of this game is easy to make money and play the lotto the lotto is super easy just click the click me button and guess a number from 1 to 10. if you lose a red screen appears and your make money account goes down by one point if you win a green screen appears and you gain a point but to play the lotto you must first make money now in this tutorial you can learn about the three different jobs and about how we play the lotto step one let's create three different jobs with three different sprites there's the pizza shop guy or gal he chases brown bread avoiding green bread and his job is the easiest so he only earns one point for every single piece of bread he catches all right the candy store guy or gal he chases little colored hearts and avoids the dark hearts super simple there he is in that fun little background he goes up down all around and he gets two points for everything that he catches the flower shop guy this is the hardest level watch out for the bad guy there is a bad guy in this uh job and he is coming after you with his ray gun and um the flower shop guy actually tries to catch the little beetle and he wins three points when he does all right step two let's go ahead and upload three different colored strips of running sprites and then in step three we're going to make each sprite into its own costume so let's go ahead and unpack that so there are my six um little flower shop guys and they are all in a state of running so i uploaded the entire strip of them and now i'm just gonna go ahead and put each of them in their own different costume and then i'm going to go ahead and label them run right one through six so i'm just duplicating and copying pasting here so they're all in their own little costume so there's run right one two three four five and six and then we're going to add some code so it looks as if they are running okay now let's go ahead and duplicate them and turn them flip them horizontal and turn them to the left and then label them run left one through six easy easy easy and with these stripes or these uh sprites we are going to be able to run not only right and left but also up and down go ahead and place the all the rights together and all the lefts together all right step four let's code the sprites to run let's stay with our red flower guy so we're gonna code them to run up down left and right and it's actually really simple we're going to use blocks so first let's go ahead and code run left alright so choose make a block and let's call it run left now let's go ahead and choose switch costume to run left one then change x by negative 10 because we're running to the left side of our screen then we're gonna do uh weight point zero one seconds then let's go ahead and add next costume now let's click that run block oops can you see my mistake instead of run left i have run right so let's go ahead and switch that and now he looks right yay or left there he goes now let's go ahead and add a key here our left key so when we type it on the keyboard he actually runs to the left so i dragged out my when green flag is clicked then a forever loop then an if then and key when left arrow is pressed drag in our run left block and let's add a couple more things set point direction in can you guess it negative 90. so he points to the left and let's set his rotation style for don't rotate so he doesn't flip over and let's try it out okay looks pretty good all right now let's run right so my block let's name it run right and click ok now let's go ahead and repeat here so switch costume to run right one and change x by 10. let's grab a weight 0.01 seconds and then let's add a next costume okay if we click that run right block he'll go ahead and he'll move and he'll run to the right perfect now let's add in our forever loop the same blocks and let's just duplicate that left arrow and then change some of the parameters so if when the key right arrow is pressed let's get rid of these guys so we don't need that run block run left we don't need that let's go ahead and grab our run right block and then instead of point in direction instead of point in direction negative 90 we plane in direction 90 and then let's leave that don't rotate and make sure that that block is right underneath it forever okay so there is our running left and our running right perfect easy all right now let's run up and run down so go ahead and click make a block hit okay and run up and hit okay again now you know the drill switch costume and this is going to be left so run left they're all left except the right so left up and down are all left costumes all right change y by 10 because we're running up which is in positive territory wait .01 seconds again and then go ahead and grab that switch costume perfect now let's test it out we can just go ahead and click let's go ahead and duplicate that left arrow and choose the up arrow key get rid of those blocks underneath choose the run up block perfect point in direction can you guess the direction we're going to point in 180 and let's set a rotation style of all around now i think that there are different parameters that we can use i'm wondering if any of you know how to run up and not use those so just let me know in the comments okay so our run up is working left right up can't go any further up awesome i like how he drags his leg okay let's go ahead and make down so make a block call it run down hit okay let's go ahead and switch costume two left and then change by negative 10 good and then let's add our weight 0.01 seconds and then let's add our next costume okay let's go ahead and duplicate that up let's make it a down take out that run up block put in our run or our um run down block and then point direction can you guess what this is going to be zero yay if you guessed zero great job and leave that rotation style okay let's see if he can run down yay he's running down he's running up left right up down left up awesome all right step five let's go ahead and create the make money variable without money we can't do anything this is super easy just go into variables click make a variable and for the new variable name go ahead and type make money and then you can add a dollar sign or two and hit okay all right step six let's upload the bad guy that lives in the flower shop this is the only store with a bad guy he has a deadly ray gun so i drew this little character with a top hat and a funny little gun and there are six of him seven of him and seven and each in a different position and so the same thing with the flower shop guy we're gonna do with the bad guy which is give him um his own costume and so the first picture of him he's just sort of holding his ray gun and the last picture of him there's just a puff of smoke so in like the fifth and sixth the puffs of smoke get bigger so it gives the illusion um that he is shooting this crazy i don't know this crazy gas gun or something so i'm just duplicating and then i copy and paste and each picture is a little bit different so when we go ahead and code him it's going to give the illusion of an animation of him actually moving and his gun going off now i can take that white off just by using my fill transparent and i put him right in the middle of the screen almost done okay perfect now make sure that you label all of them bad guy right one through seven and then let's go ahead and make you guessed it we're gonna duplicate these and make him run to the left as well all right let's say we're done with that now let's step seven code the bad guy so we're in the bad guy and when green flag is clicked let's go x to 221 and y to negative 129. so we're going to be moving the bad guy from right to left across the screen and then he's gonna jump into a random position now let's add a glide one second to x same numbers two two one and negative one two nine now let's pull in that forever loop and let's go ahead and add a weight point one second we're going to make him a little faster than the red guy and you can adjust this however you'd like and make it your own game and then we go ahead and put in next costume so he looks as if he is really running and shooting his ray gun now we're going to do change y by you guessed it negative 5 and you can do negative 10 you can do negative 7 if you want him to move faster this way he really looks um at negative 5. you can really see each pose that we've drawn all right let's add a if then statement if x position is less than 170 negative 170 then go to random position awesome so when you get to the end of the screen then jump set x to 180 and let's try it out there he goes step eight let's go ahead and upload the beetle in the flower shop remember this is the objective of the flower shop guy is to catch the beetle and get three points stay away from the bad guy if the bad guy touches them it's minus three points so i went into my upload a sprite i'm gonna go ahead in the search bar and type beetle there's the beetle let's go ahead and first thing let's make him a little smaller he's a little too easy to catch that size so i go ahead and i draw a box around his entire body and just drag him to a smaller size okay perfect let's add some code when green flag is clicked show him and then in a forever loop weight point did i do 0.2 seconds yes 0.2 seconds and then hit the next costume we're going to make a couple more costumes for him and then wait 0.2 seconds again and then go to random position so he should be jumping all over the place right now let's make him look a little bit more like a real bug by um having him jump and move in a different spot so he actually does look like he's jumping so he's not always just facing to the right hand side so let's go ahead and duplicate this beetle so there's four different beetles and each of them should be facing a different way and you can use the flip horizontal foot vertical i just wanted to rotate because rotating is fun okay let's try it out hit the green flag okay now he looks more beatily because he's actually just sort of like jumping all over and moving and it sort of looks cute okay let's go back to the red flower guy code and i added when green flag is clicked for everloop let's go ahead and start adding um some things to make this into like a real game so inside the forever loop let's do if then statement so if i am touching the bad guy what happens then say ouch and let's do something with our money let's go ahead and change make money by negative three because it's a penalty we don't want to get hit by the naughty bad guy with his ray gun okay wait 0.1 second then let's go ahead and add an if then and let's do the same thing for the beetle except let's say got you and let's add three points and then we'll wait point one again so it's the exact same code for each the beetle and the bad guy and it's going to be the same thing in all of the different jobs we're going to say something we're going to have a negative and positive and we're going to have a little bit of a wait time so this is actually i'm trying to catch the beetle right now it's actually pretty hard okay i've seen my first mistake i don't like that when i hit the um beetle it just keeps saying got you so let's go ahead and change that so instead of it just saying it let's do a say for two seconds all right so let's get rid of the regular stay and we'll just have a say for two seconds so got you for two seconds and plus three and then wait point zero one second and let's go ahead and do the same thing for the um bad guy if the bad guy touches me i'm gonna say ouch for two seconds i'm gonna get a minus three on in my money and then we're gonna do a little weight on there too okay this is actually really hard to catch him got you yay he's too fast okay step nine let's go ahead and add a really fun moving background for our flower shop just to make things a little bit more interesting when we work at the flower shop so i um downloaded these two or this one um green block minecraft type back drop and i want to go ahead and upload it into a sprite so it's not a backdrop it's in a sprite so sprite sprite sprite there is my little green it's gonna be a backdrop but it's in a sprite um i duplicated it so i have two and they're gonna layer over each other and constantly move it's gonna be super cool let's make it's gonna make the flower shop an interesting place to work all right so let's go ahead and add a broadcast message the broadcast message is going to be flowers we're going to have one for every single job so if i receive flowers then i'm going to go backwards 10 layers because these are going to be more these aren't sprites these are going to be more of a backdrop so when i receive my new message i'm going to go backwards and then i'm let's go ahead and add a new variable x position 1. so i'm just going to call that xpos1 and ypos1 so two new variables x position one and y position one easy that's how we're going to tell this guy to start moving okay now let's go ahead and set you guessed it x position one two zero and y possession position one to zero and then let's go ahead and go to x and y and instead of typing anything in let's go ahead and put our variables in there go to x position one y position one perfect and then let's do a forever loop and change x position one by negative ten and next go to x equals x position y equals y position so i've just made it move a little tiny bit then let's add an if then and we'll add a less than operator if x position one is less than negative 480 which is the width of our little screen then what happens so if it's less than our screen then we set x position to our screen 480. it'll make sense in a minute okay so i'm going to take out that broadcast message right now just to try it and i'll put in a green flag so do you see in the upper left hand corner our variables they're going x position is going up to 480 and then down to negative 480 and that's right that's what we want we have to layer it with something and that's where we need that second sprite that second green backdrop sprite so let's go into the first sprite because the second sprite has no code let's go into that first sprite and let's go ahead and drag that code into the second now we're going to change the variables here we're going to make two new variables in that second backdrop x position 2 and y position 2. so let's get rid of that green flag clicked let's go to variables make a variable x position 2 and y position 2. so we have four new variables now go ahead and set that x to x position 2 and y position two to zero now let's take out let's go ahead and pull this apart so i can take things out a little better oops let's take out go to x y and let's do go to x position two and y position two okay now change x position two two by negative ten and let's take out those position ones and put in x position two y position two all right if x position 2 is less than negative 480 and let's go ahead and leave that as x position one now let's try it out so we need green flag clicked let's go back into that one add green flag clicked and um go ahead and click our green flag perfect it's running all right step 10 let's add a broadcast message all right so we are in our bad guy code and i want to go ahead and say when when he hears the message flowers that's when he's gonna go ahead and do his thing so when i receive new message flowers hit okay that's when his code is going to start running and we're going to make this for anybody that works in the flower shop so when i receive the message flowers i'm going to show myself as the bad guy because that's where i work in the flower shop all right let's go to the beetle and when i receive flowers then my code starts now let's go to our red sprite guy in the flower shop our flower guy and let's take off those when green flag is clicked and when i receive flowers put those on top of our move tools our move code okay so we're in the bad guy sprite now let's go ahead and start making buttons to jump to the three different jobs that you can have okay so you can work at the pizza shop the flower shop or the candy store let's do the pizza shop first so we're gonna make a little button so i've downloaded a little pizza shop sign and i uploaded it as a sprite now let's go ahead and make it look a little bit like a button and we're going to stick it on the home page so our players can click it and say hey i want to work at the pizza shop so i'm going to make it just the right size put it over to the lefthand part of the screen and then in text red text write pizza shop above it and then go ahead and make a box around it in red again so it looks like a button and then we're just going to code it there's the box so that when our players press it they go to a pizza store and they see our little pizza guy and they can play our little pizza bread catch game and win money to play the lotto okay so we're in the pizza shop guy sprite or we're in the pizza shop button sprite when message received we'll go ahead oh when message received flowers we're going to hide that button so hiding different sprites is important in this game because we only want the sprites to show up in their specific jobs so when green flag is clicked we want to show the pizza shop button because it's going to be on the home page and the home page is going to be when we click the green flag and let's add a couple more little simple codes here when this sprite is clicked now let's go ahead step 12 and make a pizza shop background so when that sprite's clicked it goes to this background so when the sprite is clicked let's do a new message that says pizza or pizza store or pizza shop whatever you want and let's upload a picture of the inside of a like a minecraft or a roblox game of a pizza shop so this one that i got is sort of red and black and it has um i don't know if you can see it but it has different a menu on the wall and it has sort of like a kitchen and some benches and it i like it because it's red now go ahead and fill up your entire backdrop with your picture you can have any picture you like you can even just have like a red background here it doesn't have to be a shop background i just like these little images i think it's more fun okay so i make sure that it fills the entire backdrop now i go back to my pizza store sprite and remember this is going to be a button that clicks us and what we're going to say that clicks us into the game into the pizza shop so when so we're going to say when this sprite is clicked go ahead and go to that backdrop now number 13 let's go ahead and make a home button so let's go into the sprites and upload and in the search bar let's type home and there's a little home button right there and let's drag that to the top right of the screen and it's a little big let's make it a little smaller a little bigger and it is always going to be seen because um we're going to allow our players to always go back home so let's go into the code and when this sprite is clicked same thing with the pizza store switch backdrop to home so it's just a blank white screen and there's our pizza shop button awesome so those two things are on our home page when the green flag is clicked we're going to show our home button good okay let's test it out all right let's go back to the flower shop guide and let's add when green flag is clicked we're going to hide our flower shop guide because we don't want to see him until we're actually in working in our flower shop okay so let's go to the bad guy and when green flag is clicked let's hide the bad guy because we don't want to see him until we click into our flower shop oh there's the beetle still in the pizza shop so let's hide him so let's go into the beatles code and when green flag is clicked hide all right so let's test it out go to home go to pizza shop okay back to home okay step 14 let's make the flower shop button so same steps as the pizza store but so upload and this i just have a nice little picture of flowers and in purple or pink some type of cute flower color go ahead and add the text flower shop on top of it and then add a box around it so it looks like a little button and then sort of make it the same size now let's make that flower shot button go to the moving background that we clicked or that we created i'm sorry okay so we are in the moving background the first sprite of the moving background when i receive flowers let's go ahead and change that broadcast message to when i receive flowers we show this background good when the backdrop switches to lottery we're gonna hide it so basically we're going to hide it until hide these until they're um we have the flower shop so when backdrop switches to home hide when backdrop switches to pizza shop hide when backdrop switches to candyland hide we don't want to see any of these except in when somebody clicks the flowers when somebody broadcasts flower or goes into the flower shop so i'm just hiding hiding hiding hiding this okay so i go into my second green backdrop which is a skype and i'm just going to go ahead and drag all these little hide codes into the second one as well that's going to be a big part of this game is just hiding the sprites until you go to their store and you can do it a number of different ways you don't have to just do what i'm saying okay i'm going to go ahead and lay these out so i can see them neatly okay let's go ahead and let's now make the candy store button so same thing i got a picture of the outside of a candy store called sweeties candy warehouse it is a real place and it's awesome i've been there in cleveland it is fantastic it has tons and tons of different types of candy that i've never seen before and i've seen a lot of candies okay so i want to shrink this down to be sort of sort of kind of the same size as the other stores now i'm going to go into the fire shop or the fire fire the pizza shop and i'm just gonna go ahead and drag and drop some of this code into my candy store button now let's go ahead and make the candy store backdrop so when we actually click that little candy store button where do we go well i grabbed this fun little um minecraft type roblox type background it's just tons of different colors it reminds me of candy so i went ahead and made that as a backdrop called candyland and i'm going to go ahead and just resize it and fill it all the way up so it takes up the entire screen of candy candyland okay now let's go back to the candy store button that we just created and say when we receive when this spread is clicked broadcast candyland which is a new broadcast and then go to the backdrop of candyland now let's go into the bad guy and let's hide him from candyland and basically anything else that he that is not the flower shop so he shouldn't be seen in the lottery the pizza store the candy land all he should be seen is in the flower all right so step 18 let's make the candy store code um so let's go into or let's make the candy store guy so i the easiest thing to do is just duplicate the flower store guy and then change his colors so there's our flower shop guy in red now we're going to change him to wearing all purple and having a yellow hair and beard and sometimes i have to redraw the beard and the hair a little bit because i get too happy with the colors okay looking good all right where is this okay i want to color recolor all of these so i pick a nice purple and then i use my eyedropper i can pick that yellow and just recolor his beard and his hair then use the eyedropper and grab that same purple and recolor and recolor his beard and his hair no problem and i like to do this because i like to color and again sometimes i have to redraw the outline a little bit but it does not take long and then that way i have everybody looking the same that's why i like to use the same sprites and i like to use the same code all right step 19 code the candy store guy so he's gonna have the exact same code as the flower shop guy so let's make sure he's running right right right now he's running left left left left left left awesome now let's go into his code and make sure that his costumes are all correct so they say purple right and purple left just check all of his codes now when we receive the broadcast message candyland not flowers because we're now in the candy store and make sure that his run codes are correct now when again switch the bat the broadcast message on this and then when he's touching we haven't made anything for him to um use as his earning money in his store so i'm just going to leave some of these just as placeholders but we're going to end up changing them so it's changed by two and negative two we can change that now and let's just get rid of those says all right so our purple guy our purple sprite um is working really nicely for having spent just like a couple minutes on him and that's why it's awesome to duplicate all right so duplicate that when i receive so instead of flowers when i receive pizza store i hide because he does not belong in the pizza store okay there he is there he is running up left down terrific all right step 20. let's go ahead and code um some candy hearts to make this more into a job for him so let's go ahead and go to choose a sprite and in the search bar let's type candy and there's our heart candy and then let's go ahead and go into the costume because i need to change this costume so instead of it just saying code it and and being in these light colors i want to change them to my own colors that i like better and i'm going to get rid of that coated so i made the heart smaller so it's easier so it's harder to grab we don't want the job to be too easy and let's just go ahead and delete the rest of these other hearts they're too big now um let's go ahead and duplicate this candy heart and give it a different color just to make the game a little bit more of our own that color is fine i like to keep these colors nice and light and let's get like maybe a little purple and then duplicate the purple heart maybe a little pink okay um now let's go ahead and add some code to our hearts so when green flag is clicked we're going to hide because we're only going to show the hearts when we receive the candyland message or we're in the candy shop okay so when we receive candyland message we show our hearts candy hearts let's duplicate when we receive the flower message we hide and i'll just go through those other hides now when we receive candyland let's do a forever loop and wait 0.2 seconds then we'll switch costumes so he's always turning different costume colors now let's make him move a little bit and let's wait point another point two seconds and then we'll make him move jump to random position okey dokey and that's just like the bread so let's click um candy store the sprite takes us to this cool background the heart is working awesome all right let's go back into our candy store guy and let's do a couple of things here let's start him off in a position to the bottom left so whatever coordinates you have on the bottom left let's go ahead and start the game there so i'm going to put under when i receive candyland show and then go to x at those coordinates 180 and minus 100. now let's go ahead and change this in our when i receive candyland in my forever loop if i'm touching the heart candy then make money goes up by two okay now let's go ahead and duplicate that um pink heart those those little cute hearts and let's go into the costume this is gonna be the let's turn this into the bad guy of the candyland store all right so let's get rid of the all but one costume of the heart and we're gonna call this a bad heart it's a bad candy let's turn it a rotten color candy dark and maybe like a dark red okay so this heart has some this bad heart has some code already with it so let's speed it up instead of point two let's make it point one go to candy store now it's flipping all over the place okay good there it is all over okay now let's go back into the candy store guy code and when we touch that bad heart let's do minus two now let's play a little bit see if i can make this score go up and down seems to be working good good good okay now let's do um a little bit of a say on each of these so when we touch the bad candy heart let's say oh no for two seconds and we touch the good candy heart let's say yummy for two seconds okay let's try it out yummy yummy oh no all right step 21 let's make the pizza shop guy so the we're doing the exact same thing with the pizza shop guy that we did with the candy store so let's just duplicate that candy store guy go ahead and rename him pizza shop guy now go ahead and color him differently i did brown hair and a yellow suit and i make all my rights and then i make all my lefts and i make sure that they're grouped together it's just easier to code them that way okay and i'm just using my eyedropper tool so i get the colors exactly the same from costume to costume just so he looks as good as he can good and i love the coloring process it's super easy super fun and then that way they all look exactly the same almost done okay and we only have a couple more things to do in this game before it's done okay let's keep coloring and there's the brown and brown and one more guy to go brown yellow whoops yellow okay awesome all right let's code the pizza shop guy so we just have to make a couple of changes and then his code will be good so when we receive pizza shop we're going to show good and if you haven't made the pizza shop broadcast message just go ahead and make it and then we show when we have the backdrop to pizza shop and we hide it when it's green flag click and we hide it when it flowers and we hide it when it's candyland and we hide him when we're in the home backdrop so there's all kinds of hiding to do with these candy store all right make sure his costumes are correct which they all should be because the candy store was cracked so the flower so that this guy copied it so he should be correct all right go ahead and change that broadcast message to pizza store and broadcast message to pizza store now what we're gonna do is instead of touching candy heart or heart candy we're gonna get rid of that because we're gonna be doing some bread so these can just be placeholders for a minute we're gonna change this by one and negative one because the pizza shop should be the easiest because the bread isn't super small all right so let's go ahead and make the pizza shop breads and then we'll finish the rest of the coat on the pizza shop guy so go into choose a sprite and then in the search bar type in bread and there's a little loaf of bread fabulous and that's just the right size you can adjust the size if you want okay when we receive the pizza shop broadcast message then what do we do then we do our forever loop then we do wait 0.2 seconds and next costume although i'm not sure i'm gonna do another costume for bread i might just leave that one costume but maybe you can do a different costume and flip it around okay and wait point two seconds and then go to random position all right let's go to home go to pizza shop and there's the bread and it's flipping all over the place yay or it's jumping all over the place i should say and there's our pizza shop guy and he can go up and down and right and left fabulous it's working all right let's hit stop now let's go into our black heart for a minute something's showing oh okay let's actually let's drag some of these um show and hides into our bread because we're gonna need the same things in our bread we only want the bread to be seen inside the pizza shop that makes sense right let me rearrange this code nicer and let's go ahead and do some duplicates of this so when i receive pizza shop i show my bread duplicate when i receive candy store i don't want my bread to show in the candy store okay it doesn't look like it's there good all right let's go back into the candy store the pizza shop guy so let's go ahead and adjust this so if i receive my pizza shop broadcast message forever i'm in a loop if i touch the bread then my money goes up by one and i wait 0.1 seconds okay and i'm also going to go to say yes and i'll duplicate that red and go into costume and this is i'm going to make a green bread because this is the yucky bread you don't want to touch this bread so let's make that green all over and let's wait point one second and point one second in our green bread and let's get rid of that next costume and let's just so it's just gonna wait point one second then it's just gonna go to random position all over and we're gonna say yes when we catch the brown bread and then when we touch the green bread or the bad bread whatever we want to call it let's call it bad bread then it's gonna be minus one all right step 24 let's make the play the lotto button so this is our fourth button that we're making so let's go into paint in our backdrop and let's just make a plain white background that says lottery now let's go into choose a sprite and let's i typed in the the um description button and i got this little green button and i just added the text play the lotto now for the code let's go into when we receive lotto show actually when we receive home show and then when this sprite is clicked switch back drop to lottery perfect and then let's go ahead and add when green flag is clicked show because we always want the lotto button to show it's sort of like the home button step 25 make the click me button to lay the lotto yay okay this is that big rectangle that i made that you might have seen earlier so we want sort of a light yellow and a light green rectangle one inside the other so there's rectangle one there's rectangle two and i'll just put that to the background and then let's go ahead and type click me let's make it a little bit bigger and then let's go ahead and type one dollar scratch off ticket one in ten chances winning you don't have to do one in ten you can do one in 20 you can do one in 100 you can do one in five all right let's create some new variables so new variable name winning number and this is inside that click me sprite that we just made and new variable name your number guess and we don't have to leave those out there we can for now okay so broadcast new message number and let's make another broadcast message new message one message i won and then let's duplicate that and this can be a message lost or message i lost message i lost okay so number i want i lost three different new broadcast messages all right let's create a new backdrop that says one and let's just make this green do you remember this from the beginning of the video a big green backdrop and we're going to add some text just to let the people know that they won the lotto they guessed the correct number from one to ten all right so at the bottom let's put some text in black we're almost done congratulations you won click me to play again awesome okay and let's duplicate that background that backdrop and let's make it red except let's not go ahead and say congratulations because this is what they get when they lost so instead of congratulations we're gonna put sorry you lost click me to play again because they can certainly play again and move that over a little bit now in the click me um code we have our new broadcast messages we have some hides and we have a show so when this sprite is clicked if make money is less than zero or is less than one and it can be equal to zero or less than zero two there's a lot of different ways you can do this say you must make money to play the lotto elves choose a number from one to ten between one and ten that's better between i like that better so when this sprite is clicked if your money is less than one you can't play else you're telling the person to choose a number between one and ten then you're gonna say join i bet you know what we're going to do answer bye this is your guess you can leave a little blank too so it's not out crowded is your guess so if i type two it will say my answer is your guess for two seconds it's just a little makes it more interactive so that people know that something's happening okay then we set your number guess two you guessed it the answer and something's gonna happen if it's right or wrong it's so simple then broadcast number the message or new message number we already did that one so broadcast number we're not going to do too much with the broadcast number right here but you could do like a high score set winning number so it's good to have that in there two pick random one to ten so that's where the code is picking a number for us and then pick an ifthenelse statement if winning number equals your number guess then change make money by one yay and if not change winning number by negative one and also let's go ahead and add in there our broadcast message i won and then a broadcast message i lost super simple now what happens when you win and lose so if the broadcast message says i lost then i want to switch backdrops to the lost backdrop which is that red one and then if the winning if the um message says i won then i want to switch the backdrop to one which is the green backdrop i just have one one nothing and one two i didn't switch the names okay so let's try it out click me pick a number between one and ten and i chose it and i lost all right awesome almost done step 26 let's make some background music i suggest different background music for every store so all you do go to freesounds.org download some music then go into your store so i'm in my flower shop and i go to sounds upload a sound and it's importing and let's i always rename it because it comes out with this crazy sound so flower shop background music or background and then we just have to code it okay that sounds good you guys can't hear it but it sounds good on my end now when i receive the message flowers forever play my song okay so let's test it out go to my flower store got you good and there's my lotto button there's my make money there's my home button awesome and my score is changing terrific got you got you all right step 27 this is our last step less than a minute to go let's make some directions on our homepage so go to our home page and write where would you like to work question mark pizza shop easiest one dollar per bread candy store harder two dollars per candy heart flower store hardest three dollars per bug you're done congratulations all right let's go ahead and show that text just on the home page and hide it everywhere else and you know how to do this because you've done this with all the different sprites it's just a game
