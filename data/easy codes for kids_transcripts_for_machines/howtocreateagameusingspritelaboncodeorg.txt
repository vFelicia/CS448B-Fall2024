so I love creating games in code.org let's go ahead and create a really colorful game where these little yellow Hedgehog is trying to catch the purple bunny and score a point now every time the yellow Hedgehog touches one of the gray mice that we've also created he goes back to the starting position in the bottom left so the little gray mice do not make the game easy they bounce the yellow Hedgehog back to starting position meanwhile the yellow Hedgehog tries to the purple bunny and if he does then the purple bunny goes into a random position on the screen and makes the game a little bit all right so the first thing we're going to do is go to code.org you do not need to log in and at the top right hand of your screen go ahead and click create and then click Sprite lab the left area of the screen is our spot that we see in real time the game that we are creating the middle of the screen the center is our toolbox of blocks and the right hand is where we drag our blocks of code to make our game the first thing that we're gonna do is go into our blocks in sort of the center of the screen click on our world and let's go ahead and select a colorful background so let's drag out that set background to and then go ahead and click on the blue sky with a rainbow background that's just sort of like a fun background that we're going to use now we're going to go ahead and make three different Sprites first hour gray Mouse and when we click on the location of the gray Mouse go ahead and click on the little yellow location Tab and then drag your mouse to the top right hand of your screen now we go back to Sprites go ahead and drag out make new Sprite and let's select the purple bunny this time and he is good to just sit right in the middle of our screen finally let's go ahead and drag out make new Sprite and let's choose our yellow Hedgehog it's sort of like down towards the bottom and let's drag him so grab those coordinates and drag him to the bottom left of the screen of the screen the next thing we want to do is make a loop spawn five mice so those mice are going to be born in the top right hand of the screen and then go all over the place to try and make our game a little bit more difficult so the yellow Hedgehog doesn't just have a clear trajectory to the purple buddy so let's go ahead and select loops and we'll grab our repeat and we'll put our repeat right underneath our set background and then this code is for our gray Mouse so I'll just drag those other two Sprite blocks down and now instead of repeat 10 times let's go ahead and repeat five times and that just simply means hey let's make a Sprite five times okay the next thing that we want to do is go to our behaviors and drag out Sprite begins and let's go ahead and set up that purple bunny select the gray Mouse and then let's go ahead and select what Behavior we need when these five mice are born we want them to go all over the place so let's drag out wandering so what we've done is let's make five mice and one day and that's just gonna Loop and then when they are born let's have them wander all over the screen okay now let's go ahead and I want to reorder this a little bit so I selected my purple bunny Sprite and I'm gonna put him right underneath and I rolled block and then I have now I have all my blocks for my green ice and now I just want to go ahead and put my block back for my hedgehog that just makes more sense to me okay let's go ahead and press run and we see our mice being sort of born at the top right hand of the screen there's five of them and they bounce all over the place next let's go to Sprites and set size and we'll set the Hedgehog size to 50 of what it is now and let's go ahead and run our game again so it's going to be a little bit harder a little bit more challenging because the Hedgehog isn't as big now let's go ahead and give the Hedgehog the ability to move up down left and right so let's go to events when up is pressed go to Sprites select move and it's moved North 10 pixels is fine and instead of the purple bunny let's select the yellow Hedgehog now let's give it a whirl okay so I press run and then press my up arrow and there goes my little hedgehog up you can only go in One Direction right now so let's go ahead and do South left and right so let's go to events one up is pressed and instead of up let's do down and let's go ahead and go Google move and instead of 10 pixels to the north let's pick South and we run it and there he can go up and then when I press down oops I forgot to move my to change this to the yellow Hedgehog so let's change that to the yellow Hedgehog start again so now my yellow Hedgehog can move up and down up and down North and South with the up arrows and down arrows now let's go ahead and click events when left is pressed go to Sprites move 10 pixels to the West and we can remember our directions by the little saying never eat soggy waffles never North eat is Right South is down and left is West never eat soggy waffles I'm sure you guys have heard I've heard that okay so events one more when right is pressed then we're gonna go east never eat soggy waffles okay so my hedgehog should move up down right and left now when my hedgehog touches the purple bunny or I'm sorry when my hedgehog touches the mice we want him to go back to his original position that we placed him at Okay so we just told the Hedgehog to jump to a random location when it touches a gray Mouse let's go ahead and say instead of the Hedgehog jumping to a random location let's drag out a little location block so we don't need that whole big block and when the Hedgehog touches the gray mouse let's just put it back to the bottom left of the screen I have 85 by 73. you can just put it wherever you want to the bottom of the screen okay let's test it out and it is working so he is trying to I'm trying to get to the purple bunny and the gray mice are not letting me so it just um it just makes the game a little bit more challenging and a little bit more fun okay so now let's go ahead and select when the Hedgehog gets to the purple bunny what happens let's make the Hedgehog or let's make the purple bunny jump to a random location so he is going to be moving all over the place after I touch him I successfully the Hedgehog successfully touches the purple bunny he's gonna jump all over the place he's going to go to a random position Now Let's Make a Score variable so I go to variables set I to and we're going to change that I it's not going to be I let's rename this variable to score and hit create set score to and it's going to be plus 1 every time my hedgehog touches the purple bunny so let's go to math and let's grab this block right at the top here 0 2 plus and then we're going to add that little middle zero out and grab our score variable so set score to plus and then make this one so when the Hedgehog touches the purple bunny he'll jump to a random location and we'll score will go up by one now let's go to text and let's add to the screen a title that says score colon so grab text and let's take out the title and we'll grab our join and in our join in the little quotation marks there go ahead and type score colon I'll put the colon in in a minute let's take out that zero so the title screen will say score and let's go ahead and run it and see what we have okay so I'm going to go ahead and attempt to touch okay there's my score and I actually want to move that score so it is always there not just when I touch the purple bunny and I need that score system to start working but I haven't set the initial score the starting score to zero so let's go to variables set score two and let's put this right at the beginning of my blocks so let's set score two right underneath the background because I want this to be right at the beginning of my blocks let's go to map let's grab this little zero set score to zero and hit reset and run so let me try to make my way up to their purple bunny this is a little bit more challenging than I thought it would be but good kids don't like games that aren't I go up and I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it come on come on Hedgehog yay score to one now I need to add that colon so it's score you know dashes one so let's go ahead and stop I'll go down to to title screen where my join is and add a colon there and then and now let's go ahead and instead of when down is pressed let's choose all of those to be wow and run it do you see how much smoother my Hedgehog Moves so instead of when you're pressing down up left and right go ahead and change that to wow and let's add that little colon to the score and let's go ahead and play it and there is our game super easy super fun thank you so much oh honey come along
