hello scratchers welcome back so today we are going to make a slideshow featuring one of my very favorite breeds of dogs the husky okay so we are at google and the first thing that we need to do when we are at google is type into the search bar copy right free pictures of huskies awesome sub a 700 free husky pictures and images all right awesome so this first line is usually not pixabay and they are usually copyright pictures but when we scroll down we can usually find some good copyright free pictures that then we are going to put into our scratch slides okay so the next thing that i want to do is i want to go ahead and pick out five great husky pictures and then i'm gonna save them to my desktop so i like this guy right here so i'm going to go ahead and click on him and oh look at how beautiful he is oh what a gorgeous gorgeous boy okay so i am going to go ahead and over here to the right hit free download and then i'm going to choose a smaller picture size 640 by 585 and i'm going to hit download and let's see here it's asking if i'd like to donate to the image author so i'm just going to x out of that and now we're waiting for pixabay and it says waiting for pixabay down here on the left corner of my screen okay now it's opened it up so this photo is now in my photos i want to make sure this is some place that i can find it so i'm going to go over here and i'm going to make sure it goes to my desktop so i'm going to do save as and i'm going to make a new folder that says husky i double click and instead of husky and all these numbers i'm gonna put something that describes this picture so husky face sure all right and hit save so now it's in a folder that i can find and now it is a file that i can identify okay so i'm going to go back into my pixabay pictures that i have that they have shown me that have all kinds of different husky pictures i like this picture because it's a classic um what huskies do classic working picture so i am going to go ahead and choose this with them running in their harnesses so i'll go ahead and hit free download i'm going to select a smaller size and click on download again and then i am going to go over here it pulls up my picture and this is in my photos and i have thousands of photos so i don't want to keep my husky picture there so i'm going to go to save as and i for this picture i'm going to describe it as husky pulling sled and hit save and i hit the back arrow here to go back to all of my results that i was searching for okay let's see what am i going to choose next oh i love this picture this icy picture

picture so do free download choose a smaller size hit download again then i'm going to make sure that i save as and i'm going to call this husky big train of sled dogs so i know just by reading it what it is let's see some other fun pictures oh i like a picture of this little guy right here so let's get a puppy picture so i'll choose this oh look at him he's a little fur ball then i do free download choose the smaller size download again and now i go over here do save as and this is the last little picture i want to do husky puppy hit save now i have all of the pictures that i want to use in my new scratch slideshow in a folder on my desktop called husky awesome okay so the next thing that we want to do is to open up our scratch and create a new page and i have logged in so i can share and save my work um we are just going to flip through the pictures of the huskies after we upload them and we're going to upload them as backdrops so um let's go ahead and create our very first backdrop so i am in the bottom right hand side of my page and i'm going to go to choose a backdrop and for my beginning backdrop where i'm just going to welcome people and tell people what this slideshow is all about i think i'm going to just pick something really super plain like the circles and then in the circles i'm going to go to my backdrops tab and i'm going to click inside the costume here of my backdrops and i'm going to add some text so i click on my text tool and i'm going to go ahead and choose the color red and i am going to say five husky and that's really super small so i'm going to select it i want to make it that big i'm going to make it a little bit bigger and i'll try and center it just a little bit now i still am having like a little bit of trouble seeing that so i'm going to draw a rectangle right over the husky text and i am going to push it backward so it sort of highlights my text five husky pictures okay perfect now let's go ahead and let's upload those pictures that we just got from pixabay so i go to the bottom right hand of my screen and i have several options here choose a backdrop choose a backdrop paint surprise and finally upload backdrop so that this is what we want to choose upload backdrop so i'm going to go ahead and click on it and it takes me to my downloads folder but i know what folder i really want i want to go to my desktop and i want to go to the folder that i just created for this project called husky so i double click on it and the first picture that i want to choose is husky face picture which is just this really great closeup picture all right that's awesome now um i'm going to go ahead and play with this a little bit so i sort of like the way it's looking right here in my preview screen if i wanted to i could convert it to a vector just by clicking on it and then i could select it and make it bigger i don't have to do that but if i wanted to try and just sort of um fill this screen i could do that and let me try and pull it over a little bit now i don't want to just distort the picture too much and i can't really see the top of his little ears which are so cute so i'm gonna pull it down and i've sort of made him a little wider than he needs to be so i'll just go from i'll drag from the corner and then that makes him a little bit less wide i want him to fill the picture though so i'm going to keep him like that now i'm going to go ahead and do these same steps again four more times so i go to the corner of the right hand of my screen and i go all the way up to upload a backdrop i click on it and i think i want a picture of several dogs now so i'll do this huskies pulling the sled the huskies in the harness and that's really beautiful too so i'm going to go ahead and select the convert to vector then i'm going to click on it and i'm going to pull from the corner to try and keep the proportions a little bit the way they are in the picture and i'm gonna just pull this out and then i'll center it a little bit better and beautiful oh these are great pictures okay so now i'm going to go i have three more pictures that i need to upload so bottom right hand side i go up to upload backdrop click on it now i'm going to choose husky in snow hit open it's importing it i go down here convert to vector i click on it i think i want to go ahead and stretch it i'm going to like move this over a little tiny bit because that how i um how i'm pulling it made him look too narrow so i'm gonna have him i'm gonna pull him over a little bit more perfect okay we just have two more to do so i go here i go up to upload backdrop husky big train of sled dogs open that next convert to vector i'm really going to try it um focus the picture right on the dogs so i can see their pretty faces okay one more so i go to choose a backdrop upload backdrop and this process is mode so much easier because i have all of my pictures in one folder and ready to go so there's my husky puppy hit open oops convert to vector okay there we are oh look at how cute he is he is fabulous okay terrific now so i have um a backdrop with nothing i have that i'm gonna go ahead and get rid of i have my circles backdrop and instead of it being called circles i'm going to say opening backdrop just to make everything organized then i have my husky face my dog's pulling in a harness my husky with snow in the background a big group of sled dogs and i have my little last but not least husky puppy that might be a malamute look at those brown eyes okay so i am going to go over here and i'm going to select my first five husky pictures opening uh backdrop then i'm going to go into code and now this is going to be super simple code and the code is going to be our kickoff event when green flag is clicked we're going to go ahead and switch to backdrop one backdrop so when green flag is clicked we're gonna switch to backdrop opening backdrop which is this five husky pictures then we're gonna go to the event when space key is pressed go to next backdrop okay so let's see if it works so when i press my green flag there's my opening backdrop i press my spacebar spacebar spacebar spacebar spacebar awesome okay now and then i press my green flag and go back to my five husky pictures um i want to make a couple of changes so let's go back into backdrops and in this costume i want to add something so i'm going to go to my select tool right here my select arrow and i'm going to double click in here and in between husky and pictures i'm going to put husky dog pictures and at the very top of this little opening announcement i want to go ahead and give a very simple set of directions please click spacebar to see five husky dog pictures and i'm gonna hit enter to space this out a little bit okay so i'm gonna go back to my arrow so i can select this a little bit easier i'm going to pull this up but first i'm going to go ahead and click on this black rectangle and make it bigger do and i don't like that red as much as i thought i would so maybe i'll do like a very cool blue that's a little bit icier and when i think of a husky i think of ice okay please click spacebar to see five husky dog pictures okay now i want to add to my code some music to be playing as we are looking at these beautiful dogs so i'm going to just go ahead and hit play sound until done but instead of pop i don't want pop so i am going to go ahead and go over to my bottom left hand side so i don't want pop i'm gonna go here to sounds and choose a sound in the bottom left hand side of my screen and i like all the sounds that are in dance all right let's choose dance magic okay so let's see we have one green flag is clicked switch backdrop to opening backdrop which says please click spacebar to see five husky dog pictures play sound dance magic until done when space bar is pressed go to the next backdrop all right so let's check this out awesome okay now the only thing is my music runs out before my dog pictures i'm getting done with my dog pictures so i want to just go ahead and make this a separate event so i'm going to do a forever loop on this little guy here and i'm gonna do a um
