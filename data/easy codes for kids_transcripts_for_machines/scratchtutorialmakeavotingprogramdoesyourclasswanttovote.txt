okay so let's go ahead and make a really super simple voting scratch program so when i click on this little guy he barks and the dogs get a one little vote up here and if i click on this little guy the cat gets a vote and it just go it goes up by one and then when i hover on them they move just to make things a little bit more interactive for our users and then we have like this very simple backdrop and it says please vote whom do you prefer cats or dogs please click on me to vote awesome and so the first thing that i want to do is x out of my sprite cat down here byebye and i'm going to go ahead and i am going to make a sprite so i'm going to go over here and i am going to choose sprite and then in my sprite search bar i'm going to go ahead and type dog and i'm going to grab this little puppy dog because he is adorable okay there he is now i'm gonna go into costumes so right now he has a couple of different uh costumes he has doggie right doggy sit side and sort of the back of him so i'm going to get rid of these two one two so what i want to do is when somebody is hovering on him i want him to be in one position and then when they take their mouse off he's in the next position so he's on or he's off okay so i leave these two costumes for him puppy right and puppy sit so he will have two when i'm hovering on him he'll be standing and then when i take my mouse off of him he'll be sitting okay now let's go ahead and go into sprite and create a cat sprite so i'm going to go ahead and click choose a sprite and in my search bar i'm going to hit cat cat so i think i don't want to use sprite cat i'll just use cat two and there he is i'm gonna put him right here next to you know what i'm gonna put him underneath puppy and i'm gonna move puppy up here and put kitty down here okay now i'm gonna go into i have my cat selected i'm gonna go into costumes and i am gonna go ahead and right click and duplicate my kitten okay so i am going to select my kitten and um i want to do something with the kitten so when people hover on the kitten maybe he'll turn in the diff in a different direction i guess i could have just flipped him but i'm just gonna rotate him a little bit okay so when they um when they're not or when they're selecting him and they're hovering on him he's going to look to the right hand side of the screen and when they're not hovering on him he's going to look to the lefthand side of the screen so we have sort of an on off for each the dog and the cat okay and you'll understand more as we go along all right let's do some coding so i have my puppy selected and the first thing that i want to do is i want to go to um when this sprite is clicked because it's going to be a voting game and so that is in my yellow events and it is going to be right underneath it's the third choice here when this sprite is clicked and i'll pull that over all right what happens when this sprite is clicked well we need a variable and let's go ahead into our orange variables right here and we're going to go ahead into make a variable and all we're going to do is our variable is going to be called dog vote so type in dog vote in your variable name and hit ok and all it's going to do is it is going to every time we click on a dog our dog vote is gonna go up by one and maybe we'll hear like a little barking sound and so we know that people prefer this little doggie over this little kitty okay so people are voting for the dog and not the cat or someone will vote for the cat and not the dog okay no problem so what we're going to do to make the variable actually mean something is we are going to use this change dog vote by one so every time somebody clicks this little doggy it's going to make a vote right here all right first i want it to play like a little sound though because that's always fun having sounds so let's go ahead and play sound until done oh that's a cute sound that's adorable okay now let's go ahead and so everybody every time somebody clicks on the dog you'll hear that little bark now let's go into our controls and we're going to make a forever loop so i'm going to do forever we're going to switch costume and puppy sit he's puppy sit right now and then wait until go into our control wait until and let's do a touching so when we're touching with our mouse pointer when we're touching him with our mouse pointer what what's going to happen we're going to switch his costume to puppy right and wait until it's not touching it and it's going to go back to it to puppy sit so we need another little piece of code here that says not so wait until slide this wait until not and we'll grab this touching again touching then he's going to go back to puppy sit so if we are touching puppy sit then he is gonna go to sort of um stand up and go to the right and when we're not touching him he's gonna sit so when we're not touching him he sits when we're touching him he goes up and to the right that's just what this little forever loop does okay so the forever loop what it does is when we're not touching him the puppy is sitting voila when we do touch him the puppy stands up and he's angled to the right a little bit of the screen so not touching sitting touching standing up not touching touching not touching touching awesome okay and then people are going to be voting too so if i click on him he barks and there's one more vote for the doggies but i i can hover on him and i can point to him that won't give him a doggy vote and that won't make him bark i have to click on him to hear that bark and to get the vote okay so now we want to do the exact same thing for the kitten okay and so a quick way to do this is so what i did was i sort of pulled this into my backpack and here it is in my backpack and then it which is at the bottom of my screen and then i was able to drag it into my cat okay so now i see code for my dog my puppy and my cat okay so but now the cat doesn't make any sense because it has puppy code so let's go ahead and make this make sense why is there a duplicate i'll just bloop get rid of the duplicate okay so just one all right now let's go ahead and make that variable so i go into variables make a variable and i'm going to write cat vote in the new variable name and hit ok and form i'm going to go ahead and change this to my so that means i'm going to go ahead and instead of it being a dog vote i'll change it to cat vote and that just means change cat vote by one all right so every time i click this the kitty will get a little vote right here now i don't want to play my dog sound oh fortunately there's a meow sound okay now i don't want the switch costume to puppy sit i want it to cat two and then cat three all right now let's check out what we have so if i hover he's cat two and if i take him away he should be cat three let me make sure my costumes are labeled correctly cat three cut two cat three oh i know what's happening i don't have my event okay so when this sprite is clicked when this sprite is clicked now everything should be okay okay now i'm gonna have to make sure that i put that in my directions that you actually have to click on the sprite to okay so now they're even and i can hit play and open this up and see if it works so five okay so now they're moving now i'm gonna definitely have to put in directions that you just can't sit here and hover and make a vote you actually do have to click on the sprite so i'll hit stop and let's go into the white backdrop and that's where we'll put it all right backdrops let's just add some text here and i don't want it to be purple let's make it black and please vote whom do you prefer dogs or cats okay and then i'll say please click on me to vote all right let's see if i can move this i'm going to grab my select and i'll move this like sort of down here okay and yeah i don't like it how it's like right there so i'm gonna go back to my cat and then i'll go back to my backdrop you might put it up here okay please vote whom do you prefer cats or dogs please click on me to vote okay awesome it's going up by one this is going up by one so let's go ahead and check this out so oh my
