hello scratchers welcome back to easy codes for kids okay this is lesson number two where bananas meet apple and bananas is is gonna say something to apple using our voices so we're going to record our own voices and we're going to say hey it's bananas it's so great to be a bunch of bananas or maybe you could tell a joke or sing a song or maybe you could i don't know maybe think of your own script for this okay this is coding isn't it fun isn't it easy we got this come on let's go all right so the very first thing that we want to do is we want to x out our sprite cat so that's this little guy right here so byebye okay the next thing that we want to do is we want to go down here in the right hand corner of our screen and this is where we choose a sprite so if i just hover on this little kitty icon right here it changes to the color green and then it says choose a sprite so i'm going to go ahead and click on it and i want to choose my bananas and i want to choose my apple okay so first i click on bananas and there's my sprite bananas right there then i do the same steps so i hover upon choose a sprite i click it and then i choose my apple so there is my bananas and there are there is my apple so i'm gonna move if i want to they're they're sort of like bunched together so i'm gonna go ahead and click on my bananas and i am just gonna hold him hold my mouse down and drag him over a little bit so they each have a nice distance between them okay so i just went ahead and selected and then i can move this anywhere i want but i just want it so they're sort of next to each other but not right on top of each other okay so the next thing that i want to do is for my bananas this is where my code window is right here in the middle and i am going to go ahead and choose my yellow events code and when green flag is clicked that will be my kickoff and that will start all the fun so when green flag is clicked i'm going to pick my pink sound and i am going to come over here and put play sound bite until done but i don't want to play the byte sound i'm going to go ahead and click on this little downward arrow and instead of bite i'm going to go ahead and click record now i am going to record bananas saying go bananas go go bananas to my apple now i do this by first hitting my red record button okay so let's be real quiet and then i'm gonna do it okay ready everybody shh go bananas go go bananas awesome okay let's see what it sounds like go bananas go go bananas okay i like that all right so i'm gonna go ahead and hit save awesome and instead of it be the sound being called recording one i am going to uh make the sound name go bananas okay all right now let's go ahead and go back into my code so i go into my code tab and now i want to go ahead and instead of play sound bite until done i want to select play go bananas until done now let's go ahead and test this out shall we go bananas go go bananas okay cool um so that is my banana saying go bananas go go bananas let's go ahead and do something similar for our apple so let's click on our apple sprite i can click here or i can click there and then i want to go in here i'm in my code and the first thing that i need to do is tell is to create a kickoff event so i am going to go ahead and pull over my when green flag is clicked the next thing that i want to do is i want to go ahead and create a cool sound for my apple so i go into sound and i'm going to go ahead and pull drag under when green flag is clicked place sound chomp until done now i don't you know where i'm going with this i don't want the chomp sound right i want my own voice so i'm gonna do record and then i'm not recording anything until i hit my red record button so i can tell everybody around me shh i'm gonna record so everybody has to be really quiet so i can record this okay now what i'm gonna say is yum yum yum i love apples okay so i'm gonna hit my red record button shh yum yum yum i love apples all right let's see what it it sounds like yum yum yum i love apples awesome there's a little slight delay there but it'll probably be fine so let's hit save so here we have my recording yum yum yum i love apples let's go ahead and put instead of the sound being recording one let's put apples here okay good now let's go back to our code and add it play sound apples until done awesome okay the only thing that i'm thinking is and you probably have already caught on to this is that if i press the green flag the bananas recording and the apples recording are gonna talk at the same time and i don't want that so what i want to do is let's put a little weight in there so i go into my orange control and i'm going to say when green flag is clicked wait four seconds and then play my apples recording what do you think do you think that's going to be cool all right let's go ahead and see what happens fingers crossed our timing is good go bananas go go bananas yum yum yum i love apples wow they're almost back to back that was almost perfect okay awesome now this is the end of lesson number two for us what fun sentence song poem joke can you do and then record your apple or your bananas or whatever sprite you're using to say your phrase right what can you think of i mean there's just about an endless amount of materials that you can use name your favorite books or name your favorite uh breed of dog or who is better a cat or a dog anything that you can think of that's fun that is something that you want to say you can say it with code join me for the next lesson
