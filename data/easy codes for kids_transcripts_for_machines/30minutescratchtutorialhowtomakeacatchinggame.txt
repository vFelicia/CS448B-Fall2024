hello welcome back my name is stephanie with easy codes for kids this is a scratch tutorial not for beginners and this is going to be super fun if you are just starting out go ahead and check out some of my other links that might be a little bit easier for you if you have never done scratch before if you are a scratcher and you're interested in learning this really super fun catching game well join me move ahead let's go let's do this okay this is the game we are playing today so you avoid the black baseballs and you try and catch the different colored ones under 10 seconds and get to 15 and you win pretty easy and you just use the arrow keys right and left on your keyboard to go ahead and scoop up those colorful baseballs so let's play again see if i can win i didn't win my score's only two in 10 seconds i need to get it to 15. oops so if i catch a black baseball it subtracts five from my score the colorful baseballs are all just one point whoops i'm not gonna win never say never oh no never oh no i am really not gonna win um negative six i think i did better when i was like not really trying let's play again okay this wow i am really terrible whoa and i built this game come on now come on stuff oh no oh boy that hurts oh come on steph come on oh i'm gonna win i'm gonna win yay and so it pops up you won when you get the score 15 under 10 seconds okay so 15 um points under 10 seconds that is the objective of our baseball game and it is actually pretty hard because the black baseballs are negative five and the colorful baseballs are only one and they are moving pretty quickly downward okay awesome okay so the first thing that we are going to do is we are going to get rid of scratch cat byebye so just go down here and click on this x bye and we are gonna pick a catcher sprite so down in the bottom right hand corner of my screen i hover upon choose a sprite and it's going to give me all these awesome characters to choose from so i'm going to go down here and get this gal right here so she has lots of different movements which um we are not gonna use we're just gonna have her sit there and catch and we're gonna want to move her left and right to catch the baseballs as they're floating down i just want her to go right and left so we want to say okay events when green flag is clicked let me move in a little bit when green flag is clicked we are going to go and do a little motion here and our little motion is going to be go to x so go to x and let's do let's just start her off at a position so let's do negative 30 by negative 129 so we're just starting her right there at those x and y coordinates no problem and then let's make a forever loop that makes her run back and forth in this little catching position and catch the balls as they're coming down at us so forever if we are going to say left arrow is pressed change by knit change x by negative 10 and if right arrow is pressed change by positive 10. so she's just gonna that means on the x coordinate she's going to go back and forth back and forth back and forth to try and catch these balls that are hurling down at her okay so now we need to tell her the keys so we're going to go into sensing and we're going to go ahead and put in if this key is pressed then do this so if left arrow is pressed then go into our emotion change x by 10 make sense now let's make another if if right arrow is pressed change x by 10 okay so that let's go ahead and try this out so play she's starting right down here where we told her on these x and y coordinates now let's press our left arrow okay awesome she changes by negative 10. let's press our right arrow she changes by positive 10. press press press press press press press press press press press press okay the next thing that we're going to do is let's create a baseball and let's have this uh be our negative baseball so our baseball if you click it if she catches it um our points are gonna go down and we haven't made points or timer yet but let's go ahead and make this black baseball sprite so i'm gonna go down here into my right uh bottom screen and i'm going to hit choose a sprite okay here is my baseball let me go ahead and grab that and here it is right here awesome now i the first thing i want to do is i don't want it to be a white baseball so i'm going to go into costumes and in fill i'm going to go ahead and drag this all the way over drag okay and i'm going to hit my fill bucket and i'm going to do click click okay so now this guy is black awesome now i'm going to go into code let's give him some life the first thing that i want to do is say oh go into my events when green flag is clicked i want to forever change his position so that's the very first thing that we're going to grab so i go into control make a forever loop because this game is just going to go on and on forever and ever all right so the first thing that i wanted him to do is i want him to start coming down so this is x moving side to side that's what our our catcher does move side to side and x and our baseball moves down in a y coordinate x y x y fabulous okay so let's go into our motion and let's look for y change y change y by change y by let's start off with negative nine so pretty quickly this ball is going to move down it's gonna go down very quickly actually negative nine is going to make it hurled down from space awesome but we can't just leave it at that we have to do an if statement saying go to a random position so the ball is always changing okay so let's do if statement because we want the ball to fly down at us randomly so we never know where it's going to land if y position y position y position if y position so if we need actually we need to get an operator here all right let's get greater than okay so if y position so this means if y position is greater than or less than if y position is less than negative 170 then we're going to go to random position put this right here okay so that's how fast it's going to fly down if y position is less than negative 170 then we want it to go to random position and then go to positive 180 okay so let's go ahead and hit random position because we want this ball to fly down any old way that it wants to go so we're always surprised by it because that's the fun of the game and then we want it to set it to 180. all right so let's see you'll see you'll see all right 180. okay awesome let's go ahead and try this out okay so see how it's coming down quickly that's that negative 9 and see how it is only coming down on the yaxis awesome because this is y and this is x and this is y and this is x and then it's going to random position it's looping because it's in a forever loop and then it's setting to 180 so it is resetting itself all the time and then running to a negative or running to a random position now we want to go ahead and set up a point system so that when our catcher touches it something happens and i think that something should be negative points right because we don't want to catch this baseball and i think that we should also make a sound and that's it just we just need to add those two things sound and negative points okay awesome okay so we have our baseball that is coming down and our gal that is going our catcher that is going right and left so let's go ahead and actually add something fun and make this actually into a game so we're going to do an if then statement if the black baseball touches the catcher then we're going to play a sound and then we're going to change the score so we're going to make a variable called score and then the baseball is going to go to a random position okay easy easy easy easy okay so let's the first thing that we want to do is go to variable and then we want to go to make a variable and the variable name is just going to be score and hit ok and all right so we created a variable a variable called score and it's right here it's already showing showing up in our game now let's go ahead and create another ifthen statement so let's go into our controls and let's go into if then and drag it underneath our first ifthen statement now we need a sensing block and the sensing block is going to say if something is touching the catcher then this so let's grab this guy right here put him right here if something is touching the catcher then what is going to happen well a couple of things we want a sound to play we want the score to change and then we want we want the black baseball to go to a random position so our game is fun okay so first things first let's go to a sound and instead of pop let's go to into our sounds and see what else we can find so come up here and hit this x we don't want the pop sound we want something more fun so go down here in your bottom left and hit choose a sound and i already have a sound in mind it's called bass beat box and listen to it so it sort of is like a like not such a great sound and you don't want a good sound because it's not a good thing when you catch the black baseball not a good thing it's going to be a negative point system with the black baseball this is going to be a penalty okay so if our ball is touching the catcher then we want to play the bass beat box until done and then we want to change the score so go into variables and look for change and it's going to be change my variable by 1. so my variable score is going to be negative 5. so you're penalized when you catch this black baseball okay then the next thing we want the baseball to do is to go ahead and go to a random position so let's go ahead into the blue motion and gather our random position we want the game to continue to play and we'll set y by 180. so set y to 180. so it goes back to a good position and the game keeps playing so let's go ahead and see what happens when we hit play but and the change the score changed negative 10 oops i missed that one negative 15 negative 20. how fast i am with my counting by fives i'm fabulous okay so the next thing that we want to do is let's go ahead and create some colorful baseballs we'll just create one and then we'll go ahead and duplicate them so we don't have to do the same work over and over again so down here in our sprite window at the bottom right go ahead and click choose a sprite okay now let's go ahead and choose baseball and there's another baseball right there awesome okay so i'm going to run through this code again and it's basically the same code as the black baseball except we want the points to go up and we want a different sound okay so i'm gonna go ahead and try and zoom in a little bit okay so the first thing that we want to do is click our events and we're going to go ahead and grab when flag is clicked let's grab a forever loop which will um loop around everything because we want this game to go on and on forever ever and ever and ever okay the first thing that we want to do is we want to decide how fast do we want this baseball to float downward so let's go ahead and make it pretty quick so let's go ahead and do y change y by negative eight so right here change x by whoops we don't want change x by change y because we want it to fall downward by negative eight and that's going to make it go pretty fast now we're going to put an iffense statement to make it keep moving correctly so let's go into whoops control and we're going to do if then underneath that change negative 8 if y position is less than negative 170 then go to random position and set y to 180. so that just means when it scrolls down we want it to scroll back up again and go down and up and down and up in a random sequence so it actually is a fun game oh okay so we need an operator and we're going to do less than i was calling this greater than it's less than and we're going to do y position which i think is not sensing it is in our motion it's down here i saw it get over here y position woohoo negative it's negative 170 what should we do we're going to go to random position and then set y to 180. so we'll go into our motion again this is like my favorite block ever go to random position and then set y by 180. so this is just telling the white baseball how to move now if the catcher catches the white baseball what is going to happen so we need another if statement let's go into our controls and we're going to grab this if then statement and put it right underneath our first ifthen statement okay so if we need something sensing now if touching the catcher then what happens so sensing so not mouse pointer but if touching catcher then we want a sound we want to change the score then we want it to go to random position and keep falling downward again okay so let's go to sounds now we have that funky sound for the black baseball but we don't want that sound nor do we want this pop sound i want a chomp sound so i get rid of that first pop sound then i go down bottom left hand corner and click on choose a sound okay and chomp oh that's a cool one all right let's go ahead and click on that one now go back into our code and go ahead and put play chomp until done and then change score so we're going to go ahead and go into variables and change my variable so instead of my variable let's go ahead and change it and actually we can leave it by one so change score by one that means every time this little gal catches a white baseball or any of the baseballs that we're going to make that are different colors the score is going to go up by one now i'd like to also throw in here a motion that makes the baseballs more fun to watch so let's go ahead and do a turning motion and then we'll go ahead and reset it so it comes back up and goes to a random position so let's first let's turn okay so turn by 90 degrees we'll turn to the left and then we're going to set y to 180 again so it goes up and then it'll come down and it will come down in a weird random position and we'll have no idea and it'll actually be a fun game okay awesome so let's try it out all right so it's moving a little slowly that's okay i have to figure that out why it's moving too slowly but i think the score is working let's see all right so it's making that chomp sound and it's um setting our score changing our score by one in a positive direction and um is it turning it's not turning though i'll have to figure out why it's not turning i'm going to go ahead and take this turn out then and i think i know what the problem is i'm going to go ahead and change set y right there back to 180 and all i did was take that rotation out because i'm going to go ahead and put that tack that on at the end okay awesome okay so let's go ahead and make two backdrops as our next step two backdrops so i go into the bottom right hand of my screen into my backdrops area and i'm gonna go ahead and click choose a backdrop and for my first backdrop i'm just going to go ahead and choose blue sky and there's my lovely blue sky now i'm going to go to my costumes tab because i want to add some directions i'm gonna click my blue sky um i wanna add some directions to my blue sky okay so i want to say how to basically play my game and so i'm going to go ahead and hit my text button there and i am going to choose my color my text color is black and i'm going to sort of start over a little bit towards the middle and i'm going to write high catchers exclamation point you have only 10 seconds to catch 15 baseballs okay the next thing that we're gonna write is warning don't catch the black baseballs now so this is gonna be a nice little um piece of directions for everybody playing our game so high catchers you have only 10 seconds to catch 15 baseballs warning don't catch the black baseballs in my black background i'm going to add game over press green flag to play again you okay this is a preview of the next thing that we are doing which is creating a sprite called u1 so sprite name u1 so this is just a little bit of a preview of u1 because this is a very important part of our game so we are going to basically with the yuan sprite when the green flag is clicked we're going to hide everything and we're going to switch the backdrop of blue sky then we're going to set the score to zero and set the timer to zero then in a forever loop we are going to change the timer and it's going to go it's just going to give us 10 seconds when it hits 10 seconds our backdrop is going to switch to black and then we have a little piece of our score over here as well so when green flag is clicked if the score is less than 14 or greater than 14 it's going to show this u1 sprite and then it's going to stop everything else okay awesome now let's go ahead and create that piece by piece okay so let's go down here we're going to go ahead and create that very important you want sprite so go down here into choose a sprite into choose a sprite and let's just go ahead and click on paint and so we're going to go ahead and use our text in black to say you won exclamation point we'll put it right in the middle see that little cross here we're going to sort of drag it right in the middle there okay now let's go into the code and the first thing that we want to do is go to events when green flag is clicked we are going to hide a backdrop hide don't come out until we tell you when to come out and then we're going to switch backdrop to not black but blue sky okay then we're going to set our score to zero okay and we have to set our timer to zero so we don't have a timer yet so let's go ahead and make a variable called timer and hit ok and so we want to go here instead of instead of set my variable set timer and we're going to tell the timer what to do in just a second all right the next thing that we want to do is grab a forever loop now we want to start a weight game and our weight is going to tell us what to do as far as timing is concerned so wait one second then we're going to change the timer so back into our variables change timer i think you know where we're going with this change timer by one so this one second will make our chimer change by one okay all right now we want to add another wait one second after our change timer by one and then we are going to add a forever and then we're going to add an if then statement about the timer all right so let's go into our apparatus and let's pick this equal can you see where we're going see where we're driving yet okay so let's do if our timer equals 10 and guess what times up we're going to switch to our backdrop that we just made which is black because the game is over and it says game over on our black backdrop then we're going to stop everything we're going to go to variables oh i'm sorry we're going to go to control and we're going to stop all of our events okay so we have hide when the green flag is clicked so everything is hidden except the blue sky we set our timer or excuse me we set our score to zero and then we set our timer to zero in this forever loop we have wait a second then change timer by one then wait a second now it's gonna so that's going to give our contestants our game players um a timer countdown and the timer is gonna go from zero to one two three four five six seven eight nine and when it reaches ten it's going to switch the backdrop to black which says game over and then it's gonna say stop all okay now we want to do one more thing and that is we are going to add our score so let's go into events and when green flag is clicked let's do a forever loop here forever and ever and ever forever forever is a long time let's do an if then we need an operator in a greater than so we're gonna do if the score is greater than 14 you won i just let the cat out of the bag i know it's so suspenseful to see what i'm gonna do next if score is greater than 14 then show this little sprite you won right and then stop all and give the people a chance to play again if they dare so let's play oh i accidentally put a bow tie in there what the heck all right four score seems to be working and i'm just terrible i am just not winning at all okay come on come on win win win win win i only have oh i am not gonna win definitely not gonna win game over yay oh why am i cheering i lost but game over worked yay okay the next thing that i want to do is i want to make more baseballs so our game actually becomes pretty competitive so i go here to baseball two and i right click and i hit duplicate and the first thing that i want to do with baseball number three is i'm going to turn it red so i'm going to go to my fill bucket and go ahead and click on turn my color red deep red and click to make it red awesome now i don't want the exact same code in my black baseball as in or in my white baseball as in my red baseball so let's go over into the code of the red baseball and this has been duplicated it's the exact same thing that is in the white baseball so let's go ahead and change that up a little bit so instead of change y you zoom in a little bit instead of change y by negative eight let's make it go a little slower so change y by negative four and if it's catching if it's touching the catcher it will play the chomp sound change the score by one and we'll set y to it will go back to 180. okay perfect that looks pretty good all right let's go ahead and rightclick and duplicate this guy first thing we want to do is change his color let's go into the fill bucket and let's move a little bit over more into the orange awesome oops i changed one of his little stitches that's okay let's go into the code and instead of change y by negative 4 let's do change y by negative 5. let's duplicate him let's make this guy yellow so go into costumes fill bucket moving on over awesome perfect oh you can see the little orange stitch okay and let's do a pink baseball so you know the drill right click duplicate oh wait let's go back into code here instead of change by negative five let's do change by negative three okay right click duplicate instead of change by negative three let's do change by negative nine so that'll go super fast costumes and let's make this guy yellow or instead of yellow let's make this guy pink it's like more like a fuchsia awesome okay so we have one two three four five good baseballs one bad baseball let's go ahead and click on our bad baseball and right click and duplicate our bad baseball awesome so we have two bad baseballs that are coming down towards our catcher and one two three four five good ones so five ones five good baseballs that will give us points and two bad baseballs that will subtract points and let's check our code on this bad baseball here yep and his score is going to be negative five awesome so let's stop and play our game come on you can do this you're gonna win just get more then you do you're gonna do it you're won yay good job thank you you're welcome
