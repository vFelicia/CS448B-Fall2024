okay so here we are on the scratch page so the first thing i'm going to do is go over here to create and create a new project for our dancing dino project dancing dinosaurs dancing dinosaurs dancing dinosaurs that's sort of a little tongue twister dancing dinosaurs dancing dancing dinosaurs dancing dinos okay so we want to get rid of this guy bye bye and we want to go down here and we want to click choose a sprite now we are going to pick a dinosaur sprite that has four different costumes so when we run through his costumes it's going to look as if he's moving and dancing yay okay so up here in our search we are going to click d dinosaur dinosaur and let's go ahead and choose this guy so when i hover over him i can see that he is moving fabulous so i put him right there now i'm going to put all the code in this guy and then i'm going to right click and duplicate two more of him so it looks as if there are three dinos dancing so the first thing i am going to do though is i'm going to put a little code in him so i am going to go over here to code and go to events and then i'm going to drag over one green flag is clicked then i'm going to go to control and i'm going to drag over forever then i'm going to go to looks and i'm going to do switch costume to a i just like to go a b c d now if i do a b c d all in a row it will move so fast that my audience won't see him moving and dancing so i have to put some weights in there so i go to control and wait now if i do one second if i do one second let me go in here a little bit if i do one second the dinosaur um switching the different movements is going to be way too slow and it's going to look really bumpy so instead of wait one second i'm going to put weight 0.3 seconds okay and then i'm going to go up here and i'm going to hit i'm going to right click right here and i'm going to do duplicate and then i'm going to put that block again right below my first block but instead of switch costume to dinosaur a i'm going to switch it to b okay so you see what i did there and he's already moving for me he's already shaking his tail feather right okay so i want to go ahead and right here hover and then right click with my mouse or my keypad and hit duplicate and then drag that underneath and looky there now he's kicking his little leg fabulous i'm gonna click out and i'm gonna hover over dinosaur b and choose that dinosaur c and we have one more costume to choose from and i can tell that because one two three four different looks so i hover over c right click hit duplicate put it right there and instead of c i choose d so i have a b c d and look at him go oh look how cute he looks when he's dancing fabulous okay now um i am going to come over here and right click and hit duplicate so now i have two of them and they're sort of on top of each other so i'm going to move the next one right there now i'm going to go right here right click duplicate and there's my third one so i'm going to put them over here okay so now all of them have the capability of looking like this dancing guy i just have to put some code behind them so i go to dinosaur two okay now all of them are able to dance and kick their legs and open their mouths because they all have the same code so they can all be dancing to the same little song now the next thing i want to do is i want to put in a nice backdrop so i go over here to backdrop in my bottom right hand corner of my screen i click choose a backdrop and in my search bar i'm going to put dance and it brings up this spotlight background so i'm going to go ahead and click on that and this is sort of like a runway and here are some chairs and here's some speakers there's the spotlight and different lights that it's you know sort of like we're pretending can go into this stage so i'm gonna bring the dinosaurs i'm gonna spread them out a little bit one dinosaur is gonna be like on a little platform here and then they're all going to be dancing fabulous fabulous now everything looks really good but we're missing one important piece of this and that is our sounds so i'm going to have a sound run through the entire piece okay so the very last piece of code that we need to put into our dinos dancing is the sound so um this um dino dancing already this project already came with the pop sound which is just this let's put that up so you can hear it okay so it's just like a little pop sound so we're going to get rid of that because we want a nice dance beat for them to dance to so in the bottom left hand corner of our screen go ahead and click choose a sound and in the search bar let's go ahead and type dance and let's fool around with these a little bit so let's listen i like that one that one's a little funky let's see what this one is let's go ahead and choose dance around okay so here it is in our in our sounds so let's go back into our code and it doesn't matter which of the dinosaurs codes that we choose what we want to do is we want to say hey when these guys when the green flag is clicked start playing the song the dinosaurs will start moving when the green flag is clicked and forever they're going to be switching through their costumes and making it look as if they're dancing so the same concept we need for our music so when green flag is clicked go to sound and let's do play sound until done which is fine but the dinos are going to be dancing forever so maybe we need a forever in there to match so i go to my orange control i'll grab my um forever i'm going to go ahead and put my forever here so we have our sound actually matching our costume changing so forever our dinosaurs are going to be switching through their costumes and quoteunquote dancing and forever our song is going to be playing so let's go ahead and full screen and play you
