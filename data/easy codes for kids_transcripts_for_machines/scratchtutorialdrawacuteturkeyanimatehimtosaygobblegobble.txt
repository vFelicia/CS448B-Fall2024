okay so the first thing that i did was i opened scratch and i'm creating a little vector drawing of this cute little turkey i drew out this turkey and then i made him in microsoft paint and then i uploaded him to scratch and i'm just gonna put him in the corner here and um use him as a little model for what we're creating okay so i've drawn this circle and it is a an orangish brownish fill with a black outline and size four i guess is the outline thickness and let's go ahead and draw this cute little turkey's feathers i'll go ahead and go in a little bit and i've drawn one line now i'm going to go ahead and put some points on this line so it's sort of towards the top there's an extra point i'm going to give him some little turkey feathers that are going to surround his big body so that's sort of how i want it so i go ahead and select it then copy and paste and whoops get rid of that guy delete okay so i'm gonna go ahead and flip him to where i want him and i'm gonna play around with this and then just go ahead and grab the end and rotate until i make his feather the two points meet at the top and so there's my nice little black outline of my turkey and i'm gonna group those together and i'm going to hit copy and paste and i'll make a smaller one to lay inside of the outside one and i'm going to color then color them differently so the first one i'm going to fill i'm going to go ahead and select it since it's grouped and i'm going to fill it with a brownish color so i use my color wheel and i just pick out a nice little brown color then i go ahead and select the one that is in the feather that is in back and i'll make that bright red and now just to add a little depth i am going to make a little bit of a darker shade of red and let me go ahead and magnify and then with my paintbrush just fill in a little corner of that feather just to make it look a little bit more fun i select it and i'm going to go ahead and put that a little bit towards that little piece a little bit towards the back so the outline is showing and then i went ahead and grouped the entire feather and put it toward the back so his little fat turkey body is way in front so now i'm going to go ahead and pull with that little darker red piece and make sure that i can see my outline okay so i have my turkey feather looking really super cute and i have two little colors on it red and a dark darker red to add a little bit of depth his body is a little big so i'm going to pull it in and i make sure that feather is in the back and i'm just sort of customizing it to where i like it and now i am going to go ahead and select the entire feather and i'm going to hit copy and paste and move it over to the other side and then flip horizontal make sure you're in your vector setting when you're doing this and then i'm going to go ahead and put that towards the back so it's looking pretty cute right now so now he's a big fat turkey body with two feathers so i go ahead and select another feather hit copy paste i'll move that one up a little bit put it to the back and sort of resize it just the way i want and for this guy i'm going to rotate him a little bit and then i'm going to choose different colors and i'm going to do a yellow with a a light yellow so there's a nice yellow shade and then for that little piece i am going to make a lighter yellow shade and then i am going to go ahead and just do copy paste for the rest of the feathers okay so now let's go ahead and draw the little turkey body so he's more of an oval shape and i'm gonna put on a lighter color brown for his body just to give him a little bit of depth and shade and i put that right in the back and i'm going to go ahead and sort of make these feathers towards his body a little bit bigger and then i'm going to draw some little feathers on his chest oh cute and they can be like a little bit funky and then i go ahead and select them copy paste and pull the second set down now let's make one eye and it's just completely big and black and let's do copy paste and make the second eye they're pretty close together and let me make him a little bit his body a little thinner his bottom feathers a little bit fatter and now i'm just going to select the line tool let's make that a little thicker make a line tool that is just straight down from the body and then i'm going to use my points tool and pull it out and there's his little wing fabulous and now i'll just do copy and paste flip horizontal and bring that back over to the other side and now let's do his little feet same thing make a line add a little point in the middle pull that up copy paste make sure i can flip it horizontal pull it over to the other side these are just like little claw feet nothing special copy paste flip vertical rotate it a little bit pull it up so they meet each other fantastic copy paste and after i copy paste then i'm going to go ahead and sort of like move that little those little lines until i get them just the way i want to and bring over the other guy oh cute make sure they meet up now i'd like to make a couple little circles for his eyes little white circles that make like little reflection points and just give him a little bit more life so i make one then i do copy and paste just to make sure that they are the exact same size now on my model on my original drawing i have two little circles in one eye and one circle and one little heart in the other eye but i don't think i'm gonna do that here okay let me um keep going on his wing here so i'm gonna go ahead and actually let's go ahead and finish those eyes let's go ahead and finish and fill his wing in with black so when we move his wing and animate it it looks as one piece and so we do that by adding a nice thick line to that elbow and then grouping all the pieces together so i hit my shift key on my keyboard i group the pieces and then i have a a nice one piece and then i can go to my fill bucket and fill with black fun and then i'll go ahead and do the same thing for the other wing and the feet okay so let's go ahead and make one of the most important features on our little guy which is his mouth so i want to use my line tool and i'm just going to make a straight line and then it's sort of like an upside down triangle and i'm going to add some points to make it not so sharp looking so my upside down triangle is going to have more rounded edges than sharp edges and when i have it all connected i am going to turn it like a a little orangish color just to make him super cute okay let's go ahead and draw his little gobbley wobbly thing over his nose that sort of hangs off of turkey's faces so i selected the square piece and then added my points with my using my little point tool and i'm just gonna shape it um like a it's sort of like a sideways v and i'm just going to keep adding little points until i get it to sort of hang off of his mouth now it's looking more like a little worm so i'm just adding points where i need to and then i'm going to go ahead and delete some points if i don't like them and i turn it red and i do like the outline there not like a really super thick outline and again i'm going to delete some points if i don't like them and i just do that by selecting on the point and then just hitting delete and i'm just going to move it it definitely looks like a little worm and it's sort of just hanging on the side of his nose looking super cute so now i'm going to go ahead and add some color using my square again and the same color from his little oval body so i add a square and then add points to it and now i'm just going to like shape it to the top sort of left corner of his head just to give my picture like a little depth i like doing shading it's the same type of shading that we did with his little feathers in the corner we just did like a darker red and a lighter yellow and so we're going to do like this little half moon shape that is going to go um on the top of the corner of his little head and i do two different colors a little bit lighter shades again to give him some nice depth and make him look more realistic a realistic cartoon turkey yes that's what we're going for now i'm going to add a little bit of that lighter shade underneath his chin underneath his big head basically on his little the top of his little oval body and i just do that all right so we have our cute little turkey he is just fabulous looking let's go ahead and add some code and our farm background in scratch so he um can make a gobbley sound that we upload from freesounds.org okay this is our end oh look how cute he is this is gobbly gobbley let's do oh my gosh so cute okay so let's go back and see how we're doing this okay so after we have our little turkey looking super cute the way we want him to we go into our backdrops and we upload the farm backdrop right here so it's perfect perfect colors fantastic love him so much now we go into our cute turkey and i've made a bunch of duplicates of him how many duplicates 29 duplicates each of them slightly different so in this these first duplicates i am just moving his eyes a teeny weeny little bit so i select his eyes and then with my um mouse i just drag them over or you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard then i am making duplicates with his mouth slightly open now let's check out the code that i'm using okay so very very very simple code and i will link this project in my description so when green flag is clicked i make sure that he's at x and y zero coordinates i set his size to a hundred percent i clear all my graphic effects i switch his costume to cute turkey too which is my very first costume right here cute turkey tube i don't know why i named it that and i show him then i wait point one second and i have a repeat going so costume number until 29 so you're gonna do however many costumes you have i have 29 so it repeats until it hits that very last costume which is mine is 29 and then it goes to the next costume until it re until it hits that 29 and then in a separate just to make it super super easy when green flag is clicked i have my gobbly turkey until done which is i just got that from freesounds.org and i just went ahead and looked up turkey okay and let's go ahead and play it again i sort of matched it up to how long my gobbly is fabulous super easy happy
