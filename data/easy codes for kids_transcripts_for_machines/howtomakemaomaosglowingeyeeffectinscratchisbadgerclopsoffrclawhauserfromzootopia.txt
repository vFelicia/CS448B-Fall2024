i love any scene with maumel's eyes i especially love his glowing eyes so does mega rasa have a slythering ooh let's try that again mega rhino hoffa sniggering better moving on better moving on lego batman's best scenes with joker are all about the eyes speaking of is it me or do lego batman and mao mao look a lot alike and badger clubs my absolute favorite cyborg armed badger reminds me a lot a lot of zootopia love love love zootopia officer clowhauser come on do you see it come on cut out meow meow do you see the comparison come on cut out mel mel you know you see it okay let's go watch some eyes glowing and then let's check out how we can make glowing eyes in scratch fabulous so here we see the code that i used for making mao mao's eyes follow a mouse pointer and thereby glow this would be a very simple effect to capture in a screen capture that you could make his eyes look like laser beams or look really powerful as they're glaring at his opponent or cut across the screen really quickly as if he is like throwing blasts from them your imagination can do a thousand different things with this really cool ghost effect and that's all it is i'm just repeating a ghost effect and then i am deleting the clone so it does not slow down the animation and let's go ahead and check out some more effects let's go to our color effect oh i love this look at all those fantastic colors and we're just changing within a radius of 10 so if you want to change that effect by 20 i'm assuming you'll get all the colors in the rainbow i hope somebody checks that out i think one of my students did that and got all the colors all right let's change it to fisheye which just sort of elongates it um and makes it like clump which is really cool i like that let's change it to this little swirly whirl swirl look at that this is lots of fun just to like play with this is super fun i want to change the shape too let's do pixelate which is always going to be these fun little boxes a pixel is just a little square in and of itself so going all around with the pixelation let's change it to oh mosaic look at these tiny little boxes i love this it's so much fun this is one of my students favorites everybody loves the pixelate and if you can combine the color in the pixelate that's super fun and this is brightness so you can see it's changing all of those different shades of that green which is nice and then finally back to ghost which is what i used to create sort of like the laser beams coming out of his eyes fabulous and thank you so much to our amazing content creators and actors i just love these guys so much they're incredibly talented thank you thank you thank you you
