it's almost christmas let's draw a super cute grinch in scratch okay so i am in my vector setting in scratch and i've picked this fun little drawing that i did in a paint editor and i put it right in the corner so it can be our little example that we are using and i'm picking this nice lime it's sort of like an ugly lime color for the grinch because he is sort of a villainous character at least at the beginning of the grinch movies so the first thing that i'm going to do is i am just going to draw a bunch of shapes without an outline so i'm going to draw a circle and then a sideways oval and then a little rectangle then for his belly another oval and for his legs i'm going to draw a series of just nice little rectangles and i'm going to go ahead and fool around with the shapes a little bit move them the way i like them again there's no outline color it's just this lime green color now let's get a closer look of him and let's see what we can add first so the first thing that i'm going to tackle is the bottom of his belly i'm going to pull up and then using my points i'm going to sort of make shoulders and the side of his stomach come in a little bit now i'm going to do the shape for his arms which is just a little rectangle i have a couple of rectangles that i'm just going to put together so he's sort of looking like he's in a stance where he has his hands on his little fat belly and there's just a little block for his um hand and i'm continuing to just use my points to um sort of slim him down so he's gonna have like a big torso a big belly area and then really thin little limbs okay so i make a little um mouth for him and it's the thickness um it's black and thickness too then i'm gonna go ahead and add a little circle where i want his chin and i'm adding little pieces for his mouth where his little evil grin is going to be so i add a straight line and then i add so i add a straight line and then i add extra points then i copy and paste them and put them to the other side i flip them horizontal too flip this little line horizontal so i get its exact match now you don't have to be matchymatchy now with the now with the head i'm gonna add more points and i'm gonna bring it up a little bit my outline i'm gonna start outlining everything in black thickness two now i group the head pieces together and i'm going to try and hide them a little bit by ungrouping and then moving forward and backward i'm going to bring his the bottom piece of his face up a little bit and i'm not going to be super concerned about what the top of his head is gonna look like because i'm gonna delete it so i delete that circle that was just a placer that was just a place mark for me to understand where his little hat was gonna go so now i add a little crinkle in his face and that just makes um a more definition and i'm going to add a little bit more to his smile his smile can be crooked he is sort of again like this evil character so he can have more of an evil smile right now this is before of course he turns super good and saves christmas so let's go ahead and start drawing his eyes i just drew a circle and then i'm going to make several points at the top of my circle and at the bottom of my circle and when i get it to be sort of like um more squarish on the bottom i'm going to fool around i'm going to have a topdown gradient color and then i'm gonna have the colors the two colors be sort of a brownish on top and a whitish on bottom and i just fool around with the colors until i get them just the way i like them and i only have to do one eye because i'm going to copy and paste it to the other side so now i'm going to go ahead and just get little white circles and those will be like my reflection points in my eyes and i do two of them now i'm going to go ahead and make a size 2 little crease in his eye and i'm pretty much done with his eye now i'm going to go ahead and get all my pieces i think there are four pieces i group them copy paste and then flip them horizontal to the other side now he's looking really happy so let's go ahead and put some little naughty eyebrows on him just using our line tool and one little point in the middle so i get a good one then i copy paste flip horizontal and put it to the other side now i'm working with his chin i put it to the back and then using my points tool i'm just gonna go ahead and fool around with his face a little bit more and i made the bottom of his chin stick out a little bit in a point and then i went ahead and made his outline a three on his face i'm gonna keep his smile at two and i bring his little nose down and i'm going to bring a little mouth piece down and then put his nose in front there there we go and i bring his little creases for his face down and i can use the arrow keys on my keyboard just to move the little pieces that i like very very slowly and get them just the way i want them so now he's looking a little bit more knotty okay let's go ahead and try and do his hat so i'm in my brush tool size five black and i'm making hit little curlicues all over the bottom of his head and then the top of his head and i made some little accent marks in there i might keep those i might not and then now with my line tool i did use my brush and i didn't like it so go ahead and use your line tool to make his hat and i just made like a nice curl at the top and then i'm going to make a size 4 or size 5 outline for this line for his hat and i have one like almost upside down v and then one piece that is just almost straight up and then connected to that last point on his hat so it's sort of a slouchy santa hat and it's like sort of cocked to the side now i like to go ahead and just use my brush tool and fill everything in in white for the fluff part but you can use the circle tool and just add extra points and fill it in that way too but i like to paint and you don't have to be very um real super careful with this because you can always pull your outline in front because you made it a separate piece and so i'm just coloring coloring white get all his little pieces down and now i'm going to go ahead and group his hat and i make a bottom so i get those nice three pieces and then i can turn it red and now i'm going to go ahead and move it so it's a little bit less to the side and pull it down so you can see the fluff part instead of that straight line now i'm going to go ahead and move my outline of my fluff part to the front and it can be uneven it's supposed to be like slouchy looking and sort of uneven and i make a little slouchy mark in the corner of the top of his hat so it looks as if it is really angled downwards like you'd have a natural wrinkle there and now i'm going to draw the fluff part um of his hat the end of his hat the tip of it and again i'm just going to go ahead and use my paint tool to just paint it white and i don't have to worry about being perfect because i can go ahead and grab i made a little white reflection point in his hat as well and now i'm going to go ahead and make a little accent point in his white fluff but i can go ahead and grab any of those outlines i want and pull them to the front perfect oh he's looking very evil isn't he let's go ahead and outline his body now i think i'm outlining it in two or three just black i'm going to go ahead and put that arm piece to the back so his belly sticks out and i'm going to adjust the arm he has real skinny little arms or at least in my head he has very skinny little limbs and a bigger belly so i'm going to make him a little fun here i put his points over and just connect that little arm piece and i can go ahead and delete any of the blocks that i made at first because those were just placers those were just fun little reference points that we had oh his arm is looking more like an arm i might even give it like a little bit more shoulder here he's supposed to have sort of weak shoulders so that's why they sort of droop down instead of sticking out okay now i'm going to go ahead and use that marker that block that i have and i'm just going to use my points and draw out like a little point for his fingers i'm not worried about fingers i'm not going to define fingers i just have one little point and i make his wrist thin and it's to the back because he has his hand on his hip there okay now i'm going to go ahead and grab that leg block and i will make it give it some extra points and make it thin and i'm looking anytime i'm not real sure where i'm going i just look at the original drawing that i did and then that gives me sort of an angle now his feet i want to sort of be like a funny shape so he has like an arch in the middle of his foot he has like no distinguishable toes or anything and his heel comes down and there's like an arch and when i like it it's a simple simple leg there's his little knee when i like it i just copy paste flip horizontal and then i'm going to put it back a little bit further so it doesn't exactly match and the arm doesn't exactly match the other arm so they're back a little bit more they're higher on one side than the other just it just makes it a little bit more realistic let's go ahead and work on his body i want him to be plump around the middle but not too plump so i just add extra points to his torso now i give him like a little belly button thing little belly button line it does not have to be perfect now let's go ahead and use our line tool and i'm going to get a series of v's upside down v's and i'm gonna make his little like fun little scruff that i i'm gonna do it in an outline thickness of two and then i'm gonna go ahead and color it a darker olive so if when i get these points that i like i'm just going to copy and paste them because why do extra work when you have copy and paste that's the beautiful thing about computers okay so i'm going to turn that i'm going to get these points i'm going to use shift key copy paste after i've grouped them and then i flip horizontal and then i'll just make some lines to meet up in the middle where i'm missing some okay now i'm going to use my select tool and i'm going to select all of them and then group them and i can try and use my fill a little bit it'll fill it a little bit and then all i have to do is add a circle in the middle and just fool around with extra points in the circle and give it no outline so you see the points outline and i select everything and turn it like a booger shade like a dark yucky greenish same type of shade of his skin except darker because he remember he is an evil character until he turns good we're not supposed to like be in love with him he's supposed to be sort of like this scary monstery type of person creature so now i'm just fooling around with my with my points and i get everything the way i like it and then i hit group and i pull it over voila we're done
