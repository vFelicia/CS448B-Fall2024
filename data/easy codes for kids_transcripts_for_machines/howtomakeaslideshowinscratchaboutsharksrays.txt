let's learn about sharks and rays using scratch first let's gather our pictures from pixabay then we'll build our code in scratch finally we'll educate people to help save these beautiful sharks and rays so so the first thing that we need to do is to create a new folder on our desktops named sharks and rays so here i am on my desktop and i am going to right click go down to new select folder and type in sharks and rays step two let's go to google and in this search bar let's type pixabay pixabay pixabay is a great resource for grabbing copyright free photos we'll use these in our photo montage of sharks and rays so i see right here pixabay 1.8 million stunning free images to use anywhere let's go ahead and click on it now all of these are not copyright free and i'm going to show you how to determine which ones we can use and which ones we can't so in the search bar go ahead and type shark and then hit this little guy right here the first row of images that we see are not copyright free these are sponsored images and that means that we have to pay for them so we don't want to select any of those the first image that we want to select is a sawfish which is a rey and it's really super cool it has a huge snout that has little spikes on it like a hedge trimmer so it has little teeth on it all coming out right here you can see them a little bit right here so i click on this and now i go over here to my free download and click on free download and then click on download again our sawfish photo is now in our downloads folder so we don't want it to just sit there we want it to actually live in our sharks and rays folder that we created just for this scratch project so i am going to go ahead and click on the little box next to my picture of my sawfish and i am going to use my home tab and i'm going to hit copy and then i'm going to go to my desktop and find that new folder that we just created so there it is sharks and rays i'm going to go home again and click paste now instead of this being named a random name from pixabay i am going to call this sawfish and all i did to rename it was just click on it so if i click on it lightly i can rename it okay step four let's select and download more sharks and raise pictures so i am here i've just downloaded my sawfish and i am just going to go up here to my back arrow and it takes me back into my search results for sharks and i'm going to go ahead and grab a couple of more pictures that i want to put into our awesome slideshow so let's grab this great white shark picture and let's go over here and click free download and then download and now i can see at the bottom of my screen it's gone into my download folder and i'll move that in a minute so i go back to my back arrow and it gives me my results again and let's see let's pick some different types of photos i like this great white photo i click free download download sometimes it will open the picture that you've downloaded and that's fine i just go back to my browser and go hit my back arrow there are some great pictures that we can choose i like this hammerhead picture i click free download download again use my back arrow oh i like this picture predownload download again oh he's scary when you see his teeth go back to my browser hit back okay i'm going to go up here because i want to get some pictures of rays now so in pixabay i want to go ahead and type manta rays try and grab some pictures of manta rays oh there's a good one beautiful free download download go back into my browser hit the back arrow i like this picture because we can see under him download i have some nice pictures of rays now i think i want to grab a big picture of a basking shark so i'm going to write basking shark and then hit my magnifying glass oh and this is a terrific picture so i'm going to go ahead and hit free download download okay step five go ahead and save all of the pictures that we just downloaded into your sharks and raise folder step six open scratch go ahead and log in so you can save and share your projects now we are ready to go ahead and to create our awesome new slideshow that is going to feature sharks and rays with a little bit of text on top of each picture so we can give our audience a little bit more understanding of what these creatures are all about so go ahead and hit create and scratch will begin to set up your program step six so i am at my desktop and i see my sharks and rays folder i double click on it and i open up to see all of my amazing pictures of these fantastic amazing sharks and rays so i have a basking shark i have a great white uh shark with a blue background i have pictures of a great white with a transparent background or a clear background and it looks to be about five different pictures of the same great white i have a gray shark with his teeth showing i have three hammer heads with a transparent background or clear background i have manta rays i have my sawfish picture and i have an under wreath underneath rey picture okay so i've labeled all of them so i clearly understand what each picture is about and i'm not going to get them confused with any other picture now i go back into my scratch program that's already opened and the first thing that i want to do is get rid of my scratch cat byebye and the next thing that i want to do is i want to go ahead and upload all of my shark and rape my shark and rey pictures so i go into my upload window it's sort of down here on the right hand side and i choose this option upload sprite i go to my desktop and i go down to my sharks and rays folder i double click it and i wonder if i select my first picture and hold shift key down and then select my last picture oh look they can all be selected at one time and all be imported into my scratch picture at one time so all i did i'll do that again is i selected my very first shark picture then on my keyboard i'm holding my shift key down and i'm selecting my last picture so my first to my last picture with my shift key down on my keyboard and it selects all eight pictures at one time and i hit open and now my scratch program tells me that these are importing so there's basking there's great white with blue great white transparent gray shark with teeth three hammerheads manta rays sawfish underneath rey one two three four five six seven eight awesome okay let's go to my and they are all on top of each other and that's no big deal we're going to go ahead and fix that with code so the first thing that i want to do is i want to rename these in my scratch program because as i go through the slideshow i'm going to call all of these individually and when i call them i want to call them by a letter so i don't have to write basking shark and great white shark with blue background and great white shark with clear background that type of thing so i'm going to rename all of them and to do that i'm just going to be in my sprite window right here and the first one i have here is my basking shark so instead of it having the long name of basking shark i want to just name it b and you'll see why we do that in just a minute that is going to be our code part of our code for calling that picture great white shark let's go to him next so great white shark with the blue background i want to name him w the great white shark with the transparent background or the clear background i want to name him g for great the gray shark with the teeth with the scary teeth i want to name him tea for teeth the hammer heads you know what i'm going to name hammer heads h manta rays you know what i'm going to name them m sawfish s underneath rey which is this guy right here you so basking b great white with blue background w for white great whites um with the transparent background g for great t for the gray shark with the teeth h for the hammerheads m for the manta rays s for the sawfish and u for the underneath part of this ray picture okay so they are all layered on top of each other and that's fine because we are going to right now start putting some code in so we're just going to call each picture one at a time with that specific letter you'll see what i mean don't worry just follow me so the first shark that we are going to do is this basking shark and that's what he looks like when we look at his costume if we go into code we don't really see anything because his picture is sort of layered underneath all of these and hidden so the first thing that we want to do is we want to say okay when the green flag is clicked and we start our game we want him to hide because we don't want to see him until we press the letter b so when green flag clicked hide him and then we're going to go through all of these when w is clicked hide him when g is clicked tied him when t is clicked hide him when h is clicked hide him when m is clicked hide him when s is clicked hide him when u is clicked hide him when b is clicked show him so let's go ahead and put that first so i go to events when space key is pressed so instead of space put b when b key is pressed then let's go into our looks and down here is our show and let's check it out so he is hidden we can't really see it but it did it did hide from beneath this when this is clicked he hides and then let's go ahead and hit b see that he's behind here when b is clicked he shows up now let's go ahead and make that a little bit clearer so go back to events and let's go through all of these so the next one in line is w so let's hide w when w is pressed go into looks grab that hide hide him go back to events what's next g when g is pressed go into looks hide him when tea is pressed hide him when h is pressed hide him what's our next one m okay when m is pressed hide him two more two more when s is pressed hide him and then i'm going to show you a shortcut here if i right click here i can say duplicate and it gives me a duplicate of the block so the last one is you which is our great big manta picture right here underneath manta so hide him then okay so now let's go ahead we have hidden everything except our basking shark but we only show him when we press b so let's go ahead and and hit green flag now let's press b now wait a second i see him popping up back here but i don't see anything else happening well because none of these other pictures have any code on them so they don't know how to behave themselves so they're just hanging out basking shark is the only one who knows how to behave because he has code behind them behind him right now so we have to put in code to a couple more of these before we see any real change but that's okay let's go ahead and go to so basking shark has when green flag is click tied when b is pressed show and then the rest of the pictures go ahead and hide in until their letter is shown so let's do the same thing for our great white shark so when green flag is clicked hide now we want our great white with a blue background to show when our w is clicked so we go to when w then show now the rest of the time we want to hide so b g t h m s u we have to hide all of those now there is a shortcut for doing this there is a code way for doing this i teach this letter by letter so let's go ahead and pick b because i want my students to really understand what they're doing and so the first time they go through this if they have to hide every single letter i've found it helps them understand this lesson a little bit better and it's just fun to be on here and to click around okay so when g is pressed hide and let's see when t is pressed t for teeth hide and when h is pressed then we're going to go ahead and hide and when m is pressed we're going to go ahead and hide and then let's go ahead and do our right click duplicate our little shortcut and when s is pressed we hide so right click duplicate when you is pressed we're going to go ahead and hide okay so let's make sure we have everybody so when it's a w we show b g t h m s u okay awesome let's see if anything happens see if we can see anything happening now i'm pressing some of the keys nothing really is happening because we have so many layers okay let's go to g now g is the great white sharks with the transparent background so the first thing we want to do is when green flag is clicked we want to hide and then we want to do events when we'll do this one for the show when g is pressed we show that's the only one now let's go to we'll duplicate the next one when b let's start with b when b is pressed we hide now let's do right click duplicate when w oops nope not v when w is pressed we hide duplicate when t is pressed we hide when h is pressed we hide right click duplicate i'm going to put this up here when m is pressed we hide duplicate whoops it just gave me the hide now if i have a mistake i just pull it off okay so when s is pressed we hide and then duplicate this when you is pressed we hide okay awesome okay now once all of the code is in our pictures i want to then go back to my very first picture which is my basking shark and i want to make sure that my sprite is the name is b just because i don't want to confuse it with anything and then i want to go to my text and for each picture i have written something different about each animal so i just put right on my animal that text so for instance on my basking shark i have don't worry this big mouth only eats tiny plankton fish eggs and krill and then more importantly i have down here press green flag for directory and that will mean that our audience can go back to the green flag and click it and they'll be given a little preview of what letters they need to click to go to each animal okay so i have all of this text written down in my matching online lesson tutorial for this at easycodesforkids.com so you can see that in the description or if you want to write your own about each animal you can do that as well so teachers here is a great chance for your kids to get onto google and to do some research about all of these different animals and then come up with their own text to put on top of the picture okay so i opened up a fresh scratch program to show you how i made the beginning piece of our slideshow just so it's a little less confusing so when you have all of when we have all of our different pictures here we can go through them because we have code on each of them telling them to hide until a certain letter is pressed well people who are going to come to this program are not going to know automatically what letter they need to press to see a basking shark or to see manta rays or to see a sawfish unless we give them a nice little directory and i think the easiest way to go from let's say basking shark if i'm in a basking shark and i can't remember all the other different sharks and ray pictures that are available i think you know what i'll just go back to my green flag for the directory so all of them in the bottom corner have press green flag for directory so they know after they're done looking at this picture i can press green flag for the directory and find what is the next letter i need to press to go to the next animal okay so this is going to be the very start of our slideshow and it's going to say welcome to our slideshow it has a nice little cartoon shark and then it gives sort of an explanation press the following keys whoops i messed that up press the following keys to see and read about sharks and rays okay super simple and then they will know that when they go back to the start they don't have to memorize oh i want to see great white so i have to press g okay so what i'd like to show you is how i'm going to make this welcome to our slideshow and it's going to be a lot it's going to be very similar to the code that we use for the other animals a lot of hide and show so the first thing that i want to do is go down here and choose a sprite and i'm going to type shark into my search and there's my little shark now he has some animation he has some different costumes so he animates to this guy so he goes from a great white to a hammerhead but we are not necessarily concerned about that we i like to use him just as a great white and i'm going to add the text here and then i'll add the code and that will be our beginning piece of our slideshow so you are going to do this right in your program i'm just doing this on a separate piece so it doesn't look confusing okay all right so i want to make sure that this guy is grouped and now i can move him up here so i just used my arrow i drew a box around him and then i hit group just so i can move him around correctly and he doesn't i don't move him in pieces now i'm going to choose my text and i'm going to say welcome to our slideshow about sharks and rays now i can see in this corner over here that that is a little bit out of alignment so i move it a little bit okay now here comes the important part the directory so i'm going to go in alphabetical order so i'm going to say b or basking shark the second one is g a space great white shark with clear and let's see if it goes up here i'm going to scroll out a little bit okay that looks good okay let's see the third one is h hammerhead the fourth one is m and ray the fifth one is s for saw fish and that up a little better the sixth one is t re shark with teeth seven is you sting ray with underneath picture finally we have w for great white shark with blue background okay so the final thing that we have to do is just add our code so we need to have our code that tells our slideshow when to show and when to hide okay super simple and it's a lot like the rest of our slideshow so we go into code and we do events when green flag is clicked we're going to show our beginning slide when let's go to events when b is clicked or pressed we are going to hide okay and let's right click duplicate when g is pressed we're going to hide okay duplicate when h is pressed we're going to hide duplicate when m is pressed we're going to hide when s is pressed we're going to hide when t is pressed we're going to hide when u is pressed we're going to hide and finally when w is pressed we're going to hide so only on green flag are we going to see our beginner do you
