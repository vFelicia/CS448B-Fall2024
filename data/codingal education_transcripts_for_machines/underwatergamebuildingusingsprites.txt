okay because i'm going to teach you something about composition okay so first of all i'll share my screen and i'll just tell you what all competitions we have for you just a second okay so just let me know when my poor little screen is visible yes so is my screen visible yes yes so when you log into your dashboard the competition is here at the top okay so today we are going to talk about the code string okay so if you just click on this name it shows you the entire details of this competition one very important thing and that is that we have to complete this before 16th of august okay so we'll be doing like you all what you will be doing i'll tell you how to register after that i will be making one sample project and you have to make your own project you do not have to copy mine you have to make your own project and after that you have to submit your project okay so i'll tell you step by step how you can do everything so this is the code sprint whose due date is august 16 so you need to complete your project and submit it before that so what will you be doing in the code sprint so you are all in the junior group right you're in this process one to four okay so we have two themes for you the first one is building and the second one is storytelling okay so depending on which theme you like you can do a project according to that so let's just say i want to do game building so i have to build an innovative outdoor or underwater game okay my favorite avenger or cartoon should be a part of the game and you people can use any block based application okay so whatever you have learned you can use that platform okay be it strange eatport.org be some cable applause any platform that you have learned you can use that to make this game okay the next theme is storytelling so you have to select any one thing either this one or this one so you have to select one theme so if i explain storytelling then i have to tell a story of my choice okay and i will animate the story using images texts and sound effects and for this also i can use any block based application okay so after finalizing as to which theme i want to work on let's just say i like game building okay so after finalizing my theme i'll just click on start now okay so as soon as i click on start now it will take me to this page where it will ask me for my name then my grade then my email my phone number then my parents name then my school and my city after i fill in all these details i can take help from my parents to fill these details okay so i'll fill in all these details and after that i'll just click on register for competition is that clear yes ma'am yes so that is clear i'll register for competition so now after i register i have to start working on my project why because the clock's ticking and 16 august though it seems very far but it is not okay so i know code.org so i'll make a project on four.org so as we read that we can make an underwater game so i'll just go to code.org and then after that i'll go to create and ilo sprite lab if you know play lab or anything else you can do that as well i know sprite lab so i'll make a project on sprite lab okay and i will quickly let it and after that still let it close after one more thing you will not be given points for copying the project that i am making your task is to make a project of your own your project should be your imagination your creativity you should be doing the block of codes yourself okay so you will be given points if the like depending on how imaginative your project is how creative how new and how correct the code is okay try not to copy the project from anywhere because otherwise you will not be getting points okay so i will make my project so i'll just delete this and i'll set so as i'm going to make an underwater game so i'll select an underwater theme and after that i'll go to stripes to add my characters so let me think i want a star i want a chef who is going to eat fishes and yeah so i have this octopus and i'll make another character and that will be let's just say oh where's my shark so i'll search bird or shark yeah here my shark is so i'll make a shark as well now i'll change the position of this shark with this yellow spoon and yeah here's my shark and i'll add most fishes okay i'll just add one more fish so here goes my fish so i'll go to more again and insert i will say fish which face do i like oh i like this blue fish so i'll say select the fish and i change its position and done so now i have everything that i want to be there in my game okay after that what i'll do i'll go to event so that my shaft can move with my arrow keys so i'll do events and when i press okay so when up is pressed i want my shaft to move up so i'll go to sprites and i'll do move 10 pixels not but does the bunny have to move no so i'll select here the sharp and if i click on run to check oh yeah my shaft is moving up similarly i need to do it for the other arrow keys as well so again i'll go to events and i will do then down stretch so now for the down arrow key also i will make my shark hole so but this time it has to move and this character would be the shaft and similarly i'll do for the left and the right arrow key as well so when left is pressed i will again move character 10 pixels now i'll take this block and i'll change the character to shark and i'll change north to west and similarly i'll do for the right arrow key as well so event pen right press i'll again go to sprite and move my character sharp 10 pixels each and now if i just click on run and try to check see it's moving right it's moving left moving up and it's moving down as well you cool my sharks moving oh but what about my octopus and my fish oh i have to move them as well for that i'll go to behaviors and i will take the sprite begins block okay so i'll just take sprite begins and i'll place this one here so that i have some space so sprite begins so but which price is funny no my octopus so my octopus begins and the next one i'll do and that is wandering the last one and if i just click on run yay my octopus is moving now on its own i'm not doing anything similarly i even want that my fish should be doing both the same thing so again i'll go to behaters and i'll say sprite begins but which price the bunny no the fish so the fish the fish and behaviors again and i'll take wondering again i like wandering the best okay if i click on run now everyone is moving i can move with the arrow keys and i can eat the characters oh but oh i am unable to read them because i have not done the code for that yet so again i'll go to events i'll again go to events and i will say that when this touches this okay so when i on the shark and when i touch the octopus i want that i eat the octopus and he disappears so i'll take this ben block i'll take it out oh it's not coming out okay wait i'll just reload okay in the meanwhile you all can tell me is everything clear till here what i was doing yeah i'm here always make it in the scratch you can make it in scratch also you can use any platform okay you can use fast food.org again also you can use sprite lab play lab app lab game lab any platform that you know you can use that okay even if you know any platform that we have not taught you but you know that platform you can use that as well fine okay so my blocks have got arranged just because i reloaded so now what i want i want that event and when this touches this oh it's still not coming out oh wait let me oopsie let me check my system's handling something has happened we'll just wait for it to exit okay and i'll reopen so i'll again go to my projects it is saved in my projects okay so yeah see here it is untitled project so if i just open it and let it load and after that still let it load yeah so i go to event and when this touches this oh something has happened oh it's still not coming out i guess my system is angry with oh my system please don't be happy over oh my mouse battery is fine no ma'am your computer advance is not it's not coming out if you take it no no no my mouse battery is fine my computer's battery is also fine oh it's out finally it's out see so i was saying that when the shark touches the fish okay what i'll do i'll go to sprite and i will just remove the sprite because i'll eat the sprite i'll eat the fish right so i don't want the fish anymore so i'll just click on run and let's see if my fish is getting disappeared or not yeah i ate my fish oh but what about the octopus so similarly i'll do the same thing for the octopus as well so events again and when they such as this let's hope it comes out sooner oh there's some ghost in my computer who's angry with very very active do you have does your computer also get angry with you at times no yes ma'am no someone says no no oh yes well few times hmm my computer is also angry it is saying that oh you are not giving me charging i'm angry with you is that it does your computer say that as
