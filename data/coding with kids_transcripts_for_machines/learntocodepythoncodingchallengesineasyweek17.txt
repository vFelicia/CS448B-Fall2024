welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible edible is a coding platform where there are lots of different problems you can solve using different coding languages So today we're gonna do three easy coding challenges and add a bit using python so our first coding challenge is called recursion to repeat a string and number of times so our instructions are to create a recursive function that takes two parameters and repeats the string n number of times the first parameter txc which is text is a string to be repeated and the second parameter is the number of times the strings to be repeated so for example here we have two variables first is a string so here in this case it's a b and then number three so the number is how many times we need to repeat the string and here a b a b a b okay so the second parameter of the function is always a positive integer so first we have a function called repetition with two parameters text and N so first we're going to create a variable called repeat which is a which has an empty string today we're going to do if n equals equals one and we're going to return text so when make sure to repeat two equal slot uh do two equal signs because then it'll actually mean equal not like in variables where you will only assign something so if n equals one we're just going to return the original text because we don't need to repeat it so then we're basically going to do this to all the numbers but it's going to be different from one so else if n equals equals two we're gonna do we're gonna assign repeat to be Text Plus text so here we basically do two texts and put them inside the variable repeat then we will return repeat so if these if the first if and else if so uh don't work so if like n is not one or two it will keep going down the if so else if n equals three we're gonna keep doing it make sure to add the add one more text each time and change the number and then all the way to four and then five five times the return repeat so now let's check it and see this test console so there is soccer and two times so soccer soccer then there is more 3ab which is a b a b a b so in the console we got all the tests passed onto our next coding challenge so our next coding challenge is called smash Factor smash factor is a term in golf that relates to the amount of energy transferred from the club head to the golf ball the formula for calculating smash factor is ball speed divided by Club speed create a function that takes ball speed which is BS and Club speed CS as arguments and Returns the smash factor to the nearest hundred so all we have to do is basically divide the BS variable by the Cs variable and then round it to the nearest hundredth which is two decimal points so first we have a function called smash factor with BS and CS so first I'm going to put the formula for smash factor in it which is ball speed divided by Club speed so now that we so now we have the smash Factor inside our variable SF so then we need to round the variable so we're going to do a variable called rounded equals round sf2 so round is a function which you can use to round numbers to whatever digits place to the hundredths place has two decimal points so we're going to put the two here and what we want to round over here which is our variable SF so now that we have our rounded uh smash Factor inside our variable around it we're going to return the variable rounded and now we're going to check and see the test console if you there are lots of numbers so 218 plus 161.2 is 1.34 which is rounded and then there's also 209.7 and 164.3 divide that and you get 1.28 which is also rounded to the nearest hundredth place so we pass all their tests onto our final coding challenge this it's called is the dictionary empty so this can be very simple I'm but it can also be very useful so instructions are basically right so it is useful and easy yeah so write a function that returns true if the dictionary is empty and false otherwise so here for example here they give us an empty dictionary so we're going to return true if there's anything in the dictionary we return false so first we have function called is empty with a dictionary so first we're going to check the dictionary is blank so here it's an empty dictionary so I also remember to do the two equal signs not assigning something so then if it is empty we're going to return true else we're going to return false you can also do this to the list but you have to change the brackets and now let's check it and do the test cases so here there's Z2 W4 and y5 so there are keys and values so there are things in the dictionary so it's going to be false and empty dictionary is true so we pass all our tests well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
