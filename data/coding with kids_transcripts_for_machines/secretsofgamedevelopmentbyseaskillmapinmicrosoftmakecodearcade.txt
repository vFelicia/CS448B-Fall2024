welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia today we're in microsoft made code arcade and we're going to do a zookeeper's adventure so we're we already completed the zookeeper hunt and now we're gonna do by sea so there are two choices after the first one the zookeeper hunt so you can do by land and by sea today we're going to do by sea welcome to the aquarium we're so excited to have you designing this exhibit so right now there's the project's running and there's like a ocean exhibit and there are bubbles in the sand yeah and to start go to the sprites category and drag set my sprite to sprite of kind player into the onstart containers so we're going to go to our sprite set my spread click the gray box and use the imager image editor to draw your favorite sea animal click next when you're ready for the next step so you can draw or you can or you can go to the gallery what kind of van humans are animals too these these clowns fish or these i don't know what goldfish okay done and sprite find my sprite set my sprite x20 and drag it into the end of the onstart container so my spread set my sprite x click x then choose vx velocity x from the drop down menu so v x right here try changing the zero and the text box to something else let's see let's try first open sprites then snap set my stripe bounce on wall to the end of the program and check out your new exhibit on the game screen okay we're gonna do a spread set my sprite bounce almost so fishy you can bounce on the wall and keep doing it okay let's because it first goes backwards you know bounce on the edge of the screen and then keep bouncing and swimming bling okay now let's next let's make the aquarium more exciting with some randomness grab a new set my spread x20 block and drag it to the end of it on start container another one okay set my x replace x with y using the drop down menu this will change change the position of the fish in the up down direction so let's see why and let's set it to zero okay let's see that's on the bye top fishy friend i don't know where you went from the math category grab a pick random 0 to 10 value block and use it to use it zero zero next to the y try you placing zero and ten with larger numbers to see how they affect your new friend hit they the screen will go to zero to 120 okay math pick random let's see pickering them from 10 to 110 so that's a lot 110. next this is awesome but look it's looking a little lonely in that aquarium let's give your c critter a few new friends okay now let's see right now let's select this okay and loops find the repeat four times glue container and snap it into the top of the onstar container grab okay first let's get the repeat grab the first block of code beneath the new loop and drag it and use it to drag the whole chunk of code up into the empty repeat container so we're gonna make more fishies okay first is it okay oh first example i see an alarm what's going on hold on we're getting a report from the penguin department the opinions did what you best trick fish so we need to finish by land first before we do that so let's see what our code now does so it's gonna make eight fishies fishy fishy fishy oh now there are a lot of fishies in the bottom a bunch of fishies are packed together packs this one is so lonely and once you swim alone that's right and now let's press finish and next time after we do by land we're gonna see what the penguins did um over here looks like the penguins escaped well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
