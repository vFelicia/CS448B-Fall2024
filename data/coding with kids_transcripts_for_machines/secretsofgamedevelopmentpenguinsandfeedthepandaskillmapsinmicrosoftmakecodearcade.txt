welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia today we're in microsoft may code arcade and we're in the zoo keepers hunt so we're going to do that yeah penguins it's penguin pension they're all like running crazy yeah i think we have to put them back in thank goodness you're here penguins are everywhere well this is a good painting actually they're running around outside of their enclosure you'll have to help they're eating all the ice cream is sliding down the street how can you slide down the street look through the code and figure out how to put the penguin back into their icy paradise can you figure out how to move the penguin's spawn point when you've helped the penguins back into the exhibit click finish to continue to other parts of these let's see the code so let's start repeat three thousand oh there's going to be three thousand penguins penguin coupons so right now it's all spawning here because the x is 10 let's change it so after we fix the code it says you win but i just fixed the code and i went the penguins are now happily inside their enclosure one more time or maybe a little bit too full of ice cream there's a dirt block over there so let's see so the next one we'll have is the panda so let's do feed the panda too everyone's favorite panda is hungry so let's write some code to feed it some tasty bamboo take a look at the code in your workspace it should look familiar can you remember what it does when it starts to and then it just writes to the pan spray and set panda velocity to vx pick random 20 to 50 n okay so it moves then pan events first you'll need to grab some bamboo from controller drag and on a button press container into the workspace snap a new set my sprite to sprite kind of player block inside it make sure to change these kind to food so on a button press when you press the a button we're going to go to sprites so we need to like draw bamboo or choose a bamboo from the gallery okay so here we go gallery and get a bamboo so these are basically but the panda doesn't do anything it's just wandering around yeah it's next time to scatter the boot around the panda enclosure from sprites get i'll set my sprite position to x zero y zero block and place it at the end of the on a button pressed container from math grab to pick random 0 to 10 value blocks and use them to replace the x and y value in the new set position block try some different numbers to see how they affect the way the bamboo is randomly uh placed on across this okay so we're going to do some sprites sprites set my spray position set my let's try first one to be 30 and the second one to be 50. now let's see let's try you're gonna click the spacebar okay it went to the corner next one okay so now there's multiple buttons they're all over there now the bamboo forward for you to eat but you're not eating so the fourth the wet into the forest the forest is slowly growing okay so next i want the pam the panda isn't very good at finding food let's help it out open sprites and drag a set my enemy follow my sprite block out into the end of the on a button press container change the first variable value to panda then try your code on the greens so the game's green so far my sprite yeah do it panda so the panda will follow and go to the newest bamboo okay okay next lunch time we can help the panda find snacks by running code with the panda when the panda overlaps the bamboo from sprites pull out and on spike of kind player overlaps other spread of kind player container and drop it into the workspace click on the second player drop down menu and select food so first on spread of compare overlaps this one okay second food okay next grab a destroy my sprite block from sprites and put it in the on overlap container destroy so they on spartacon food it's food because the bamboo sprite block in the header of the on overlaps container called other sprite grab it and drag it down to replace my sprite and the destroying block press press the plus icon on the block to add an effect that will play when the panda starts munching both spray and do some great well okay so drag the other sprite over here to nice to replace my sprite and we can trash spray or just get your game and try using the game screen and when you're done click finish to continue the zoo journey we don't want the pan to disappear because it's not the bamboo eating the pan yeah the pan doesn't keep pressing more okay now they're all cracking yeah okay every time you make a new one but if you your range is very long then if you already press one then you press another one you may have one bamboo will never be eaten and you keep pressing and if the panda if your range is very long then it will go to this one then another one then another one and all of them won't be finished okay let's try one thing i'm gonna set here to 100. so we have this expanse hopefully it won't grab a screen okay so now it's all always great those are aren't eaten yeah because i pressed so fast it only will go to the newest one yeah now there's bamboo but sometimes when it touches one bamboo it also touches other bamboo and it eats both of those bamboo well we should call it tree it doesn't really look like a bamboo bamboo should be a stick more than a dog one more bamboo you press it yay how about we put the spray effect what's the difference okay last time let's do spray and then so now it's like more crunchy you like there's something spraying out of it which one do you like more i like this thing decent okay me too yeah okay one more one last one okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
