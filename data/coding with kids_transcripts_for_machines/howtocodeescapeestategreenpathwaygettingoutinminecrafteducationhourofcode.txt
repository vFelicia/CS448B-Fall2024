welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia mine is Andrew today we're in timecraft in Minecraft education Edition so in the last video we went out the chest room and then now we found that the time Bots are bad guys they have been in this prison and they're gonna use that portal to get away and get out of this prison so we have these cannons that can like destroy or do something to the portal so that the robots can't go through so now only I use code to uh fire the cannon like defeat the robots the time agents are underneath the time War they have used their powers to create protective colored rings around it use the activate Canon function to activate the color cannons in the same order as the colored rings to disable the timer so there's blue yellow megana and green magenta magenta okay so there's an example activ blue and then yellow let's see what it does okay so there are blue Rings right oh look the blue one it's oh another blue ring disappeared and now the blue robot yellow it doesn't work because there's a green ring that's outside so when the ring is disappear they fall and then they they're like knocked out so we did like um blue so the blue Time by Banshee went down okay so first we need to do blue and then green almost blocking the yellow Cannon so then when you do green yellow and then magenta because those are the our order of the biggest and smallest Rings okay so now let's go coding and we're gonna do so it's blue and then we're gonna have to do yellow foreign so we're gonna do yellow and then we're gonna do oh wait we have to do green then yellow right oh yeah you're green and then yellow so so we are gonna do green and then yellow the magenta do you spell Canada over here okay you did two okay then magenta let's run it go go go fire boom green one look boom oh no two out of five yellow there's no Red Wing I don't know boom okay and now Rask there's only Rascals he also broke down there's a Time orb disappeared oh now we're going past the Box oh now there's a weird spirit teleporting the robots teleported away or they got destroyed you did it you really stuck it to those time agents or should I say you really stuck to his hot tight those agents to this time haha sorry I'm still working on this thing you call humor the time agents will remain here to think about what they have done as for you come with me I'll show you the way out let's go no no congratulations your coding skills saved the day again who knows what trouble the time agents would have stirred up if they had escaped the estate well done there's still one question I have those diary Pages where do you think they came from that's an excuse oh that's a God that's the real guy it's the real it's the real Dr brickowski they were from me Dr Dodge brakowski those temporal troublemakers lured me into this place too I've actually been trying to escape for weeks whatever you did in there helped me finally find a way out thank you this is a real one yeah I'm glad you are safe and I think we've heard the last from the time agents for a while now please let's get out of here this place gives me the zeros and ones okay so sorry kid I'm broke would you start off with saving the world in a cookie I think uh our character wanted the emerald yeah now they're all right now we go the Mansion actually is pretty big and cool I saw Rascal huh the end this question mark maybe Rascal yeah it came out they were stuck in the prison but now they came out yeah so in this Escape I think there's free free like Lanes you can go to so this is the easiest time time uh trees like this is the first the easiest one and in the next Escape as state we're gonna go to the um next PATH which is not that hard but it's still harder than this one well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to Smashing And subscribe bye bye
