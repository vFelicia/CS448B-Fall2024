welcome to recording with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about the while loop you first want to do count equals zero so count is a variable then we'll do while count is not five so exclamation equals is not so what keep repeating whatever is in the while loop until count is so in the while loop there's count plus equals one so add one to count so it's the same as count equals count plus one so on the first time it iterates the while loop count will become one after adding one to count we'll print count so keep adding one and then printing count until count is five and then stop so let's start at zero yeah but in the while loop it'll add one so it'll start printing one not zero let's save it with control s go to terminal and type t y wall to dot p y and run so let's see it printed one two three four and five so it printed all the numbers from one to five and when count was five it stopped because the while loop starts when count is five yeah so count is a variable yeah and it worked so we're going to keep using the count equal zero and print count so we're going to change the wall to wall count is less than 20 or equal to yeah then count plus equals three so add free to count so keep repeating this until count is greater than 20. let's save it go to terminal and run it so you can use up here to copy what you last typed in terminal so it printed let's see 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 so why did it print to 21 well after it printed the 18 it checked the wall again so 18 is still less than 20 so it added free to count which is 21. yeah 18 plus 21 equals i mean 18 plus 3 it was 21 yeah and then printed 21 so check the wall again but 21 is more than 20 so it stopped like this oh let me see hmm oh it's 21 stop the loop okay that worked so now we're in still prints the count we're going to do count equals 20. so now the count variable is 20 and then while count is greater than or equal to zero then count minus equals three so now we're subtracting free from count so on the first time it iterates the while loop count will become 17 and then it will print 17 and repeat until count is less than zero so let's save it go to terminal and run it so let's see what it printed so i printed 17 14 11 8 5 2 and negative one so it printed a negative root one because after printed the two i checked the wall again and two is still more than zero so subtracted three from two which is negative one and then imprinted negative one and check the wall again but negative one is less than zero so it's stopped i'm stopping that worked now we're going to tell you the operator and the purpose so equals is a sign and then plus equals is add in the sign minus equals is subtracting a sign star equals is multiply then sign and forward slash equals is divide then assign percentage equals is get the model as then assign and the star star equals is perform exponent then assign and thank you for watching remember to smash it up and subscribe bye
