welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education so today i'm going to show you my code project called exploding footsteps so it's a very simple um code project and i want to make you they're fun even though it's really cool yeah it's only three blocks but when you so what this code does is basically um go explode um behind you so wherever you walk there will be craters and holes because it explodes so the here is the code on player walk so when you walk you'll place the code will place tnt where you just walked and then immediately it will also place fire at tnt so when you light um tnt with fire or steel whatever um just like it happens to a creeper a creeper or tnt will explode so then will be exploding footsteps so let now let's see in python there's also another way to do this code is to like box that place prime to tnt but we'll do it this way yeah so define untraveled walk so it's a function so when there when you travel you'll do block stop place tnt position zero zero zero so place t and t yeah and then place fire so it'll light the tnt of fire and then the tnt will explode set the function and then player that untraveled walk on traveled walk it'll run it so when you walk it'll run the function okay so now uh i just want to do it in a survival so kind of being a little more fun yeah so first i'm going to get another armor so i don't need to die yeah we're also going to get a few of our diet so even if we do die we'll survive okay yeah okay and then now i'm gonna equip it equip andrews at redstone brother well he looks like a redstone robber he is resting everywhere he looks so sucks okay we're gonna hold on to one token and place these here and now we're gonna take you to survival so you get exploded and it's kind of more fun because you have hearts and health okay let's do is a little bit better because it's like um it will just suddenly just happen you don't need a way too uh we're trying to get into tnt um into water because of the fire and then you keep exposed so um this only what this only works on land so it doesn't work when you're walking water because you're literally just jumping yeah and oh copper and tnt doesn't really do anything in water so i also don't think this works well maybe it works then um when it's raining but i didn't test it out so i think we should have gotten some food but we don't have any we still fall hungry so i'm just gonna run it it's a drama excuse me footsteps i really think it's too good if you want to try this and one actually like exploring footsteps trying to use prime team teeth yeah i use one of my toes and now there's copper so this is also useful for mining it's quick and you could get hurt yeah well just make sure you're you're equipped with armor and total of undying yeah should we try it with prime team tea um to make actually one i'm just gonna go to the water but there's a drown with you know what okay let's try it with prime t and t now okay so let's go back to blocks so prime candy only needs two blocks so it's more easy if you want more fun so you go to mobs and do projectile from tnt so you put it instead of tnt so you can get the place fire block out because the prime tnt isn't ready that's ready to explode so now let's do it again oh first set it today i guess it's still good why is there ladder let's see why is there loud let's see how it goes then it's projectile pronto it just gives us ladders how does it give us ladder is something wrong the place is loud maybe something's lying okay so now i'm just gonna change it back and do one more our last two no no oh he's right here yeah my last totem let's see it's still dark changing back today how about you get out of here oh i'm probably gonna hold your tnt's behind me fired rntv run as fast as you can order something this is so cool yes it's not in the video right here no until it comes oh it's raining so it doesn't work so there's a bunch of tnt because the raining is getting the fire out okay so now let's set it to a day um and set it to clear wetter so we can do one more actually okay okay one more oh get ready for exploding footsteps it's actually really not exploding footsteps but there's at least something but it is enderman i'm just going to hide here so yeah yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
