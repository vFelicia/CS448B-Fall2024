welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python today we're going to learn about arguments so first we're going to do deaf print arts then a star so star args so arc is basically arguments and whatever you type here you can type strings floats or any type and the star makes it so you can type any number of arguments inside and then do a for statement inside while defining the print r function so for argon r so as we said the star mixes so you can type any number of arguments so for each argument and we'll print f string r equals and then whatever you typed in then print aux a so a is our first and only argument so do for rs and arcs it will print string arc equals a then it'll do that same thing for a and b and a b and c so let's save it and run it so see it did it a because the second time marie called the function we also added another a so that r equals b r equals a and finally r equals b and r equals c that worked so next we will replace the for statement with print r so for the first time recall the function you'll print a and it'll print the type of odds so now let's save it and run it so they had a class tuple a b class double and a b c class tuple so all these are class tuples and tuples are just like lists but you can't modify them and you can't use list helper functions so now we're going to do rx 0 equals z in the def print ours to see if it can do lists so it has a error so it's a tuple not a list so let's gonna do different keyword args then star star quarks those quarks is named arguments then we're going to do third equals quarks dot get so get is a function that will unlock something with the key third then none so none is a default value then if third is not none it'll print third arc equals third then we're going to do print keyword args first equals a so the first time we call the function it will do nothing because there's no third key then the second time we're going to print keyword args first equals b and second equals c the second time we call it it also do nothing because it all still has no third key the last time we'll do print keyword arcs first equals d second equal e and third equals f so now we have a third key so it'll do third equal third r equals f so save it and run it so deferred r equals f that worked well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
