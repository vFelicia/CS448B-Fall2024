welcome to recruiting with kids my name is claire my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition and we're going to explain the code of 1000 tnt so thousand tnt is an example where you can make like a huge cube of a thousand tnt which you can explode so when you type a thousand tnt which we're going to just change into tnt so it's more simple okay fill with tnt of course because it's very fun you can fill it with flavor i think the only fun things is actually just tnt and lava because they're destructive yeah so from one one one which is one block of bowie so you won't get glitched in the block which is very annoying because you know you have to break it then 2 10 10 10 so that's actually just a cube up in the sky you can also do it down in a cave and then you can explode all along and see if we get any good things yeah but there will be a lot of food yeah and don't explode yourself but if you're in creative that will be fine yeah so in python it's step on and chat so it's a function it's blocks that fill tnt position 111 to position 10 10 10 so it'll be your whole huge queue to fill operation dot replace and then dot player dot on check when you type tnt in the channel run so let's go and explore this place and i think we're going to get some yeah coal first let's get foot and steel okay to explode the cnc hopefully you won't lag so if you don't want to lag and do that much tnt i guess we need to change the code yeah so that's 10 pi 10 yeah okay so if you want if you don't want to lag i would start at the bottom but i don't i think you'll just one day one explode and then cause all the other one one by far one creative oh it's flying everywhere it's flying everywhere oh dude it fly everywhere look at what it did oh there's one more because it glitches because there's a lot oh there's still some in the air because it glitches they get exploded so far they just disappeared yeah let's see where did it explode here mostly dark yeah and stone then the water broke through it's like dynamite like when people want to create line themes but they exploded this block because all of that remains well two blocks of like oh one then disappears okay that was the big llamas hi llama okay i'm gonna try i'm doing the forest oh yeah so we can explode more trees and go here let's try tntg and t okay i'm just gonna explode the bottom one so that it'll fall and it will affect the other tnt so you should do behind the air that way but if you want more explosion it's like yeah okay oui and then it flies okay let's see uh you can keep doing the same spot to mine deeper and deeper oh no you set them on fire that's very deeper okay let's go deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper oh that one's going to fall out over there is the most um deepest because we kept on exploring it this is still only iron maybe we should make one on top over here like over here so we can keep exploding it okay let's do tnt last time one last time oh it's kind of stuck replaced it's starting to lag see it's glitching okay this is a big big one big waterfall yeah okay we got some copper a lot of dirt blocks and a stone block a little coal flint this flint haha um some xp from coal on raw iron obviously um there's some trees oh a lot like this cold cold cool a lot of coal tnt if you're in survival it will be good mining resource if you just be careful like you really care because if you explode 1000 tnti once it can cause you to lag and you can it can explode you which is bad yeah and if you if you do a thousand tnt that is a lot and a lot of range of exploding okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like button and subscribe bye
