welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're at minecraft education so we're on python 101 and lesson five so we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says hi again since you have been on such helpful company i want to show you our newest creation a robot companion called the agent the agent can be controlled with code and can help people in every part of daytoday life it can help you around the house network down here we are testing the agent to help out so let's see what this lever does switch oh there are lots of agents and this one's the agent yes hi inject the agent says hot i'm the agent and i'll be your helper and companion throughout this journey can you help code me to become smarter so i'm going to help the agent to become smarter okay good now we're going to talk to the developer so the developer says hi would it be possible to get your help i need to write some code that will move the bars from one side to the other this will greatly help people who can't move heavy objects that easily but i cannot seem to make the agent move correctly could you write some code some code to help me with this so i'm gonna help the help her get the agent to get borrows and put the bar on the piston okay so in part one write some code so that the agent will pick up the box and move six blocks forward and place it four so first we're gonna do agent duh collect all so we'll collect everything everything around it okay next we're gonna do asian dot move forward six times okay so go to the pis uh the block before the piston then agent place forward okay place four to place the barrel i picked up on the piston so now let's run okay hey takes a long ball and puts it on the piston now i'm gonna go to part two okay so now it's a little different okay so part two at the same cost i had the agent goes back to the starting point it needs to do the same thing but four times use a for loop at the beginning the boxes will auto be automatically stacked okay so we're all doing all this tap tap it needs to put it on inside the loop so i'm gonna do four i in oops for i and range repeat four times because there will be four more times um do after the asian.place forward i'm going to do agent dot move and do backward how many times six so go back to the beginning because the agent that collect all will only collect one bar at a time okay okay okay so the piston lifted out left the bars out so the agent will have enough space to put the bottle okay now we're gonna go to activity 2. so now we're going to talk to the tester so the tester says could i ask for your help i've been testing the agent and i found that if it spins left 20 times that's when your clothes get clean however i can't get the program to work could you write some code so that will some code that will make the agent go into the machine spin around left 20 times then go out okay so first let me go here so this is the pretend wash machine and agent nissa get the lever chest plate which is basically the clothes that you clean spin around here to clean and close and then go back okay so part one waste them code so that the agent will pick up the dirty laundry move forward into the machine spin left 20 times and then get out of the machine to place the clean laundry on the other side of where the dirty laundry was so we have a code agent.collector doll you can download for it seven times and agent that drop all four so first i'm gonna do for i1 and range from how many times 20 20 times because you need to spend 20 times then we're gonna do asian dot turn left left okay then we're going to do a change dot collect how about this is this in the loop let's see no okay i'm going to do agent dot move back seven times oops back seven times so go back to the beginning and then agent dot drop left okay oh drop underscore all so drop all the clean clothes left okay so now let's right now it's spinning okay now this is enchanted so it's so critically cleaned now let me go here okay part two out of the same coast that the h does the same thing but for free loads of laundry do this by using for loop before all the other code so we are gonna do all this do a tab because we're going to do it in the loop all right you enter so for oh there's no this tab okay you're gonna do four i two two in range repeat three times so we'll do three loads of laundry is that correct okay now that's one okay let's go let's go clean agent okay so now the cleaning chest plate now needs to clean the boots okay he loses cleaning yeah i think now i think it's pants he has pants yay so now there's armor okay this is complete let's go to activity three they're carpets so we're gonna talk to the programmer so the programmer says sorry to bother you could i get your help i'm trying to make the agent vacuum dirt awesome carpets but i can't seem to get the agent to vacuum the whole carpet it just goes over a small part could you write some code that will make the legion vacuum the whole carpet okay so okay so i think the seeds are the dirt because they look pretty like dirt okay the agent needs to clean the carpet so part one write some coats so that the agent will go over every block small carpet and pick up the dirt so first there is agent dot collect all agent dot move forward one and agent move right one okay so first over here we are going to do for i1 and range okay we're going to do it seven times so we're going to put these two lines inside that over here okay then for i to arrange we are going to do it also seven times okay then we're gonna do tab agent dot collect all so collect all the seeds around it then you're going to do agent dot move back yeah that's it okay go back one time then go and do occasion dot okay so now we are gonna run it okay yay that's how it goes through the whole carpet so i clean up all the seeds also called dirt okay now we are going to help clean a bigger carpet so part two is the same kill said the agent does the same thing before the larger carpet do this by repeating the code three times using a full loop at the end try to make the asian drop all the dirt in the trash to its way so first we are gonna do here the four three in range okay how many times three times three times okay then you're gonna move this tab okay so now we're gonna need part two make the agent move right so we're gonna do agent dot move right one one okay that's the end third loop then we're going to do asian don't drop all right so drop all to the trash can over there in the agent that move right it is already end of loop two so we don't need the first attack because it's not endo for eye to rearrange okay so now we're not one more seed yay clean it but it's not gonna go over the whole carpet okay so throw all the seeds in the trash rockets i have the fruit all the seeds here right and then the trash can so called trash okay okay okay so now you're gonna join the elevator okay so now we're back at the start well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
