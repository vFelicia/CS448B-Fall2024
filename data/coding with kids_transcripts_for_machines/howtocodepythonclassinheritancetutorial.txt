welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about inheritance in python so first we have a class so a class is basically a blueprint for objects so first we have a class called vehicle then we're going to death which is defined move cells this is a function or a method so vehicle can move so print when you do the function move it will print moves 10 miles then we're going to define another function method called recharge and then it'll print print gains 10 gallons of gas so it can like refill its gas so we need inherent so we don't need to like copy and paste all the methods of one class to another class so we can just like inherit it and we don't need a copy and paste we okay then we can do class truck so we did vehicle over here to inherit so a truck can also move and recharge so it also adds its load because of the truck so print loads 100 boxes then we're going to do class ambulance then it also inherits vehicle then it'll define flash so ambulance have lights or print flashes lights then it'll define move self so it also has a move printer moves 50 miles so it also has a move and it hurts the class vehicle and it also hasn't moved so we'll print 10 or 50. so print 50 because we can override it so you can like upgrade is 10 miles to 50 miles then we're going to do classifier truck so it can inherit both well it can inherit two classes so it hurts truck and ambience which also it hurts from vehicles so it basically and hurts all these free classes so then it can splash because this fire truck to put out the fire it splashes water and it can override again so it has a move which is print 70 miles instead of the ambulance 50 miles which also overrided the vehicle's 10 miles then do car one equals ambience yeah okay so vehicles is the parent of the trucking ambulance and the truck and ambulance are the parents of the fire truck so it hurts is traits so then we have car one which is variable equals ambulance then a car one dot move and car when that flash don't receive it all right so it did moves 50 miles so it overrided the vehicles 10 miles and then it flashes lights i'm gonna do car one equals fire truck net they're gonna do car one dot splash so it can splash which is its own trade and it can move which is 70 miles overrided the ambulance 50 miles then it can do flash which is from also from the ambulance and it can load from the truck so it did splashes water from itself then it can move sunny miles so it override did the ambulance 50 miles because it has a move of 70 miles and flashes lights from the ambulance and loads 100 boxes from the truck so this isn't hurts well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
