welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in colorado so the instructions say they're multiplying can you make two or more mouse straws appear every time r2d2 gets one mouse draw get 20 mouse draw so one run add a master play rdt to three sound so we need okay yeah but when we touch one of them it just disappears it doesn't do anything so we so let's start okay then we need to do this when you get mouse drawer that means when we touch it add a hundred add a mouse jord so there's another one and or two we can add two yeah okay then play random sound yes so it will play around yourself so right now there's one most mouse droid and let's get it wait it's so fast now there's two more because we touched it so our mission is to get 20 miles and our score is 100 right now so that one yeah we finally got our second one now there's three that um best thing to the hardest thing about them is they're so fast yeah and they go random directions yeah and when i tried to get them yeah now there's four i'll get you let's stop it it seems there's still too little should we add more mouse draws once you touch one let's add three no four okay so this will make it easier yeah because once you touch one mouse draw four more will appear so it's easier for me to catch because there's more but still hard to catch wine is chasing around and i'm going here hey you're still up there girl ah you're tricking me come on one touch me yeah now there's a lot so there it will be easier to do whoa uh okay let's stop maybe there's twenty not don't think so yet they're all like going to the same line there's a lot yeah actually when i touch one it gives me let's stop maybe there's 20 not yet there's definitely 20. yeah well done r2d2 let's press continue that was hard now the instructions say time to visit another planet use the new commands to change your droid and its speed then get the rebel pies so right now we have code add a rebel pile so it adds it has free added rebel pie so it has freebie pipes and we're in another planet because it says set random background so the background is a random uh plan but we're slow so we need our speed set joy to a fast speed fast speed and okay now we have a different background and we're faster so we need to get the rebel pilots we i got we got one we got two where's the third one i think it's gone make your own game to pass this puzzle you need to change your george and this set is speed let's we need to change the joy so we need sector to then choose a random jewel no we need to choose the droid right now our jordi's us is always yeah okay random okay so right now we're r2d2 again yeah oh random speed i'm slow now i'm very slow how can i catch them oh i'll just set the speed too fast fast okay let's run it oh yeah we have to reset it to run out now we'll see you through yo now this is easier am i fast yes it looks like it ah let's press continue now the instructions say you're on your own now r2d2 you have all the tools you need now to create your own puzzle feel free to explore and play with all different commands and events when you're done press the finish button to continue so now it's free and you can make your own game yeah one down move joy down so when up arrow move george up and with or on the website and you can control r2d2 yeah okay i'll tell you this is what how about you do it on the website my drink will do it on the website it works here too yeah it works with your finger too because it works on an ipad let's spawn some rebel pilots i want to do randomly because i love random so i drawn to random let's do oopsies let's do where's add a storm trooper i don't like stealing sleepers but okay then when you get a stormtrooper when you get stormtrooper let's do okay play let's see shall we do a left four and then minus minus some points yeah where's my lose points oh no go down oh yeah okay 1 000 okay that's 200 so we at least need to get um one thousand i mean 100 points one get any character no let's do when we get the storm trooper we add another character or there will only be one stormtrooper will we order it i think we should add another character when run okay let's add puffer pig and when get any character no puffer pig then play what sound let's see hey where is it where is it play puffer pig sound wait yeah where's i'm using the arrows on the computer can you please use okay now we can add another puffer pig when you touch a puffer pig add a stormtrooper when we touch another stormtrooper and a puffer paste but we also need to add storms i mean points here okay where's my pickles hey yeah add a hundred points a hundred let's see who we touch ah stormtroopers chasing me and the stone cooper was going but just right behind the puffy pig yes i touched them the score was zero because i touched puffer pig the stone trooper yeah he's gonna follow you yeah but the puff of pig isn't random directions so sad guys you're 500 points we just got five puffer pigs but now the stone trooper is still chasing me let's just add two storm troopers when you touch that trooper because one is super easy don't want to touch steroids i don't want that stormtrooper to touch me but i want that puffer pig oh almost a stone trooper let's press finish oh oh yeah i have a system oh now there are two more stormtroopers now let's press finish okay finally completed our project and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye bye
