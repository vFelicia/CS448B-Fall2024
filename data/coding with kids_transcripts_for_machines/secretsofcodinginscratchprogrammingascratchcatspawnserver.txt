welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in scratch andrew's account cool stuff kit today we're gonna see my project scratch cat spawner so in this project um it's gonna spawn a bunch of scratch cats right here so first the code is when this flag is clicked that means you run it you point in definition 90 and go to like the middle that's your zero this is yours how is it playing the song so so here it says wait one second and then it will forever loop this so if key up arrow is pressed then change y by 15 let me say we'll go up if key down arrow press then change y by negative 15 then it will go down if key left arrow pressed the important direction minus 90 and change x by 15 by negative 15. then we'll face down and go down if key right air press then point direction 90 and change x by 15. then it'll look right and go right see let's test let's do it let's go okay then here this is one space can you press create clone myself when you create a clone you'll create like another character so but it's like when he says create clone of myself means it's the sprite the sprite cat when i start as close that means this is programming new clients it says forever loop go to random position wait one seconds and then change ghost effect by 25 that means it will like start to disappear let's test see that uh scratch because i press space right here it says forever play a song okay and then it will spawn cats forever okay and that's it thank you for watching subscribe to our channel and smash the like button bye bye
