welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia and my name is Andrew today we use chat chibi 2 to make a game in Python So today we're going to use Chastity BT to make a tictactoe game so we ask it can you make a tictactoe game Python and explain it to me like a python beginner so Chach GPT says certainly I'll provide a simplified version of a tictactoe game in Python and explain the code step by step for beginners so then I'm gonna explain the code so first we're going to create empties Tic Tac Toe board so you can visualize the board and know where to put your x's and circles so I'm going to create a variable called board and create a list and we're gonna put empty spaces for in range three and then we're gonna keep doing it again I'm gonna do it again so we're going to create a three times three board then we're gonna create a function called print board to actually print the six axle board so there's board and then for row and board we're going to print the line to separate the spaces where you can put your excesses and your circles and also for the um the columns and the um rows then we're going to print the board then step three we're going to create a function to check if there is a win we're going to create a function called check win with board and player then we're going to first the check rows then we're gonna use a four Loop four row on board if all the cells which or spaces in each row equals equals player for cell and row that means if all the cells have the same in a certain row have the same um have the same symbol which is extra Circle or it'll return true if it if nobody want in a row it'll check for columns and it was basically the same code before columns and then it will return true if somebody won with a column if not it'll keep going and check diagonals in the for Loop so here if board zero zero which are coordinates for the small board zero zero equals equals board one one and then two two equals the player which is a symbol we're gonna run return true and we're going to do the same for the other diagonal and if still doesn't return true we're gonna return false because nobody won yet then I'm going to create the main game Loop is which is the loop where we actually run the game so I'm going to create the current player variable equals x because X goes first they want to have a while true Loop so step five get the current players move so we're gonna do create two variables row and column in which we will input our coordinates from one to two for the row and column then it'll store our input in the row and column variables step six check if the chosen cell is valid so you may um get an invalid cell like it's out of the board or somebody already put their P their symbol there so it'll check if board row call is not an empty space if an empty space then you can put it a bit but it says not empty space it'll print an invalid move please try again and then it'll continue step seven update the board with The Current player's move when the board roll call um equals current player and then next we're going to print the updated board we're going to Simply print board and then then we're going to check for a win after um a player puts their new symbol so if check when board and current player then if it's true it'll print player whichever player it is X or uh Circle or zero or o wins and it'll break and then step 10 we're gonna check for a tie if it passes the check for if it passes um a check for a win then if all cell is not um a space that means all cells are filled but I already checked if there's a win so there's no wind so it's a tie then I'm going to print it's a tie and break and if it's not a tie or a win we're gonna switch to Knicks player and then current player equals zero which is basically Circle then if current player equals equals x else X and then here we also got May check GPT to give us a simple explanation here which you can read and then it says that's it with this code players can take turns entering their moves and the game will check for wins and ties until there is a conclusive result so now we're going to put that code in Visual Studio code and you can see the code here and now me and Kalia are going to play a game so do you want to go first you go first okay let's see I like to play I'm very good it's row zero and then I'm six zero so now I have X your turn wow one and column one so one one that's the middle so not on the on the test and I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show you um if we enter in ballot positions six and eight so it's incorrect so and then you did one one one and then out to for example I already did um zero zero so we're gonna do zero and then zero then it says invalid move please try again so now I'm just gonna put it at and put it right here which is two two okay so now um hmm one Sarah so now she's threatened it so I have to block it which is one two okay now you're you have to block it now zero two no I have to block that the diagonal so I think it's gonna be it's hot yeah two zero okay so there are two more spaces two that's one one two one so now it's a tie so I have to do zero one so then it's that's hot let's play again you go first zero two um let's do two zero so I block the leg two two block it one two uh one one okay see so we block it here that's zero zero I think it's high again zero it has a tie two one zero one so now let's see if what happens if somebody wins so let's simply do zero zero and then this guy the the second player does two zero zero then I do one one so now I'm threatening Pretender dumb they do one zero and then if I'm gonna win I'm gonna do two two so then player X wins so if player Oh wins the LSA player Oh wins yeah so now you can try this out and play with people well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
