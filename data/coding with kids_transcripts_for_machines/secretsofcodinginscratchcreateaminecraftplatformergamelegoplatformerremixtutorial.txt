welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch and andrew's account techno468 so today i'm going to show you my remix the minecraft platformer originally it was a lego platformer first let's show you the first few levels okay i really love the music so let's see what i changed to the city the lego guy it's supposed to be called that it's supposed to be called lego but oopsies yeah it is guy it's supposed to be lego guy so this is the costumes yes i changed it into steve because i got a gif which is a moving picture of a yeah but it's still different see we those are walking yeah this is like more drawy yeah so i changed the lego person to a stage you can still see the lego in them but the minecraft and you're covering it yeah so here this is like when you when you like get hurt or like die like this you need it you need to split up the costumes right yeah so i got i uploaded a steve take a picture and like i copied some the parts of the body and then i like paste them with this tool copy yeah copy and paste tool and paste them in their body parts are going through the costumes you can see if you will touch something that that's bad like this changes yeah you know if that's the thumbnail you like split into pieces and you dance all over the air so i did the same costumes for your character with your music moving it might be a trick for people who haven't played they think it's like a good guy that can't help you but it's not just a bad guy yeah he's just walking around the usual bad guy having a but when i played that platformer i didn't actually know what he was supposed to do but then i touched me and i split into pieces he's an enemy no okay so i did the same gif and the same costumes as yours d so you might kind of get confused yeah let's do the thumbnail right no this is not the third oh yeah so this is like the sky the background and change this sun to the minecraft sun it's not actually so minecrafty it's just like a basically white square and then the lively lava is this lava no this is not the lava i changed oh yeah so these costumes are empty because on those levels there is no lava so i changed the lava to like i covered the old lego lava that makes me a lot of it yeah yeah a little yeah so i also uploaded most of these images yeah so these on the costume 15 i left a bit of these because they're out of the screen because if you go here out of these yeah if it's out of these they're not in the screen so the core two is like what's on the the level so oopsies so like the grass the mushrooms so they're like yeah they're just decorating the levels they're they don't actually do anything so like i changed the grass and the mushrooms into minecraft grass and mushrooms so uh so this is so this is um sugar sugar canes and yeah i thought it was a bamboo bag yeah so sad then from now so this is from there this is the minecraft so i uploaded it and yeah so then i copied this minecraft with the copy and paste tool and pasted it over the lego and i did i copied this costume from the steve and paste it here yeah yeah but jump let's go oh maybe is you can't see them you just need to jump over that chainsaw and then you just jump over there oh crystal enemy hello enemy you must be mining but he has a trick in it blends into the background so you can't actually see it these spikes are just part of the background this one you can split your pieces oh yeah but they're mostly easy well you can check out the project yourself and on the link in the description yeah and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
