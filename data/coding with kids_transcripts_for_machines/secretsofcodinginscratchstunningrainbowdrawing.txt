welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and today i'm gonna be showing my project called rainbow drawing so first we have our first stop one and well one green flat is clipped which means you start a project for it will point in direction pick random so it will prick made between these two numbers negative 180 to 180 so it will point in that direction then forever it will move 10 steps then if on edge on the edge of the screen it will bounce if we don't have this then it will do like this screen and it won't return to you except if you have the code to return back to somewhere near the screen like this code um go to that code uh so we need this so dot 2 and dot 3 has the same kind of code because we need three dots then we have a change dot which is completely not the same so at first erase all because when we press this it will drop so when we erase we will erase it okay let me erase it again we just need to get every song okay now it's erased then set pin size to a pin we will let it dry on the stars backdrop looks so beautiful then forever pen up then go to dot one that one is the red one then pen down so we can start drawing go 2.2 and dot 3.2 is orange and dot free is yellow i'm making the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow okay i don't have green blue and purple but you violet then got go 2.2 and free and change pen color by 10 so make a beautiful but if i change color by one let's see what happens whoa this looks so beautiful okay it looks so beautiful so we're gonna add one more dot oh god first i'm gonna draw the dots so uh it will be green because it's part of a rainbow i need to be yup green and then i gotta paint it 30. i think this is big enough i think that's how the usual ones are yep 30 then we need to code to make it faster we just need to get this drag on the code you need then it's like blue then when it is green that means they received a code and look it has the same code as that 3.2 and that one but right now its name is sprite one then let's do it to dot dot four but don't think this isn't all the thing you need you still need to go to that four here or else that four is just like a this bouncing bouncing it's doing nothing it's doing nothing okay so that's why we need a dot for that go to whoa this is so cool it's like yeah but uh but first i'm just gonna put it somewhere else we will put it here go what will it look like wow that looks so pretty i'm just gonna full screen it looks so pretty oh it's like paralyzing me it looks so beautiful that's why i named it rainbow drawing because it's rainbow and thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
