welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python today we're going to learn about python modules so models use import to reuse functions across different files so first we have a file called deck.py so first we do def create deck so we defining a function called create so we're free lists suits equals heart spades clubs and diamonds and then ranks equals two three four five six seven eight nine ten jack queen can ace so if two four statements and the suits and ranks list we're gonna make a deck of cards and we're gonna use the deck list to put all of the cars in the list so then we're gonna make the deck so four suit and suits so it's gonna check the items first suits and then we're gonna put a four statement inside of four stick so for rankin ranks now deck.append so a pen is a list helper function that will add the item and we're going to do f string rank of suit the first time it runs these four statements in the suit suits list it will be checking hearts and ranks list it will be checking too so add the card two of hearts now keep repeating that until ace of diamonds and then we're gonna return deck so save it and then go to module.py so we're going to import the file deck so we can use the functions in the deck.py and then we're going to do cars which is a variable equals deck dot create deck so we can use the create deck function inside the deck file then it's gonna force card and cards print cards so it'll print every card in the create deck so save it and run so it did all of these cards there's a lot of cards so started with two of hearts and then ended with ace of diamonds so i printed all 52 cars just as we fought and it worked well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash your like button and subscribe bye bye
