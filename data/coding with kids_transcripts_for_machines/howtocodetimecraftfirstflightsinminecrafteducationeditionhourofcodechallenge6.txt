welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition and we're in timeout which is an hour of code yes so we need to select a time split let's say that this one which is like a balloon with a car balloon that is tied to a car that's weird go through time let's go yay get the brief get free here's a time speed where airplanes never took off literally now everyone is using balloons to travel but that idea is just full of hot air yeah that's weird yeah there are no airplanes now everyone's using balloons that's kind of risky even if it pops then it goes down travel to the united states during the early nineteen thousands and make sure the first flight ticks to the skies okay and enter the pot button press it in united states of america 1900 okay flight engineer where did these holes in my runway come from they'll never get enough speed to lift off now if this flight fails people will continue to mock me from their air balloons and will never fly like the bird this flight engineer is trying to make um planes but the people that are using balloons mock him so he's trying to prove that airplanes actually work tara oh no it looks like the flight engineer is about to give up let's fix this airstrip start your mission by using your talk device to call the time agent okay use the top device start activity so the time returns here you can see hot air balloons tear fantastic now that the timing is in place let's use code to repair the run away there are holes in the runway right here there's holes here and look you can see balloons hot air balloons yeah so we need to do this run away like like fix it and then um airplanes will be back so that's code code one of the first airplanes is about to take off but there are holes in the runway so if there are holes in the runway you can't take off yeah because they the um road will be very bumpy code your asian to fill the holes with dirt blocks we've given it okay so let's see where the hole is so there are several holes to here right in front of the edges so let's fix these first okay first we need to move forward then we're going to place down down repeat it two times down two times yeah yeah four times two so um the asian already has dirt blocks in this inventory cool so now we need to move forward two times and turn turn right move right two times so let's see let's just put it forward by one by two just yeah move sideways agent move we don't need to repeat we don't need to repeat oh yeah move four by two and move right by two okay let's go one two one two okay okay now we do the exact same thing we did at the first time now let's just move here and move repeat two times agent move one time and agent place down oopsies place down bounty down down okay you can go yay still two more holes so it's the same path it's like repeated three times so you can do a whole larger program but with more repeat loops yeah then you can do it one time stand do this let's go let's go oh that's so fast now this is uplifting that's a pun runway has been restored let's give this glider another try sure man congratulations time split repair great good job you've repaired this moment in time thanks to your code modern flight has been saved and people can again travel anywhere in the world in hours now flight is more out faster scanning it's scanning detected okay let's see search area oh it's right there i just saw it up here press it yeah oh it's right outside you found the secret room take note of which time agents you see here and head back to the institute there is pixie and yeti that's end mission which time jumping pixie pixie sus no yes this is okay so now we're going to do other time splits in other videos yeah okay well now there's a on plane yeah the planes got back i think this is the engineer yeah so now the planes come back yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
