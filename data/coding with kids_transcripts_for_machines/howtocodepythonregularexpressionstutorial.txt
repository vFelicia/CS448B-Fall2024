welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you that so today we're going to learn about regular expressions so regular expressions is a tool that tries to find a pattern in our sentences so for example if you want to sign up in a website there might be requirements for a password like underscores and uppercase letters so first we'll do import read which is regular expressions then when you do pattern you close read.comply and kalia so andrew and kalia will try to find andrew kaley in our sentences then we're going to do print read.search so search is a function as try to search our pattern in which is andrew and kalia in our sentence so our first sentence is andrew likes minecraft so i'm going to save it and say dead re dot match object because it found andrew in the sentence span equals 0 2 6 so it tells us the span that that means which where it is in the sentence and there's index here so there's one i mean zero one two three four five and six okay then it tells us the match is andrew because it can't find kalia inside our sentence next the sentence we're going to try is i think khalil likes it too so now we're going to save it so did read.match object again the span now is 8 to 13 and the match is kalia because i can't find andrew in it last we're going to do print three dot search pattern welcome to coding with kids so now let's save it and finally so did none because it can't find andrew or kalia inside the pattern so it returns then print undo def which is defined validate email your pattern pattern eagles read.compile your patent then we have a list called emails with free emails which we are going to try this functional andrew at gmail.com kalia hotmail.net and youtube minecraft.minecraft so then we're going to do a for loop for each email in the list emails if not read up match pattern email so if it doesn't match d packer i'll print fail to match then email else i'll print valley email address then we'll do a pattern so there's a pattern you can do a to z and calculus a to z 0 to 9 and a bunch of symbols then there's a top validate email packages save it so it did value my address valid email address and valid email address so all of our email addresses were found to this pattern make sure to change the pattern so after the dot it was supposed to be w plus but now after the dot we change it to dot com.net or dot org to pass through validate email save said valid email address valid email address and then failed to match youtube at minecraft.minecraft because this email after a dot it doesn't have a com net or it has minecraft so it didn't match so to fail to match youtube but minecraft.minecraft well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
