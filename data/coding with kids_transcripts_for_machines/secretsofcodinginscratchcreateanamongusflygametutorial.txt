welcome to quitting with kids my name is andrew today is scratch it and in andrews account techno468 today i'm going to show you my project called a mangas fly so first we have a sprite called science so it's like flappy bird but it's different so when up arrow key press change y by 10 okay so let's show you oh no dodge the buildings okay so now let's show you the code so when up arrow key press change y by 10 so it'll go up and then you can also use space to go up and then when down arrow key press change y by negative 10 so you will go down so green flag collector will go to its start position which is like in the middle right here so one green flag clicked if key space press then else change y by negative 10 wait 0.2 seconds and then when green flag collect it'll switch costume to sign because it also has a game over costume and then do set the variable coins position random score and lie to zero that will lie to free and then do when green flex oops clicked then forever if touching buildings that's the obstacle you'll change lives by negative one and then it will wait five seconds so it'll like won't change your lives like so fast then when green flags like that forever if loss equals zero that means when you like lose all your lives now switch causing to costume one which is the game over and stop all so to stop the game and also play good to be alive now the coin spices like a mario coin so when green flags click it'll hide and go to this position then for reflect clicked for forever if touching sign which is the player then i'll change coins by one and then change score by 150 so each coin is 150 score then i'll wait one second so it also won't add too much points then when green flag clicked it'll show now four set position random to pick when one two three so it's a variable then if position random equals one then go to start or call up so it's a sprite that is right here there's three of them for the start positions of the obstacles and the coins then wait 0.4 seconds and then repeat 4 seconds change what x by negative 10 and wait one second so keep going for the player then if position random equals 2 then it'll go to the middle and it'll change y by change x by negative 10 i mean 100 and go forward the player again and wait one second so then in the buildings which is the sprite from scratch when green flags click so high so the buildings is the obstacle so in green flag clicked ill forever if touching sign then change score by negative 150 so l minus 150 and then wait three seconds so it also won't minus too much points then when green flag clicked it'll show so it's like basically the same code as the coin but it'll go to the middle and down it can't go up or it'll like block all everything and you'll like definitely lose life so there's up down and the middle so these are where like the starting of the obstacles and collectibles and then up the only collectibles which is the coins then down is only obstacles and the middle is for both of them so now let's play so omelettes here 1000 five one thousand points yeah it's a little easy because you get a lot of points but it doesn't well minus the same points if you touch up like build it up yay if the building is down it's like much easier because you don't even need to go down i've too far oh no the building went to the middle but the coins all almost always goes up we'll stay up let's see what if we what happens if we touch if we our lives go to zero i touch the building on purpose yeah i have two last three thousand yay wow at 21 now let's go to the um get more calls yeah oh yeah oh no yeah like they sound they stopped on purpose and then you see the game over so i got three thousand okay oh no you got negative 150 because you spawned on the building oh no back up oh no oh no you move quickly that was too scary buildings yeah don't come into the middle building depending on if which is the player can go anywhere yeah well it's only like over here in the world over here i think it's worth it oh you've got to die go to the middle oh man i'm gonna go to one life and minus your school yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
