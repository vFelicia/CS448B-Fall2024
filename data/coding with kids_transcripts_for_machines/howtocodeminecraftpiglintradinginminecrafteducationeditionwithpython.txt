welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is today i'm learning minecraft education edition so as you can see we're in the nether because we're going to do some pickling training so on chat command piglet i'm going to use the builder teleport to where you are so the builder is basically an invisible agent suited for building and then we just call builder yeah so we also are going to use the agent so both the builder and agent are going to go to so agent's going to set blocker items so the agent is going to get 64 golden ingots in slot 1 so the agent also has an inventory so we're going to be using these golden ingots to trade with the piglets since pickling like um golden ingots so yeah yeah so agent said i active slot one then agent dot move agent move right by one and then now we're going to use the builder so repeat five times for the like cage where you'll get the piglet you don't want them running all around it's going to be hard to trade with them yeah so build our trace path for mark with so it's a fence and builder move forward by four that'll be one side then build a turn left for then get ready for another side so it'll make the cage so now let's test it out and see what loot we can't get but first let's see and type okay so death on the chats is a function brother dot teleport to position zero zero zero which is where you are yeah then agent dot teleport to player so the agent will also come the agent that set item gold and get 64 gold and gets in slot one agenda set slot one so this active slot is one and agent dot move right one so it won't be in the cage or stuck in the fence or else we have to like very hard try to get it out yeah so for index and range five so it's a repeat loop build in that trace path oak fence so builder that move forward four so there'll be one side and then builder the turn left turn get ready for another side and then it'll build the cage so player that on chat when you take picklin on the chat i'll run the function now let's try it okay you might want to like um get some pickling um spawners yeah that would be better if they're included you know okay okay that was oh the agent is still stuck you can get the gold ingot still even if it's stuck inside okay they're all crossbow oh that's your first goal is any of them going to get uh enchantment or something oh almost that has chest plate and helmet so now we can you can just drop a lot yeah drop them and then they'll just pick them up and then they'll stare at it and drop something after a little while they drop something they're like oh they gave you a lot okay on the first round let's see we have more absolutely so much of city and 64 and another one we have a soul sand black stone 10 arrows two fire charges two ender pearls and a potion of fire resistance pink ones themselves aren't immune to fire okay oh look there's more than over there yeah okay some are late because you they pick it up like okay what did we get we got more um blackstone yeah okay next round oh they spam oh there is crying obsidian yeah okay the gold armor is still staring at it okay let's see what we got okay let's see we got more fire charge we have two more fire charges some crying obsidian another brick and some leather leather i guess the leather is the most useless yeah they get those nyx rounds oh that one already had one all will have one you just stare i think some of them gave you um strings yeah oh this one too okay let's review we have 12 12 strings that's a lot oh one more obsidian we have a lot of obsidian um we got some more nether bricks i think i can't keep track yeah and i think we got more crime obsidian next it will be useful if you had um a notebook right next to you and write it down yeah keep track respond more you might want to make the cage bigger yeah you can extend it drop more the ones that are moving don't have any hmm they just wait for the last two he's still staring correct oh that one gave us a five charge they can give us very rare like such as potions yeah but they only give us um viruses splash potion of fire resistance got another post shrinking potion oh one more um crying obsidian before you love them more i don't know uh we got a few more arrows and we have a lot of blacks from there 56 but i'm also full and one more obsidian yeah they love obsidian okay let's drop the last round drop every single one of them i don't think i think it will take oh i dropped all of them yeah but there's still some of them yeah okay the ones that are lucky get to pick the um ones that are left there there's one on the fence okay oh collect the loot ooh there's some new stuff this round yeah the water bottle water bottle two water bottles another splash portion of fire resistance another another one and 27 networks that's rare and then gravel i don't play this graph well you can try to trap them okay i think there's still a little more i don't think so they're all moving they're all moving well there
