welcome to the curtain with kids my name is kalia today we're in scratch in my account kid.com123 and in this project i remixed called enemy enemy smash so looks like there's a creeper head arrow t and potion press space so kalia is hitting the creeper head yeah so i changed the player first so there's the costume one which is the arrow these are like ranged weapons you can throw there's a arrow which you need to use a bow tnt it used to be a ball so it's called costume ball two ball free i turned it into a tnt and it's a potion red potion it was supposed to be three different kind of balls so there's a dot which is supposed to be like a circle which you hit with the balls now i change it into creeper because i really don't like creepers in minecraft they keep exploding me up man i don't just don't like these creepers and there's a pen which is like the health of the creeper i changed it from there the arrow and the creeper head and the title and there is the menu the title and a mismatch very big right now if it's it's like when you start it it's right here changing color because the cold code make its change color and there's ball one because you need tap to change so when you start there's the arrow because it's the first one tap the arrow to change ball one ball two and ball feet which is just like the players it's the same costume but just need to click them to choose which one you want and that's all i changed and now let's play i'll go first hmm i want to use a tnt the tnt is the hardest because it's the biggest yeah but for the easiest for me is actually the potion i have no idea why but it really should be the arrow oh you must be good diamond oh man last time my high score is 31. oh creeper you don't have so much defense points to you there's the high score in global high school well you can try out yourself well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye
