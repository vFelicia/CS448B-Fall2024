welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in timecraft So today we're gonna do this last one looking like a sign like a tube signed Tube without anything in it so let's go let's click go to tampon hi time agent press button press and this time split it seems our knowledge of chemistry is disappearing let's head off to the 1890s Paris and visit the lab with this famous chemist known for a great scientific discoveries perhaps the mystery of our missing chemistry can be solved here as well okay let's go press button see two one Boop laboratory Paris France 19 1890s chemist where did those samples go I can't find them anywhere I guess it's back to the drawing board oh she's turning she's going away here she go it appears that copper has hidden all the chairs samples she used to discover important elements start your mission by using Talk device to teleport the time agents to a starting location so let's see I'm gonna eat one slice sorry Thomas okay oh oh no yummy cake yummy cake no yeah yeah I want to eat the cake okay okay let's go use our top this is weird look there's a there's a there's a green green thing okay this is start activity oh it's on the Shelf look the elements are radiating let's use code to uncover the hidden elements for the chemist so I think the elements are right here yeah it's like sparkling and stuff see code start tutorial and the chemist left the room someone hid her research inside the bookcase could you age to destroy the green glowing book okay so now she can share her Discovery so first we have to move up because um it's like one block higher than my agent first near reached the bookshelf before you can destroy it yeah so let's go back to coding move up by one and then AJ moved forward because he can't move to the trap doors yeah forward by by let's see how many see so we're here one two three four four times four and then destroy to destroy the black Shelf okay let's see go go go go go you can destroy it it turned but I'll turn then oh so agent destroyed forward no no no no no oh we only needed a straw destroy it I mean just disappeared oh oh she came back the chairman suddenly came back what do we have here it's my missing samples now I can complete my research she's holding them right no no amazing work you've prepared this moment in time now the chance will go on to win two Nobel prizes for our work and change the world for the better this is mostly um oh I don't I think we can't ship wow oh the door's here you found the secret room take note of which time you should see here and headed back to the Institute Banshee I think it's Yeti because last time I'm gonna create some misery I'm gonna do Banshee no action okay look at me she looked at us teleport it's yes daddy okay let's go back to the time split oh look it's full screen and the background is red like let's jump over to here oh it's a pet it's a pet collar for the and this is the one we did today it's weird it's just a green blob there's more things here this is the Apollo 11. okay this is the oh yeah the mom and Lisa okay this is a castle the Wall of China okay this is the this is the Apollo what is that I don't know this is a pyramid pyramid and this is the trumpet it's the first one we ever did yeah let's go back up up up so let's see that one I oh I think that the the one is maybe what was it this one the one that the one that was very weird I don't know it looks so weird because the balloon it looks just so weird okay look it's a little Among Us well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remembering to smash like And subscribe bye bye
