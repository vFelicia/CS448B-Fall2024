welcome to quitting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition hour of code Escape estate so in the last video we went to the side rooms and unlocked the Cannons and now we have this time portal so let's see what we have to do with code the time agents are underneath this High Mark they've used their powers to create protective colored rings around we used to activate Canon function to activate the colored cannons in the same order as the colored rates to disable the timeline to activate K9 function takes one parameter that defines what color Canon you want to activate blue yellow magenta and green okay so the protective frames so the outside is first is blue and the end screen and yellow and then magenta okay and this is just the time okay so let's go to code so this is the code example the first is blue so the code example first part is the blue Canon right there then it's gonna shoot blue and improve the blue ring then next gonna do the yellow the yellow but it's wrong because the Nyx room is the green one okay so you can see that fish since he's blue he has the blue ring then when the blue ring bursts he fell down okay it's weird that Rascal doesn't happen he's the boss yeah so now first is blue which is right and the second one is green so we're gonna change it to three and then we're gonna do the same with other other functions and then the last one is Magento then we will break all the ribs okay okay so now let's run the code and we should break all the Rings in protection that they have so first the blue kit boom so now magenta gets full it's knocked out next the green one boom and there's only two more the yellow one and now the last one it's gonna shoot another no more protection rules it's only Rascals oh time oh he also got locked up and the time will disappear Tara so the time ages extend over the time or two now's our chance that we should rotate the magnetic disc beneath the floor you can reverse the Polaris and trapped in there track them here once and forth itself break this glass or something they move it okay and then they will get trapped in there forever okay so now let's see okay activate the trap now it's your chance to capture the Time regions into the center of the Boss Arena and look down you'll need to align all three rings with the center colors of the trap to activate it rotate room continue to rotate each ring either clockwise or counterclockwise to align all the colors the other rings are outer middle inner and valve directions are clockwise it counts are clockwise okay so let's see the cut example oh so there are three rings as you can see and you have to align the colors or the numbers it's us with the middle so each so they all have numbers on the columns Okay so you spell border let's see what we have to do okay so let's go to so first let's see it rotates that outer one the outer ring clockwise so let's see what this is okay so does that okay so that the first the first two lines of code no you have to align like with the center colors so like the outer ring will have to move one side um clockwise wait counterclockwise I clockwise yeah it has to move counterclockwise the old ring has to move counterclockwise once okay so let's see okay and then let's see the I don't know okay so the outer ring is good and then now we have to do the middle one middle ring so this the middle ring is also good oh yeah it is so now we'll just have the inner ring the inner ring we need to go either counterclockwise or clockwise be wise so it doesn't really matter to rotate ring called The Middle inner ring and we're gonna move that clockwise and we're just gonna repeat that two times and you're here so now we should have aligned okay let's see okay so the outer two rings are aligned and then for the final inner ring okay puzzle solved it's another completed Trophy and locked in the middle and we're gonna get out of the glass and then we're gonna get sucked in oh boy the thing won't pop out now they're getting inside and now they're traveling Tara you did it you really stuck it to those timings or should I say you really stuck those top ages to this top sorry I'm still working on this thing she's all right ages so we're right here to think about what they have done after you come with me I'll show you the way out let's go Escape From The Mansion congratulations your coding skills saves the day again who knows what trouble the time idiots will have stirred up if they had escaped the estate well done there's still one question I have those diary Pages where do you think they came from you still don't know who they're trying a guy pop out it's the actual Dr brickowski do it from me Dr dots forkowski those temporal troublemakers lured me to this place too I've actually been trying to escape for weeks whatever you did in there helped me finally find a way out thank you he's an old guy yeah I'm glad you're safe and I think we've heard the last one time it just for a while now please let's get out of here this place gives me those musicals okay so Dr groupowski I got those million emeralds sorry kid I'm broke when you said it was saving the world of the cookie after all the original Dr Bukowski was was the time yeah thank you so now if I face oh it's a big mansion it's rascal did you see in the window so creepy just zoomed up okay so that's all well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like that and subscribe bye bye
