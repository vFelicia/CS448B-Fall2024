welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew general miranda education today i'm going to show you my coding project called iron golem via zombie so which is basically um gladiator project and um microsoft made code but i changed it a little so on chat command arena so when you type arena in chat it'll build that teleport to play our world position so where you are in the world and the ability to move back by 10 and then builder will move right by 10 blocks now the builder will place a mark and then where p four times able to move forward by 20 and build a turn left so it'll do this four times so here when it does build up builder move forward by 20 and builder turn left it's basically making one side of the um cage or like um yeah arena where the iron golem will be fighting the zombies and they'll build a raised wall for mark with um we'll use polished and the site of five so it'll do five bucks high and it'll do the wall here in the repeat four because it placed the mark before it did the repeat four times in the building move so after it makes the arena they'll repeat 50 times to spawn monster zombie at zero zero zero so basically where you are standing then you can spawn the zombies and then you can um make iron golems to fight them okay so now let's see it in python so def on a chassis is a function builder.teleport to player position to teleport to the builder and then the builder will move back 10 blocks then it will move right to 10 blocks the builder that place marks so place a mark for the wall and then four index range four so repeat four times builder that move forward twenty and then builder that's her left turn so it will like go the other way to put the other side yeah another wall of the arena and then builder that range wall polished and site five blocks so i'll make the walls and then for index two in range fifty so repeat fifty times mob dot let's just stop right the zombies will probably um disappear before the iron golem can attack um all these days i'm gonna go to settings and do um not always day so now we're to do change time to night arena okay that's 50 that's quite quick oh there's a baby zombie with um full golden armor a baby i don't know i just saw it so i'm just gonna place um light so you can see more clear to this dark this oh this is not baby zombie clunching onto it's mama oh well it's apparent and um there's a zombie with a full email and an enchanted subject yeah so i recommend you to do this on flat world because here's uneven baby yeah and then here there's a chainmail on helmet and then there's a sword and another shovel by a regular circle the other ones are mostly just regular zombies this one is the most lucky yeah lucky angola three against fifties yes forty nine that's one of the biggest i'm that one is cornered in a corner cornered in the corner this one is oh oh no one of them unfailed now this one is trapped in the corner yeah two isn't it three i think i need four maybe okay still about thirty no i'm just gonna spawn one for now wow they hit the chain the one with the chainmail yeah but not the full chain my arm right yeah it's the same treatment armor still over here it's in the middle of the crowd yeah some of them pick up the rotten flesh yeah one of them has a days now it's cornered okay four i think i'll take five i think it's gonna take six six yeah i think that's too much sesame yeah six is in six for fifty zombies yeah six okay that's reasonable so the angle has a little advantage because it has um ball damage oh yeah one of the enchanted shovels now it's cornered and the zombies also have their own advantage because they corner the iron golem and push it back okay so this is our fifth okay go there's still like 25 around 25. this one's a lot i got yeah so the iron bomb gets disadvantaged when the zombie hits doesn't um disappear but then it just when the iron color is attacked yeah because its target is at a beach i saw the baby zombie also attacking from its parent okay six okay i changed my mind seven eight eight how about you i think seven no eight yeah this is still a little too much for the eye it won't take ten i'm telling you it won't take ten oh no it got cornered again the fall damage isn't enough yeah okay this is our eighth right yeah no this is oh no no he's still here yeah this target is there are a lot of zombies that they're pushing it sometimes it changes it's actually pretty hard to just defeat yeah it's on on the top of the wall now i'm gonna let it down okay so we have one two three four five six seven eight eight more zombies this is our ninth so we only need nine nine zombies actually barely do any damage and it's like one oh yeah one or two hitting okay okay five more four more finally that's a lot nine you need to use nine to just defeat fifty uh under what took eighteen yeah so but i think our girls had a disadvantage because we didn't spawn them all at once yes i think they're going to complete it very fast yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
