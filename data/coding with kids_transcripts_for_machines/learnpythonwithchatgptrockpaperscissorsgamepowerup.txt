welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're use chat gbt to make a game in Python So today we're going to use trash gbt to make a rock paper scissors game with a power up in Python so I encountered a lot of bugs and we fix them all and here's the game so by the way the double down power up lets you use two items in one round like you can choose paper and scissors in one round and we're going to play against a bot so first we're going to import the random module to allow us to use code and functions inside it then we're going to do a function called get player choice we're going to do while true we're create a variable called choice and it ask us enter a choice rockes or double up we're use the lower function then we can enter answer and that answer is going to be stored in the choice variable then if choice is in the list of valid answers then it will return Choice else if it's invalid answer it'll print invalid Choice please choose some rock paper scissors or double up then we're going to create a function called get bot choice we're going to turn random that choice rock paper or scissors so the bot doesn't have the double up power up and it'll choose a random Choice from these three then we're going to have the play game function we're going to have player choice and Bot Choice then the player choice is equal to double up that means use the double up power up going to print you use the double up power up then it's going to ask us for two choices and you it can be the same if you want for some reason then it it'll show you what you played you played blah blah blah and blah blah blah with the double up power up then it will store in the variable then it will print your choice and the boss Choice then if instance player choice is a duple player it'll have two variables player wins and Bot wins for item and player choice if item is equal to bot choice or these cases where you win win it'll do player wins plus equals one else it'll add one to the bot wins variable if player wins is equals to bot wins it return it's a tie else if player wins is more than bot wins you win and then else bot wins if player choice is equal to a bot Choice it will return it's a tie else if these winning cases for you a return you win else bot wins and then the main code is print welcome to rock paper scissors with a double up power up it's like introducing the game so while true player choice it get your player your choice and the bot Choice and then it'll store the result in the result variable then it will print the result if you win you lose or it's a tie then there's a choice to play again do you want to play again yes no then if play again if your answer is not yes it will break and then here we W run the code so now let's play play you want to go first you go first okay so first I'm just going to play regular I'm going to do rock then watch those paper so bot wins that's sad do yes which one should I choose now double up double up you use the double up power up let's choose Rock So typos can be bad so add the extra space there then scissors so after you answer you can't add extra space or else it'll be any valid choice you chose rock scissors and boto scissors you win cuz I had Rock so the scissors tied okay so I want to play now okay yes okay so your choice double up okay um scissors and paper bot chose Rock so it's a tie because rock beats scissors so the bot has one point and paper beats Rock so you also have one point so it's zero let's play again one last time you want to use double up yeah you choose one and I'll choose one double up I choose Rock okay then I'll choose paper you choose paper and rock bot choose Rock we win because rock and rock is a tie and we beat the Rock with the paper so you can also do this um with your friends and play together or by yourself well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe byebye
