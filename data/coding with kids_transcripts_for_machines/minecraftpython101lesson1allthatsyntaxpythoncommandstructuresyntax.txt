and python 101 so today we're going to do lesson one all that syntax so now i'm going to create the world so today i want to learn about easy syntax so first i'm going to talk to the ceo so ceo says oh it's very nice to see you i am the ceo of codingmind a company that makes a huge variety of software however we are having a bit of trouble with some of the code whatever we do pesky books seem to be popping up left and right without an end in sight can you help us with this investigation of problems and help the ceo of this company with his problem so first we're going to talk to the developer so the developer says oh can you help me i can't seem to get a minecraft play from command instructor right i've tried to write it down in many different ways but i don't know which one was going to try them out in the coding window and see which one of the commands ones and then try first try this one now and when if we string it's the right one we're gonna press the button so first we're gonna do say so there's problems so this does not work now let's try number three so i'm going to try to try to play so in the chat i said ha so this one works so now we have completed this activity we're going to go to activity 2. it's now on top with the programmer so programmer says hi i need your help i know some syntax is missing from these six commands but i just can't put my finger on what it is can you help me out by trying the commands in the recruiting window and then placing the correction text box and the chest on the gold in front of the tv monitor so i'm gonna go to the chest and get this syntax so now we have these syntax blocks to fill it out so first place the missing syntax box and here we have players that say two we have no leads it is correct correct so now they're missing these then we're going to play with that shape too this is correct so now they're missing their questions then now they're missing one quotation mark because they only have one quotation mark at the beginning but there's no quotation mark yet finally we to do clear dutch day two shows and they only they're missing one okay now we're gonna go to activity looks like there's an elevator next to the data set so we're gonna talk to the data scientist so today the scientist says could i ask for your help i need to calculate and display the answer to these three expressions that are on the tv monitors can you write some some code in the coding window to calculate the correct answer and then press the corresponding button now we are going to go here and when you press the answer that is right so i'm going to do this in decoding so it says look at each of the tv monitors calculate the sum using code to use the mathematical value of numbers in the command quiz should not be used for example we can do player that say one plus one so it will say the answer of one plus one in the chat which is two so when this code is run it gives the result two work out the correct answer for the songs on the tv monitors and select the corresponding buttons so first i'm gonna do player dot say and do 27 plus four then star just times yeah this 55 minus 52. let's see what's the answer 93. so we're going to press the button so it's correct now i'm going to do this 225 divided by 15. someone believe this and do 255 divided by 15 somehow you're missing one oops right 17 it's right in front of us yeah finally we'll do this one what player let's say 45 plus 2 5 0 5 that's 2 000 500 two five five zero right here yay less than complete now there are like rockets fireworks okay now now we are done with the lesson and we are in the elevator yeah and this is syntax well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
