welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia and today we're in Minecraft's hour of code Escape Este so in the last video of Escape estate um we went into this Mansion found the agent helped it now it opened the green door for us which is like very mysterious now we got enter loading oh that's so creepy videos agent wait before you go I need to tell you one last thing this house is filled with Escape rooms you'll need to find Clues soft puzzles and fix code to make your way out press C to reveal reveal a puzzle's code one two coats the code to see what happens if there are errors fix the code and running again to test it that is called debugging sometimes Solutions won't be clear and that not all puzzles typical to solve when you find a puzzle remember to run the code first to see what's wrong then debug and fix the positively code it's much easier than writing code from scratch keep an eye out for this Clues such as particles to help guide you close so that agent gave us some um hints and help us so we so in the first video we found this diary page now we found another one let's see entry to this study they are diary I finally found a way out of the attic only to become trapped in this strange Library I do believe the large mirror here is more than than it seems it is true is it truly a mirror or a window to another to another dimension regardlessly I have no option other than to Hasbro and see where it takes me clothes search room for particles oh there's a particle right click particles so there's like a button right here okay let's right click close right click wait oh the painting went down and this big brown ball is here okay let's see go go to Cola see what we have to do play ball maze so I guess that ball was a clay ball move the clay ball to the gold block use the clay ball move function to navigate the bot through the maze the clay ball move function takes one perimeter then defines what direction it should move it validate the directions are up down left and right so this is a cool example clay ball moves up three times let's see what it does okay oh the clay ball moves up three times well that works okay but it seems like it didn't complete our code because it nothing happened except the um clay but I'll move back all the way down okay let's go back to code use a for Loop to do one or more actions multiple times so it's like a loop well it is a loop and it's gonna help us like make our code shorter so this is the same command as the first one we tried except like only into like in a shorter version okay navigate to Clay ball through the maze to reach the gold block that the included code book below is broken can you fix it run the code to see what happens then debug it by adding it to the correct solution okay up three times oh I went to the red block instead of the gold block okay so we can't move it to the red block but the gold block okay let's see so I'm gonna turn the clay ball move up into four I in range three times so we make a loop and we're gonna do clay ball move foreign so we can get out the first line and the clay ball move um right two times because when we first found it it went to the left instead of the right we need to move to the right to go to a gold block okay right and right again what and then we need to move down three times to reach a go walk let's run it okay up for you guys yes we got it oh does it oh it's such room for particles oh that's that's the mirror wait wait but in the mirror there's like the switches oh maybe we should switch the switches that one uh that one this one and this one whoa what oh I guess there's no more particles oh it's the same okay now move on to here pumpkins things in the mirror appear differently than in the room you're in find all the differences and modify the room to make them match use move cursor to position the cursor and place block to place the Block in the position you have selected so now so we know the mirror we have to match everything in this room as the mirror is so when we switch the lights the it's like the first light has to be on and this light has to be off and this light on and now in the mirror all of the pumpkins are there but over here only three of the pumpkins are there okay let's go code okay let's see a place back okay but this is a code example it won't work okay that doesn't work so this is the code with the loop it's the same code as this but just with the loop okay let's see it will do the same exact thing okay because it doesn't work okay then now we're gonna go to here which is where we could so this this works but I think it's too long I'm just gonna copy the place block this one and then all these just delete it so we because we don't need it okay until we have nothing left okay please code here okay and then for I in range to make um to make a loop we're gonna do it five times let's see what happens if I do it five times okay and then we're gonna do move cursor blue and no place block and then move cursor so move cursor and then Place block first there Place block let's see what happens come on okay wait oh for Iron Range it's not a string oopsies it's supposed to be just an integer not a string that will work okay one two three four five yes we did it search for particles oh what's this oh it broke it broke it broke so it's true if the particles again oh what's this works oh that doesn't work okay let's see you need to flip all four lovers to open the door but you're not quick enough to do it manually see if you can figure out the order they need to be flipped then program your new friend the Speedy Knight to do it for us you see move Knight function to Define which color the speeding Knight should move to okay so this is our friend Speedy night I guess it's a statue with things to make it like a night okay so as name said it's Speedy since it said that we can't do it manually because we're too slow but speed and light should be fast enough to do that okay okay so let's see move night blue move night orange move Knight remove Knight orange that doesn't work then what are these here or maybe we should follow like this one first like move night blue and then move my Magneto and then so on like yellow to Orange let's see if that works figure out what order lovers should be flipped by paying close attention to the carpets in front of them then moving speeding Knight to each level in the correct order the speeding Knight is clever enough to flip the lever when it's in position okay so I am right these are carpets and we need to flip it so maybe you want the bluest one and then two and then yellow three and then four okay let's cook okay so move night blue and deck uh this is wrong so I mean yeah fix this this is magnata and then it's yellow and then orange so we're coating Speedy Knight to do this for us to help us okay run uh run oh it's fast well it's like teleporting boom cleared cool thank you Speedy night and suit of armor so Speedy Knight and suit of armor but suit of armor is just standing there but look there's a next place this place is finished with stuff cracked mirror and the moving painting with the clay balls the pumpkins and The Night the Lights and Speedy Knight and suit of armor next video we're gonna go in and see where it will take us next but for now let's just stay here so well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
