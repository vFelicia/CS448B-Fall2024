welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible edibit is a platform where there are lots and lots of coding problems and then you have to solve them with um different coding languages So today we're going to do three problems using python so our first problem is called equality of three values create our instructions are to create a function that takes free integer arguments a b and c and Returns the amount of integers which are of equal value here are some examples so it will give us three numbers so in this example it's three four and three so we need to um you get a function to return how many numbers are equal so here there are two threes so we will return two and then here all of them are one so that means they're all equal so we return three and then here there's three four and one none of them are equal so return zero your function must return zero two or three let's see a code so we have a function called equal and we have three variables a b and c so first we're going to make a variable called num and it's going to start with as zero then if a is equal to B and B is equal to C so if they're all equal we're going to get the num and restate it to three because all the free numbers are equal yeah so we use two uh equal marked signs to actually mean equal not to State like number is zero okay then we're going to do else if a is b or a is C or B is C so if they're each other then L num equals two there are two numbers that are equal and then if none of these not if if an L if don't work we're going to go to else and we're just going to do num equals zero because none of them are equal yeah and then we're going to return the num variable so now let's check and see the test the test will go three random numbers here and then oh here there's the number that we need to return using the num variable and then here are what here are what the numbers are so like two three and four all values are different so when you turn zero that's the console so all this past test pass test our pass yay next one our next problem is called temperature conversion write a program that takes a temperature input in Celsius which is variable and converts it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin so verified and Kelvin are both um units of temperature return the converted temperature and values in a list the formulas that calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit from Celsius is this is the formula from Celsius to Fahrenheit and this is the formula for Celsius to Kelvin so here are examples so it'll just give us um the Celsius and then when you return the fahrenheit and the Kelvin so return invalid if K is less than zero so K is Kelvin and our term calculated temperatures up to two decimal pieces we don't want the numbers to get too long so we have a function called temp conversion and we have one variable called Celsius so first we're going to make a variable which is the formula for turning Celsius into Fahrenheit so it's called f equals round so the round function will limit will make your number whatever number into how many digits you want so this is formula and then we added two for the round function to limit it to two decimal places and then we're going to do the same frame of Kelvin the variable is called K and here's the formula and we're also going to eliminate to two decimal places then we're going to do if K is less than zero we're going to return invalid and then else if K is above zero then we're okay and we're going to return the fahrenheit and Kelvin in a list so we're going to do um square brackets and F and K so let's see the tests so here it'll give us the Celsius 0 148.2 and then we're going to return the fahrenheit and Kelvin so here that you can see they're all limited to the two um two decimal places and here it's invalid wow is it really that cold okay so all tests are passed on to the final problem find the perimeter of a rectangle so create a function that takes length and width which are both variables and finds the perimeter of rectangle so here examples it will give us six and seven and then when you calculate and it's going to be 20 the perimeter is 26. okay so when you return the result let's see the code so we have a variable called find parameter and two variables which is length and width so first we're going to do half so half of the rectangle we're going to do length plus width and then we're going to do perimeter which is another variable and use the half variable and Then star two so star in Python is um multiplication so to um calculate perimeter you need to do length times two or width times two I just do length plus which you can do either way and then uh multiply it by two and then we're going to return perimeter it's very simple and we're gonna see the test so here it goes two so twenty and ten so 20 plus 10 is 30 30 times 2 is 60. so the answer the parameter will be 60. okay so all tests are passed okay so here is another two and nine two plus nine equals eleven and eleven plus eleven is 22. okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button subscribe bye bye
