welcome to kitten with kids my name is andrew today we're in funkable and i'm going to show you the project i made called the manga songs so let's preview funko ball is like for apps and phones you can play and pause the song and if you press the song again it will stop the song let me start it yeah so there is always a screen one and there's an image one i added which is the humongous image yeah and then below it is a switch one so you can like change the background color and there's a show yourself button and the pause one so suspicious and pause two so there is two variables up here it's is playing and first we're gonna set it to false and is pause and we're going to set it to false so with those variables we can know if something is playing or if something is positive when switch one which is a switch a value change so if you press it it will set screen 1 background color to random color so i've changed the background color yeah so so suspicious click and show yourself click is like the same but just the songs are different so i'm gonna tell you to show yourself so it will set the is playing variable to false andy pause two to false and cause so some song to stop so you know you can't play these songs together at the same time if not variable is playing that means if it's not playing set is playing to the truth so like if it's not is it if it's false it will set it into true and cause show yourself songs to play but over here so suspicious will be that's called soul song play and then set area variable is playing to false and call show yourself song stop because if you press it again it will pause yeah and then when pause one will click if is pause variable is false it will sit if it's playing it will set is pause to true call show yourself songs prop because pause one is belong to show yourself and then else set variable is pause to false call show yourself song resume so go play the show yourself song so you can download it on your phone and let's first see it on the computer these two songs are my favorites of the manga songs and i can play you can pause it and then if you want to break or you know get something and then play it again pause it says everybody watch out and let's play it it's like just pause it and then play it again it's the same for so suspicious song you can play it and pause it now let's see it on the phone so you see this is the phone and we downloaded the app so let's go to it it's just like the same as the computer and you can keep switching and changing the color because there's a lot of colors yeah i don't know how many you can like it's both the same it does the same exact code but this is just on the phone it's the only difference well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
