welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python today we're going to learn about function keywords so first we're going to do def print keyword r so we're defining a function called print keyword args then star star quarks which is known arguments or named arguments don't print dash and which is new line then we'll do third which is a variable equals quartz so you can type the keys and values dot get third none so if you type like third equals n you'll get your key third and then if third equals not none that means if it has a value it will print third arc equals then your value then we'll do four statements so for each key and value in quarks.item so for each key and value type it'll print f string key equals val so if you type first equals a it'll print first equals a finally we're going to print keyword arts first a so first is the key and a is the value so for the for statement it'll print first equals a and for this it'll do nothing because there's no first key then we'll do print keyword rs first equals b second equals c so it's like a b c yeah then print cable of r's first equals d second equals e and third equals f so the last time we call the function we have the third so it'll get the third and for has a value f so point four arc equals f so save it and run it so it did first equals a then then first equals b second equals c then first equals d second equals e third equals f and then for arg equals f next we'll do up here after the new line it'll print quark so it'll print like curly brackets and then first equals a then it will print the type of cost so save it and run it we're adding that code to like all right oh yeah so it did the same thing well did this first equals a is first you hit this first equals a and curly brackets is class stick which is dictionary and the first equals a again the first b for second and c in curly brackets and class dictionary again two then first equals b second equals c then first d second e third f then class dictionary and then first equals d second equals e third equals f and inferred arg equals f so it added the print quarks and that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
