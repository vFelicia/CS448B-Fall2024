coding with kids my name is kalia my name is andrew today we're in scratch in my account kidnap cod123 and this project i made called two player pokemon battle which is version one and this is venosaur via's pikachu so i try to make it fair but then so you see it's stronger so it has a little bit more help and the attacks are random so okay so pikachu go first it's one two four venosaur and nine zero i'm using the stronger attack hey it's one two for venosaur zero pikachu is sad okay so first in venezuela and pikachu they have the same code which is when green fact clicked it will show in forever if pika won well like yeah equals yes so if pikachu won then hi and it's venezuela it used their nicknames not to be sold long ego yes then hide it's the same for pikachu that's their only code then blink is changing all the variables it will show um pica for health pica hp then full health then hp so this is the full health and the this is the hp then it will set venous return to one you'll see what this variable and the pikachu turn variable is for indefinite solar attack in the pikachu attack then in the pika then um hp the there will be like seven hundred something hp so people get unfair because pikachu has so much health but vanessa only has about 30 more health at first i actually experienced a lot of pikachu when they i was like it's so unfair even if like venezuela has the more health it's always like it's getting knocked out i was like so confused and then there's set juan the fen and pika one two no cause of course in the beginning they didn't win yet then forever set pika full health to dash 756 so and then for health is 785 then if pika hp is less than zero then it will like set fan one to yes it's just like 40 if then hp is less than zero it's just like different variables high all the four variables which is pika full health pica hp then full health and then hp and it's the same over here just the pika one and the fin health that's different now in the fitness or age i mean attack first when green valve clicks over forever if um pika one then it'll hide if enron then it'll hide then here it says when clinging fact clicked it will show of course let's see if it's the attack will show very attacking yeah switch costume to costume one which is a blank costume because right now it's showing but you can't just see it because it's a playing costume and then over here forever repeat until venosaur turn equals one so pikachu goes first so repeat until venice or turn equals one so if it's not one then it can't attack i mean when it's one if key one press so it it's the first attack show then switch costume to solar pane so it's the stronger attack it'll change pika hp by pick random so it might do 100 yeah 100 so it's 50 damage the lowest and 100 bitcoin but you know flip a lot of coins you see there's like 50 in it then change finance return by one so 31 then change pika term by negative one so pikachu will go yeah then wait one second in high it'll just be the same for the second attack but it's just when p yeah but you can do 100 100 it's just just like the same well yeah that's true and you won't see stage two having the scratch attack but that you can still do it who has thunder and duplicate the double kick costume is the seat too orange free because it's supposed to be organized someone i made two orange feet for double kick and then the venice oil so stinky well it's supposed to be yellow because because you have yellow feet but yeah so it's the same but just different key 0 for thunder and 9 for double kick let's say please don't press 9 set infinite sword then change hp by negative 50 to minus 100 so it's minus 50 to 100 that means just like the same here but just different tax and different costumes and different keys and over here change pika pikachu's turn by one and change venice or turn by negative one then over here in the backdrop it'll forever play the pokemon theme song and then it will switch backdraw to battlefield forever if pika won he goes yes then it will switch back to our two pikachu one basically black with the pikachu with the words and the venison one oh it's a bigger version of me and said to finish it like yeah and then it will stop all so it's the end of the game so let's play i'll be pikachu and will be even so yeah that wasn't so strong it's depending on luck i'm right now winning i'm only gonna do the same attack forever yeah yeah pika pika i was like i was like pikachu i was like i'm i'm a bigger version of human version pikachu pizza pikachu pikachu well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
