welcome to cody with kids my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education so today i'm going to show you my project that i made called element master so i just got this idea from a comic i read it's just like cool yeah so there's there are three elements first fire and water so you just need to set it through this right here um so on command earth builder teleports zero zero zero so the builder is basically an invisible agent specialized and made for building it's literally called builder yeah so the builder will teleport to where you are and then builder will move forward by one build a race wall from mark was um three so so when it moves forward wherever it was it just was it will have a tower of three grass blocks and then i'll do the same thing so it'll be like a wall so it can protect you from ears and stuff so you can like make it longer over here it's just a basic like yeah this is two by three and then on chat command fire so builder teleport to where you are again so build a place mark and then builder trace path from mark with fire so here you just light a block of fire you will also get on fire so eat a golden apple or if you are a survival yeah or just let it be and let it be and you can set the mobs that are chasing you on fire make sure you don't get um put fire to the grass box around okay then on check them in water it'll build our teleports here zero zero and then be able to place mark and build a trace path for mark of water so it's basically the same thing as fire but here even if you place elements yeah if you place one block of water it will spread out so it can like get you and the mobs different directions so they can be farther from i don't know it's going to be bad yeah though they'll get damaged okay so now here is placehold to define on chat it's a function builder dot teleport to position zero zero zero further that place mark so place the mark and then it'll make one block fire so this is the fire element and then player dot chat will take fire on the chat it'll run the fire element and then for the second function builder teleport to position zero zero zero we're gonna replace the mark and then build a trace path from water so this is the water element and then clear the unchat water on chat too so when you take water in the chat it'll run it and then finally here is the earth so the builder will teleport to you then the builder will move forward and raise a wall of crafts blocks three blocks high and then it'll do it two times and then when you type earth on the chat channel run okay so now let's do okay so which one should we do first we just glitched and got stuck right in the wall this is a already a pretty tall wall i so this is pretty good okay so you can like make it longer and make this color like you can make it longer by like making a repeat block and like make a wall around your face yeah so this code can also be used to make a house easily okay next is i would recommend to move quickly so we're not going to get anything creative make sure you don't set fire to those uh players yeah or like grass blocks and treats finally except that you want to be very fun yeah but also spread it and then the enemies would go that way or this way yeah or that way or that way yeah okay or that way or that way okay a lot of direction okay so earth can't go into water so if we go here and type earth so now the water is gone look it's like a photo frame if you like make a higher bitcoin blocker okay so then fire counters earth jordan type fire it's like a paper scissors and then you can set fire to this whole thing okay i don't know which one is rocker paper or scissors okay so now i you can also do the earth two times on top of each other yeah yeah so you could do earth two times and then you could make a super deal okay it's kind of weird because um i was moving break things freaking okay now look at that that's a great expression oh it looks like this is the chimney and that's the handle of the hat yeah but the chimney's a little bit too thick wow that's the three elements um well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
