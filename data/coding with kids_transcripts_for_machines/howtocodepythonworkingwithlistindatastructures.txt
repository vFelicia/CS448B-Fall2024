welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about python so first we want to do colors equals then square brackets red green blue yellow orange purple brown so these are colors and they're strings so each item is separated by a comma in this list so colors is our list then we're going to do print colors so it's going to print the list with the square brackets and the columns next i'm going to do print type colors so type is a function that will print the data type of colors and a list can store any can have items that are any data type for example floats integers and strings so let's say you would with control s and go to the terminal and type p y list dot p y so it printed the list just exactly as we typed it and it said class list so colors class is a list because it's a list yeah next we're going to sun dry equals john 3.14 7 and false so sundra is our list and now we're going to see what happens if we have a list with items of different data types because john is a string three point fourteen is a float seven is an integer and false is a boolean so i'm gonna print the list and see if anything special happens and then we're gonna print type sundry so again we're using the function type which will tell us this type of syndra and we'll see if the type will change if the a list has um different data types in it so save it and you can use the up arrow to copy what you last typed in the turn it printed the list regularly and the class is still list so if you have a list with items that are have different data types is it is still a list yeah and it still prints the list regularly so now we're going to learn about how to create an empty list so first there's a name then space equals space so if you type anything before the e the equals then it's the name and then square brackets and then you type the items in the square in the square brackets but we're going to leave it empty so next we're going to do closure equals red green blue yellow orange purple and brown so this is our list and we're using it again next we're going to do print f string so you can put the item in the list and the print zero based indexing into the list dot dot second item then curly bracket colors straight brackets one so these items in the list have index numbers and the first item is always zero and then the second item is one so it will print zero based indexing into the list dot dot second item green and the last item can be whatever number it is or negative one next we're gonna do print f string last item the list and colors negative one so the last one can be negative one and it will be brown so it will print last item the list brown next we're gonna do print a string next to the last item in the list curly bracket colors negative two so you can also go the other way and red is still zero when you go the other way and negative two is purple because we're counting from brown to red so brown is negative one so purple is negative two so orange is negative three and uh goes on yeah so it's gonna print next to last item in the list purple so let's save it and go to terminal and run it so it did zero based and next thing into the list dot dot second item green it's true it's the second item yeah the last item in the list brown next to the last item in the looks purple so it all did the correct numbers or items in the list colors so next we're going to do colors equals red green blue so now we shortened the list colors next we're going to print colors free so there is no item that has the index number three because remember red is zero green is one and blue is two so now we're gonna try to print a item well uh index number that is not in the list and let's see what happens let's save it and run it so it did it had uh index error list index out of range so it's out of range because there is no free there's only zero one and two you need to add one more item to have a free for it to work so for it to work now we need to do a two one or zero yeah so next we're gonna have our list colors again it's all the colors i can imagine right now yeah so then print dash and which will tell the print to a new line so wrote print dash end but it'll have a new line and it'll tell the print have a new line and then it's going to print print the slice start at index 2 and exclude index five so we're gonna print colors two five so it's gonna print the items two it's a four but not five excluding index five yeah so if you have two numbers like and print the items in the list like this it will exclude the last item for example it will be here five and then we're gonna print type colors to five so we're gonna see what type of items in a list are so let's save it and run it to see what happens so it did print the slice starter and index 2 and excluded in s5 blue yellow orange so it excluded index 5 and purchase the items two three and four and then the class is still list even if not it is not the whole list next i'm going to do print dash n so new line again print a slice start at index 0 to index free then print colors then nothing then free so we have nothing because it's the first list well first item to the third item so this will print the third item because there's only one number here so let's test it save it and run it so it did print a slice starting at index 0 to index for red green blue it printed the first free index color yeah so and you can notice there is a new line next we're gonna do print that and so new line again print a slice starting index four to the end of the list print colors for and then nothing so it will print all from item four to the end of the list because remember that it won't exclude anything because there's only one number so let's save it and run okay let's see so orange purple and brown the last three colors yeah so it worked finally we're gonna do oops print dash and some new line print a slice from the fourth to the end but not the last item so we're gonna print colors negative four which is yellow because we're going this way now so it'll do yellow orange and purple so let's save it and run it so it did print a slice from the fourth to the end but not the last item yellow orange and purple so now we're going to use some list helper functions so let's have helper functions so first we're going to do yeah the colors list and we're undo colors.reverse so reverse is a list helper function and then we'll print colors so the reversed function list function will reverse the next yeah we'll reverse the items and then we'll print the colors to see how colors looks like when it's reversed so let's save it and run it so it's a brown purple orange yellow blue green red so it totally reversed the whole list so the next helper function list helper function we're going to use is sort so colors dot sort and then we'll print colors so the sort list helper function will sort the items in the list by alphabetical order so let's save it and run so i did blue brown green orange purple and red and yellow for the sort helper function yes yes so the first one was blue yeah but don't ask why brown is next why not brown is first because the second second letter is l and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
