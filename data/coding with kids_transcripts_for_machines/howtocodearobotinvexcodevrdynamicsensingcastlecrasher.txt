welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew keating in this project called dynamic eye sensing in castle crasher so let's see so we have a robot here it crashed into four capsules okay it's turning and knock the roof oh man the roof went out okay go another small castle the roof of the castle also go off but that one like yeah okay okay these two are standing now and knocks it down knock down the whole building yeah then there's this top one yeah oh this one's not touched ever this one is the winner of not getting touched it's all done push the rubble turning because it sense it no three of them are in that red okay push they're still on the edge yeah trying to get these you must be in the right position but it turns that was a good one oh man it's still there but there's still this one here okay pushing out one of the big blocks please please please okay maybe you can't get that one okay so now let's see the code so when start let's set drive velocity to 100 and turn velocity to 100 and forever drive forward so we keep drawing forward if distance found an object so you can see anyone about like founding an object or left or right bumper pressed then if down i detect red because it's the end that's the other you don't want your robot to fall yeah it will stop die driving so it stops and driving first so back and turn right for five degrees if it doesn't turn it'll just like get stuck again forever else it will turn right for 20 degrees so repeat it and repeat it until nothing is on the screen anymore yeah so this is an upgraded version because it's much easier to code so well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye thank you
