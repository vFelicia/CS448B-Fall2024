welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edible is a coding platform where there are lots and lots of problems and you try to solve these problems using different coding languages So today we're going to solve three challenges using Python and edit so our first problem is called correct inequality signs so our instructions are to create a function that returns true if given inequality expression is correct and false otherwise you hear examples so give us an expression three is less than seven and seven is less than 11. so this expression makes sense it is true so we need to return true so here there is 13 is more than 44 44 is more than 33 33 is more than one that does not make sense so we're going to return because 13 is not more than 44. yeah so first we're going to do uh Define correct signs we have a variable called txt which is short for text so first we're going to do use a variable called solution equals evil and then text so evil is a function where it will evaluate the given expression which is whatever it gives us and then it will evaluate it and if it's true it will put true in the variable solution if it's false it will put false in the variable solution so then this does all the work so evil will prevent us will help us make the code short way shorter by using only this function you don't need to use a bunch of code in a bunch of lines of code it makes your work easier so it does shortcut yeah and then just we're just gonna simply return the variable solution which is either true or false so we're gonna check in and see the tests so let's see there's five more than seven and seven is more than one so five more than seven is already false so even if seven is more than one it will be false and in the console as test pass let's see another test so there is five is less than seven and seven is more than one that makes sense so we need to return true so we solved all of it so we're gonna go to our next problem so our next problem is called alphabet soup it's a suit with alphabet yeah so our um instructions are to create a function that takes a string and returns a string of a slider in alphabetical order so here are some examples it will give us hello they'll just give us a string like a word and then we need to get the word into uh sort its Letters by alphabetical order so hello will turn into ello e h l l o yeah and hacker will turn to Ace Quirk a c e h k r h and then h k r and a geek will turn into ink you can just do egg no not an egg plus a K well that's not really eight yeah it's supposed to be two G's it's something like that okay so note you can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test cases you only have to deal with a single word alphabetical characters okay so now we have a function called alphabet soup we want the same variable it's also called text so first we're gonna do a of make a variable called sort and we're going to use the function sorted on the variable text so sorted we'll sort um the Kevin uh string or whatever and it'll sort it into alphabetical order but the problem is it will return all the uh letters in alphabetical order but it is in a list so we want a word a string not a list so we're going to use the join function as our next line we're going to make another um variable called join and we're going to do this which is for Strings dot join we're going to use our variable we just made sort and join it so join will make the list the alphabetical letters in the list into one word so here if you add a space it won't work because letters will be the letters will be separated by space in between we're just going to do this to make them into Strings then we're going to Simply return join to get give them an answer now I'm going to check and see the tests so here there is when we're going to change it into in in okay and then edibit will become it kind of sounds like edible it's a little different just uh look the A and the B yeah and determination look at the airport that is such a weird sounding word yes let's see a console and we we passed all the tests great now on to our final problem um it's called The Museum of incredibly dull things so a museum wants to get rid of some exhibitions Katia the interior architect comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibition why would you make boring exhibitions no I think they're all great with some of them they're just worse than the others like more boring okay so she gives them a rating and removes the one with the lowest rating she finishes reading the exhibitions she's called off to an important meeting she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after the lowest one is removed so our we need to create a function that takes a list of integers and removes the smallest value here are some examples so give us a list of numbers in this example it's one two three four five so we need to remove the lowest number here which is one and then return the list without the lowest number so we're going to return two three four and five and for two two one two one it has two one so we're gonna remove the first one in the list which is this one and we're gonna return two two two one notes don't change the order of the leftover items if you get empty list return empty list which is square brackets and if there are multiple items with the same value remove item with lower index so this example so now we're gonna go to the code and we have a function called remove smallest with a variable called list so if list exclamation equal empty bracket well entry list so exclamation mark plus equal sign is not so if list is not an empty list which is two square brackets we're going to do list dot remove Min list so the remove function will remove something from a list so here we're going to add Min which is short for minimum or so it's going to remove the least the least valuable value in the list which is probably here one two three four five it will remove one so here we remove the lowest value um thing in the list then we're gonna return list if it is not an empty list so else we're going to return list if it is empty bracket now I'm going to check and see the tests so here move smallest there's only three so we're just gonna remove the three because it's the only number so when I return empty brackets here this empty brackets so we just go to else and return the empty bracket and finally let's see um three one six seven three seven six there are two threes and one so we're just gonna remove the one so we're number three six seven three seven six yeah correct so we passed all the tests hooray well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching
