welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition and in the hour of code Escape Austin so in the last video we completed this room and now we're gonna enter I'm loading it's coming portal boom so now first we see the lamps it's a library oh it's the chest room are we back to it yeah so every every like every stage will all have the chest room so every stage yeah so like there's three different paths yeah so right click the particle to know we're gonna play chess again I'm just mixing the puzzles press C to go so there's a puzzle switch for containing the uh chess the king chess piece picture slot it looks like these pieces are part of an incomplete picture try reordering them to see what's this supposed to be used to push pieces function to trigger the Pistons to move the pieces that in that direction you can do up down left and right okay so this is a code example to the left right okay so we'll see what we have to do so we have to do right and then up and then left okay so let's go to coding again um Left Right and let's run this left right okay that does not work so we have to do left and up and then right so let's go here and then delete it's left and then up and then right okay so let's see if this works left up right oh that's easy so now we got the king chest no broke and now it's the actual Cube chest okay let's go go where's the king Justice Bishop so now the bishop disappeared on the king up here but it's Rook the rook's checking the king okay so that's kind of an illegal move okay let's go right click the button booms now we have there's a bunch of libraries bookshelves and we have to the cursor I think it needs to reach the queen which is up all the way up there as I get the queen up there using Code um getting gold blocks and towering all the way up to the queen okay so let's go code so it says there seems to be something at the top of the bookcase see if you can create a way to get up there use move cursor to position the cursor and place back to place a block and you select position so you can um using the move cursor function we can um do orange magenta blue and yellow which orange moves up magenta moves down blue moves left and yellow moves right so let's see the code example okay so it's placing gold blocks so we have to walk on a gold box to get the queen up there so let's go code okay so this one works so let's you can also use repeats to make the code shorter okay so um we're gonna first create a loop for I in range um three times and we're gonna make another repeat Loop two times we got to um move I mean Place bar Place block first and then let's see so we're gonna place a block over here and then we have to move yellow and then Place Another block so we're gonna move cursor yellow and then we're just gonna Place Another block and then in the first repeat loop we're gonna put move cursor but not place a block and move up which is orange cursor Orange and then we're just gonna go everyone so we shouldn't have repeated three times but now we reach the queen with a jumping Rock it's another king and queen on the board investigate particles on the carpet so in the next video we're just we're gonna finish this and see where it leads us because that door looks big okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe
