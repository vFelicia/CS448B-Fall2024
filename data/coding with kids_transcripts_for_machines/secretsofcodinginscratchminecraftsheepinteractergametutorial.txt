welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're scratching the android account so today i'm going to show you my project that i made called minecraft sheep interactor where on scratch you can interact with the sheep like you do in minecraft so you can dye it change its colors sheer it and feed it with um wheat so here's the code so first i got sheep so the costumes are all different colors of the sheet a sheer sheet and i added heart sushi so when you tame it when you feed it you it will have hearts so green fat collect it'll switch costumes to sheet which is why so reset and forever play subwoofer lullaby which is a minecraft song then when i receive hearts which is the message you get from the feed button when you try when you tame the sheet they'll switch costumes to hearts which is the white sheep with the hearts wait one second and then back to regular and whenever you shear you'll switch cosmic sheer sheep so it's a sheer sheet without its wall place down when you use a shear wait one second is um back to the regular unsheat costume and then when rc die it'll switch costume to pick random one to five so i'll switch to a random um costume so it'll switch to a random color so before the die button when the spray click it will broadcast the die but um the dye message and change wheat variable by one so here it's like a score so it's like you die and then the sheep gives you a wii yeah well it doesn't happen in minecraft but i just made it so it'll be a little more fun because you need a way to get beat yeah and then for shear when this breaks like a board cashier and there's a year's costume it's just like yeah so and then feed wheat when the spray is clicked if wheat is less than five and is more than five then it'll broadcast feed so you need five wheat at least five yeah to feed the sheep when green flower collected it'll set wheat to zero so reset the variable and for the wheat one green five place will hide and when i say feed i'll change wheat variable by negative five so it'll take five week away from because the sheep ate it yeah and then they'll show wait one second switch costs into week two so it'll be like here like like a sheep is eating it yeah and then broadcast hearts so the sheet will have hearts wait one second switch costs them to wheat to go back to its regular and then it will hide and then the backdrop is basically a minecraft backdrop out and then there are some colors on the top and bottom so they can't make it too wide stretch or else they look unreal yeah so you'll just add some i'll say some colors yeah okay so now let's play i'm just gonna dye it red green blue i realized something that um the white is actually smaller than all the other ones well it's like bad the other colors are like taller like um in the red over here even over here is dye button the other colors it isn't but it's like yellow too okay get blue and then i'm gonna feed it because i have 32 wheat wow feed it always turn back into the fat cake yeah sheer so now it's super skinny i love the sheer sound it's like a scissor yeah you're literally cutting it off and then you get a wool and then you're happy keep feeding it she's and let's do three more dice one two three and then last three three oh yeah it has to be more than five then you can do some more stuff like steering it again and feeding it again and feeding oh you can't feed it one more time this year she or she she is fancier the cutting sound is just so satisfying yeah i want a loop of a cutting sound it's just i guess it will get annoying and the sheep costume is like as suited to the background so it looks like it's actually in the background except it's like um angles yeah of the angles just a little off well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash that button and subscribe bye bye
