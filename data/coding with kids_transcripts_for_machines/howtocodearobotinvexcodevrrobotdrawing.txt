welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name's andy today we're in flexco and we'll tell you um the project will be about robot drawing the description this example will draw lines on the page and show how to change the colors of lines the program will be grid map and we're going to change a lot of different playgrounds the first thing is we're going to move robot down it's in looks and move robot pen down drive forward for 200 millimeters okay then set robot color to red okay set robot color to red then drive forward for 200 millimeters again robots pen okay then drive forward for 200 millimeters okay then move the pen down color to blue no not print set robot color to blue okay then drive forward for 200 millimeters what do you think it will do i think it will move from a pen down then it will drop black because the rubber pen is down but no color so it will be black it will drive forward for 200 millimeters it will set robot pin color to red then drive forward for 200 millimeters then it will move robo pen up so it won't draw anything then it will drive for 200 meters again then move lower pen down to dragon it will set robot pen color to blue and drive forward for 200 millimeters okay let's start we're gonna be in grid map and so here it's really going to be first it will be black then red then no color which is white then blue okay let's do it so see it's black then red then it's going to be nothing then blue please now it stops because there's no code yeah commands and who's doing free okay let me restart it okay let's see oh yeah restart okay 3d okay let's see black red then blue now let's play it again oh look at that it's like running the code again it's so cool it crashed because there's no more play okay now let's change to disk mover okay let's see what it does here it can be different because it's different playgrounds and maybe there will be things to smash into i don't really think so so here i will do the same code oh look at this let's do it to 3d let's see what will happen let's see let's see okay black then red dancing and blue hmm now let's stop it again and run it again let's see it went on to that oh look at that so cool that's close and thanks for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye
