welcome to cting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're on the hour of Escape estate and in the last video we completed this room with the crate minu and now we're going to go through the door well the portal loading so we said bye to the crate menu let's see where we're going to go where we we're like in a library a bedroom it's the diary Pages let's go let's see entry number 10 the driver dear diary my travels have found me in a small sitting room is warmer and inviting it feels like I could just stay here forever no I must press on strange things are foot here and I'm pretty sure I'm not alow it's creepy okay let's search the room for particles and click the button okay so now I think we need to turn all the lamps on the Redstone lamps let's see the instructions you need to open the door by powering all of the lamps each light you turn on will open the door just a little more use the move cursor function to position the cursor over light then use turn light on so we're just going to have to turn on all these lights okay let's see so let's see the code first the example 1 2 3 4 so here we only need to move the cursor yellow one two three four five six seven okay so we need seven times so we but we can make this simpler by using this repeat loop as show there okay so we just need this and then we're going to add turn light on function and then we just have to repeat it seven times I think seven then remember to add the tab okay so let's run it 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven okay so you open the door now we're in another room okay so search room for particles again oh seems like we have to fill these holes let's see laser reveal fill in all the holes in the floor with the cursor to open the curtain use and then use the functions move cursor and place blocks so this is kind of different from the other one but we still use the same functions okay so we could just move use orange for so first place block and then um use orange one two three four times okay so four times so we have to do it one more time or we can use a repeat Loop okay so we're going to just use a repeat Loop right now without the place block just for the move cursor orange four yeah four times just with the without to place block we're gonna have to place the block first before the loop so before that we're going to have to place the block and then after that we have to place a block too okay so let's see oh forgot the colons okay okay okay so we got the first two done then we have to move yellow four times too so then we're go for Iron Range four again move cursor yellow oh we forgot to place block we'll just add that later after that we have to move magenta forward down too so first place block and then we're going to for for range again magenta so we move down then we're going do mag move cursor magenta and then Place block okay so let's see okay so two 3 four and then we have to move blue two times and then orange two times so blue two times you can use the repeat or not it's your choice cuz and it's the same so it doesn't really matter and then 2 * Orange then we're going to place a block yeah okay let's see one 2 3 4 five puzzle solved the curtains lift it up wow Museum it's the art room it can't jump in okay let's see what we have to do laser puzzle again solid blocks stop the laser shift a row of green blocks to make the laser pass through the glass blocks to turn on the light on the other side use the shift row function to do it so we we're just going to have to use green right now and the right or left so let's see just make that laser right now so you have to know where the lases are okay so the so that works but then we have to use do this too so the coding example actually helped us if solve the first one but now we have to do these three and the yellow so we could just move the green left one time and then yeah so first green left so we're just going to do one of this and then let's see so we're just going to do one of that so it works and the yellow one time okay that works I guess okay oh there's even red now so move green one time let's see oh so that's let's see what this does first so green left and the yellow red oh oh so let's see how how do we have to move this one what do you think okay so the yellow and green works but the red doesn't work so the green work the yellow work but the red doesn't work okay so let's see how it is in first you need to move two move two two to the left two to the left uh or wait it's one to the left right we'll try that two to we'll try one left why did you delete that because we just need to move it one time since it's only one block right let me see we add a left after the code wait okay what do what how would you do it oh I left after the code okay all right okay two times okay so let's see so you can just also use a repeat to make that easier one two three four five Andrew is so smart I am not as smart sadly okay and oh we already finished it so that was all for today let's go back to the first room oh okay so we first went through here got open the door went through here got open the curtains and then we saw this the laser okay so in the next video we're going to go for the poil for now we're just going to stay here and look at the curtains I guess well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like
