welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're on minecraft education edition so today i'm going to show you how to make a horse farm so on chacomat farm so when you take farm in the chat the builder is going to teleport to where you are and the coordinates are zero zero zero so the builder is basically an invisible agent that is used more as more suitable for building stuff so something's called yeah so we're gonna do repeat three times we're gonna build a trace path for mark with a spurs fence so just like this kind of fence and it'll build a turn left then builder move forward by seven so we're making one side and then builder turn left so he the builder is ready to make the other side and the builder move forward by six and then it'll repeat three times it'll make the whole square this is gonna be seven by six and out of the repeat loop we're gonna do agent teleport to player so now we need the agent so it's a cooperation between the agent and the builder then we're gonna agent set blocker item so this is the item spawn horse so the horse spawn egg and slot count 64 in slot 1. so the agent also has an inventory so we can use that to get the horsepower instead of us searching it in creative inventory so if you are in um survival that will be very like useful yeah so in python it's defined on chances of python function teleport to position zero zero where you are and then for index and range three builder that trace path spurs fence and then building that turn left turn so it's ready to make a side builder that move forward seven one side whether that turn left turn so it'll be another side and building that move forward six times and then out of the repeat loop we're gonna do agent dot teleport to builder so now we're using the agent the agent dot set item spawn horse egg 64 and slot one then player that on chat when you type farm in the chat it'll run the function now let's try it next to the pumpkin wow that's a wild horse there's a wild horse already spawned to you yeah this one i think it's a bit rare i've never seen that kind or i just saw a gold helmet skeleton oh dude i think the horse can escape no they're too tall they can't fit in like two two um blocks high well this is one yeah okay um if you try to do this try to do this now get the agent which is stuck in the fence okay the spawn horse or the bone meals from one of our other videos okay spawn force wow this one is black spots okay this white one is like very white ones are very royal yeah kind of way this one is a baby it's the same it escaped because babies are one block baby you can't escape it's okay it's just another baby this one it's just like that one yeah it's just like a natural sponge it's more gray this one looks like brownish one teenager yeah that's like a teenager okay a more dark brown okay oh the same dark brown again yeah um oh this is gray and white spotted one which ones are your favorite counting the wild one too i think the white one it's royal another baby so maybe another one babies okay now we're gonna choose four adult ones and armor and saddle them and try to take them around for a ride okay of course so we're gonna take another iron gold and diamond and now we're gonna need a saddle who's gonna get the lucky diamond one i think it's going to be the warrior one or i think uh the white one so now i'm gonna use a golden carrot or if you want you can use a golden apple to tame them okay okay this one what which one you're gonna saddle with then try to ride it okay needs more more more more all right try not to try not to hold a sandal try not to hold the stand though when trying to go on top of them oh you're feeding the baby yeah one time try to go and go on to the top of it okay yes okay we're gonna go see oh yeah nice satellite now okay now we're in its inventory put saddle and leather leather fits it right or our iron it's more of its color yeah okay now we're going to take it for a ride so called walk full jump go oh that's actually a perfect shot so fast yeah this one is just way faster don't go to the water as if it smacked you for some reason there's a honey high skeleton okay oh no you're almost done underwater okay oh there's another wild um wild one right there oh yeah cool i know where our first one went okay now i'm gonna leave the iron one close by now i'm going to try a different one okay which one you want yeah obviously you're sure i like you okay now it works right so i'm going to try you sure it didn't have any like um hearts coming at it well it doesn't need hearts your heart i think a heart when you ride it no don't go on top of it with um okay yeah okay the heart was on it when you were in your inventory so okay go through my own you're on saddle and diamond of course i guessed it obviously the royal one bull jump on another ball jump almost almost almost full jump oh yes and leave it closer like it okay next oh we have leather this one how is this this is not the dark brown one oh i think lever more like yeah okay now try to ride it but first we need a saddle okay we're gonna get a saddle oh i love you when i say love like you okay saddle okay cut the saddle and the leather gold one is hard to decide i think it's more on the royal one yeah because you know gold's very royal but it's not that good like diamond is way better it's i'm always thinking why can't they take fall damage like they jump so high well they're they're trained i guess trained oh i love jumping this one i think this one is the fastest okay finally yeah our gold one which one should we do spotted uh okay okay which one black or gray gray great i'd and then get a saddle or armor it looks cool actually yeah cause it's very shiny okay i think the gold one is perfect for anyone we actually can just escape the end where i think i also saw it yeah right there oh let's set it back to sunny okay for a good day for these kind of um horses as their day for their armor to get their armor on oh let's try to jump over it's really can't um um pull job i'm trying to follow ball drop almost full job you're like so fast when you keep jumping yeah because it jumps very high i did two ball jumps with it i wonder if it ever gets tired of this really realistic actually minecraft is not really that really thick yeah like but why can't chickens well they can flutter the i don't think they would be that high in life for any reason yeah okay let's take our diamond and our leather okay hi my diamond looks so cool perfect for loyal people yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye
