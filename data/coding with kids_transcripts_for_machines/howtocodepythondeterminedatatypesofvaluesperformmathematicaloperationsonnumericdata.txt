welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn data types in python so first i'm going to create a new file called first going to use the type so type quotes 7 so type is going to print the the data type of what's inside the brackets okay then print oh wait first the seven is a string because it is yes see it says class string so it's going to print class string okay then print type inside is set so now we don't have the quotes and so it's going to be a it works right there yeah that so now we have 7.1 and that's a float because float has decimals so let's save it with ctrl s and internal type data py data dot py so it says class string class int class flow that's all correct the first one is a string the second one is an integer and the third one is a float then we're gonna uh delete this and do current true or false if something is that data type so in the brackets there will be codes then the quotes inside will be seven okay so it's gonna print true or false to this so in it is if this quote if the seven in the quote is a string everything we do print is instant is sent then there will be a seven and comma seven com comma then so now we're checking if the seven without the quotes is a integer then we do print is instant instance 7.1 7.1 comma float float so now we're checking if the 7.1 is a flip so let's save it and run it oopsies so you can use the up arrow to copy what you last typed in terminal let's run it so this hits true true true because the seven encodes the string the seven without the quotes is an integer and the seven point one is a float okay so let's delete this and do print oopsies print is instant is instance seven seven comma string seven comma string okay so now we don't have the quotes for the seven and it was print false or true if it's um actually a string or not yeah so it's going to print false because strings have quotes then print print is instant this instance quotes with a 7 inside yeah so now it's going to check if the 7 in the quotes is an integer it'll also print false because the 7 in the quotes is a string and the seven without the quotes is an inch okay then print is instant this instance i mean yeah it quotes quotes seven point one seven point one then comma float it's gonna print false because there are quotes yeah even if the is a seven point one but it's in quote is a string so it's going to print false to all these let's save it and run it oops okay so it says false false false because the seven without the quotes is not a string it's an integer yeah and the seven in the quotes is a string not an integer and the seven point one in the quotes is a string not a float so okay let's delete this and do print type so we're checking if seven is something straight straight so this is another way to check if something is a data type i would not recommend this because it's longer and i recommend you use the is instance function because this uh is better and it's easier to see then print print type function type seven seven then two equals equals eight and so now we're checking if the seven without the quotes is a int okay then we're gonna do so now we're checking the 7.1 is float okay let's save it and run it now it's true true true because they're all this one is a string because it's in size of quotes and the seven is an integer because as no quotes and it's a whole number and the 7.1 is a float it doesn't have any quotes yeah so the type function again the type seven so now we're going to check if the seven without the closest string is going to print false okay then type and so it's also going to prove false because if it has quotes is a string then we do print type type and that is quote 7.1 7.1 so this is string two because remember it has quotes then two equals seconds then float so it's all gonna print false because the string the seven does not have codes it's an integer yeah and the other ones has quotes so they're both strings not integers or floats so let's save it and run it because false because they're all not true yeah okay then i'm going to do x x equals codes as string string so this is a string because it has quotes then so it's going to print the type of all strings because so it's going to print a string because there are quotes so it's a string and then x equals seven x equals seven so this is an integer print print type type x x so we did the print just as like the top one but the x is a 7 now so it's going to print the it because it is an integer okay then print i mean it is and and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
