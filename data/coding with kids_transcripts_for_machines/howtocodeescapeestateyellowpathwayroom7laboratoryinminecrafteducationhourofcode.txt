welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition and in the hour of code Escape estate in the last video we completed this room with a lot of plants and mushrooms this is probably the garden yeah and now we're gonna go for this yellow all right it's a factory ooh look there's smoke ooh maybe can't find it look down look there's mushrooms again and there's lots of copper and then there's these patterns and that's particle button here oh look there are patterns over there see proceed to code pipes you'll need to add a specific amount of blocks to each of the Hoppers maybe there's something in the room that can tell you how many use the drop blog post usually drop the correct amount of color block into the pipes the draft block function to a swim parameter that defines what color blocks should be dropped yellow blue orange and magenta magnetic magenta okay so let's see this one okay so here are the Hoppers oh it turns different colors no so let's see the pattern I think this is how many of each color we have to put in the hopper okay so two yellow four blue three magenta and two Orange jump down let's hope we don't damage ourselves on these spikes I don't think we can well we are in survive okay so now we're cool okay so here we can also use the repeat block to do it faster it does the same thing it changes color when it one is dropped in so okay so let's do go to code and first do we're gonna do two yellows yeah so now that we have uh two yellow I think it's um four blue when you check okay see it's two okay then four blue okay so we're gonna use a repeat Loop for eye and range range four four we have to do drop block blue so now let's run it and check it okay both of these colors right so now we need three magenta and two orange okay so let's make a repeat loop again so three times we'll have to drop block magenta so now let's run it again okay good good it's supposed to turn green onions is the orange so we need two Orange um drop Block Orange yeah okay now let's run it initial work one two three one two four one two three one two puzzle solved now we need to solve room four particles again here oh there's a cage one chicken it's three sheep five cows and 23 Crown I think um a cow is five pounds a sheep is two pounds and it's three chicken is one pound three oh oopsies three pounds and the crown is 20. I think this is the what what food we should achieve so let's see wait oh wait you need to scale to reach a weight of exactly 23 pounds maybe there's a sign around here to tell me how much each mob weighs use the summon Animal Farm here to summon a combination of animals that adds up to 23 pounds okay so we can do chicken sheep and cow so let's do our math so the most simple is to get the cows first to get as close as we can which is 20 so that is four cows four cows and then one sheet or we can do the simplest is just spawn 23 chickens because they're all one pound sure there's a spawning animals on it okay there's only one chicken so let's find the code again oh let's run the code again same place so it's still not oh okay so now let's do it so we can also use repeat Loops so first we need to do four cows so I gotta deal up repeat Loop for Iron Range four four we're gonna do salmon animal cow so now let's try it should measure to 20. this is 20. so now we need uh three more so which is a one sheep or if you wanna you can do free chicken but we're gonna do one sheep then salmon so now let's run it should be 23. I went down it should be heavy puzzle search room for more particles so let's search hmm I think it's up here this one's pretty big whoa there are lots of uh mobs and Minecarts that's crazy okay then there are huge mob uh faces made out of wool and concrete this is crazy foreign read the diary page okay entry seven the laboratory dear diary I made the most almost fascinating Discovery today a laboratory so this room is a laboratory it's complete with mysterious machinery and strange experiments the likes of which I've never seen or have I there's something very familiar about this place nuts are diary page so creepy let's go back up and let's press code to see what we have to do the mods need to be sorted into the right passageways look at the mobs queued up to be sorted insert them based on the order they are waiting use a short malfunction to the set the order they should be stored so let's run this code to see what happens so the zombie skeleton and creeper run zombie zombies okay zombies so this first car will go to zombie zombie and zombie oh there's two s's on their eyes so we only saw each mom to the um right place so like the creeper goes there skeleton goes there and a zombie goes there okay so let's see we can use a repeat Loop too so let's try this zombies some oh that's wrong skeleton zombie skeleton Creeper Creeper zombie zombie once again okay let's go to have a better so it's so there versus skeleton zombie skeleton okay let's delete all this short mob so the first one's skeleton and then zombie skeleton uh you're supposed to do zombie first note skills oh no it's zombie skeleton first oh skeleton first 10 zombies and skeleton over here yeah second one zombie yeah so we have to change the first okay let's see skeleton zombie okay and then we have skeleton and two creepy creepers two times okay some dogs from it and they should all go in except for the last two zombies skeleton went to the creeper and that is stuck it's stuck the Creeper's stuck okay okay they respond can I see it our code again skeleton zombie skeleton then creepy skeleton zombies skeletons let's try again skeletons it went to zombie zombies went let's just put the zombies at the end yeah because I'm pretty sure our code is right yeah zombie now let's run it wait okay wait let's go back oh it's really moving they weren't all in the wrong ones one was and the creepers still I think I think in Minecraft's glitching yeah this is puzzle sauce puzzle sauce so we did the our code is right except the like the graphics right so you can still copy our code you know there's a little Factory there and look it's the portal that was the portal let's go down look at these green they're so cool there's like gas Chambers okay let's go should we go no next video okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button subscribe bye bye
