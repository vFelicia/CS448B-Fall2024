welcome to recording with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in fix code so here it says code favorite this is impossible so this video is going to be about turning accurately description this example will show how to use different drawings every train turning block to control the robot playground grid map so first we're gonna do turn right then wait four seconds so it'll turn right for four seconds okay then we need to stop driving so turn right for four seconds then start driving for one second then we're gonna turn left for 180 degrees oopsies wrong block turn left for 180 degrees okay for one then wait one second so after it turns left for 180 degrees he's gonna wait one second then turn to rotation zero degrees so so it will um turn back to when it started like facing forward so see the platform codes add more codes when we add more codes here so let's go to the background now so it will run all the python code because the python code is same as the codes behind the page let's run it so first it will turn right for four seconds three four then turn left 180 now it's going back to zero so zero is just like when you start let's do it in 3d mode okay good okay turn right for four seconds turn the left for 180 degrees and then turn to rotation zero yay it works and thanks for watching remember to smash your like button subscribe bye bye
