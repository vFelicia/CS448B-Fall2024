welcome to go play with kids my name is colleen and today we're in scratch i'm going to show you one of my games i made all by myself it's called hippo get apple so i'll find people will trying to get apples so inspired you can make a lot of games projects and animations so right now it's floating so it has the white screen yeah it's called hip forget apple because you have to up arrow hippo go up down arrow hip and go down so try to get the apple when you get an apple you will add a four but sometimes when you don't get the apple it doesn't have a score i want so here there's the hippo code so when green flag is quick clicked set score to zero so when the match zero because i clicked the green flag then forever if the hippo was touching the apple then the score would change by one so add one then wait one second okay so when up arrow key pressed change y by ten so the y and change y by 10 means it will go up so see i'm pressing the up layer right now it's going up i'll be seeing by when down arrow key pressed change by 10 so it will go down so over here it says when green flap is clicked the hippo will say time to fly for two seconds then over here there's another code there's a lot of hidden codes it says so when the green flap is clicked forever next costume so has costumes here so it has typical a and hippo b so it will keep like flapping its swing x by 2 250 so x is this so it will be that the width and chain then repeat 32 times change x by minus 15. now the clouds are these so oh when the green flag is clicked then forever set x to 250 next costume repeat 100 times change x by minus 50. so it's change x by minus 50 100 times okay um so i found the flying hippo at animals i wanted something to be flying in this so i chose to find i didn't choose dragonfly because i don't know what it really eats i want something like like apple i forgot where it is so to describe how it looks like aha it's called hippo one it has these little wings to fly so now i found the apple by searching apple apple then it has an eyeball press on it too see so the clouds i didn't really search it i just found it somewhere forgot so let's see okay so these clouds like this cloud that i wanted to play this cloud not the backdrop i have only one backdrop so the bathtub actually just forever plays sound there's energetic until you're done so it will forever play these songs see is was done see the sounds had something see this is the whole song now when i found it it's just a backdrop it's very easy to find because it's blue sky 2 right here when you open it you will just find it saying blue sky 2 and a blue background okay now let's see project page and i'm gonna see how many score i'll get in 15 seconds one two three four five six 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. so i got 10 points in 15 seconds or 11 but this is one of my project i created all by myself but don't pass on it before so thanks for watching smash the like button and click the subscribe button bye
