welcome to clinton with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to do python today we're going to deal a deck of cards for player 1 and player 2 using lists and nested 4 statements so first i'm going to do import random so import will tell by phone we're using the module and random is the module and in another video we also learned about the python standard library and what modules are this one do suits equal so it's just like a variable and then we have two square brackets which is the list and we have four items hearts spades clubs and diamonds and there's columns then so this is a list so then we'll make another list called ranks with the items two three four five six seven eight nine ten jack queen king and eight so with the list suits and ranks we're gonna make a deck of cards and restore those cards in the list deck so right now it's empty which has two square brackets only yeah next we're gonna do for suit and suit so this is a four step it's for each something in something so for each something that something is suit which is a variable like for the items so for each item in the list of suits we're going to do another for loop and then in the outer for rankin ranks so the first timer runs these two four statements it will be in the suits list it will be checking the item hearts and in the drank lists ranks list it will be checking the two item then it will do decta append astro rank of soup so a pen is a list helper function that will add an item to our list deck and we're going to add so first time it runs these and we'll add two of hearts to the deck and we're going to repeat that until the last card is ace of diamonds next we're going to do print s string there are latin deck cards in the deck so always be there are 52 cards in deck because in these four to four statements we're going to add 52 cards into the deck list so print there are 52 cards in the deck then i'm going to print dealing so it's like it's loading yeah that is just printing something no have two empty lists called play run and play two yeah andrew's the player one and i'm the player too so these two lists will store the deck or cards of player one and player two then while then player one is less than five so each player will have five cards so we only need to do one list so we just did player one so while player one and player two has less than five cards we're gonna make a variable called card equals random.choice deck so choice is a function inside the random module and i'll pick a random item or card from deck and that card will be stored inside the card variable then we're going to get that removed card so player 2 or another player won't have the same card and we're gonna add that card to player one's deck so we're gonna do the same thing for player two except the card variable is card two and player one the one yeah we have two yeah player two then after we put the cards in the player's deck we're going to print a string there are land deck cards in the deck so each player has five five plus five is ten fifty two minus ten is forty two so we'll print there are 42 cards in the deck and then let's get in print player one has the following cards in their hand and it will print player ones deck which is the list player one and i'll do that same for player two except that player one is player two and a princeton let's player 2. so let's say with ctrl s x let's see who has the better call so it did play everyone the following cards in the head ten of clubs queen of space i got two tens two ten of clubs and ten have done queen of diamonds i got two queens two one let's see what you have you have three of clubs two of clubs jackal spades nine of hearts ten of ones you've got no doubles i got the best cards let's do it again then i have seven parts king of clubs jack of hearts jack of clothes i got two jacks and then i got ten of hearts so i got one double player two has six of diamonds king of spades an excel club you got a double six yeah triple spades and six of hearts you got three six you got so much you got better but i'm not even six one more toy i'm old i got king of diamonds ten of them died free of space i got three diamonds but i got no doubles yeah player two has nine of diamonds queen enough diamonds tennis space jack of five you have two nines i have two diamonds and two spades two diamonds yeah and two spades yeah but you got two nines so this try we got a lot of diamonds yeah so this game it depends on luck to win because that it uses the choice function yeah random don't know what kind of account yeah pretty that's a very cool and fun game right yeah yeah and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
