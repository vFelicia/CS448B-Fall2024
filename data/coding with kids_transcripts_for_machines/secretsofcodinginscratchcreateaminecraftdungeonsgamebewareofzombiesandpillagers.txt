welcome to cooking with kids my name is and today we're on scratch so today we're going to show you my project minecraft dungeon so it's a test project so first you you're going to control steve with your mouse or your finger and you avoid the zombie and pillager both of them are monsters and you try to survive for 60 seconds that means one minute let's try it so now steve is following my mouse and they're trying to get me so i just got damaged and got attacked now there's more mobs and my health went down okay so let's see the code for steve so when green flag click that means when you run the project go to x0 and y0 that means the middle then switch costume to steve that means the regular costume and set health to 20. so your maximum health is 20 and then forever go to mouse pointer so steve will follow your mask or your finger and then when green flag clicked forever so it'll keep forever checking the if if health equals 0 that means you lose then broadcast game over so game over is a message to other characters so when i receive attack that means when steve receives the message attack switch costume to damage steep so he gets damaged and then play some hit sound until done so so you can know that he's damaged then change health by minus one so minus one one health from the health variable and then switch costume to steve so i'll go back to the regular costume or look then wait 0.1 seconds so it'll avoid very little okay then let's go to zombies code so when green flat clicked forever glide one seconds too steep so it will follow yeah follow steve for one second and then if touching steve that means if it touches steve switch costume to zombie that means the usual costume and then broadcast attack and create clone of myself so a clone is like a copy of this character so and then wait 0.2 seconds to do this again okay so when it touches steve it will broadcast attack and steve will get damaged okay so when i start as close so now i'm coding the clone that means the copy forever glide one second to see if touching steve then switch costume to zombie broadcast attack wait 0.2 seconds so this is just like the code for the usual zombie but it doesn't create another clone yeah so if steve is touching the clone zombies it won't make another zombie yeah the zombie won't make another zombie only the original zombie can make another zombie so next the pillager another monster so the code is just like the zombie except the costumes and yeah that's basically all but the zombie doesn't have a attack costume because the pillager has a weapon it has a attack costume so switch costume to pill attack so pill is a short name for pillager and then it will go into the attack mode and broadcast attack so again steve will get damaged and create clone myself so the clone code is also like the zombie clone code yes so it has pill attack then broadcast attack but yeah but again it doesn't create another clone where there will be more clones than you expected next this is the dungeon so this is the background so when i receive game over high so it will disappear so the game over sprite that means the game over screen will show and then when green flag clicked forever play sound minecraft dungeons yeah so this is a song well a sound and it's gonna forever do it yeah okay then game over screen so when i receive game over the message show for then it will show in the dungeons that means the background will hide so you can see the game over screen and then forever wait 0.1 seconds next costume because it has a lot of costumes and then when green flag clicked hides because you don't want when you run it it's game over already play oh that would be crazy and then when the wind spread is will tell you whenever you win so when green flag clicked reset timer so you see there's a timer here and it's still running yeah okay so when green flag collects you know reset the time then wait 60 seconds that means yeah and if health more than zero that means you're still surviving then reset timer and say your vlog you just need to survive for 60 seconds now let's play after editor please it's my attack okay they're creepy they're creepy they're creepy hey i turn okay when it's 30 seconds it's my turn okay that is yeah you have 19 help they need like time to attack us yeah and they follow you for just one second so they they might they may not oh man you attack me like 30 seconds you survived yeah ah there we go and thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye bye
