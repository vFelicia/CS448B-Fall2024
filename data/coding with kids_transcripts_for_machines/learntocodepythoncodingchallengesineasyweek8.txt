welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew day one edible so edibit is a coding platform where there are lots and lots of coding problems that you can solve using different kinds of coding languages So today we're going to do three easy coding challenges using python so our first problem is called pair management our instructions are given to arguments return on lists which contains these two arguments so basically just um get to numbers because that's what is in the test cases and then when you put these numbers and return it in a list so first we have a function called make pair with two variables num1 and number two so first we're going to do we're gonna make a list so we have to make the list ourselves so we're going to do list equals and then two square brackets as an empty list next we need to add the two numbers into the list and eventually return the list so I want to add the two list using this function this list helper function called append so append is the function where you can add something to a list so we're gonna do list dot append number one and list a pen thought append number two so now our list has both number one and number two in it so now all we have to do is return it so we're going to do return list now we're going to check it and see the test cases so here that it will give us two numbers here there's 4213 with 526 so we would turn it in a list with square brackets and the same problem so here in console we got all the tests passed there are only three tests so on to our next problem so it's called Boolean to string conversion create a function that takes a Boolean variable called flag and returns it as a string so all we need to do is turn a Boolean into a string so don't forget to return your result so here we just need to use a simple function so first we have a function called bull to string and a variable called flag which is a Boolean so we're gonna use we're gonna create a variable called solution which is basically storing the answer to return so equals string function and flat so string function function will try to return whatever is in the um and here like for example the flag here no try to convert whatever it is into a string so here we're going to convert the Boolean whatever is the Boolean in the flag variable into a string I'm going to store that string the solution variable and then we're basically going to return the solution variable okay so you can also do use the string function on integers now I'm going to check it and see the test cases see there are only two questions test cases even less than the other ones true and false it's a two uh test cases are true and false so basically here there's there are balloons booleans so there are blue so to make a string we need to add parentheses to make a string so let's go back to console and both tests are passed on to our final coding challenge so our final coding challenge is kind of fun and silly it's called broken bridge create a function which validates whether a bridge is safe to walk on it has no gaps in it to fall through so we're either going to return true if it's safe to walk on and false if it has a hole in it so here it's kind of silly and it's very creative because the number of signs are actually the bridge so there's a gap between between them it's basically the space they look like railroads yeah well it's just pretty close to a bridge so here for example here there are no you can't see any spaces so it's a complete Bridge so it's safe to walk and you won't fall into the river so whenever it is beneath me yes return true and then here there is a hole in between the two parts of the bridge right here okay so we're gonna return false so we basically have to check if the string with the bridge has a has this space in it so here there's only one that's a very small Bridge so this is true you can expect the bridges and connecting it to a surrounding okay so first we have a function called is safe Bridge with the bridge stored in a variable called s so first we have to check if there are any spaces in the bridge so we're going to do if then empty string which is a space so we add a space in it because if we do this it won't work so we add a string as in a hole so if there is a hole technically a hole not a but also a space in the bridge which is s we're gonna return false because it's not safe to walk on if so if there isn't then we're gonna uh isn't a hole then that we're gonna do else returns true because it's safe to walk on now let's see the test or maybe that train can go through world you see so railroad she thinks they're true okay here so there are two are false and two are true so here there is a hole there's a number sign whole number sign that's still a pretty short bridge but there's a hole in beneath uh in it so we're gonna turn false here there's also a hole between the very big bridge so we're in turn false so now all tests are passed hooray well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
