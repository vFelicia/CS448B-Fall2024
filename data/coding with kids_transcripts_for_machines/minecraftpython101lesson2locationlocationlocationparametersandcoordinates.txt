welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition so we're on platform 101 and we're in lesson two so first we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says it's nice to see you again putting mine is expanding quite a bit so we have began to build more office space however we need the process to go faster that is why we are developing a piece of software that will automatically make complicated structures out of blocks we are experiencing some problems can you help so we're going to help the ceo now talk to the programmer okay so the programmer says hello can you help me with this i need to make different blog types appear in the dedicated areas but for some reason sometimes the wrong block type appears can you write some code to place a grass block on the grass and bricks on the brick okay so first we're going to stand on top of the grape then we're gonna do this so this will place a grass block at our feet because we are standing on the grass block it will place the grass block on top of the grass so it did correct so now i'm hi would it be possible to get your help you should put resident lamps and those fittings on the ceiling but it can't seem to get the required height correct you write some code to place the free lamps at the correct height using these scales next to each of them once you've done this go ahead and turn them off so first we are going to stand on the gold box let's see let me change the middle number and also change the block so first we're going to change the brass block to red stone lamp then i'm going to change the middle number let's try five to see if it's high enough yeah okay okay it's not high enough let's try six so now we're gonna change the five to a six so let's see if it's high now yeah then we're gonna turn on the lights okay now we get it correct so we're gonna turn the lever on and turn on the lights next we are gonna go to this gold block and we're trying this this one looks taller so we're gonna try seven okay correct now i'm gonna turn the lever right over here to turn on the lights that's much brighter yeah we're going to do the last light right here so this one looks closer we're going to try for it let's see correct so now i'm going to also turn it up so now we fixed all the lights now i'm going to go to activity 3 so we're going to talk to the engineer see engineer says could i ask for your help i need to build a staircase starting after the gold but it never comes out right can you write some code that will place a staircase made out of three steps okay so first we are gonna do the place block again and we're going to change the block again so we're going to change the grass block into a work then we're going to turn the last number which is the euro still 0 and turn it into one so now we're gonna run okay let's see okay next we are gonna add one to this so we're gonna change the one to a two and the middle number into a one let's try okay and finally we'll still add one so we're going to change the middle number into two and the last number into free so now we're running it let's see yes so we completed the staircase that works so now we're going to go to the last activity so now we're going to talk to another engineer so the engineer says sorry to bother you could i get your help i need to build a piece of the floor for this hallway starting after the goal but it's never long could you write some code that will place a strip of floor so we could cross the hole also watch out the hole is filled with bugs so now when you make a bridge so first we're gonna go here again and we're gonna place a block so we're gonna change the block and change the block that's placing into a oak plank oak so i'm gonna do oak plank plank oh okay then we'll do the first two numbers negative one and the second number also negative one so now we're gonna run to make the first so it's correct so next we're gonna turn it into negative two we're not going to change the middle number so now we're gonna run again okay and i'm gonna change the negative two into negative one back again okay so now we have like about two more blocks to go okay so we're going to do this second when you go on nearest block okay one more block make sure we don't fall in the holes or there'll be bugs okay yes now there are like rockets let me build the bridge okay so we can go in the elevator okay let's take the lesson so we go okay that's cool well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
