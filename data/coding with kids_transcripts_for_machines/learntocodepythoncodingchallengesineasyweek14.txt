welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in Edison so edible is a coding platform where there are lots of coding problems to solve and you can solve the problems using different kinds of coding languages So today we're going to do three easy coding challenges with python so our first problem is called recreating the ABS function the ads function Returns the absolute value of a number this means it Returns the numbers positive value you can think of it as the distance away from zero create a function that recreates this functionality so for example here's what the as function does now it will turn negative five into five so like remove the negative assign if it doesn't have a negative sign it's just going to return the same number here 250 and we'll return to 50. if you give it negative 3.14 it will give you 3.14 without the negative sign okay so here we really have a simple solution so we're not going to go into deep here we're going to learn how to do modules so modules are like addons with more commands so we're going to add an import a module called math so you just type import math and then you do deaf absolute and so this is our function to define absolute with the variable n which is the number and then absolute value equals math.fabs and so Fabs is a function in the math module that does the exact same thing as the absolute function so we can just substitute it and then we're basically going to return the absolute value so there are modules for lots of things and models can be very useful so now see the test cases there is zero so we're just gonna get zero and uh yeah they're only two negative numbers negative five and negative 3.14 okay so we pass all the tests onto our next coding challenge so our next coding challenge is called Century crisis scientists have discovered that in four decades the world will explode it will also take three decades to make a spaceship to travel to a new plant that can hold the entire world population you must calculate the number of fuel there will be in three decades from now the variable p is the world population now assume that every month someone gives birth to more people which is the variable NP returned a number of people there will be when the spaceship is complete so here there is the current population and then the number of people that are born every month so first we have two variables P which is the current population and NP which is uh the number of people that are born every month so first we're going to do new people equals NP times 360. so we multiply it by 360 because in a decade there are 120 months so this will so 360 is the months so now that we have the number of new people when you add it to the current population so we're going to do new people plus P which is the variable people and finally we're just going to return the variable people so now let's see the test cases there's 5240 which is current population three people are born every month that's still over that's still over a thousand people born in three decades okay so we pass all our tests onto our final coding challenge it's called football points create a function that takes the number of wins draws and losses and calculates the number of points a football team has obtained so far wins get three points draws get one point losses get zero points so here's three wins four draws and two losses so we basically have three times three equals nine nine plus four equals 13 points okay so we have three variables wins draws and losses we calculate the points first so we're going to do W points equals wins times three draw points equals draws times one and L points equals losses times zero uh so these are the points now now we add them all up for the total amount of points in the variable so the points we return that variable now let's check it and see it test cases there's zero when seven draws and zero losses that's kind of Lucky and unlucky and there's the zero wins zero draws in 15. that's just that yeah okay well we passed all our tests well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
