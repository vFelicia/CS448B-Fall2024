welcome to coding with kids my name is claudia and this video is going to be about how a project works so here we will have some projects i'm going to choose artists you can choose other things okay okay there is action but you will move the drawer brushes you will set the color or set color to random um you can set pattern draw stickers then draw sticker with size of um the pick pixels what pixels you want then this is loops from i for i from question mark to question mark count by question mark repeat question mark times over here has math so zero for the question marks it can be for the question marks or you can just type it like this you can just type it 24 56 just doing random numbers eight oops not e 34 some random numbers right now i'll just try one something two it just moves too forwards so that's just nothing so math is random random logic if equals then there's functions you can create a functions or you can edit functions variables such slaves that are to do comments comments is just like this you just put and then type random things like this is is that is code.org but comments don't really do anything see it just like it just stays there okay now first we have to do let's just get this comment away move forward by 100 pixels let's say and brushes to random color over here see it move forward 100 pixels but if we keep repeat it let's see 30 times let's say 30 times and it will give you 300 pixels i think so you can't see it anymore because 300 pixels are too long okay let's try 10 that would be 100 pixels still you can't see it how about two now it's through there right now i'm trying to build a square let's say now we have to turn right but what degrees 90 supposed to say 190 nope zero no 9 is 90. so it's all right then we repeat things so uh and you made a sick square over here you can rename your project whatever you like i'll just name it t pretty good save your project to re mix your project press the remix button then it will say remix t so you mix the whole entire project by and adding your own color into it but i don't even need to remix because it's my own project so when it's saved you can go back here to check if it's saved right you go down right here see there is remix t t and c it's the same thing because i didn't change anything in mixed e because i pressed it we mix at t you can make like minecraft designer you can design a minecraft and thanks for watching subscribe to our channel and smash the like button bye
