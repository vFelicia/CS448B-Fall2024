today we're in scratch and andrew's account techno468 so today i'm going to show you my original project called minecraft clicker game the version 1.0 okay tap the sum and get points let's see 20 30 points we can buy the dolphin now we have five automatic points per second okay so first i have the solomon the basic thing you can click so when green fire clicked it will set points the variable to zero so it will restart and then forever wait 0.05 seconds next costume because yeah flip it's tail and it's like moving good it's not actually moving okay then when the sprite clicks so because there's a clicker game you'll change points by one so if you click sum and you get one point then play sound so it's like uh some suffocating minecraft that's the only sound sound i could find and set size to 110 so it'll grow big then wait and then so you can only see it grow big and small if you don't keep spamming something or else i'm gonna just keep them big no look here if you do it it doesn't have time to do it run the code so also when greenfield collector forever wait one second change points by points per second so if you buy the the tropical fish or the dolphin you'll get points per second and then here it will change points per points per second variable so you get the automatic points then the dolphin and the costume there's cost 30 points and then points per second is 5 points per second someone gets 30 points you can buy the dolphin or you can just keep going to 50 points and get the tropical fish which has 10 points per second okay so in a dolphin code there's one green flag clicked set points per second to zero so i'll set the points per second variable to zero and then forever if points is less than 30 then set ghost effect to 60 because you can't buy it so now you can barely see it because you don't have 30 points at first i did even else clear graphic effects so if you have more you have 30 or more points it'll become regular so because you can buy it then the fish is the same thing but the points it needs to be more than 50 and yeah there's also one to spray collect if points is less than 50 then it'll do nothing else if you have 50 then it'll start sound and then change points by negative 50 if you click it because you buy it then change points per second by 10 so you have 10 points per second then i added a trophy so when growth i clicked will hide then forever if points is a hundred so when you get a hundred points then i'll show wait one second and high so edit it so it says a hundred points says congratulations okay that's it let's one three so let's bounce it bounce that's okay keep clicking here should we buy the dolphin okay like one for a second i think the tropical fish is more better but you should get dolphin to start out so you can get more tropical fish okay a lot now we can wait we get 40 points per second now we have a hundred okay why don't we we can keep crying 130 points per second that's a lot my turn okay go go so in the background there is a coral reef very beautiful there's lots of fish too i'm just gonna keep we have a thousand let us get two thousand oh we have two thousand i don't even need to click it i just need to well uh you can spam or if you click the salomon while also about buying the fish okay so if you keep clicking the tropical fish you can one day get a lot of points um 1 000 points per second you can get a thousand points per second a million points so this is just version one but it's already very fun you can get oh thirty thousand like once per second yeah now it's like a thousand like button it's like when people are in youtube you say please like okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
