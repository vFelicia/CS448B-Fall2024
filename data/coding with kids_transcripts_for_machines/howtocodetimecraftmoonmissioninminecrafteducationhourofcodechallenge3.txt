welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in timecraft So today we're gonna select one and that's this one the space yeah that's our friend it's on the moon okay so that's it go to time paw and also this is our time agent Gremlin the green one I found a town time split where the Apollo 11 rock is stuck in orbit and will never make it to the moon we have to fix this travel to the canandi Space Center on July 16 1969 and get those astronauts to the Moon okay let's go so in the times like they never reach the moon yeah enter pot and press button press press button time jumping in three it's a picture Space Center Merritt Island Florida USA July 16 1969 NASA engineer they have just received a message from Apollo 11 The Landing navigation data has been deleted how can we get the data back to them mathematician I've got the calculations to save the mission right here will have to manually send the landing navigation data and hope Apollo 11 receives it a mathematician let's get to work here's how we reached them first 425 then turn right then for 17 and finally down three so now use your talk devices to help or your time agent into space follow the mathematician's instruction to deliver the navigation data to Apollo 11. so these are the this is the mathematician and this is the NASA engineer oh it's right up there and these are computers let's see the computer oh let's see it's like so cool in real Minecraft you won't find that I love that space Oh that's I think that's the spaceship yeah that's the spaceship okay use talk device it's the activity is out there just in time now that the time agent is in place let's use code to deliver the landing navigation data to Apollo 11 so they can safely land on the moon okay so it's a code we are having like a screen to see where um Apollo 11 is send your agent to space module to deliver the calculations use the mathematician's calculations to determine how many moves the Asia must pick 425 write 17 and down three so we just have to do 425 right to 17. yeah this reached the Apollo 11 spaceship we're gonna do like the easy way to have like bicep like 25 so you don't have to do Asian move forward by 125. that is the long way yeah and like you have to do and then you need to do this 17 times yeah the first change it to White or else you'll just keep on moving forward yeah and I'll never reach this destination and then when you do down down three these are blocks yeah now let's run it because there's no repeat Loop in repeat Loop you can just do like um repeat 25 times and then just buy one faster still yeah two blocks yeah yeah NASA engineer thank you Apollo 11 has received the data we did it as a team thank you everyone for your incredible work okay so congratulations Time Square repair so don't you disappeared wow I can teleport anyways rolling skills are Stellar you prepared this moon in time and the future space exploration is safe this is like so cool in here let's see where is here oh there's a library is it here on the first one there's like nobody here these they're pressure points yeah okay let's see there's nothing on the other computers you can jump right over here there's nothing here let's go to the last one I think it's in the last row yeah probably oh it's over there jump on the pressure plate press it press secret room where was it ah it's the library wow you found the secret room take note of which time HCC here and head back to the Institute okay see it's right here Rascal and Yeti it's always these two because they're always like so suspicious they all look so soft especially Rascal his name is literally Rascal yeah let's leave leave Mission time Jump it's still say bye bye bye oh okay we think Rascal Yeti Rascal okay so now we're gonna select well in another video we're going to select another time oh look look now there's the Apollo 11 and landed on the moon those little white things are humans yeah they're the astronauts they look so small they look like a Mangus see that's the head and that's the pack yeah that's what it's so like a manga yes except it's supposed to have some color right here except it doesn't yeah well the other one looks more yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash that button and subscribe bye bye
