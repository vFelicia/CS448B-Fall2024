welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and today i'm going to teach you python i'm going to teach you math with numbers so first we already have some code here so first we type first value then second value equals four then we need first value equals five then sum equals first value plus second value then difference is first value minus second value then product will be first value star second value which is multiplication then quotient will need a full slash which is for division then modulus will need a percent then exponent will need a star star so here sum is addition difference is subtraction product is multiplication quotient is division modulus is the remainder then exponent is like five times five because it's five star star four so if it will do five times five times five times five and we already have the code we need over here let's save it with ctrl s then let's run it p y math dot p y let's run it so first we have a sum nine because five plus four equals nine the difference is one because five minus four equals one product is twenty because 5 times 4 equals 20. then quotient is 1 dot 25 because 5 divided by 4 will be 1.25 the modulus will be 1 because 5 divided by 4 will be 1.25 and then it will do the remainder which is a whole number so it'll be one then exponent will be 625 because 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 equals 625 next let's delete these yeah yeah okay this is gonna be hard to believe these are yards then you too yar next we'll need print print free plus four oopsies three plus four then star which is division i mean multiplication then five so here we have three plus four divided by i mean multiplied by five so here three plus four equals seven but we don't have the brackets so it would multiply first because it's the math rule so 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20 and then it will plus 3 because there's addition sign here it will be 23 let's see if it works let's run into the terminal up arrow for what you typed less than the terminal then 23 because 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20 and plus 3 it will go to 23. then if we want to do audition first we need print then inside the brackets we need another bracket for plus four three plus four then outside will be multiplied by five so first right now where the three plus four will be in the brackets so it will add this first so seven divided multiply by five so let's say and see the difference between jobs so 23 and 35 because 7 times 5 equals 35. you now know the difference then we'll need to do first value equals five then second value equals four then quotient equals first value divided by second value then print quotient print type function it will have the type function here so i will print these what the result will be will actually always be float so it will print a float the type will be a string integer or float let's save it and run it so it's class float because it is a float and because there's a decimal here next we need pi equals 3.14 then print type the type function pi then print integer print extra inked the part equals 99.99 then print type check up time then print over here will be print type it will see what the class is and the integer so it will make it into a full number a whole number so it won't be a float then we'll print type again with the with a different number so let's do ctrl s and run it it's class float free because of the whole number is actually free then class float because it has a decimal 99 the next one is very like this so we just need a print round and then print i mean round is actually rounding up the number so let's do ctrl s and say to save it and run it so uh it's class okay let's go back up so we can see the first one class float free and free and there's class float again 99 100. so over here it's 99 and it will be 99 and there's 100 because over here round up it will be 100 but over here is free free because it's round down so it'll be free so next first value is equals round round u uh andy seven point six five four three two one then you print and then i forgot something right here then we need to then print print right here print first value so here we round down because the rule is five are up in a round up but right now it's two so we need two numbers after the decimal so over here is less than 5 so we round down and we don't need any so it will just print 7.65 let's save it and run it so it's 7.65 because we round down so we don't need these numbers anymore so just 27.65 next second value equals round nine point comma 3 then let's print second value second value so here we need to round up because six is not not less than five so we need to round up so we add one to the six now let's save it and run it so we now we have nine point eight seven seven because we rounded up and add one to the six and then it will be 9.877 it worked and thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
