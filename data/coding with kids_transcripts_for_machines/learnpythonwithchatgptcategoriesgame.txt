welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew they want to use chat jbt to create a game in Python So today we're going to be creating the categories game with chat gbt the categories game is a game where you can do on paper we're gonna do it with python so it's where they're a few categories and then regularly you would pick a letter and list um words in the category that start with that letter but today we're just going to try to list words so I asked chat gbd to create a simple categories game in Python and then I made it at a bunch of letters I mean answers and then two players and points okay so here's the PO the code first you import the random module so you can use the filters inside of it then we're gonna have the categories and we're gonna have animals and then here the bunch of animal names fruits countries and colors so these are the words you can guess which are a lot and then here the max tries per turn is five so every turn the player a player has they can guess five words at the maximum this and then here the scores and then we have a function called choose category which we use the random.choice function from the random module and we'll pick a random uh category out of the four then we have a playground function which is the main gaining Loop that we're going to choose a category and store and the category variable then we're going to tell the players the category then we're gonna put the valid answers inside our variable we're going to have items and tries then while tries is less than maximum tries we're going to do player one and player two name an item in a category or end to finish and then remember to put that on lowercase and then if item equals equals n so if you type n and you want to end the game will break else if it's not end the item and item current you already mentioned the I so you can also check if you uh already answered like that so you have to answer another thing else if item invalid answers so if you get a right answer it will add the item it will give you a score and it will also remove it from the valid answer so you can't guess it again and it'll say this is a valid answer else it will print this is not at all answer this category tries plus equals one because you use the turn and then while true for player then it will cycle over the players and then at the end it will do print player scored and then the score points and then here you can play again and then if it's yes it'll repeat and then print final scores and then it will show the scores okay so now let's see it in Visual Studio code so here's the code let's play we're only gonna play one ROM because this can take very long no you do okay our category is fruits so let's see we can do apple and we're gonna do banana we're gonna do watermelon and we're gonna do um pineapple so you can also change the answers and categories or I still have one or two okay let's see um mango okay you're not supposed to be healthy so it says here one score five points in a category changes for Clear two zebra a monkey so you can also change the answers and so that will be harder to guess the right words so Kalia spelled misspelled monkey so it says it's not a valid answer so she loses a point but she doesn't get a point lion tiger tiger two score two points three points let's see zebra is about a monkey is not dolphin is not a valid answer see so you can shorten the list and make it harder to guess the right rules okay let's see so I won this round so we can do yes animals I'm gonna do I'm actually gonna do monkey there's no monkey in it okay organic I don't know I'm not gonna take this let's do seahorse it's not in there any uh either let's do dog yes still not let's see um um let's see let's guess the hamster third one I still have five points from the last round so I didn't get any animals again lying mine is not about answer because you already answered it oh how do you spell koala okay yeah what should I do that that is that so if you try to answer something two times it's Unity you already mentioned that I am that still takes the trip should we end it yeah okay so if you do n we'll do player two scored Four Points number I didn't know and then I will show the final scores so I won I've got five points and four points I clutch the so we hope you have fun well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching And subscribe bye bye thank you
