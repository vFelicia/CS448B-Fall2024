welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew today i'm scratching an angel's account starter scratch so today i'm going to show you my project called cash to dig so first let's see good morning so there are five black squares which are basically holes so this is based on an arc so first we have a digital image called diglett so when griffin collector go to front layer then now set which diglett which is a variable to zero and set the points variable over here to zero to you know height now go to the position and forever play a song then when we have collective forever set which stickler to zero and set which sticker to pick around one to five because there are five diggers so this variable will help us choose which digger will pop out so so pick a random one to five for which degree variable and of course trigger equals one the board has to get one and it's the same for all the other ones but it's one two three four five and the broadcast message just is like one two three four five you know wait two seconds then when i receive they got one because this is the first diglett no show then i'll repeat five times if the key one is pressed and i change points by one and high if you get if you don't press the key one wait 0.3 seconds and then it will repeat after 1.5 seconds because three times 0.3 is 1.5 seconds it'll hide then it'll choose another digger maybe it'll be the same deal then when you click reset timing because of the time and forever if timer is 60 seconds which is a minute and it will stop the game so you need to see how many points you can get in a minute so that's the same code for the diglett ii the free and take the floor by except that it's different message different positions and yeah okay so there's an also backdrop and there's a pokeball so this pokemon is a sprite and when greenback collector forever go to bed go to mouse pointer i'll always follow your mouse over your hand and it'll it's basically a decoration and this is the board and there are the holes okay so i drew the halls guess which which number to subtract this one is always three two one 5. this is based on the game where the our face wears you have a hammer and you smash the holes that come out of here master head and the middle one is four i'm getting used to the numbers five well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
