welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about list comprehensions which is a powerful tool so list comprehensions is basically it makes another list based on one list but in one single clean line so first we're gonna make a list called students which has names andrew billy cindy derek and eva then we're gonna have a new list which is empty then we're gonna do a four step so this is the regular way we do for each item which is x and the students list we're gonna if a in the word do new list.append x then we'll print a new list someone save it go to terminal and type p y comp dot p y so then andrew and eva because those were the only names in the students that had a in them so the other names don't have the letter a yeah then we're gonna do this the same thing but shorter which we are using less comprehension so we're gonna just do the new list equals x for x and students then we're gonna print a new list so this will copy the entire students list into the new list and we don't need to do this like we do it in one single clean line so now let me save it and run so did andrew billy cindy derrick and eva so copy the students then we're going to do new list equals for x and students if a and x so this is the shorter version for the fourth statement then we're going to print a new lips so this is the shorter version and we do the fourth for statement inside the new list so now i'm going to save it and write so i also did andrew and eva so it works the same way then we're going to do new list equals x for x and students if x is not billy so print new list so this will add all of the items in the students into the new list except billy so now we're gonna see if billy is there so it printed andrew cindy derek and eagle so there was no billy then we're gonna do new list equals extra title for x and students so this we did the title function we should capitalize our words they'll capitalize the first letter and make the words needed now receive it and run so that andrew billy cindy derrick and eva with the first letters capitalized so it's neater finally we're going to do nearly equals x dot title so we're going to use the title function again if x is not really i'll add the item else i'll change billy into bobby then for x and students then we're going to print new list so i'm going to save it so then andrew bobby cindy derek and eva so in the last list we printed it did andrew billy cinna derek and evil but now the billy's changed into bobby and they're still capitalized that's a very cool tool well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash your like button and subscribe bye bye
