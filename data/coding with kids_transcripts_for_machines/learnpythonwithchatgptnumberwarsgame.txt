welcome to cutting with kids my name is CIA and my name is Andrew today we're going to make a game in Python with chot gbt So today we're going to make a game you called number War where you can Bas basically choose a random number and you have to compete with who has the highest number with the computer so to make this game more fun we made it so that you can choose whatever number you want but uh if you choose 10 all the time it won't always work because we also um have a range of numbers 3 to three or you can modify it which will add or subtract that number to your number so you can't always have win also there will be a number of rounds and a winning score so now let's see the code we have import random which is a random module then we have a get player input function so while true we're going to try number input so it ask us choose the number between 1 and 10 then we're going to put a number then know is variable offset equals random randit which is this function from the random module this is the number change this is the range of how our number can be change from 3 to three then the final number is the player number plus the offset then if one is less than final one is less or equals to final number and final number is less than equals to 10 because that's our number range before the final number that's the same range for the computer too then print your final number and then it show it'll show your final number then return the number else then it say invalid Choice the F number is out of range please choose again then is value error if you don't input a number it'll do invalid input please enter a valid number then we have another function called play round we have a variable called player number and computer number the computer will choose a random number through 1 and 10 then it's going to show your number and the computer's number if your number is more than the computer number it print you win this round and then return one then if the computer wins it'll return negative one else it it's going to be a tie and turn zero these numbers we return will help us keep track of who won that round then we're going to have the number War function with number of rounds and winning score player score will and score will start at zero then for the round number here we'll show the display the round and then here are the return values if round Z equals equals one then we're add one to player score if it's negative one which means the computer wins we're going to add one to the computer score and if it's zero we're not going to do anything cuz it was a tie then it'll show the your score and the computer score after every round then if players score is equal to winning score or the computer has the winning score will break and then if the player score is more than computer score it congratulations you win the game if the computer wins it'll say sorry computer wins the game else it's going to be a tie then the total number of rounds is five and the winning score is three but you can always adjust it then here we start the game so now we're going to put in Visual Studio codes with the code here we're going to run it okay do you want to play first play first okay so choose number between one and 10 do five your final number was seven so the random offset was two so we added two then computer's number was nine so computer wins this round okay four then it added three and the computer's number was one so you win this round okay round three which number should I choose um seven oh it was tie so I got plus two and and the computer also got nine so round four three in valid Choice the F numbers out of range so it probably did 3 which is zero which is out of the range six the computer won this round because I got three that's my final number so round five okay let's choose a nine again I got plus three or plus two and then out of range do six so computer won my round because my final number is three so the computer won okay your turn you lost okay um six yes so I won cuz it was six against four four it was a tie so I got minus one eight it's also a tie um nine let's see oh oh y I win okay then round five if I win this round then I win you basically win already cuz you got a score oh I won per phone number was two computer won the r but it was 2 one okay let's try one more time I got higher than the computer okay you choose the number now oh man so you lost let's see if I have look I got 10 let's go then computer got seven okay you're now you're 10 10 you can uh eight okay so you got also got 10 and then computer got six so here the 10 didn't work because the file number was also out of their range okay so you can play this by yourself or modify it so you can play with friends well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe byebye
