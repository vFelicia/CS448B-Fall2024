welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python today we're going to learn exception handling so first we're going to do result equals 0 which is a variable then we're going to do try which is the code we're going to try to do so we're going to do num1 equals end input enter a number of cakes so we can type a number of cakes and then there's num2 equals int input enter a number of people to share the cakes so you can enter numbers then we'll do result equals num1 slash num2 so slash is basically divide so we're going to divide num1 by num2 we're going to do if num2 is less than 2 we're going to raise value error so we're going to raise the error then we're going to do accept which is the the code will run if there is a error so we're going to accept print and valid input so we're going to save and try to enter a number of kicks i'm when we do four and then we'll do enter a number of people to share the kicks we're gonna do zero then it says invalid inputs because we had zero and numbers can't divide by zero so now we'll do else so which is the code will run if there is no error i'm gonna print each person can have result cakes so now we are gonna do i'm gonna do eight cakes then four people so it is each person can have two cakes so next we're gonna do finally print thanks for eating so finally it will always run finally so now save it and so number of cakes let's do six and then three people and then it says each person can have two cakes and then it says thanks for eating so always say thanks for eating we're going to do accept zero division error as so error is basically error and this will this is the code that will run if we type zero then we're gonna print error which is the error it will say so we can know where to fix the error in the code and then it'll say someone has to eat the cake zero people to share the text and then it says division by zero so that's the error then it says someone has to eat the cake next we're gonna do final error except value error which we raise here over here and then i'll do print err this cake must be sheet so we're gonna save them right now so enter a number of cakes so i'm gonna do 9. and enter a number of people to share the case one said that it says one this cake must be shared then it says thanks for eating so this is exception handling well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
