welcome to cing with kids my name is Kalia and my is Andrew today we're going to make a simple game in Python with chat gbt so today we're going to use chat DPT to help us make a math quiz game this math quiz game is where we try to answer a number of questions within a certain time limit so chat jpt gave us this code so first we import two modules random which gives us functions that help us with random stuff and time which helps us to keep track of our time so first we have a generate question function so we have two uh three variables so operate one so they'll choose the number between 1 to 10 and then they'll do that two times for two numbers in the in the random equation then also choose a random operator which is um addition subtraction multiplication or Division if operator equals division it'll check that division results in a whole number so it because if it has decimal points it'll be very hard then we're going to put the whole question in variable which has the first number the operator and the second number then we're going to get the answer of that question using the eval functions which will evaluate our equation and then we'll return the question and answer then we have the math quiz function where we're going to have the number of questions and the time limit we're going to have a score variable and then we're going to start a time using a Time function to keep track of the time then for in range the number of questions which you can change also the time limit question correct answer equals generate question so use the function then it will show you the question then it will allow you to input your answer for that question so you try to answer as quick as you can then if your answer is equals equals to the correct answer remember to take to put two equal marks then it'll print correct and it'll add one to your score if you're wrong then it'll say wrong the correct answer is and then it'll display the correct answer then elapse time equals time. time minus start time so here calculate time then it'll print game over and then it'll show you your score and the time you took to complete those questions and if lapse time is more than time though it'll print you R out of time then those are other function here's the main game Loop if the name equals main then I'll have the number of fun number of questions and time Lim which you can change and the time limit is in seconds then L print welcome to the math quiz game you have and then show you the seconds to answer blah blah blah questions then I'll run the functions so now let's try it in studio code and you want to go first do you want me you go first okay let's see 10 * 10 100 7 * 4 28 10 16 2 11 I took 8.57 seconds to answer um five questions so which is pretty impressive I guess but it's kind of simple because it's just two numbers okay now your turn Okay 8 / by8 there also negative answers oh no keep going oops oh that's times oh I'm getting everything wrong you took 1650 seconds that's almost twice as long as mine let's try one more time and you can compare your scores to other people to compete okay three two one go one supposed do three hey why you get the easy ones it's random questions you get all addes uh 54 that a littleit slower 9.94 okay one more time go 9us one you finally got that right he so slow at typing hey h i got the I better than you but your first one was so slow and I My overall record is still better than yours so you can also change the number of questions and time limit and you can compete your scores with your friends and have fun well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe byebye
