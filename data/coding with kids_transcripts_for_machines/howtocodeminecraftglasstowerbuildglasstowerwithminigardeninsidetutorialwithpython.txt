welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're minecraft education edition and we're going to make a project called garden so we're in microsoft make code and we're going to go into a project called card so first we hit on chat command so our chat command is here when you type garden onto the on chat onto the chat so i'm going to use a thing called the builder which is basically an invisible agent that can help you build so first we need to do the builder teleport to zero zero zero which is right now our position yeah but you can't see the builder so it's invisible no it's not the agent then you'll need to have every time repeat loop repeat 10 times so this is just like another project i made like the tower but adding because this is not a tower time four times so this is just part one of the garden then you need to build a trace path so whenever the building moves um the block you select will appear so when you require it is glass for our garden so right now we're building like the dome right yeah with a door okay okay so build a trace path so wherever moves glass blocks will follow then we need builder move forward by one so so finally it will have a glass block like up here behind it so now we're gonna try to run it so first we do garden to like start garden a bunch of them because we did the repeat loops right now the builder the builder is making a line of glass okay so i think it's going to repeat for like 40 times yeah holy crash it replaces okay this is better than the agent okay let's go just keep going okay so we need to move forward by five times five times then turn right so it won't just keep on going like um forward forward forever that would be like does not do then well outside the repeat four we needed builder move up so after it's complete with one one floor it will move up to make the other so there will be 10 floors that is big yeah then we make the dome without a top so when it rains it rains because the plants need water yeah so when you move down to build the door for us to go in so move down by 10 because there's 10 floors right now the builder must be like 10 blocks high up there then build a turn right so it can go like somewhere not near the edge turn right yeah right then build and move forward one time then place the door twice okay so now we're right here in the blocks we're gonna scroll up and we're gonna search here item because the door is um if you don't add the item you can only get blocks so i'm gonna do the door i'm just gonna choose the regular oak door or any door you want i like the bridge door because you know okay okay yeah that's it's very big so let's let's go over here don't disturb anything okay now i'm gonna do the gardening so you can like um make how big your garden is by changing the moving forward and repeat loops the move forward is for how long each row is like like this like this and the repeat 10 times is for how many floors it will have like how many blocks the glass will be so right now it's just building small squares so this is a little small it's just tall but it's still good for somebody who wants a they have a little space but they want garden that's tall okay glass okay this is finished so before oh there's a door here it's open because it eliminates the um theater yeah this is like a miniature cage so next we're gonna see it in python okay so def on a chat doesn't function builder that teleport to position zero zero zero so the builder will teleport to where you are then four index and range ten and four index two and range four so repeat that two will be cool yeah that trace path graph so it trades a glass block where the builder walks and then builder that move forward five times so make the first side and build that turn right turn to do the other side and then out of the repeat loop of four builder for index two another that move up one to make the second floor and builder that move down ten times i'll give you that two people yeah then better that turn right turn bit of that move forward one time so move forward and brother that place the burst drawer so i'll place the door where you can go in the cage and then that's the function yeah and then player that unchecked when you type guardian in the chat it'll run the function okay so shall we plant plants well that will be the next part but if you want to right now okay okay go in how if we're in survival that's how we do it looks a little like stone but even dark wait there's a little like a little trace over here okay you know we need some seeds um let's see melon pumpkin and regularly how about bone meal okay we need a water bucket for water okay water bucket so we're just not gonna add the torches just yet okay oh okay let's look we're seeing ho ho here comes santa claus that's silly okay i think actually i would cut this rope and place the water in because we don't have that much space here okay then i want to plant the seeds pumpkin it's so little pumpkin needs space okay this you still have to wait it still has to wait this one you still have to wait so does the melon yeah pumpkin okay let's do this yeah yeah okay okay now we have to wait yeah the door to say far away far well little time oh well i can plant oh those are that is so cool i know you can just do it on the ground and then there'll be random plants bringing up yeah that is so cool and it's green sparkles like we're growing it's like so cool because the flowers just pop up yeah like out of nowhere i just need a phone look at this one okay one final one next to these flowers i like this little oranges i like the white flower yeah they're like duping but okay make it beautiful make it beautiful okay now let's go into the um garden slash cage and look outside it's like we're stuck in a beautiful cage don't want to stop them okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
