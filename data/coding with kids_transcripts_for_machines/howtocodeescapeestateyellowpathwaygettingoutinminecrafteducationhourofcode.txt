welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia mine is Andrew Taylor in Minecraft education Edition and an escape estate so in the last video we opened up to this portal room and we saw that Rascal is a bad guy with all the other time ages now we're gonna enter these side rooms to get the timing so let's we're going to activate the corona cantons to prevent them from going into the time part yeah Yeti so we entered yetis aside yet there's no way we'll let you in prepare for an avalanche of anguish explore a sidewoon mechanics keep on going this purple thing oh we get jumped we get teleported to the other side yeah let's keep it going now we get another one it's like slime yeah boom okay then let's not fall down okay oh something's here agent looks like you could use some help don't worry I've got your back I can help you activate the candles just show me the way okay so now here our agent is in here and then there's a gold blocking him lever so I think we're gonna go to the league yet he's a bad guy so let me move the agents okay so let's go to code prepare the Cannons there's a lever move the agent to the lever and then pull it down use agents that move to position the agent in front of the lever and then use pull lever down to flip the lever off the agent move function takes one parameter that defines what direction you should move it forward back left right up and down Okay so let's see the code example so here's this move forward three times and then pull over down so ahead of it is a copper block so it needs to move backwards yeah okay so let's just move it back okay let's go to code you can also use repeat Loop so now we're going to make the forward into backward because um it can't move any other direction okay so after backward it's gonna move left left two times oops so now we're gonna make the left and add two lefts so now let's see where it goes bye okay you need to go forward and then one more left okay so now we're going to do agent dot move and we're gonna do forward and then we're gonna move left again agent dot move and then we're gonna do the left now let's see what where that takes us so now it's here we need to move forward two times to get to the gold block and move right one time forward two times then right one time so now we're gonna do Asian dot move and we're gonna do forward two times okay now let's see where that takes us okay so now we only have to go right when blocking them we can use to flip the lever function because I think that there's a gold block because that's where we can flip the lever okay don't move I'm gonna do right right and then when you have to pull up or down now it should work so pull now puzzle solve and now all those blocks became Emerald Block yeti abominable human this isn't over so now puzzles he went back out let's go so now Yeti's joined to Rascal oh the Chrono can't it just pops I don't know it's so cool Explorer side so now it's starting to spit so now should we go and explore another one sure let's go to that one this one there it is so let's go this way because there's a Teleport Banshee there is no opposing us soon will be gone and you'll be trapped to your shrieking and song so that's kind of hard slime okay no keep on going so all the rooms look different this has more has a blue yeah this man she is blue I'm almost there okay we're here it's another reason so now we have to go to this bar first okay so that's moved right free time so we can use a repeat Loop okay okay so it's the same thing okay so here we can delete this I'm gonna delete this and then we're gonna do for eye in range we're gonna do three times and then we're gonna do H agent dot move right do right okay so let's see where that gets us okay right there so now we have to move forward two times and then left one time okay so we're gonna remember to remove the tab we're gonna do agent dot move and do forward two times and then we're gonna move it left one time so we'll go to the gold block so now we still have the pull level function so that's gonna pull the lever and puzzle saw again yeah this is Banshee ah I didn't think you had a ghost of a chance so he underestimated us okay so now we can explore another side so now Ben she is also returning to the Moon chamber now there's another Crown location no there's two more quickly quickly now this one has a lot of grass okay what is it it's Gremlin your kind never learns your malfunction is inevitable and now let's go here it's now this fake water it's just Glitz glass okay boom Oh we went over here okay so then we keep going there's a lot of plants in here this is probably the god okay what the what's up here oh my gosh so now this is not on the floor it's on the walk so first we need to move forward three times then down so we can use a repeat Loop okay it's the same instructions again no move three times so we can change the right to forward then we have to move down and then we're going to do we can delete this one for now so now we're gonna run it okay okay oh let's do it again three times do it again that wrong okay so now we have to move forward three times again and then move up for I in range three and then Asian dot move and forward and then what agent that move up okay now we're in the right okay so now we have to move up one more time one more time so we're into agent dot move and do up okay so let's run it again so now we have to move forward one two three four five six times so our repeat Loop is gonna help a lot or else you have to write um write agent that moved forward six times and that's a lot okay so we're gonna do six times and then we're gonna do agent dot move forward and then I think we have to wait double you can do it single order okay so now we have to move down to two times and then we can flip the lever so we're gonna make it move down two times so now we're gonna run it and it should flip the lever so now I did puzzle solved Gremlin so you figured out the Gizmo no matter it won't stop us so they're so confident that they'll steal away let's go to the final chamber so we went right through we can walk way through the can that is crazy okay so let's go tell us one more I think it's pixie dude this is the pink one there's a lot of magma huh you really think you can defeat us you're living in a fairy tale they keep tallness yeah okay explore a sidewoon it's actually lava but it's under glass yeah so these these are all themes maybe we've been through all of these rooms before I remember the guard let's keep going okay so now it's here oh yeah so first let's go to the sides because the middle takes a little longer I just go forward right yeah spacing that way so forward two times okay so we're gonna go down here okay most of our code except the pullover down okay so first we're gonna do agent dot move I'm gonna do four one or two two now we're gonna see where that takes us okay so now we have just have to move down one one two three four times and then it will be quicker than the middle a little okay so we gotta use a repeat Loop so for I in range we're gonna do four times we're gonna do agent dot move we're gonna do down right yeah so now let's see and it should be really close now we have to walk backwards two times and then move down two times sitting around do agent dot move backward I'm gonna do that two times and then down two times you just move down and then another time so now we should flip the lever okay and activate the final Chrono Cannon puzzle saw let's go what impossible nobody puts pixie in a corner you were never in a chord okay let's spit spin around and go to the exit fix it that way no it's backwards oh it is though that's not all the chronic units should be activated and we should destroy their time portal in the next video oh we walk right through it again good work now that all four cannons are ready we can take down the defenses on the time warp and stop the time ages they're all staring at us so now we still need to code the time cannons in another video well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
