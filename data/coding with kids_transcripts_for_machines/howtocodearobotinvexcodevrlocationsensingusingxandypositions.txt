welcome to curtin with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in mexico so today we want to learn about xy coordinates so first we need to drive forward so it's going to drive forward forever wait until okay don't wait until it's right there so wait until something is bigger that is bigger than zero so position when you first yeah position y is bigger than zero and millimeters is bigger than zero zero so now it's gonna drive forward until the y is more than zero so here the y is up and down so the middle is y we start from here so when we go here and we go straight up we go to more than zero then it's going to stop driving because it's going to turn right for 90 degrees okay let's turn turn right for 90 degrees then drive forward so after it goes to y the y coordinate more than zero it'll turn right for 90 degrees and drive forward and then it's going to drive forward then wait until wait until so after the y is more than zero it's going to turn right drive for and drive forward until wait until bigger the bigger one bigger than zero so the position in x in millimeters so the xcoordinate is more than zero then stop driving stop driving okay so now it's going to drive forward until the position in y is more than zero and then turn right for 90 degrees drive forward wait until position x more than zero and stop driving so we start here and it's gonna drive forward until it goes more than zero in y coordinate then it will turn right so his face this way in the x and then it will drive until it goes middle and then it'll stop so let's run it anyway okay let's do it in 2d mode first so it's gonna go forward until it goes to more than zero y so now it's moving forward and again now it's more than zero y is turn and down is zero zero so it's stopped let's go to 3d mode okay let's restart it first dance video because when you restart it it goes to t 2d mode let's run so now let's go forward until y is more than zero turn right and drive forward until x is more is more than zero so now yeah and thanks for watching remember to smash or like and subscribe bye
