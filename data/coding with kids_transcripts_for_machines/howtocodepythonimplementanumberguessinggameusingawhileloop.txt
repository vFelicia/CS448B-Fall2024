welcome to curtin with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to use the while loop to make a simple game so our game is going to be a number guessing game so he tries to guess the correct number so first we're going to do import random so import whatsapp platform using module and random is our module so random is a builtin module and a module is basically a code file with functions so remember to put import at the top of all your code then we'll do value which is a variable equals random.random15 so why do we need the random random dot randy so rand is a function we need random.randit because render is a function that's inside the module random that's why we're using the module random so rand that will pick a num a random number between one and five and i'll store that number inside the variable value then we'll do count equals zero so count is a variable that'll keep track of how many tries you took to guess the correct number and then finally we're gonna do guess equals zero so guess is the number you guessed the correct number is then well guess exclamation mark equals value that mean exclamation mark equals is not so while guess is not valued that means while you guess incorrect then you'll count plus equals one so add one to count this will do the same as count equals count plus one so we're adding count to what count we're adding once account because it's a term and then guess so now we're assigning guess the variable equals input guess the number between one and five so the code will ask you the question guess a number between one and five and whatever your answer is will be stored inside the guess variable then we want to do if guess dot is numeric so as numeric is a function that will check if our guess function i mean guess variable is a number so then it is a number your guess equals into guess so turn your guess into an integer if you type bob to the question guess the number between one and five it'll go all the way back to the while again and it'll print guess a number between one and five and that'll count as a term if you did a number it would end the number and goes to wall and then if you do the correct number it'll go through the else in the while loop and then you'll print f string you guessed it and count tries and in the count it'll do the number coming tries you then you can do the the number yeah let's save it but control s go to terminal and type p y while game dot p y and run so it says guess a number between one five when you get all the numbers until we get yeah let's do it one more time so you can use your up arrow to copy what you last typed in the terminal so let's see let me guess five okay you guys my turn my turn one no no two two yes four i almost guessed free one more time five of you guesses four nope i guess two nope oh it is it's two again so i guess it's a random number why does it never get five but it will one time okay it worked so now we're gonna make our version two so after there's a guess equals zero we're gonna do print guess a number between one and ten so it's telling you the goal also in the randit we need to do it pick a random number from one to ten not one and five it's hardly because it's one to ten but the last one is one two five yeah so there's more numbers to guess then after the account plus one that means it has one's account you're gonna assign guess in a different way so print a different thing so guess equals input is still what you type in guess it's still what you type it it'll print f string enter guess number so it'll tell you the guess you're on like how many tries right now you took then after if guest is numeric we'll do else that means if you type bulb or something that is not a number it will go to else and it'll do print numbers only please so you'll print numbers only please just telling you don't type something that's not a number and then it'll continue so skip all the other colors by going to show you below here and it'll print enter guest number count again then after this we're going to do another if so if you type the number into your number and then go to if the other if so if guess is more than value then it'll print your guess is too high try again so now we're getting clues then lf if it is not too high if it's lower than value that means lower than the correct number it'll print your guess is too low try again so now all the way to the while loop and then you'll print enter guess number would count then if you do correct it will continue it'll end your guess and then you'll pass the if because it doesn't match the first if or the second so go to the while again and then check but your number is the value so go all the way to the else and print you guessed it and count try so let's save it and run it i'm going to guess number one seven too high your turn five oopsies again your guess is too hard try again two two two low three three you guessed it in five trolls yeah but we just free again i guess all the guesses okay eight too high five too high two too low three two three four four no okay five tries let's see if khalid too high four oh no two trolls eight oh no four tries one more two depends unlock six you six oh one truck one truck it says numbers only please and then it printed enter guest number two that can't get one game okay that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
