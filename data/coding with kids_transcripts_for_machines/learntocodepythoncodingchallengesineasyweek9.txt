welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible So today we're gonna do three easy coding challenges in edit so edible is a coding platform where there are lots of easy coding problems and which you can solve using different coding languages so our first problem is called find the total number of digits the given number has our instructions are create a function that takes a number as an argument and Returns the amount of digits it has so for example here it will give us a random number for example 56 we need to return how many digits there are so 56 is from five and a six so we're going to turn two for 123 there are three digits so we're going to turn three okay so first we have a function called find digit amount with a variable which is the number called num so first we're gonna do string equals string num so string is a variable so we're going to use the string function to turn the number we're given into a string so we can use the line length function to find the length so next we're going to do we're going to create another variable called length and we're going to use the Len function of string so we're gonna the length function will turn well um figure out the length of whatever you put inside for example the string and then it will put the number like the number of digits or letters inside the variable length so we're gonna do string not num because the length function only works on strings so then we're going to do return length to return the length of digits in the number so we do test cases for example here there's five five five one no five five five five one there are five digits so we're going to turn five and there's one there's nine six four five six four three one so there's eight digits so we're gonna turn eight so now we pass all their tests so our next problem is called sort numbers and ascending order create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list sorted in ascended ascending order which is smallest to biggest sort numbers list in ascending order if the function's argument is none or it gives you an empty list return an empty list return a new array of sorted numbers so here's an example if they give us 1 2 10 50 and 5 which it so is the bunch of numbers in list we need to return the list back with the numbers in order from Smalls to greatest so here it'll be one two five ten and fifty so first we have a function called sort nums ascending with a list with with numbers in it called list so first we're going to do if list equals equals empty bracket or empty empty list return the empty list back so we're going to we're going to use two equal signs because we don't want to assign something to make a bug so then if the list does have numbers in it we're going to do else list.sort so the sort function will um make sort the numbers from smallest to greatest so then we're going to return the sorted the new sorted list I'm going to check it and now see the test cases for example there can also be negative numbers here for example negative 21 negative 9 and negative 96. so the smalls is negative 96 then negative 21 and then negative 9 so we're going to return that list here if we get a empty list we return the empty list so back to the console all tests are passed onto our final problem find the amount of potatoes that's silly potatoes create a function to return the amount of potatoes there are in the street so they'll give us a string with a potato with at least well maybe yeah at least one potato in it and then we need there will also be other words and letters potato Apple so when you return the um on the number of times potato um was in these isn't appears in the strip so first we have a function called potatoes with the string called potato so first I'm going to do create a function called number num equals potato dot count and then we're going to count the string potato so the count function will return the number of times um whatever is in here that is in the variable or the list so we're going to put that number in the variable num so we're going to count for the string potato then we're basically going to return the num variable so your tests there is potato potato Cherry so they're two potatoes there's a pattern two there's a potato potato orange no potato potato orange there's three potatoes to return three console all tests are passed well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
