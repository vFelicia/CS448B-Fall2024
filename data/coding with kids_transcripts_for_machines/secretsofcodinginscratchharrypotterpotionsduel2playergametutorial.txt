welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today is scratching angie's account techno468 today i'm going to show you my project called harry potter potion stool so as you can see we have draco malfoy via harry potter so they're real enemies they'll be so they'll be fighting with these potions blue and green so the green one does damage and the blue one does healing there are sounds and effects okay so let's see the code so for harry potter we have when green flag click they'll reset the harry potter hp and draco mall 4 hp which is their health to 10 so each has a health of 10 and the potions on the heel or do damage of one so when i receive hairy attacks so it's harry gets that person and uses it so it's a message now switch costume to harry potter 2 and then wait 0.5 seconds and switch across into harry potter so here it's one here with dracula for attacks harry potter not harry potter attack okay so there's explosion effects oh no okay then when griflock collected a switch costume to harry potter you don't want harry potter to start in a damaged way and forever if harry potter hp equals zero or drag them all for hp goes here so they're both variables then it'll stop also it ends the game so if one of them um loses it will stop fall yeah okay for dragon ball four we have when green flag clicked the switch costing dragon ball four so again we have effect yes froze a potion so when i see my four attacks this time i'll switch costume to dragon ball four 42 which is the explosion effect wait 0.5 seconds and back to its original costume so for healing potions we have one reflex like to oh forever if mouse down so if you're clicking and you're clicking on the potion so touching mouse pointer then i'll change harry potter hp by one so a heal harry potter is my favorite product says good yeah okay then i'm gonna start sound minecraft potion drinking sound effect it's like this so this it's the personal minecraft drink yesterday yeah okay then wait one second so you can't keep spamming yeah potion two so this is a harming potion when green flaps like go forever if mouse down and touching mouth pointer again if you're clicking it then i'll change dragon ball four hp by negative one so he'll subtract one from dragon ball voice hp so harry potter yeah then you'll broadcast my four attack which is the message start sound yeah okay then wait one second so again you can't spam sephora dragon ball four's pair so for dracula voice pair of potions in the same code except it's different variables and different messages okay so clear while we drag on the point i'll be harry potter let's take turn so yeah okay okay how okay um if anger just keeps healing you need a heel i'm not you need to what do you want to do okay no forever so i'll say whoever goes first have a 70 or 80 percent opening yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
