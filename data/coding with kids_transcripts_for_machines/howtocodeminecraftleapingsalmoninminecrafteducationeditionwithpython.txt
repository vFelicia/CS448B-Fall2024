welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew today we're on minecraft education edition and we're gonna do one of those tutorials so we're in microsoft makeup in which is to cause sound to mix giant lips into the sky and um i can use to code and set item type to try it so let's get these we want multiple fish to spawn for each trident news so insert a repeat loop into the item music and set the repeat number to six so we repeat six times now we need to spawn them all some chicken this one yes so it's gonna spawn and now we need to pick random position pick random from negative three thirty negative three from three thirty three so the sixth almost one six different spots and now i'll just made it so these salmon fall from extremely high we should create a pound to catch them so they don't get injured when they land add a new on item used to your code and set the item to kelp so kelp okay it's like a drive seat use a drive truck and put a fill into the on item used that's set for the fallen fish need to land on water so sit there fill block type to water so blocks fill with and get into water and we uh set position from negative four negative one minus four oops one then negative four to four negative one four so this will be the place where we create the pond you're all done so we need to get a trident and a kelp let's first look at the python so first death on item and direct interacted kelp item on item interactive cup so when you use detail it'll run the function then def on item interactive trident so this is for trying for index and range six so repeat six times monster spawn solomon and then random position then clear that one item interact and try it so run the function when you used to try it first uh i think you need to do the lake first then but it's so much trickier to actually it's like you just point it in the sky and then the fish come falling down is those you need to switch very fast really really do you like the pawn then we tried okay let me try that first okay two see now they're surviving and then like they've water spreading everywhere oh no uh they're getting out of there because they're cute jumping the cows in the water i ain't more solomon okay oopsies the water is getting me away but at least i'm in creative one so i can float oh there's so much they're landing on top of the trees more the lucky lucky ones get to survive oh there's so much there's like so much of them a lot splattered on the tree that's so cool yeah let's go to another place section one did andrew's turn to try first trident and kelp so you spawn the fish then you create a pawn sweat on the floor oh the water we created went are going to the lake right yeah this is natural oh it's like before it was we can plant some kelp while creating more ponds like yeah oh it's making it deeper because it's replacing yes so cool yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
