welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today is watching andrew's techno468 today i'm going to show you my project called find the crewmates version 1.2 so this is the second version so i added some view rules okay so first i had i changed the news on to a new song then i also changed and i added a thumbnail as you can see here so in green flat clicked it'll go to front layer and then it'll show wait three seconds and hides it up here for 30 seconds until you can start the game so adding roles like engineer and scientist so mr cheese and white are engineers so engineers can vent in a manga so here in this project they will disappear so in green five click they'll set event variables to zero forever set vent to pick a random one to two so vent will have one or two in it and then if vent equals two then it'll hide wait 15 seconds this year so basically you vent for 15 seconds else if vent is one then it'll just wait 10 seconds because you don't want it to keep um pick a random one to two or it'll just keep appearing disappear for white is the same but it's just changed a variable for yellow yellow is a scientist so scientists can look at vitals and they can see if you if who is the imposter so when this right click so when you eliminate yellow the change is scientists dead by one which is a variable so we're going for a click a switch backdrop to looking such which is a paulus backdrop so i changed it so it is scientists eliminated to zero and then we wait 10 seconds so you have seven seconds to eliminate the scientists because a thumbnail takes three seconds to disappear so if scientist eliminated equals one they'll switch backtrack to win which is a windscreen so there's you win and you lose so then i'll switch back to when it'll stop the game and else if scientist eliminated equals zero then switch backdrop to loose lose and stop all okay so now let's play each of us are gonna go do one turn okay andrea's going first yeah that's fast because they keep moving every half a second your turn you can't just click everywhere but i'm trying to track it down you can follow it with quick reactions i'm better and way better in touchscreen last time you eliminated yellow so you win yay congratulations so you can try out yourself well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
