welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia my name is andrew today we're in edibit so edibit is a coding platform where there are lots and lots of problems you can solve using all kinds of coding languages so today we're going to do three challenges in edibit using python so our first challenge is called return a string as an integer so our mission is to create a function that takes a string and returns it as an integer so here are examples what our function should do so string and six so it gives us a string which is six we need to turn it into six but it's an integer and then we need to do the same with all numbers so let's go to code so we have a function called string int and we have a variable called txt that stands for text so text is the thing we need to change into an integer so first we do a variable called result equals int text so this int will turn whatever is inside the variable into an integer whatever it was before and then we're going to return the result variable which is the um the text but turned into an integer so now let's check it and for the test it will give us a number and then which is a string and we need to turn it into an integer so let's see oh all four tests are passed let's go on to next challenge add subtract multiply or divide write a function that takes two numbers and returns if they should be added subtracted multiplied or divided to get 24. if none of the operations give can give 24 return none so here are some examples so it goes two numbers in this case 15 and 9 so 15 plus 9 equals 24 so when you return added and then there is um 11 and 11. there's no way you can get 24 with 11. you only can get 22. yeah so there's none and then 26 and 2 26 minus 2 equals 24 so when you return subtracted let's see only integers are used as test input numbers should be added subtracted divided or multiplied in the order they appear in the parameters the function should return either added subtracted divided multiplied or not let's see the code so we have a function called operation and we have two variables num1 and num2 number one and number two yeah so first we need to do if num1 plus num2 equals equals 24 return added so we need two equal signs because um one equal sign is just stating like this is stored inside this for variables two equal signs actually means is one plus one equals two yes okay so if number one plus num two equals twenty four it'll return added so it's like if is 20 plus 4 equals 24 and then it will return added yeah so we're going to do the same we've all uh subtracted multiply and divide it so we're going to do lf which is else if num1 minus number 2 equals equals 24 or num2 minus number one num1 equals equals 24. there are two ways this could work out because it maybe the number two is like bigger than number one yeah then if it works we're going to return subtract it and we're going to do the same with multiplied and divided so lf um we're going to do num1 divided by num2 equals equals 24. so this could also go two ways and if it does work we're gonna return divided and finally multiplication lf num1 star which is multiply num2 equals equals 24. this can only go one way uh return multiply so then else this is the last well if none of these work that means they can't get into 24 so we're going to return none now let's check it and see the tests so here they'll give us two numbers 12 and 12. so here 12 plus 12 equals 24. 100 minus 706.76 wow subtract it that's still worth now there's 10 and 12 that doesn't work there's also 528 divided by 22. okay let's see so we passed all the tests now to our final challenge to the power of okay so create a function that takes a base number and an exponent number and returns the calculation so here for example 5 to the power of 5 is 3 125. this 3 to the power of 3 is 27. so when you return the result and all test inputs will be positive integers so um after you do the exponent like 3 to the power of 3 so if they're both integers which they are um it will be 27 and 27 will still be an integer okay let's see so we have a function called calculate exponent with two variables num which is the number and the exponent so we need to do return num star star x that's all we need to do is very simple so um a longer way is to put a num star star x into a a variable and then you return the variable so star star and python means exponent like to the power of so if one to the power of one it will be one okay now let's check it and see the tests so there is three and three 27's these are the examples right here they're basically just tests let's see the console so all tests are passed yay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
