welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition and we're going to do to make a tower with the builder so first we're going to make a new project called tower because we're making a tower then we're going to uncheck command when you take tower into the chat we'll make a tower so first we need a repeat loop repeat it for 10 times then inside the repeat loop we need another repeat loop repeat it for four times then in the advance we need the builder so because we're building a tower we we don't want to make it with our hands so the builder will help us so we need to do builder trace path from mark with with the polish and the scent so when the builder moves there will be the polished and set um with like we moving behind it so if i went here then there will be a polish polished innocent if i was to build then need to build and move forward by free and one by three so the builder will move free box but then it'll be like one side of the floor one of the top yeah then builders turn right so you know so this will be like a little square yeah three by three square like one two three one two three then one two three like that then out of the repeat four times we need a builder move up so build the move up by one so it'll make another level so there's ten levels then we need another repeat loop repeat four times and inside the repeat loop repeat three times call place and move so we're going to make a function called place and move and inside we're going to do place a stone wall place a stone wall so i do a cobblestone wall and then builder move forward by one so this is on the top so like you can kind of like it's like a watch tower and you can shoot opponents below and then you call place the move so you place the builder place and then move forward by one three times and then builder turn turn right so out of the repeat loop the builder will turn right so complete it look just like this so let's see go to a place and then tower to oh it's cut into the grass okay let's i wanna break that okay it's building so it's one side by one side yeah okay drop down one another one you can see a hole okay and then four so it's like like magically appear because it's invisible yeah okay another four how many floors have you been oh it's starting to rain dude let's set it to clear sky clear okay okay so it's clear again okay so while it's finishing the tower let's see it in python so in python it's define place and move to this place and move function further that plays cobblestone wall so the builder will place the wall and then build it up move forward then def on chat for index remains 10 so repeat 10 times then for index 2 in range 4 so it's the second loop four times build that trace path polish and the site builder that move forward three times and we build it up turn right turn and then add the repeat four times that the builder will move up to the next floor and then four index and range four times and then another loop for three times it would run the punch function place and move and then you will do builder that turn right turn and then play that on chat when you type tower on the chat it'll run the function okay and i think it's stopped when you go into this code yeah let's make another one right there clear space okay 13 tower start building okay go into the middle we got stuck going to middle but we're in creative mode so we won't suffocate go into the oh no i always replaced it oh we're inside a block i want to get it out oh dude i can't wear and yeah oh i got out of it it's a quick escape it's still building still building okay let's drop down to count one two three one two three four four five six seven eight nine nine four nine still nine one okay there's a ten ten four okay okay still building it okay now there's a wall so this is like the little hole where you can shoot yeah so it's like a in pvp when you put this wall and you know like places place so you can go up and then you get it's a bunch attack so now i just want to get an error we're just going to get a bow because in creative you already have those you already have here and then like you do this so in survival you need to create a blocks to stand or ladder yeah and then it's just like it's like and then when somebody shoots arrows at you you just need to dodge them yeah yeah so the crossbar is actually faster but it takes super long time to reload yeah oh yeah we're shooting into the river oh you're missed okay yeah there's no splash yeah because you know it's the water there's just a thin little arrow okay look when it's the crossbars are loaded it'll stay reloaded so you can just shoot right away like it's so cool but yeah it needed a long time to really yeah this is your last era we will our shoot will go all the way to the sky so where did it go disappeared because it was so far and then there's lava pool over here and that's our first tower let's shoot which is incomplete because we went to the code the the you can see i know it's because it's so fast yeah this one's the completed one if you built a lot it will be like so cool if you built a lot of those like connected and you can make a kingdom or like a wall yeah this is a wall and watch towers yeah shoot well it's farther the it doesn't give it so much effect well this one does but you're here it looks so long arrow will you ever come back will you i think it says oh it's right here okay how about this one i don't think that bow will be too long yeah but still in your way right your brothers okay one more zero i like the crossbow more the moon okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
