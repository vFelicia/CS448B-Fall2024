welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in edibit so edibit is a platform where there are lots and lots of challenges that you can solve using coding languages of all kinds so today we're at edibit and we're going to use python and we're going to solve three challenges so our first challenge is called are the numbers equal so our instructions are to create a function that takes two integers and checks that they are equal so here are examples so is equal which is a function that will give you the numbers five and six is it equal false five and six are not equal so we need to um make the function to work then there's another example example is equal one and one true because one is equal to one and then there's another one with one and one but one one of the ones is a string and the other is the integer so there is a note and it says if there's a string that you should return false okay let's see so define is equal then we have number one and number two so this is our function so i'm going to do if number one equals equals to two question marks integer number two return true so if one number is equal to another number and both of them are integers it will return true and else if one of them is an integer or um one of them is not equal to the other it'll do else return false now let's check it now it's checking so there are the tests so it'll give you two numbers for number one and number two as variables and then their answers so for the console here we passed all the tests and then here you can see in the test these are the results where we are supposed to give is there's two two they're equal so there's true and then there's a one and five and one is an integer so it's false and there's 88 and 88 true 3645 false okay that's our first challenge and moving on to next challenge this challenge is called let's fuel up a vehicle needs 10 times the amount of fuel that the distance it travels however it must always carry a minimum of a hundred feet before setting off create a function which calculates the amount of fuel it needs given the distance so here are the examples calculate fuel 15. so if there is 15 i mean 15 um distance we need to calculate how many fuel we need so 15 times 10 equals 150 so then we will return 150 so if here for example calculated field 3 3 times 10 is 30 but it says um it it must always carry a minimum of a hundred field before setting off so here it says distance will be a number greater than zero return 100 if the calculate calculated field turns out to be less than a hundred so here three times 10 is 30 30 is less than 100 so we need to return a hundred okay now we have a function called calculate field with a variable called n so only if uh we're going to make a field a variable called feel it goes n which is the distance times 10 so that fuel holds the variable field holds the fuel need then if fuel is more than 100 then return fuel so we're checking if it's more or less than 100 because remember the vehicle needs to carry a minimum of 100 fuel and else if the fuel is less than a hundred it will just return a hundred okay now we're gonna check and see the tests so test will give us the um the distance there's um a bunch of there's sometimes there is um points and then so we passed all the tests okay and then here there's a number that is the distance we or we need the fuel we need to um return so here's 15 15 times 10 is 150 so that works but here um 3.14 times 4 i mean times 10 equals 31.4 that's less than 100 so we return 100 okay now for our last challenge it's called luke i am your dot dot dot so luke skywalker from says star wars has family and friends humans will remind him who is who so like maybe his memory got a little whackadoodledoo given a string with a name return the relation of that person to luke he's a chart so in case if you didn't watch star wars or didn't know anything you can see the names and the relation to luke skywalker so there's darth vader leah han and r2d2 so darth vader's relation is father leah's his sister han is brotherinlaw and r2d2 is just a droid it's a robot yeah so here are examples so relation to luke darth vader then when you say luke i am your father so luke knows who how his relation is and then for hand is luke i am your brotherinlaw so let's go to code and there are functions called relation to luke with a variable called name okay let's see so if name equals equals darth vader return luke i am your father so then luke will be oh you're my father but you're evil okay then we're gonna do the same to the other three people and r2d choose the jordan if name equals leah return luke i am your sister and then if name eagles equals han return luke i'm your brotherinlaw and the same for r2d2 except i am i i am your droid or robot yes now let's check it and for the test it will only do the four members and then it has the thing that the relation the people need to say to luke so lou can remember okay so console so we test all four uh we passed all four tests and we succeeded okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
