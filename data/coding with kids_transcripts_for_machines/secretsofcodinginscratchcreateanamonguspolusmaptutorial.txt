welcome to kids my name is colleen and my name is andrew today i'm wearing scratching and andrew's account techno468 so today i'm going to show you a project that i remixed called among this polish map so i remixed the original map and i'm trying to make of among us in scratch so i did a lot to the project so today we're gonna do part one which is the report button so i got the report button from the internet and i uploaded here so let's see the code so when green class collected forever if your mouse is down or when you're pressing with your finger if you're on an ipad phone and body is not near which is variable equals one and touching mouse pointer then that means which means you are pressing the button because i didn't do dead body so it just picks a random number of seconds and you can press we're going to switch costume to dead body report too so let's see the costume dead body reported to it's like when when there's dead bodies reported yeah so it's like there's this okay then uh star sound report body longer sound effects so that's when you report a body the sound then every two seconds and then switch costumes for so it will switch the costume to the regular costume which is the yeah so i did a ghost effect so if i click switch costume to report one so what you won't start out the game at like you're already reported and then it'll go to front layer and then step by step which is variable i'm not really using it to zero because i can't make because that is yeah this is not online can't cute so when green flag collected forever if body is not near equals zero then the set goes back to 50. so because when when the body is near so i didn't make bodies yeah now the button will light up because you can report it so if there is no body in here i'm going to set the ghost effect to 50 so like kind of blending with the background so it's not this doesn't seem to forever if body is not near equals one that means there's a body knee and a second suspect to zero so become the regular brightness because yeah because you can report then when grief is gonna collect forever wait pick one to thirty seconds so pick random one to thirty seconds so body is not near to one that means there's body in here but you can't see a the bodies because they i didn't make them then wait five seconds and the set body is not near to zero so by doing this variable there will be you can do these two code to make the report button available so now maybe you'll miss your truth reporting it yeah so now test out the report button there's one imposter among us so you're you'll always be cooling right now okay so the report button this ghost effect is 50 right now okay because it starts out as zero as a variable okay we're now gonna explore paulus while we wait for the import button to light up task task i see a task no they're not actually that's how now it goes back to ghost effect because but yeah the picture oh that was fast yeah so picked a random one to thirty seconds so sometimes you have to wait very long but sometimes let's go like very short yeah laboratory yeah i am going to so i i still didn't make the recording yet but yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye
