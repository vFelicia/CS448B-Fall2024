welcome to creating with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about lambda functions so lambda function is a small annoyance function so a lambda function can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression so why use a lambda function instead of a usual function well you can get the the power out of lambda functions when you put it inside a regular function so first we're going to do a usual function so when this is how to write uh lambda functions so first you have the name equals lambda the word lambda then the parameters and then the expression so this is the regular function so we're going to do def which is to find hello then there's a parameter x then return hello plus x i want to run that function print hello then world so the x is the world then it will return hello plus x and x is world so print hello world so i'm going to save it to the hello world going to do it in the lambda way so we're going to do hello one equals lambda x so is the parameter then hello plus x so that's the expression so we're going to print hello one then world as x so let's see if it also prints hello world so they both did hello world next i'm going to also do a function just like this one but i can it will be like the lambda function because it will be one line so we're gonna do def hello to x return hello plus x and all we're also going to do print hello to world so i'm going to save all three of them do hello so now there's free hello world so right now we have three ways to use functions to print hello world yeah so i'm gonna do greeting so i'm gonna do the lambda function equals lambda great name so now there's two arguments i mean two yeah two parameters and green plus then space plus name so we're gonna do print grading and the great will be how are you doing and the name will be andrew so greet then space andrew so to do how are you doing space andrew um right say that how are you doing then there's space andrews that worked i'm going to do define multiply and this is the original function i'm going to return lambda a and a times n so now we are gonna we are placing a lambda function inside a regular function so now there are two parameters one for the regular function one for the length so how do we fill both of them out at the same time so we need to fill out the parameters in different times i'm going to do double which is a variable equals then we'll do the function multiply two so we're filling up n as two then we're going to do triple equals multiply three then we're gonna do 11. so now it's gonna supposed to be print 22 and 33. so did 22 and 33 so this worked and this draws out the power of the lavender function well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
