welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in scratch and we're going to show you how we made a game called hang then it's just a classic hangman but there's only one word so if you don't know what hangman is it's where you have to guess a word and guess one letter at a time if you get a letter wrong then the hangman on the hanging pole so you need to try to save the man and guess the word before because his whole body should So like um if you guess one letter wrong you'll get the head and then continue continue if you keep on getting it wrong so with a happy face it has eyes yeah the eyes are one and in the mouth that's a lot of chances there's eight chances there's eight chances yeah eight chances yeah so you get eight chances to guess this one two seven letter word okay so in our hang band so this guy here the one who is about to get hanged so when it's green flag click it will switch to costume one which is like no head anything yet so just like a hanging hanger a hanging pole the set hanging which is a variable to one so it's like Euro to zero sorry so it's like um if you get one letter wrong it'll just go to another like add one to the hangman Theory then forever if penguin equals eight so that's how many chances you have then broadcast two and wait so it's like end game someone will receive what message One Forever create hanging by one next cause and weight 1.5 seconds then stop the script so it's like when I read when I received the message one it will like get another like a body on so like the next one off so head body hands on well arms and then um for word one well letter one it will switch costume to a costume one so like First costume is just like a letter yeah whatever if answer equals s so this um this word letter one is just this one and then wait one second and then switch costume hosting two which is the letter then process done change answer by one so it's like counting how many letters you have correct and stop the scripts yeah so like onward tube one for you were four were five we're six and that were seven is the same yeah they're all letters so it's the same as this code except just different answer like answer equals um it's not this but Z then it's like gonna run this script so then this this the person it'll just add it's a instruction The Hanger yeah it's so mean so he's got the hanger why would he give you a chance to guess a word and save the man from being hanged because it's just a game just a game so he'll ask you like what letter you want and if it it keeps on just when I receive these just keep on asking the questions so these are the um letters that are not in the words so like Z that's the answer so Z so is well green fact clicked High because you didn't guess anything yet if answer equals z then it will show and wait one second switch costume costume one so the area and the blue which is like a sky where there are all the letters yeah so there's all the wrong letters yeah then you see the costume one is like X out because it's not here so you have to remember which letter you did so here's my comment I don't think you should do an X because you kind of will you can still see so like it exit out and then for this one is like it's custom one so it's U1 that means it gets guess the word and then custom two you lost try again and this guy just disappears byebye like that so it's like if green fat clicked hi go to front layer so it's here then if answer equals seven then show which cartoon to costume one so if you get this word correct then it's going to do you wet and then when I receive two which is when you lost you switch your costume too you lost try again so we need to go to front layer because you don't want it to be hiding or getting uh some parts of it getting covered by other Sprites yeah so these are just the backdrops so like when you win you get this backdrop and when you lose you get this backdrop it's red the sky turned red so it's like when greenpark like switched backdrop to backdrop one which is like this just this usable Blue Sky just a usable day forever if answer equals seven so if you get the word correct switch back to backdrop free which is this you win background which is the green background and then when I receive two switch background to backdrop two the blood stop and then stop off yeah okay okay what letter do you guess I'm gonna guess I'm gonna go okay because I write another word okay sorry yes okay so I saw it as I'm also gonna do this yes how about uh e no good so his head appeared okay and I'm just giving you the wrong letters so now his body up here he's so skinny because it's a Stickman right next to each other tea no no not t there's a t why of course not a y the um oh his arms up here we have one two three we use four okay let's do d no no D either his leg up here we have three more chances G oh no we listen to only have two more chances I and his mouth wait you need to go back here let's do see there's a spot okay we have one more do I I I I I no I uh you lost try again let's do it again okay there is a s there's C there's a is a t what is this J J this is not day let's do h a yes scratch yes that's scratch that's the platform we're using yeah so you can like make your own words by just switching the letters so um just do this code but add all the alphabet letters over here I don't have like you know I don't have a because there's a a here but if you want to make a different word you can add like switch these letters and add all the other letters that aren't in this alphabet to make your own word so that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash it like button and subscribe bye bye
