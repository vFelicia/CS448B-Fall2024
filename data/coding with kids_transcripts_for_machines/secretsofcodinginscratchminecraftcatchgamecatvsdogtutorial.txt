welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch in my account kidnap code one two three and this project i improved called minecraft catch game cat fierce dog so it was originally only a cat so let's see so i'm the cat and andrew is the dog so there's a creeper a bone um cooked salmon and a raw salmon they're all minecraft so the cat needs to get the cooked salmon and stay away from the regular salmon and the wolf needs to get the bone and avoid the creeper okay okay so in the cat in the original project i didn't have the switch costume so when you press the right arrow it will the cat will face right if you press the left arrow the cat will face left in the original project it only faced like one way which is like moving backwards and forwards and the wolf is the same code as the cat except um it's d and a so you need to press d and a to control the both um the grilled salmon and the raw salmon is the same the bone is just like the gross amount except it has a new variable which is square slash bone wolf chewed because both two bone don't eat them and it will if touching the wolf not the cat because you see the bone doesn't matter to the cat the creeper since it it's here because the wolf hates creeper so poor wolf scared of creeper so it's like um the wolf is you need to get the raw you don't want to get the raw salmon which is a creeper and once you get the grilled salmon which is the bone but it doesn't matter if you touch the um the fish if you're a new wolf and doesn't matter matter if you touch the creeper or bone if you're the cat so in this bright one which is like the wind and blue screen so costume one is both one then costume two is cat one and costume free sadly redly nobody wants sad face so when green frog clicked if the timer is zero and like the variables the two scores um so if the wolf or captain um get enough fish and bone it will switch to costume free the sad one nobody wants withdrawal yeah then go to front lane show and when green falls clicks to a high because you don't want to see like nobody want or cat one or whatever yeah that can't see anything yeah then if green fox clicked and the bone both two equals 15 so if the dog chewed on 15 bones it was which cost him to costume one which is wolf one so it's the points then it will show stop all um the cat one is just like the wolf wand but it's just the different variable so let's play i'm the cat and andrew is the dog okay first to 15. i don't really care if i touch the creeper sometimes sometimes you get distracted by touching the creeper yeah most of the time for the salomon they're like stuck together yeah which is bad so the dog has a sound yeah okay it's pretty close it's 15 to 10. one more time okay if um when the um like the raw salmon touches the red line or the creeper touches the red line nothing happens but if the cooked salmon or the bone touches the red line then um the score of the the player that um we needed to get it um well minus okay because i always get distracted by the creeper i'm like i need to get the creepy oh i need to get the um fish instead oh so you're like distracted yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
