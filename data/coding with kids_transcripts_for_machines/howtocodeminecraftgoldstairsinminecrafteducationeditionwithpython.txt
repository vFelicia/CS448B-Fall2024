welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're going to do one of those tutorials so we're going to do gold stairs it looks cool yeah climb higher and go for you will build some stairs out of gold blocks in this tutorial the builder tool will do the work by placing gold blocks where you tell it to you will build a golden stair to the sky just like an infinite stick yeah put in and for me like changing it into a game it won't be cold there will be water the stairs so insert a builder teleport too into the chat command to teleport the player to your position the builder is similar to the agent button visible so that's basically an invisible version of the agent yeah builder teleport to zero zero which will be our exact spot put two builder moves below builder teleport to to move forward enough to build a single stair we tell the builder to move forward then up then forward and up so it keeps getting forward yeah so builder move forward by one so we first move the builder will move forward and then move forward i mean move up so the builder will be moving up on this add a builder choice to tell the builder to fill the path with gold blocks so we're going to do it with water first let's try gold gold okay go to minecraft type t to open the chat and enter gold stairs you should see three new gold blocks he is now get a repeat loop move 25 times and put around all the builder move to build 25 stairs so now we're using a repeat loop to build more stairs uh how many times should we actually do just let's do it yes maybe it's gonna take too long go to minecraft enter go stairs and check you should see how long a long gold block staircase gets get created at in the teleport position but we don't need to because it's only a one player game over here and we're already in player so let's see in python first okay so there's def on a chat so it's a function builder dot teleport to position zero zero zero that's a function and for indexing range 25 so we'll repeat 25 times better that move forward once you'll go forward up then it'll do the trace path golden block then you'll declare the unchecked when you type gold chatter from the function oh we're inside the slime oh well the invisible builder is building sorry but you're taking so long let's walk let's walk up the stairs five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22. it's like it's just 27 24 there's no one it's actually pretty oh okay i think we shouldn't change it into water andrew just gave me an idea so we're just gonna do this and we're gonna give give nearest player or self on water bucket oh yeah i need to do an item i water survival okay let's hope the slime will not attack us i really hope not let's now type gold hi shooty okay okay now we have one i'm just going to wait for the builder to finish the new one so first i'm going to go over the old one okay let's see if anger's a seat if we fall then right here okay so we gold okay now we need to wait wait where is it it's right here maybe the builder was still doing that staircase oh yeah i wanted to go here so it still had the trace thing and then i had to go to that's super weird yes now it has a path to the other staircase which is awesome yes okay back to water go to the middle we always have those items you'll have two chances okay okay i'm gonna move okay where is the water there is no water that's a glitch there's no water a glitch okay don't fall off the staircase only one block oh okay do you want dude dude no let's swim up because we can swim sink there the water okay my turn the last one okay last one why is the water still there i thought i got the water still the other one oh you're gonna do it run oh there was still the water sound though because we placed it but i don't know maybe you placed it too late but it just didn't okay all right now it looks like a like a water stairs they change into a gold stairs okay okay plant but we don't have any oh yeah it's right next to your swim actually okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
