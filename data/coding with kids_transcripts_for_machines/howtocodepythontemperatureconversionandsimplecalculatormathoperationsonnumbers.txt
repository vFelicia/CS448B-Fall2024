welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew and today we're going to learn about python so we're going to learn about user input and performing mathematical operations so i have my file temp dot py and we're going to make a machine that turns fanta height to celsius so unless your fair height equals what so right now is the checking if the answer the user typed in to the question what is the temperature and fan height is the number if it's false so let's do two equals default so if it's false a question what is the temperature and fan right you can take the answer and then it will check if your answer is a number if it's not a number and it will print input is not a number and then exit so stop the code and you're going to run the code again next let's do the parent height is minus 32 okay so 5 9 is a fraction and this is the formula for turning fahrenheit into celsius then let's do so we turn it into a string so we can print it and this print will print what your your temperature is in celsius so let's save it with control s and go to terminal and type pink y then press enter and what is the temperature outside 50 okay then temperature in celsius is 10 okay you can use the arrow to temperature in celsius is 148 okay last try let's run it again temperature and celsius is free okay now i have my second folder out simplecall.piva and i already have some code and now i'm going to build a simple calculator and we can use different operations okay so i already have some code as well right now the code will check the operation and it will give you the answer okay let's do print simple calculator so this is like the intro okay then first first number equals input so the user can type by answer okay then first number okay first number so it'll ask you for the first number you want to like perform a mathematical operation with then you can answer in an if first number function will check your if your first number is a number so equals false so if your answer is not a number then please input a number then so if your answer is not a number it will print please input a number and then exit we will stop all the code and you need one again next we're gonna do operations [Laughter] equals and then second number dot is then print import it is not um okay so the result is blank so we're calculating is operation equals plus so if you enter the plus at the when it asks for the operation it'll do it'll do this if operation equals plus result equals first number plus second number so it's calculating the result and then label equals sum and then l of operation equals minus then result equals first number minus second number just calculate again then if l of lf operation equals star that means multiplication result equals first number star so we're multiplying second number okay then label product so the label is the and the name of the answer in that operation then lf operation equals division that means forward slash then result equals first number four slash second number so we're dividing and then label equals quotient then upper if opera l of operation equals star star that means exponent so five so there's the power so two to the power of three that means you need to do two times two times two okay so that will be that will be eight okay let's do a result equals first number star star second number then lf operation equals percentage which is modulus the five model is four will be the leftover which is one because 4 can't add up to 5 or multiply up to 5 because it just can't then result equals first number percentage second number then else print operation not recognized because you did none of these symbols then it will print operation not recognized except then we're going to do print play label plus then of spaces oops plus string first number so we can print it so that's why we're turning it first number into string then plus and empty so there's space between the words and numbers operation love empty space plus string second number space equals or space on both sides and then these three result so the last effect so print label of string first number so this print is printing the answer let's save it and try let's do py simple call that py and press enter simple calculator first number five operation let's do star so we're multiplying then second number 3 then product of 5 star 3 that means multiply equals 15 that's right let's type bomb now okay then first number three operation bulb then second number two then operation not recognized because after you type the second number and all your numbers and your second number is a number then it will just keep going on and it'll check your operation i type bob for the operation that's no the operations so it'll print operation not recognized let's do another one first number six operation let's do percentage so that is modulus then second number one then models of six percentage one that means models equals zero okay one more time first number let's do 30 operation let's do plus second number 20 sum of 30 plus 20 equals 50 and that's right thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
