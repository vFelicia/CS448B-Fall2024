see the first video where i basically did everything so today i added here the bathtub so there's a water bottle and yeah there's water ball basketball and a fish which is eating okay first we need to drink some water dirty we're getting dirty very dirty oh dude hunger then we're gonna get some fun let's do first and then here okay so then when you press this button there are the instructions okay so today so first i added the bathtub so you can see this bathtub image so that's where the first variable is so the first variable so the bathtubs code is simply when the sprite is clicked so when you press the bathtub so the octopus can wash itself a board cast a message called wash so then in the octopus uh there is when i receive the wash message from the bathtub well glide one seconds to back slide one second to bathtub so the octopus will go to the bathtub then it'll start sat ocean waste that's the closest sound i could get to like washing in the path then i change dirty by minus two so you don't want to get ten early yeah basically you get too much of the variables you'll get you'll lose okay so we're gonna change 30 by minus two because dirty goes up more fast than the other one so i just minus two because you get 30 yeah and then glide one second to the regular position here okay and then in the fish originally i think it was this yeah so it was an evil instead of dory so i changed the dory and the water bottle it was like a plastic one that's i changed to a more it's more ecofriendly yeah you know so i changed it into a glass one but it's not full this one's an awful and the soccer ball is the it's called soccer ball so it was originally soccer ball but i just changed it into basketball i don't want to like change all this stuff so it's still called soccer ball so button i don't want to make it blue no because it's you know maybe a little bit too blunt into the background because you know the octopus is in the ocean so you wouldn't really want to be blue yeah so now the octopus has more new toys to go okay so i'll play first your goal is to get 10 fun to win okay let's go i'm hungry how are you going to keep pressing fun but okay now when you press the octopus by itself it can do break uh and then it'll change costume then it can also do drums it's just for like decoration it doesn't really do anything okay let's see everything's two and get fun dirty to make a zero we need first now hunger first if you if you get anything that's 10 and it's fun okay soccer ball i don't know how the octopus can play basketball maybe put with this is one that's technical it has so many tentacles like a lot of basketball maybe then outside like that yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
