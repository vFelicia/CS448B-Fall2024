welcome to greeting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so we're going to learn about the python standard library so my first question is what is the python standard library the python standard library is a lot of functions that help you code the library is split in up into modules what is a module a module is a code file for a specific thing what can you do with the python student library modules inside the python standard library can be used for lots of things like date time and math inside the python standard library then which one is better built in function or importing modules builtin functions are more commonly used so it's built into python some other features and functions are useful but they're not commonly used to use these features and functions you will need to do import third party packages which is a public library by other platform programmers you first need to download the module and then use the import command to use the functions and the pip command to download it now we're going to use a module from the python standard library use the import to tell python you're going to use a module so let's do let's do import random as dice so random is a module that is in play font so you don't need to use pip to download so you're all there's also a random command to like get random stuff so we're going to name random as dice so then we're going to do roll dice.rand 110 so randit is a function that is in the module random so return a random integer in 1 or 10. like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10. yeah so it's stored in the variable called rule so we're going to do print s string so we can put role in it which will print the number rand it chose you rolled then the number then rand it chose so let's save it with ctrl s and then write p y ran dot p y so now you roll six now let's try again yeah okay so you can up use up arrow to copy what you last typed so it says you rolled one so it worked because first we wrote a sixth and a one yeah so randa chose a random number for between one and ten let's try one last time it says you rolled a four six one four there's no pattern oh there is a pattern it's even odd even okay now we're at pipi.org here at this website you can find all the modules in the third in in this huge library made by python programmers so yeah so now i'm going to search camel case which is the module we're going to be re trying out a lot of people have made camel cases yeah so we're going to go to camera case here this one so what camel case does is that well the function camel case inside the module camera case will capitalize each starting letter of each word so let's go to python again and then do go here to terminal and pip install chairs so now it's downloading it and now we have downloaded it so now we're going to import camelcase because we already downloaded it so we can use it now so import will tell python we're using camo case okay then c equals camelcase camel case so this camera case is the function while this one is the module name so let's do txt use hello world txt that means text yeah and then print c hump hump is another function text so now let's save it and run it let's do p y camo dot p cd dot py so now it says hello world so it was different from the text one because in the text variable the hello world did not have any capital letters but when we run it it also printed it so there the capital the first letter of each word became capitalized okay so let's change the hello world into la la la so there's no capital and let's see if it will print capital okay let's run it this is hollywood because if i can just save it and then run it because there's a live lib and now save it so this is i love hamburgers so they're all capitalized again okay it worked okay let's finally do pip list so pip list will list all the modules you have on your python now i list a bunch of them okay let's go to c and then there's camel case and then it also says is version came okay okay let's go back and pip install camera vip uninstall and then install camera okay so now we're uninstalling it hit enter then you can y to yes now it's successfully uninstalled okay let's do pip list again so let's see if camelcase is not in this list i think you see nope so this is a start and camera case is supposed to be here but it's not there so because we installed it yeah uninstalled so we successfully uninstalled and thanks for watching that's it for today remember to smash and subscribe bye
