welcome to cocooning with kids my name is clea and my name is andrew today we're a minecraft education edition and we're going to do the make a job so we're going to go to code and it's one of the tutorials in microsoft make code and this is the mega jump we're gonna start the block tutorial just the agent moving with a chest oh look you can jump so high more than usual so it says put in and on chat command and rename it to duck so if when we type jump in the chat we're gonna mega jump yeah place the teleport inside on check command to teleport deploy 100 blocks or higher so we need a teleport to zero zero zero so the zero zero zero is the position of where we jump jump we stayed at the same place because it's zero zero zero which is exactly where the player is yeah so we need a code more next add a number parameter called num1 which is number one to uncheck command in blocks click on the plus sign so i need so you can like type type how many blocks you want to jump after you type jump is the variable num1 then it says use num1 variable instead of 100 in the code so that you will jump by the map entered by the player so you will put the num one in into the middle so now we're gonna go into the chat and then type let's test it out by jumping 50 blocks you jump 50 ah oh man you need to go into water before you do the convenience so now we're gonna do we're gonna try a hundred we're gonna try greater numbers wait wait we're not close oh we're jumping into the water we survived that was so hot yeah let's see if it has any more for us to do so that is it yeah i'm going to try a thousand sure okay then but if you don't want if you don't see any water source you should get a water pumpkin yeah so you do jump jump and i know the code to do to the agent to give you you know water buckets we are like so high yeah if we don't splash into water where are we oh we're going to the clouds oh oh we were late i did not realize that we were like we were like falling so bad i'm gonna do the code where you can like the agent gives you some water buckets water in the chakra and you take water it will do blocks go to blocks and it will you need to let you know um give you type given the search give nearest player yourself yourself a blocker item and we need to change that into item so we're going to change it into a water bucket we need to go to the item we need to get a new one which is the items and because it's an item not a block so then we search water and there is a water bucket and you can do however mountain ones so if we type water into the chat you'll get one water bucket so now we have a water bucket so now we're gonna jump how about a hundred jump a hundred let's see if we late i'm going oh try again water okay now i'm going to jump a hundred oh nice get the water buckets because we didn't use it it's down one more time jump how about 150 to give me more time okay i'm gonna do it now oh shoot oh and so this is the pie finality code so def on on chat num1 so when you type the jump you'll do player dot teleport position then num1 zero num100 so it'll teleport you and then player.on chat jump on on chat so there's death on on chat too because it's number two yeah because it'll run both things when you type something in the chat so do mobs documents so the mob is the agent target dot target local player which is uh water bucket one so it give us one water if we change the one into about ten okay 10 so now it'll give us 10 and then let's see did the code change here yes yes so now we're going to try it if it gives us 10 water buckets water we have 10 water buckets okay let's go into the water oh yeah make more like water streams so now we're going to do this in case if we're weird yes we survived the mega jump okay one more time we're going to do 500 okay oh yeah 500 is just going to be very 500. we're in the sky when did we see the clouds oh cloudy oh no there's a bunch of water yeah they're sticking together yay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
