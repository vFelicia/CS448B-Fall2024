welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn a string helper function the format helper function so first i'm going to create a new file i'm going to name it format dot py okay then i'm going to do train equals milk and cups equal five then duration equals 4.5 so the first the drink the milk is a string and then the five is an integer and the 4.5 is a string i mean a float that construction means curly brackets cups every curly brackets hours okay then dot format drink cups so here we have a list and the first is drink so there are also three curly fat targets so the first is drink so the drink will go to the first pair the second is cup so the cups will go to the second pair and the third it will go to the third okay so let's print instructions okay let's save it with um control s and then go to the terminal and type p y format dot p one it says milk take five cups every four 4.5 hours that worked let's delete the instructions and print then we'll do instructions equals curly brackets and the two inside okay take curly brackets without one cups every curly bracket flip for zero hours then format format drink cup and then duration so again we have a list here and in the curly brackets we have numbers so um the zero the numbers represent the position the variables are in the list so first the string so the first first thing of the list is in position zero then the second is what so drink goes to the zero and then cups go to the one and then the duration goes to the two then let's do print instructions instructions and let's save it and you can use your up arrow to copy what you last typed in the term okay so 4.5 take five cups every milk hours okay let's delete this and do instructions vehicles curly brackets with drink in it take dash take curly rockets cups i mean like cups every no there's a cups in in front of every there's a a cups no okay cups every hour i mean curly brackets then duration then hour outwards dot format so drink equals water comma then cups equals 10 10 and duration duration equals six equals six i think yeah okay okay then let's do enter and print instruction so here we now in the curly brackets we now have the variables names so because we changed it yeah so the milk will be water then cups will be 10 and duration will be six yeah so we changed what's inside the variables and we put the variable names in the curly brackets let's save it and run it let's say water 10 cups every 6 hours i won't like okay next we're going to do all of it and do name equals world then message equal f so here we're going to do before the so we're going to do f so the f is a f string and it's just a shorter version of the f of the format function and so this you can do the use the format function without that much typing so we're going to do curly brackets with name inside so the name is equals to whales so when we print it it will say hello world yeah so then we're gonna do print message message okay so we're going to save it and what hello world yeah so the name is a world and there's already a hello so it's going to be hello world yeah so let's delete this then count equals 10 equals value equals three point three point fourteen and message equal f the f string count two two curly bracket count then period okay then multiply by multiply by curly bracket value value okay so again we have the f and the count in here and the value in here okay let's save it no we forgot to print the message oh so i don't have to save it in the search and save it and run it so it says count to 10 multiplied by 3.14 so the count became a 10 and the value became a 3.14 then we're gonna do with equal five then height equals ten and print the f string um the parameter two stars so the star is multiplication in python so here we're multiplying two two times width so multiply inside a print function is not actually recommended okay then plus no the plus is supposed to be inside that plus two brackets okay height so here we're adding two times width and two times height together okay then a curly bracket then and the area area is curly bracket with do we need brackets yes i mean no star height height okay so here or now we're multiplying width and height okay yeah okay let's save it and and run py format.py says the parameter is 30 and the area is 50. okay so let's delete this and next we're going to do value equals height then print a string then dot dot then curly brackets and value colon less than 25 then another dot here so we have a less than 25 and so this is gonna add spaces on the on the right right yeah so the high also counts as 2 so it's basically going to add 23 and then there are also going to be periods on the left and right okay let's save it and run it so it has a dot and then high and then spaces and then another dot okay let's do print value you forget the s thing okay so then dot then curly brackets the value big garden out because oh yeah colon bigger than 25 and then i'm done so now we have a bigger than psi so it's going to make the spaces to the left so again we only add 20 free spaces and then there are done okay let's save it and run so now there's a period and then there are spaces and then high and then another dot okay so then we're going to do print then f string then dot then curly brackets and value going to do a carrot oh yeah then carrot and then 25. so now we got yeah okay so now we have a carrot and so it's facing up so and like if you minus two from 25 is going to be 23 and the carrot is gonna split the spaces so the high is in the middle but 23 is not equal so the on the left there will be um 11 spaces and on the right there will be 12 spaces okay so let's save it and run okay so now there's a dot spaces high then another spaces and done so these are also used for padding and alignment okay let's then do print a string then dot curly brackets value colon then we do a dash and then a carrot and then 25 then another done okay so now we have a dash here so it's gonna replace the this empty spaces with dashes so there will be 11 dashes on the yeah and 12 stashes on the right let's save it and run it so now there's a dot and there are 11 dashes then hi then uh 12 dashes over here okay it worked and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash it up and subscribe bye bye
