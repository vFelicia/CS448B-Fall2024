welcome to quitting with kids my name is andrew today we're on scratching in my account kate that coke one two three and this project i mixed called evolution slash so it's supposed to be theme yeah so let's see play yeah connect the evolutions there's also a timer i see a timer ah a timer i hate diamonds that was so bad okay now let's see like a connector yeah so in the tiles it was supposed to be gems in the usable project now i changed them yeah now i changed them into evolution they're pixel eevee and e evolutions which is leafeon umbreon glacion and espion and evie i'll of course choose evie because you know it is the main thing pokemon pokemon of the evolutions in the background i didn't add any background but i added when green frog takes forever it was zip rack dial which is a variable to pick random one two six so four so when you click switch back yeah so see it always is a different background so if background equals one or um two five for six it will switch out the background and then we'll stop the scribble it'll always keep changing yeah and then in the title it's supposed to be gem you see i exit oops i accident and then change into evolution and then and spread four which is you know the cover from there yeah uh my best my favorite background is this one so the graph and then i choose for the evolutions sorry you're not here but for them and then i put the title because it was supposed to be just for the color gems and then like this gem slash so that's and the background was supposed to be black and the usual project um it was only this background background six but i didn't know why um he had these background the five other background heroes i know but let's play okay i'll go fast first uh yeah yeah at least get two the like bigger connection is then the more points you get so you try to get as much as most points you can get in the minute yeah when it's 30 seconds i'm gonna give it to andrew okay ah three umbreons yeah uh yeah three is i mean two is the most common but the most not point three sometimes you can't actually do four like this three you can only do straight lines yeah or what i guess let's just give you the same point if you do this because okay six more seconds straight down is more faster so you can get more points okay so we have over a hundred points okay it's dangerous because it's 30 seconds so it's half oh i'm just gonna put i'm like getting getting freeze he's only getting two sometimes i get lucky and then like there were there is a bunch of some of those evolutions and then like i connect them and give me a lot of points but they waste a lot of times while you're trying to color connect them yeah oh there's a lot of tools i can see and a lot of babies oh i see that one right here it's a big line that's so big that's so lucky and you can see the leaderboards but it's about it's the usual game this how can people even get 100 500. they do it or they train like every day and then they were very good well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
