welcome to curtin with kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch and we're gonna show you andrew's super minecraft bro so super minecraft bros is just like super mario but it's a minecraft version yeah do you see the big x it's actually crossing the mario and there's already one over there let's show you let's play level one let's you can go down pipes by the down arrow yeah on your keyboard you can zombies are actually the mushrooms in the super so mario is now steve and the mushrooms or the goombas are now zombies yeah just keep going in the background it's minecraft yeah so you can if you go down hills you can slide you can squish the zombies automatically oops uh and that's how he dies okay so let's see we're gonna we're gonna show you how to um remix a project so i'm just going to go to one of my projects go to minecraft minecraft dungeons because one of our videos are ready to show minecraft dungeons okay oopsies you can't go into this and you go to another one i'm just going to go to learn your other accounts a lot of accounts hammerhead sharks this one this one really no problem okay so here's the remix button and after the project loads you can press the remix button and then it will start remixing you know wait a few seconds and then it'll say project save doesn't remix so our mix is basically a copy of another person's game but you need to change it a little yeah andrew this is a remix of of another project yeah so now you can change things and you can share your project after you've changed some things yeah and this remix is made by cool stuff kid which is andrew's other account let's go through super minecraft pros now let's show you how andrew made it so i mixed a super mario bros project yeah and i changed it so first the player the original player was mario there's still some real costumes but yeah but he just yeah so it's just he's just using the minecraft yeah so i got a bunch of steve costumes and i uploaded them from um google so you can search it up and then go to images and upload them and put them here by going to upload costume and then you can pick your costume and upload here you also need to like do the same name so it was a bit hard okay next the coins so this is what like the when you collect the coins it'll pop up diamonds yeah i changed the coins to diamonds and again i uploaded the costumes you call this costume gif it's moving so when you upload this costume it will automatically do all the costing the gis yeah it will change into a lot of costumes yeah to make the gis move here here you don't need to change the diamonds names it's all okay okay then you need to upload the same the same costumes the diamonds for here the same costumes into another coin sprite but this is when they're not collected yet so you know upload the same images or like gif yeah okay then which are zombies yeah so last one is squished so this is the regular costume and there's the zombie i upload it and sometimes maybe your uploaded images are too big so you can change its size yeah size two yeah blah blah blah percent i so i changed the background into minecraft yeah if you go down a pipe you will go underground so i got this background from minecraft it's like a mine yeah it's like a minor color it's a mine then if you're in the regular world and up world this is the background so there's a bunch of flowers that looks cool to rest in okay i want to live in minecraft let's go balloon down to another one so from there i changed it that's how i x the mario and then added the minecraft some people will know it's actually super minecraft world yeah and the flomps the stones that go down on you yeah i changed them into endermen hello endermans so and you can resize the image and then that is all i changed okay now let's play let's see i'm gonna go back first go go go let's see the background has changed and i am steve and the zombie is this supposed to be a goomba but yeah you go down go down no you go down okay so the oh also the mushroom is a golden and got now yeah it will also give you an extra life just like in the original one yep and when you go down a hill you can squish the zombies yeah okay your turn go down the pipe i will go down go down yeah see the background change and the music change too because it's more creepier yeah oh oh let's try that again i can show them how it's cool in the pike down the pipe i recommend you go to the upper world because the the underground world is pretty hard one last turn okay next time i'm gonna try again are you sure yep you see sometimes i'm not good at it like when i'm very nervous one more turn okay for me you go one more time so mario also turns big or like steve turns big so i just like maybe you can use the same costumes even though it still gives you the second life you passed it there's always a pipe to get back up yes i passed see go back go in the pipe yeah you're up here it's gonna be hard i jump here i literally just keep jumping and those are platforms it's creepy it's easy you only have one life oh you got off the platform too okay you sure this is hard to go to the level too so the background you also need to change it in the backdrop it's not also a sprite but it's also a backdrop because it is the background yeah so he changed into minecraft yeah it's so relaxing but if in the mind costume where when you go down a pipe i would like that without the lava and a lot of orange in minecraft and i can just mind it i think i can craft and thanks for watching remember to smash the like and subscribe bye
