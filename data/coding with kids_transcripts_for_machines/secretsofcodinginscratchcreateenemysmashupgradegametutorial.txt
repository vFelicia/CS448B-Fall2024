hey okay since the player there was supposed to be three balls and added the fourth ball which is a minecraft weapon which is an enchanted dinosaur which i really like and same over here in the menu i changed the all four and then in the thumbnail it was supposed to be a nail but i got the dinosaur more so i changed it into a dinosaur in the backdrop i added this minecraft background and i added some color or else it will be just plain white which i don't really like and i added i see a dreamer a song i really liked and in the code it says when clickfunnel clicks forever please don't i see a dreamer so if i ever play the song i see a dreamer so that's all i changed so now let's play i like the sword i don't like green purse ah i don't really like these kind of levels i want the creeper to go well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye
