welcome to coding with kids my name is and my name is andrew today we're in code.org and we're score c lesson 12 build a flappy king so we're on number 10. so so we have the thing called when hit an obstacle and then you can put code below when hit an obstacle to program what what will happen when flappy bird hits an obstacle like a pipe so right now the instructions are want us to set the score to zero and hit an obstacle not end the game we're gonna play yes i am let's choose crash crash crashes craig so when we hit an obstacle um it will play a crash sound and then it'll settle you hit the ground so you game over okay my turn let's make a big o that's the maximum let's see if i can get one point oh no one let's get a i got zero points now because when you touch a pipe which is the obstacle your score becomes zero and it'll play a sound so even if you got one point your minus at whatever amount of points you got 100 yeah okay let's go to puzzle 10 now press continue oh yeah puzzle 11. now the instruction says create your own flappy game you can change the visuals and remove even the gravity when you're done click finish to share with friends on their phones so i'm gonna make a opposite flappy game so i'm just the jack very large and then one past obstacle you need an end game because it's the opposite then that's really easy because the pipes are always bigger but they're still the pipes are always bigger than the gaps we play smash that sounds like um oh that would be cool and then you can just keep going to the top forever and out of the screen and then you always yeah well the ground is mars now we're in a dark hallway now we're back on mars warning somewhere now some normal ground okay one more time your turn yeah i'm superman i'm mars there's also batman drawing mars again that meant this that was margaret we're on the roost of christmas oh lava lava nine points it's more easy this is point so we can see what happened it played the sound laser and then it ended the game so when it hit the ground you also and hit the ground you end the game so when when you set all those things normal and very large yeah and thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
