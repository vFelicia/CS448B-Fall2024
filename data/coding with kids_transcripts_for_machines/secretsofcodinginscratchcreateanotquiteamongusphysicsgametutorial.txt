welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch and minecraft kingdom code one two three and in this project i remixed called not quite among us physics remix so originally it was balls yeah now i changed it into a marvelous version there's mr cheese as the background and he is the imposter in the game it's the cheese he's yellow so the levels i changed the color first it was supposed to be brownish but my background is kind of black so you can't really see the levels i made it like a bright line all of them are changing to the same color and these were usually the same font and the same color i didn't change and there's the guy the guy is still pixely i got him from andrews among us fly so there's it was a ball yeah there's a guy guy blank guy two guy 3 guy 4 guys scrunch cyan it's the usual one all of these are the same so for the whole game it will just stay the same costume well there is first at the ball over here in the usable project it won't blink but in the longest people don't blank so i don't need that blank and there's the button first there was just a usual button i changed it into a mangas emergency button emergency there is a button too it's supposed to be like the buttons pressed but it's the same sprite well costume as this one the button one and there's the white out first it's in the user project it is white and then it will change into the background same as the background image of andrew's account called cool stuff animation and this is mr cheese as imposter and the background is black i added these kind of cyan color backgrounds to it or else it will like be white and there's a backdrop just same as the white act and there's the collectibles i really think of like something to collect which is among us the task the asteroid task so i just added an asteroid that's like the task the astro task now let's do it i'm gonna go first yay you need to collect all the asteroids before you can go through the exit or else the exit won't work you need to collect every asteroid when i first played the usual game i thought i didn't collect the asteroids and i was like why can't i go with the extent then i figured out i actually needed to collect every collectibles okay quite the wiggle there yes level uh 23 levels in all but the last level is actually just say more levels to come so just tell you the usual project there are going to be more levels and i might add more bubbles with this one this is a little okay up like this there and then swing here get more energy go here no go there swing up there next one is another level yeah there's tons of green levels here okay well there way like anthony just just low change you need to do it the other way if you keep falling ugh again three three please you need a crate how about my turn you need a great enough energy and you need to go here and swing yourself in there it might be tricky okay and then fall down i'll be weird you love the pools there's a lot of pools yeah you need to create more energy to go up when i first tried the usual game i this was one of the hardest levels i had after a few times i got it except the second one you need to create more energy and then but that's that way yeah oh dying oh this one is hard you need to be very slow at the other one okay let me just do it this is kind of hard when i first played it it needs a lot to try to do with the whole thing so hard this level if you don't want to like do this level like so hard if it takes you one hour just sips oh sticky face so this one helps this has a sticky face so you can stay up there but if you stay there too long without moving you will fall off the sticky face oh oh that's a good one come on sticky face you can stick me okay i can't sticky face this thick face well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
