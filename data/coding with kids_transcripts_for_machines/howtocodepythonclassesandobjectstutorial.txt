welcome to quitting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about classes so first we're going to do class car so class is a blueprint for objects which are things we build so first we have a class called a car then we're deaf which is defined in it so in it is a constructor which will help us construct the class call so then we have variables or attributes that describe the object so which are color here make and model for a cop i'm going to do self.co self.color equals color and the same for year make it mod and we're going to do def which is defined again show cars so so this is a function or we can call it a method so the method is called show call then when we run the method it will print color colon and self.color and the same for year make and model then we're going to do car 1 which is the variable equals then the class car gray 2005 honda and pi so we're doing the color year and making model then we're going to do a car 2 which is red 2010 jeep com pass these are two cops then we're going to make a list called cars with car 1 and car 2 and then we're going to print cars 1 dot color and cars 0. color so we're going to print the colors of car 1 and car 2 but why do we need the 1 and 0 it's because we need to specify which item you want to get the color out of in the list cars so lists are in x 0 so the first item has index of 0 and the second item has an index of 1 and so on so we're going to print the colors we're going to save it and so dead red and gray so that is correct because those are the colors of car 1 and car 2. they're going to do car 2 that show car so we're going to use the show car function another way to do it is to do the class car that showcase the function then specify which one cartoon now receive it and so it did see so i did color red year 2010 make cheap and model compass so repeats two times because we did it in two ways well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash your like like and subscribe bye bye
