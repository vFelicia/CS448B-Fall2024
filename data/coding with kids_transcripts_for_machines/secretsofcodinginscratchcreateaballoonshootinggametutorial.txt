welcome to clinton with kids my name is cleo my name is andrew today we're in scratch and in my cat kid gekko one two three so this is a project i remixed called getty balloons and balls yeah okay other question why do the balloons always go on the right wall though added ball and bought two a target i didn't change anything the robot and i added this robot i uploaded it was very hard to find one this one when it was in the usual one so the code from the robot is actually from i mean there's what's it called yeah robots this robot i got the code and like with this that's how you like do the same culture didn't another spirit but i changed the sound don't don't and this is so i changed the backdrop too dance fun this is i reverse it yeah nick you can't reverse the song this is how i supposed to be but i changed it like this like i wanna maybe just a little something okay this whole thing's softer yeah okay the code i over here added forever switch backdrop to next backdrop wait one second so switch back drop to nick's backdrop is much easier than like this switch back drop to w then wait one second and keep doing it until you do all the backdrops you can just switch it to the book you can use the block mix backdrop yeah i got these backdrop i uploaded it it's i choose scratch kind of backdrop look these are kind of like tutorials and these but it's not actually my games this is a old kind of version also 2.0 yeah and it's in a safari i can see and ball two is the same as ball one because they're both balls yeah and balloon i think so hmm yeah because like you both need to get the balloon on the ball yeah but don't forget so over here it's pick one to ten seconds to create clone of myself over here it's one two three so the robot can take longer to spawn yeah the uploaded robot yeah but this one from the usual thing will not because it's one two three while this is one to ten then pick random negative ten to negative 90. it's important yeah this one too maybe i want to change it yeah change it a negative 5 negative let's see what will happen the sound x position y not minus one let's see what will happen now maybe you will never up here i just saw it then one green flag click forever play sound damn funky five so the sound is i choose it from scratch i always do loops because it's kind of like i read a song but i need to do a loop so it can actually sound like a real song so the robot no the robot the oh i should minus it until 15 yeah 15 because it's a box because it is bigger and this robot minus 22 because this is a small little robot i should do it about minus nine eight five five yeah say it it will minus five so the bottom line is is is um this is going to be hard to read so the balls and the robots yeah your turn is because yeah i didn't notice that so i think it will be much better does it happen does it have it please uh when you click switch backdrop two next backdrop then wait one second how about two seconds is and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like and subscribe bye bye
