welcome to curtin with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in scratch and andrew's account star scratch cat so today i'm going to show you my project mario kart jumping game so it's a jumping game but more like different so first let's show you space space okay so now let's see the code so the obstacle and the mario sprites i uploaded and the mario spy is a gif which is a moving image and it's an image of mario running so i have a background and so this is a jumpy game so how do you jump so you jump by pressing the space key so when you press the space key or repeat 10 times change y by 20 so that will make it go up then it will repeat 10 times change y by negative 20 so it'll go down to where it started then it'll change score to one because you pass an obstacle yeah then when greenfield clicked it'll also reset the score and go to his original position also i'll go to nick's costume because it's gif so if you upload a gif in scratch it'll go into a bunch of different costumes so when you like for every next costume it will like it's actually doing the gif yeah and they'll also play a song that i got from youtube so it's a song i love that stadium okay next the obstacle so when green flag stitch wait until touching mario so not do nothing except these until touching mario didn't stop all because you lose the game then when green flag clicked forever go to x 195 and y negative 145 which is the at the edge of the screen where it starts and then it'll glide one second to where mario is so like go for mario and then i'll switch causing to pick a random obstacle so it'll be a different obstacle each time that you won't know that's how it's different so when the back dropped i uploaded the mario and i painted it black or it would be white yeah so let's see the kinds of obstacles first there's a banana and there's a squid the ink squid and there's king boo there's a bomb a red shell and a green shell and finally a bullet bill a bullet bill can hit you if you're not using it but if you're using it it will be expressed yeah you don't really get it when you're in first place it's a little uncommon let's play it so i'm gonna play first jump banana squid bomb on green shell green shell again king boo squid blue you can actually see what's next when it like crosses yeah like it's king blue green style red shell 20 yay i did it yeah i got 20. you almost touched it oh i got 26. you're turning until red yeah oops okay let's do that i love coconut malt oh 10. so to fix it from like showing what the next obstacle will be when it like goes to edge where mario is we're gonna do a white block so let's do a weight 0.3 seconds 0.3 seconds now let's try it oh oh it went too long it's waiting how about 0.2 0.1 okay let's try it's much harder now still you can still see so let's do 0.2 then you need to be in the air to for longer yeah okay so let's just move the way because we don't want it to be too hard unless you're like only get two points or so let's say if you're a very pro let's let kalia play jump at the right time but the worst is the blue exploding spiky shell okay and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
