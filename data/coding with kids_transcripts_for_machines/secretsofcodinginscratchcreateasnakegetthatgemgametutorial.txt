welcome to cooking with kids and my name is andrew today one two three and in this project i made cosmic gym so as you see there's a snake and few gems a gem which you need to get yeah i grow longer maya i am cheese okay so here is the code for the snakehead there is three sprites the snakehead snake body and gem so when green flat click go to x zero y negative one hundred so is the starting point yeah point in direction zero which is over here going over pointing out here let's go to zero so there's a score variable yeah forever move ten steps if touching color this kind of color which is kind of one of the sprites of the snake body broadcast game over and weight because if you touch one of your bodies which is over here right if you get gems you will grow longer so if you touch it you say ouch it will broadcast game over it's touching edge which is these edge it will rock us game over two so there's two ways to die when i receive game over it will say ouch because you kind of like ouchy yourself and stop all so you lose stop the project when up a recreate pressed point in direction zero because i don't want to like move the whole sprite when down arrow key press point and direction 180 so it's just like this one right arrow key press point in 90 and one left arrow key press it will point in negative nine now the snake body when green flat click switch costume to snake trail which is this one this one's the custom ones just like square of green then forever go to snakehead so it will always follow the snakehead it will wait 0.01 seconds it will create a clone of myself so keep getting longer yeah when i start as a clone so right now we're coding the clone point in directions pick random 0 to 3 star which is multiplication nine it will multiply nine and wait 0.1 seconds and switch costume to costume which is just the screen and the weight score dash 5 seconds delete disco so and there's the gem when green flag clicked forever if touching snake heads so if the snakehead gets the gem change score by one so you get one gem and go to expect random negative 220 to 220 so it will like pick a random spot why pick random 160 to 160 so go somewhere else yeah and there's one backdrop which i got it from the sprite backdrop i think snakes live in foresty places so i just put a force black background and now let's play i mean yeah i got that you got one my turn okay andrew oh no i can't touch my nose i can't touch myself you almost touch yourself six oh man at the end when you touch the edge every of those kind of square clones go to the snakehead the most hardest is when it's very close to the edge because it's very close yes got it yeah yes got it yeah oh man zero and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
