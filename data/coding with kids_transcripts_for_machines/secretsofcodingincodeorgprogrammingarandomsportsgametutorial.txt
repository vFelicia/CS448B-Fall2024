welcome to clinton with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in kodak and this is one of the projects we made random game so it's actually a sport game and it's have a lot of random except the speed and the player speed and the ball speed now let's see how oh there's a hockey stick hockey stick each kind of background have a different kind of like goal like this one and some of them are small some of them big so like this football field is a very easy one but and the soccer because they're both big now let's see let's see how it works so one run so when you press run that means you start it throw a new ball so it will like have a new ball there will be a ball so you can play then set player to a hockey stick you can choose others then set fast player speed so your your player speed will be fast so you can move it fast and the ball speed is fast too so when you start you're the same speed except random scenes so you don't know what kind of scene but you can choose i did random but you can't do random players so i like the hockey stick so i choose the hockey stick they set random ball so there is other two eventually there is actually a baseball you can make a baseball game a football game a hockey game or a soccer game or you can make a random game then when right arrow pressed then it will move right when left arrow press then it will move left when ball hits players so when it touches your player which is the hand hockey sticker foot it'll place bounce sound first it will bounce the ball so you won't earn any points or miss then set random scenes so when you tuck when the ball touches you it will set random scene then it will set perf speed very too fast which is the same then set ball speed to very fast so it's like a little challenging yeah when left arrow it will move left when ball hits the ball it will bounce ball because it's a wall you can't go through the wall yeah but because if you didn't have that code the ball will go out of the screen on your first like bounce when ball is in the goal which is over here or the other scenes have different kind of goals it will score points so we add one point to you your score you set random scenes so you need to change another city throw a new ball yeah before you set another random scene then it was one the whole hockey thing there was a hockey ball and a hockey scene and a hockey stick it's always a hockey stick so then set players speed be fast and sit balls speed faster it's just like one run but not when you touch you want the ball to touch you the plug you die when ball misses players someone goes score opponent point oh no the opponent got a point because you missed it throw new ball so wouldn't there won't be any no more balls so there will be one more ball so you can't keep playing then set random scenes set random ball and set fast player speed and fast ball speed so it's just like when ball and goal but it will score opponent's point now let's play you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard or yeah or the the arrows over here so this is mobile friendly tool so you can use it on a phone a computer or an ipad no it got me the cpu can will do nothing to earn two points whoa it depends on me to score the cpu's points on my it's catching up oh no two more points oh please score i have to the ball will score a point when it touches the goal of this the backgrounds one more point no don't let it get one more point no oh i almost got one more point luckily i got it oh it's still bouncing back then no oh i it's still bouncing back two points two points when i get to eight it's andrew's turn um one point again no you won't you won't computer one more point until it catches up to me and one more point until i win i win is i can't catch them bounce oh you missed um um there's a lot of different scenes and stuff leaders laughter yeah too fast computer always gets points nope you won't you won't computer you won't no no computer you won't over me computer gets five points by doing nothing whoever gets to seven points will give over seven points well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
