welcome today coding with kids my name is my name is andrew today we're inspecting minecraft kit that called bungeefree and this project i made called minecraft so you move a cat and try to eat something so it's um minecraft based so in the cat sprite when green file clicked forever if key right arrow press so if you press the right arrow on your keyboard it will change x by 10 so it'll move right if t left arrow pressed then change x by negative 10 so move left in the grille summon um when greenville click go to random position and set y to 180 so always appear on the top in any position that's the y is 180 my green flag clicked it will say score slash fish cat 8 which is a variable to zero so always restart your points forever if touching cat the cat will play sound bite until done so it's a sound that i found in the scratch sound library go to rent it will change score by 1 and go to random position set y280 so it goes somewhere on the top when green file clicks it will forever change y by negative 5 so it'll fall down if y position is bigger is less than negative 170 then it will go to random position and set y to us that's when they reach the red line green factory is set timer with another variable for 250 so you have a 50 time limit 15 seconds forever change time mirror by one so minus one each second because it's a timer when greenpot click forever if touching bottom which is the red line um it will change score by negative one before it falls or else so minus point it will go to random position and set y to 180 when green frog cook forever if timer is zero and the score is less than 15 so if the timer is zero you ran out time the broadcast messages one and wait in raw sum and it has like the same exact code except like set the timer and this codes my grandma click forever if timer equals zero and score is less than 15 and the set timer variable in the bottom there's no code because it's just the bottom um in the trophy when green found click high forever if score fish the cat eight is is bigger than 10 and score the score fish is less than 10 then switch costume to trophy show wait one second hi so it's a trophy if the score fish and it's like when you reach 15 it will show the costume this one 15 points show wait one second and hide and sprite one is where you use the message one yeah and look screen when greenback's like hide forever if score is equal to 15 then switch costume to costume one go to front layer show stop alls different layers that like nothing will be still showing so the main screen will cover all these friends then when i received message once and did not reach reach 15 points it will switch costume to costume 2 which is you lost sadie face it will show and stop us okay oh i almost mistaken the raw one for the because my cooking one is a little more orange i can show the difference but sometimes it's tricky when on the small one is with the cooked one okay sometimes the tail is the one you really don't like okay oops the tail may make you in trouble or maybe head oh oh three i don't think you would go four five six five five six seven oh this one's tricky it's just a random position it's the scratch um site is um no it's not okay 11 eleven four okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
