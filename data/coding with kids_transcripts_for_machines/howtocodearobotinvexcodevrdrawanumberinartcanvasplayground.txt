welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andy today we're in fix code and today we're gonna draw a number i think we should draw number eight do you agree andrew yes because it's your age okay let's first move robot pen down so we can start drawing then set robot color to blue because it's my favorite color then repeat four times to first mix a square because eight has two squares oopsies repeat four times move forward for 900 millimeters 900 millimeters and turn right for 90 degrees turn right 90 degrees okay then let's see what it does it will draw a square first turn let's press run okay it's going forward for 900 millimeters now it turns right 90 degrees then go 404 um 900 millimeters again because it's a repeat four times it repeats four times to make a square now last time now we start this is the starting position now we need to make another square but right here maybe you can turn and go dead i have a more simple idea you can reverse because you can drive reverse let's repeat it three times let's drive four four no reverse for 900 millimeters reverse for 900 millimeters then turn left for 90 degrees turn left 90 degrees let's run it so first it will draw one square then it will reverse so it will go backwards then turn that for 90 degrees then repeat it for three times let's see if it works okay it's going forward to make the first square turn 90 degrees go forward for 900 millimeters turn 90 degrees again repeat that four times to make a square then from the starting position we go reverse turn left 90 degrees go backwards again turn left 90 degrees and go backwards again we don't need um repeat four times because if it repeats it will just draw the same thing so it's like drawing nothing and thanks for watching remember to smash them up and subscribe bye bye bye
