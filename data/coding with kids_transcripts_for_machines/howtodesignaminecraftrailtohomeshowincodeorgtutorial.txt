welcome to cooking with kids my name is and my name is andrew today we're on coda on and this is a project i made called rail to home so as his name is you know that the agent will make a rail that connects you to your home so it's first here it's a function call function one let's go place the rails and move forward or you can change one so functions over here in the code you need a lot of function ones but you don't even need a function too so these are how you built a rail all the way to home so first repeat ten times do function one so it repeat ten times actually built a rail then repeat five times in function one repeat two times turn back repeat two times turn right times still function one so only suppose back to home so let's see so the agent will start building the rail just explore the world without crossing the bridge while we let the agent build there's trees and grass dirt go on the rail we can't see the agent we're on a minecart well i agent really built so slow racing it turns by itself you don't need to touch the keyboard and it will turn except over here it's stuck because there's a torch there so yeah you need to turn because you can't even break the tool and bump the door and then you need to go here that's to go through your front door and and this is like a whale through like the middle of the island so i'm gonna stop off here and there is some stone yeah and there's a river and you when you go on the rail you can go all the way back to the spawn point and it was hit there's an island yeah but you can't go yeah because you can't walk on water on this one you need a code the agent to build anything to go over well yeah oh yeah oh i can look look i'm looking under the leaves and blinking go back to the spawn point and then we set and we're going to just like follow the agent okay i want a different really built very slow you can use the arrows here or the arrow keys on your computer it's the sd or on an ipad or iphone you can still use the arrows on the screen yeah see it backed up or else it will turn on the wall you can literally like go on to the agent and squish him see he doesn't care he doesn't even take any damage agent why don't you react you can't walk on water or break anything so you need a like code agent to do everything for you except open the doors and stuff and ride on your car where are you are you going i mean i want to close the door then you need to press space in front of the door the agents just stand there after it's finished with the code like this that was a rail to home yeah now you don't need to oh there's the mom's chasing me except there are mobs on that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
