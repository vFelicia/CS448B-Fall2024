welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew today we're on minecraft education edition so we're in the two villages hour of code so the simple tale was that there were two villages the villager village and the elder village and they were friends but then they knew how they learned how to live on their own and now we're going to unite them together so we're today we're going to go to the regular village and we're going to go to this fisherman so now we're going to talk to him so the fisher says hi friend fishing is something we've never been good at the elders from the next town over are offering to help us learn how but they say we need a doctor an official says can you help us build the dock at the edge of the shore or just meet the outline see if he can build a six bucks long four box walk restart activity okay so our agent needs to follow these green dots and to build the outline of the dock and then our code will be complete so we're gonna press two so we can do agent dot give planks to give so the eddy can give himself blocks and then we're gonna do if we can move the agent and place the box so let me go here for iron range six so i'll repeat this six times for the first side of the dot so i'm going to do six i'm gonna do agent dot give planks to one so i'll give myself planks then i'll do asian.place down and then between the gif and the placement the agent dot move forward so now let's go so now the agent has made one side of be done successfully it looks like like a player holding the wood blank so now we're going to do agent dot move right to turn hello agent then we're gonna let's start doing this again but now we're going to do it three times so i'm going to change these six to a free then we're gonna do asian.gif planks still we're going to do agent.move right so now i'm going to do this after the agent puts the block down so now we have built again another side so now we have one more side left to complete the dock so i want to move left one time because it's trying to do agent dot mode left get into place first okay two three four five so now we only you do it five times oops and do the four i in range and do it five times and do asian dot move backward agent dot move backward and then we're gonna do dot give planks to one then a gentle place place one down one down so now it's completing the last side so now there are townsfolk so the caretaker says equity is not about giving everyone the same thing it is about making sure everyone has what they need to be successful before you build dock the villagers didn't have what they needed to learn to fish they don't want them to do this then the caretaker said fishing together with your dog and some lessons from the elders the villagers learn to fish oneself don't forget to check on your tree but it's good so now we have completed the second last activity and now they are the villagers and villagers are fishing happily so now we're gonna use this to teleport tshirt it's nice i think it can fit about four tree houses i think it's like it's so big so when you only do one more task well you can you can't even see them one more task to reunite them well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash your like button and subscribe bye bye
