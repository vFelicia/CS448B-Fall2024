welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're going to use chat GPT to create a simple game in Python So today we're going to show you how to create a Hangman game in Python using track gbt so first I asked us to give me some simple games it says certainly here are a few examples of simple games you can play TicTacToe we already did did that in Python Hang Man which we're gonna do today 20 Questions Pictionary charades which we can't do in python or maybe we can but we need lots of people to play it and Simon Says and I spot so these are just a few examples of simple games you can enjoy you can modify the rules or add variations to suit your preferences have fun play so Nana said to Chachi make a simple Hangman game with Clues and two players with python and explain it to me like I'm a python beginner it says sure I can help you create a simple hangman gamer python he's a stepbystep explanation of how to do it so step one to set up the game first you need to import the random module to generate a random word for the game here input then you can start by defining a list of words that will be used as the word bank for the game so then there's a list which we can put in the words that we can guess here for example as an example it's apple banana character and eggplant and fig so you can change those words to whatever you want select step two or select a random word next you need to choose a random word from the word Bank you can use the rand.choice function to do this so here we have variable storing the one of these words from the list as the word you you are supposed to guess then step three we're gonna initialize the variables you need some variables to keep track of the game's profits initialize variables like guesses math guess Max guesses Clues and guess letters so there's guesses which is zero it will increase over time the maximum guesses here it's six you can also modify that and then we have a variable called clue equals and there's this times the length of the word to create to tell you um how many letters the word has and then there's a list that will contain your guest letters step four is create a loop for gameplay so first I'm going to do a while loop while guesses is less than Max's maximum guesses and clue is not word we're going to display the current clue in guest letters so I'm going to print clue and we're going to give the amount of letters in the word and then we're going to print guest letters here which is also a list and then we're going to prompt the player for a guess so we're going to create a variable with our answer equals input guess letter and then we'll change the letter to lower and then we're it's going to store our answer here and then we're going to check if the guess is valid if it's in the word so if length of guess is not one or it's not guest dot is Alpha so it's Alpha checks if the input or whatever it's checking is only one letter so if length if the length is not uh one letter it's going to print invalid guess please enter a single letter and we're going to continue then we're going to check if the letter has already been guessed if guess in guest letters then it will print you already guessed that letter and then you can guess again next we're going to add the guess to the list of guest letters if we pass both these if Loops we're going to do guess dot letters guess letters the append guess we're gonna add it to the list and then we're gonna check the guess is in the word so if guess is in the word we're gonna do we're gonna update our clue or our word that is Mystery unknown and then we're going to print correct guess because it's in the word if it's not in the word we're going to add one to the guesses variable I'm going to print incorrect guess then we're going to print then step five in the game so if guesses equals equals Max guesses remember it's about two so you're not a science so if you're you reach the max gases it'll print you lost the word was and then I'll show you the word if you didn't then it'll print congratulations you've guessed the word and it'll also show the word even if you did it against it that's it you now have a basic Hangman game feel free to add more features or customize it further as you become more comfortable with python remember to indent the code properly to maintain the structure and functionality happy code so now we're in Visual Studio codes and we put all the code here and we change the word bank to games YouTube coding Andrew Kalia and Python and we're going to change the max guesses to 10 so we have space for wrong letters okay so now we're gonna do you want to go first sure okay okay I'm gonna put an a because it's very very there is six letters there's no a this six letters um let's see there's no a so let's try the bar there is a y that's the second letter let me think of the huh it's python yeah okay you guessed the word python okay my turn let's see there is also six letters let's choose a there's a it's probably my name this is my name okay one more time for us each okay I'm good it's six again right I think so yeah it sucks there's no kick uh there's a g at the end okay it hasn't what could it be uh let me try it there is no e there is no a either you have four guesses what ends with a G I have no idea I'm just gonna guess random letters now there's an o in the second letter oh it's coding oh I'm running out of guesses you made it okay my turn last one see seven letters there's only one thing that has seven letters there's no way let's see there's no C either there is a it's probably YouTube yeah it's the only one in our bank that had seven letters so okay congratulations you guessed the word YouTube well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash that button and subscribe bye bye
