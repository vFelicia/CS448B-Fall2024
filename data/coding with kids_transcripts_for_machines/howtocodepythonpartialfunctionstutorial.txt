welcome to getting with kids my name is clea and my name is andrew today we are going to teach you python so today we want to learn about partial functions so partial functions will turn your a function with x parameters into a function with less parameters so first we're going to do from func tools we're going to import the partial then we'll do example one def which is defined multiply and there are two parameters x and y return x star y so star is basically the multiplication symbol so here you enter two numbers and then the function will multiply the two numbers and then it will give you the answer so now going to make a variable called triple equals partial so we're going to use the partial function multiply 3 so we make x free so then we're going to print a triple two so we fill out one in the variable one parameter in the variable and the other variable i mean the other other parameter parameter in the print so now we'll save it and right so that's six because three times two is six then we're gonna do example two we're gonna define get cakes there are four parameters a b c and d so we're gonna return a plus b plus c plus d so we're going to add four numbers in this function so when we do a variable called get cakes for all equals partial get kicks one one so we here we fill out the a and b parameters into one and one then we're gonna do print get cakes for all two and three so we make c two and d three so here we're gonna add one plus one plus two plus three now i'm gonna say so did seven one plus one plus two plus three equals seven okay then for example three we're going to find get cakes a b c d so this is the same function so we're gonna get case for all variable again and equals partial their case a equals one and b equals one so here we specify which parameter we want to one and one then we're going to print get case for all b equals two so here we override the b in here which is supposed to be one and we override it into two and then we also do the c into three and d into four so here we're adding one plus two plus three plus four so now i'm gonna save it and so i did ten let's see one plus two is three three plus four equals six and six plus four equals ten that's correct well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
