welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is amy today we're gonna teach you python so today we're gonna learn about string helper functions so i'm gonna make a new folder file and i'm gonna name it helper2.py then we're going to message equals the quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog then we're gonna do print message dot message dot find two two so it's going to return the number of the position that the letter is in if the the letter is the first letter in the sentence they're gonna return a zero yeah but if it doesn't find that letter it's gonna return a negative one okay then we're gonna do print message dot find t lowercase t yeah then print message dot find a z z so there is no z here well hmm let's do it uppercase see and let's see if it finds the uppercase yeah first let's do ctrl s to save it and then go to the terminal and do helper no py helper 2 dot p1 let's press enter 4 32 and negative 1. it returned a negative 1 because they're fine uh um uppercase c yeah then is 32 so the t is right there the t the the lazy dot and then there's four because there's a q and a quick yeah okay now we're going to delete this and then message equal middle i mean a long space near the middle so the spaces in here it is two tabs then i'm gonna do print a dot and then plus message dot else plus a dot again so the l strip function will um take away all the spaces in the left of the word and then and then like make it into periods okay then print dot plus message dot r strip the l equals left and the r equals right yeah then a dot then we're gonna do print dot plus message s strip that strip so the strip it doesn't have a left or right so it's going to strip on both sides of the work okay then okay let's save it so it's gonna strip the spaces and add these okay let's do up arrow to copy what you list what you last typed in the terminal and run it middle middle middle so in the strip all the spaces disappeared and they added periods yeah then here in the r strip the r the right spaces disappear but the left spaces are still here then in the l strip the right spaces are still here but the left spaces are disappeared okay now let's delete this and type it brevity is the essence of what so that's the message and then message equals message dot replace essence so the replace function as it says as it names is going to replace the word if it sees it it will replace it too so yeah so if it's fine essence in the message it's gonna turn the essence to a soul okay then print message okay let's save it and run it now it says brevity is the soul of what so you see it doesn't print brevity is the essence of what because it found the word essence and changed it to a soul less than this so now we're going to do message equals b then print message so the so the r just function is gonna uh put 20 spaces but it also counts the word howdy so the howdy has five letters so it's gonna minus five from the twenty so there's gonna be fifteen spaces then print i left yeah message dot our just 20 comma dash so now we have added the dash so it will add 15 dashes yeah because again the how do you already have five letters so it will take five away from this one then print message dot 20 so just like the r chest the elders is gonna add 20 spaces but it minus five so that would be 15. so because of the howdy so the left the lgs will do will add 20 well 15 spaces on the right then print message dot l just 20 comma dash so just like here the l just 20 comma dash is gonna add 15 dashes to the right yeah to the right of having let's save it and run it so see it just as 15 because here there's already five letters so it all worked and that's it for today remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
