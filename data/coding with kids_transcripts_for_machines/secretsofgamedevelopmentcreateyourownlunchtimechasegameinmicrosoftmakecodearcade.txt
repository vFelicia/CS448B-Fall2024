cutting with kids my name is andrew today we're in microsoft make code arcade so today i'm going to show you my game lunchtime chase so as you see here i am a happy face i wasn't so good at drawing it and there's a pizza and timer and your score so first let's show you how this works so i'm gonna play it first the timer goes to three seconds okay now let's see the code so first on start so like when you run the the project set score to zero so the score is here and set background color to this color blue yeah and then set my sprite to sprite happy face so i choose the happy face see it's not so good of kind player so this the happy faces are player then move my sprite with buttons so we can move our happy face with the buttons like the arrow keys on your computer or these buttons okay which is harder yeah then set pizza to sprite of kind food so the pizza we're gonna try to touch the pizza and the pizza is a food because the pizza isn't food yeah it is the cat is a kind of player okay then on sprite of kind player over lots of sprite of kind food so our happy face is player and the pizza is food so this is basically if the happy face to just the pizza or the pizza touches the happy face then place down ppu so it's a sound it's like a scoring sound but they're is no scores so i picked the ppu then start countdown four seconds so there's a countdown for four seconds so it'll it'll count down for four seconds i tried other like five seconds or six seconds but they're like kind of made it easy so four seconds is like not too hard or not too easy so yeah it's the perfect one then change score by one and then set pizza positions to x pick random 1 to 160 and y 106 yeah 10 to 120 so speaking is random x and y coordinates so if the happy face touches the pizza then the pizza will go to a random position in the screen and when you start you always get one at least one point because the happy face and the pizza appear on the same place when you run the code and yeah that's all the code okay yeah i'm gonna go first sorry let's see if i can get at least 10. one time i got over 30 score yeah 46 i think okay let's change it to three oh no so i'm gonna play first and then leah's gonna play if the countdown goes to zero it will automatically stop the game and that's how this kind of work yeah automatically you lose okay 14. 15. 18 19 20 yeah sometimes you don't even need to move because the pizza goes on top of you yeah because it goes to one position 30. wow is new high school they also met if you lose like this is we set a score in the code so automatically like stays your new high school okay now kalia is going to play okay let's restart it four this is her first time playing like you you always get two you're done oh so so it's lunch time like that stuff for lunch more shall we stop no no you want to beat my high school um i want to is thanks for watching remember to dismantle like and subscribe bye
