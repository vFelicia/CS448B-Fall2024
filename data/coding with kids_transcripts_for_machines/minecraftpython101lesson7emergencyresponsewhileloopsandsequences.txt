welcome to curtin with kids my name is education to help in emergency situations are too dangerous for humans right now we're still in a testing phase with simulated disaster requirements however as soon as the code is finished the agent could be deployed in real world okay so in this lesson the agent i'm going to try to make the agent to help in natural disasters so first there's the emergency worker so the emergency worker says would it be possible to get your help i need a code that will make the agent build two block high wall to stop flood water you have a line of restaurant dust on the floor that the aliens should follow can you write such a code for me so first we need to try to code an agent to follow the trail of redstone and part one to the gold block okay so we have to help the um agent put blocks to block flood from flooding villages yeah so first we'll do wire agent dot attack trying to detect okay so while the agent detect would detect the function agent detection that redstone forward so while the agent detects redstone in front of it it will agent dot move so keep moving forward so the agent is following the path and goes to go back okay so now we're gonna make a wall to stop the flood water so it's just like um pretending it's flooding it's just testing so you can stop a place right so replace the block to its right and here move up one time one time and then agent that place right place right again so make a two block high wall then back down agent dot me down then two times so go back to the ground level move forward and build the next part of the wall okay now let's work here so it's placing the glocks it's maybe making a stone wall okay okay so now there's no more fluff yeah okay so now i'm gonna go to activity 2. so now i'm going to go talk to the farm so firemount says i need a coat that will give the agent the ability to build firebreaks on uneven terrain to stop the spread of fires the wall must be one block high and built out of conquer you have a line of restaurant dust over a terrain next to where the aegis place to walk to try to build a wall that will stop fires first agent dot up place left again you just not move forward so continue the wall just stop move forward one time and then the end of move tools now we only need one tab here we do agent dot place left and then you drink that move move forward one time so now you're gonna run the code go agent now it's down in the wall okay so now we're finished the emergency worker so the emergency worker says i'm trying to make the agent build foundations for homes damaged by hurricanes however it is not working the agent needs to place the foundations within the restroom dust outlines can you write such a cool for me okay so first there's a door bed and like the outline of the house so we need to build one block wall around the redstone to make a house to appear a house after it's been destroyed by a heart okay so okay build the house okay so first let me do while agent dot dot detect one time to move on because the foundation only needs to be one block tall then we'll do a second while loop well you just don't detect right redstone again but it's going to be in the left the forward has to be left forward has to be left and the agent's detection the second one agent dot oops two tabs dot move forward one time two times so now yeah foundation okay it's been a pretty good house it's kind of a simple house too yeah okay now we finished building a small house here next to part two we're gonna build a bigger house only one time because end of while loop one i mean while loop two so we're gonna do while loop three so wall agent talk detect boom redstone right so the part one already build these these first speaker so our living room then we'll do two tabs now i'm gonna make the agent place the block to its left so we're going to do agent dot place left then it did not move forward one time because the house only needs to be one block well the foundation only needs to be one block top okay one time then agent dot place will do left again did you move back you just don't move back one time one time and then finally we're gonna do agent dot turn right agent turn house because that one is more simple so it's made out of okay so we need to fix the code so here i turn then you need it return then agent i'll place left right yeah i have to return right um move forward one time one time so now i'm going to try to run it again first we need to restart okay so there's like go and go out so the room is not just square now it's building the bedroom because there's a bed the living room or the big room doesn't have a bed so so this is just for a maybe a one person because it's just oh there's only one that i had yeah but it's a big place for a one person to live maybe like he needs to score a lot of students well after hiking um yeah now there's rockets yeah fireworks okay so we completed it this house is pretty fancy better than the first house yeah the first house is pretty simple here i even saw that um the first house has not really good floor but the second house has better floor yeah and their bed colors are different well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
