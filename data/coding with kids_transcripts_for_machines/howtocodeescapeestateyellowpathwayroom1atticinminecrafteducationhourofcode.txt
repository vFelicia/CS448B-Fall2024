welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we are Minecraft education Edition and we're in an escape estate so in the last video we completed the Green Path of Escape estate so now we're gonna head on to the yellow path Minecraft presents so we're starting from all the way in the start Escape so now we're in this creepy place again forest look it's our kids are it looks different maybe is it a continuation no it's a the same thing so we're gonna just skip the tutorial if you want that tutorial you can go to our first video of Escape SD to do the tutorial so the tutorial is basically just the controls of Minecraft yeah okay so we're gonna skip the tutorial Dr brickowski hello I am Dr Dodge bragowski I see you've received my engine invitation do you think you have what it takes to Escape the Mansion by Dawn and claim the one million emeralds excellent now head to the front door to begin your challenge let's go the doctor looks weird yeah okay his body is so involved and big that's that's okay he looks it's grumbling oh no we got swallowed so now we have a book such room for particles hello is someone there oh my a human do you think you could help me I can't seem to open this door floor of it I think my code may be broken do you think you could take a look and see what's wrong with it can you try to get the agent out of the trapdoor so blocks is best from Beginnings but we're gonna choose python um to code to help the agent so okay first see that cursor on over there on the floor it needs to move forward free box to reach the trapdoor but it isn't working press C to view the code okay so this is a cursor it needs to go to the trapdoor and openness so the agent can come out okay so let's go to code okay so we just need to move forward three times in an open trapdoor so we already did this in the first video so first there's already two move cursors but we need to move it three time so we need to add one more so we're gonna do this copy so move to our search and then orange so orange so it will re reach the trapdoor and then there's the open chapter function so I'll open the trap door okay great it's open that's strange I still can't seem to get out can check the code again and make sure I'm moving up two blocks so we open the tractor but the agent still can't get out so now when you have a program the agent to come out okay so so there are agent that moves but then there are forward bath left right up and down so we the agent to move up so we just need to move it one more time because everybody has agent move up one time so agent dot move up so now I will move up two blocks and get one to the trap door thank you you fixed my code now I'm in range to open the green door for you but we're already completed the Green Path the path Behind the Green Door is an easier one you can take that path or talk to me again if you want to try opening the yellow door so we're gonna try to open the yellow door so we're gonna talk to the agent so you want to try opening the yellow door for that I'll need more power luckily I can charge off of moonlight all we had to do was open the Scarlet above huh my code isn't working right now but working right try checking my code to make sure that all four chapters in the ceiling are opening oh there are trap doors now we need to use the cursor on the roof to open the trapdoor so the agent can get Moonlight energy okay so these are the we can move orange which is forward move the cursor forward to move it back blue to move it left and yellow to move it right so we're just gonna go do this code example to see what it does so the Open chat or yellow yellow yellow so it first opened the first trapdoor okay so now we need to open all four of those trap doors so we can use a loop for Iron Range to repeat the same code except like in the shorter term repeating the same coat open tracker it does the same thing okay back to coding so now it open traps to remove yellow cursor cursor let's see what this does it's different so open okay so before we do move cursor orange we're gonna open the trapdoor the orange two times again yeah so if you want to do something two times it's basically the loop so you can use either way so then we're gonna open trapdoor again let's see what this does okay okay it opens the first one opens the second one open the third one so now we need to go Blue two times and then open trapdoor function so do move cursor blue blue two times and then we're gonna do a trapdoor trap door if now this should work and open all the tractors two three four puzzle solved so now it's a bunch of electricity energy well way to go I've opened the yellow door for you now head through if you like or if you really want a challenge talk with me again to try opening the red door but next video we're gonna go through the yellow door seems the same mysterious as the Green Door it's just like more yellow goes to a different room than the Green Door yeah because it says the green was the easiest and the yellow I think is the medium and then the red over here is the hardest iron blocks gardening yeah it looks hard so in the next video we're gonna go in but for now we're just gonna stay and look at this mysterious portal well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
