welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edible is a coding platform where there are lots and lots of problems you can solve using different kinds of coding languages So today we're going to do three easy coding challenges in edible using python so our first problem is called moving house the instructions are I'd like to calculate how long on average I have lived in the same house given a person's age and the number of times they've moved houses and the variable moves return the average number of years that they've spent living in the same house so for example it would give us the number of the age of the person then the number of times they moved so here uh 30 years and one move that means two houses so you do 30 divided by two equals 15. okay and then you also need to round to the nearest year okay so first we have a function called years in one house with variables age and moves so first we're going to do we're going to create a variable called houses equals moves plus one because I figured out that the number of moves plus one is the number that you have to divide the H by to get the answer because they still will have to have one house and then they move to another house so they'll have like if they move two times they'll have their first house and then they move to the second house and they move to a third house so then we're gonna make a variable called years equals H divided by houses to figure out how many years on average uh the person spent in each house so I thought then we're gonna we also need to round to the nearest year so we're gonna do a variable called rounded and use the function round and working around the number of years to and then we put zero because that's how many decimal places we want which is zero decimal places just the whole number family we're just gonna return the variable around it now we're going to check our test cases there's 80 and 0 moves so you just do 80 years in one house so that person stayed in in one house for um their whole life yeah and then there's a baby that's one years old and there's Zero moves so there's one year in one house okay so we passed all our tests onto our next coding challenge it's called basketball points the instructions are you accounting points for a basketball game given the amount of three pointers scored and two pointers scored find the final points for the team and return that value okay so here it will give us two pointer scored and three pointer score here there is one two pointer and one threepointer so two plus three equals five okay so first we have a function called points with two variables two pointers and three pointers so the first number will be two pointers which is two points in the second number will be three pointers which is three points okay so first we're gonna calculate how many points for each kind of shot so we're going to create a variable called shots for two equals two pointers times two because each two pointer you make is two points and then we're gonna do the same for three pointers so shots for three equals three pointers times three so now we have all the points but now we still need to add them so we're gonna do total points equals shots for Two Plus shots for three which is the total amount of points and then we're gonna return the total amount of points and see the test cases so there is one and two so I think that is two three pointers and one two pointer so three plus three equals six and six plus two equals eight oh there's also two and two which is two three pointers equals six and two two pointers equals four six plus four equals ten and there's a sixty not 69 and a 420. that's a lot that's impossible okay so if we pass all the tests on to our final coding challenge it's called frames per second create a function that Returns the number of frames shown in a given number of minutes for a certain FPS so FPS stands for frames per second so for example here there is one minute and one frame per second so we're there are 60 seconds of one minute so we're just gonna do 60 frames in that number of minutes with that frames per second okay so first we have a function called frames with two variables minutes and frames per second so first we're just gonna easily convert minutes to the seconds so we can easily multiply the frames per second times the number of seconds in this number of minutes so first we're gonna do a variable called seconds equals minutes times 60 because there are 60 seconds in one minute so now we have the total number of seconds so there's frames per second so we can do fps2 equals seconds times FPS so seconds and the FPS are both different each time so we're going to use the variable so now in fps2 we have the total number of frames in that number of minutes so now we're going to return that number and see the test cases so there's 99 minutes with one one frame per second so it's five nine four zero and then there's zero minutes and 60 uh frame per second we don't it's just minutes so it's zero okay so we pass all the tests well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to
