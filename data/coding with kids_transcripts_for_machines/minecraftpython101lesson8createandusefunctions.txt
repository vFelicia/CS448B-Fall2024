welcome to cutting with kids my name is colleen and my name is andrew general minecraft education so we're on python 101 lesson 8. so first we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says hi there we are trying to help an e ecological organization with their project they want to plant a large number of trees in a very short time that is why we want to develop the agent to do it should be easy then however we have been having some problems can you help us someone help the ceo make the agent plant trees and do stuff faster so the developer says i need your help i need to get the agent to till the grass box plant saplings on them and then fertilize those saplings to grow the plant however i can not seem to get the agent to chill each of the grass blocks in a row could you write some code to me with my problem okay so we're going to help the developer you get the agent to tell plant and fertilize the plants so which is basically make the agent plant a tree okay so first here we're going to define a function called plant okay these will be on to plant then we're going to make the aging tail to his left so we're going to do agent dot channel down to its left because the dirt block is to its left okay then we're going to place agent dot place sapling to its left to to plant it then here we're going to make the agent move forward and do agent move forward one time then call your function plant then we just not moved forward again so we need agent that move to move to the next block agent double move forward six times let's see if it's actually sticking after it goes to here and one two three four five six okay that's correct okay then your call function again because there are three diff blocks walk six times again agent move forward six times and then call your function again okay now you're gonna run it so there you go so that's so fast okay so fast maybe yeah so part two when you add fertilizer so here are planted little plants with a diamond okay so next here we're gonna go to code so part two here let's set the agent's inventory slot to one so we're gonna do agent dot set underscore slot to one because we need to put multiple things in the agent's inventory okay then here we're going to do set we're going to do agent dot set slot to two we don't want to over place the items then we're gonna make the agent place fertilizer two is left so we're gonna do agent dot place left then we're gonna copy this because we have to do it a lot of times i'm going to copy this okay right here you also need to do tab because it's in the well in the function okay makes the plants go faster so yeah the bone meal when the agent used a bone marrow made the the plant grow immediately into a full road trip with a lot like i'll say like six bombings i think yeah okay next we're gonna talk to the developer again and then the developer says i need to get the aeg to remove all the rocks after which it should chill the sore implant stop itself however each time we run the code the agent just walks right into the rocks without breaking giving by some coaching problem we're going to try to help the developer to get the at9 to walk right into the rocks and do that yeah and do nothing and blink its head you don't want to engage it together okay so first robot define function called destroy okay then we'll make the agent destroyed block forward we did that destroy forward because when i destroy the stone block that is forward right here okay then we're going to make the unit move forward how many times one two so i can plant because there's actually dirt under the stove so block gonna do agent dot move forward one time and here we're gonna do four i in range twelve times so it's a replica if agent dot inspect so it's a function agent inspection inspection dot block so the agent will try to inspect the block all the way forward because the um stone is forward of it yeah forward then we need to search for its specific block equals equals stone then we're going to call function for removing rocks which is destroy someone destroy the rock then here else else if there is no rock though move forward agent don't move forward one time so right now we're not planting yet we're just destroying the rocks and going to the end which is a good one go ahead go go oh the agent uses his hands yeah how powerful it's like it it's like awesome creative mode you can show any block with one hit okay now when you after we do the stone we apply it okay so now part two here i'm gonna declare function to death plant now we have to plant then here an agent move forward agent dot move forward forward we did the forward so the agent will be ahead of the dirt block well the brass block and then your till to make it a dirt block it's so cool it tilts yeah so we can plant then the agent dot place the seed back okay then here bottom after the destroyer we're doing lf which is elsa lf alif agent dot inspect a agent inspection inspection dot block down now equals equals grass so now we are searching for the grass block underneath the agent then we're going to do here and a call function for planting trees so we're going to plant right there and then the elves okay now we're in the right go agent go go ages 12. that's cool yeah because it destroys the block the stone block while planting yes and it's also pretty cool when it chills backward because there's like he's like they just so cool he just chills backward without looking yeah well that's how robot is actually okay cool robot mixer goes here and talk to the third developer there's so many developers free developers yeah they're on all the activities the developer says help i'm trying to get the agent to plant saplings on tilled soil on a small pasture however there's nothing wrong with my coat the agent does not cover the whole area okay this is a big area so first this part we need the agent to move all cleanly row by row and then go to the gold block and the second part you'll need a plant and stuff oh that's much harder but first let's clear this one so the agent's going to be planting it walking along let's hope his feet will not grow sore it's a robot okay so first here i'm going to declare function one def let's see move yes it's just moving this part forward okay so one row is one two three four five six seven eight nine so it's nine blocks okay but the second row is going to be ten because you know you didn't stand in the first block two three four five six seven eight nine yeah you're right okay so here back here it's gonna return that move okay then here i'm gonna do i'm gonna do death here down here underscore right okay so it's another function so make the agent turn right because the function is called turn right so agent forgot direction agent dot move forward one time okay and you turn right again agent so this is like the code for when the agent needs to go to the edge of a row then you said turn right okay now here i make another function def left direction not left okay so we're turning left move forward keep that move forward one time up to the d needs to capitalize and then finally here major dot turn left again it's basically the same as term right right one but it's just the turns are left and the um name is the right one is turn right and the left one is left turn okay here dude four i in range range four times oh yeah sometimes i just typical call function makes the patient move forward just turn right yeah then here the four iron range it's actually two rows so one two three four so that's great now go ahead go go go it's like it's a race it's arms and legs are moving so it's when it's moving so fast it looks like it's wheels yeah it's like flash okay part two part two agent won't run as fast because you need to still implant anyone else okay so now it's gonna do it's cool move till back again oh that's so cool up here right here and add to here if agent dot inspect project dot respect agent pages inspection dot block comma down equals equals graph and do the same as last time because it needs to till again and a function that plants saplings so we're going to do plant for now we didn't do the function yet and here we're going to do place the command so now here we're going to go here which is make the plan death plan then over here we'll do agent dot move for agent moon forward one okay the date isn't capitalized i always but that's the like missed the place back if they place back agent dot place back it's gonna place backwards plant okay then here after we finish we're going to try okay so here grass oh colon ah i'm sorry i i didn't see that's it now it's very slow because you check every time you're moving it checks it's not flash now yeah it needs to check it's back because it's grasp off but it still uses cool moves yeah i can see after it chills i can sometimes see the diamond um yeah it's like very flashy when it tails until very big sometimes i see it like it's um a pickaxe yeah but wait look look fruity look through the um uh you know what the planted near the edge i can see kind of blue yeah i think that's blocking this block is it water or no i think it's yeah i think it's water maybe but maybe it's glass water well there's rockets and we complete it okay now bye bye three developers yeah finish our job here we step listen we get our money here in our pay and that that like that room we first go to talk to ceo is like so cool because yeah there's a big tree with lanterns and like some places there's light crawling up the tree oh my god then fall we won't take fall damage hi ceo did you like how we climbed yes this is what you see oh it says you're not allowed to climb sorry but you already did but i appreciate it for yourself thank you please do again yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
