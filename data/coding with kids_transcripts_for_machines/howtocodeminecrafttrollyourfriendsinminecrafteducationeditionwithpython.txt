welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in a Minecraft education Edition so today I'm going to be showing you how to code four simple trolls so you can make fun of your friends and troll them and surprise them in survival so if you don't know what troll means troll is like just like tricking down and like uh like spawning balls out of nowhere and like making them scared and surprised so our first troll is on player sneak teleport the nearest player to your coordinates so where you are and then it'll spawn on Cooper at your position so here so the this these trolls aren't 100 efficient but they're still pretty good so like for example when players sneak so when your friend's trying to kill you or um to eliminate you to surprise you or something and they're sneaking so you can't see their name tags you control them by doing by teleporting them to you then you can eliminate them yourself with the surprise or you can spawn a creeper at your coordinate and then after they've teleported you and so and the creep responds you can quickly run away okay so then the next rule is to keep your friend focused on on eliminating zombies hopefully it's still night so on when uh any player or like when you kill a monster they'll teleport the nearest player to your coordinates will spawn a monster sponge and it'll Spawn Two More Zombies also at your record is so you can also need to run quickly away okay and then this will keep the focus because for every zombie you eliminate two more zombies will spawn so it's just like doubling it yeah yeah and then here when your friend finds a diamond and they mine it it will teleport them to your coordinates and they probably would have already collected the diamond hopefully um then after it teleports you uh the code is going to repeat 10 times then Place cobwebs and pick random position from your coordinates to the x is five and then the Y is Tenon lives I mean the Z is ten and the zero is wide so these are quarters so the code was just Spam cobwebs but Tim blocks which will slow you and your friend but maybe you have a sword so you're prepared at all times when you can break the cobbles what are the cobwebs for will they slow you down so we're going to spawn them projectile Prime TNT at your recording so you must run away I'll say very quickly all of these are not that efficient because you will be trapped in it too but maybe if you do it you'll have like something prepared to get out yeah so the prime TNT will be more quicker to explode and will explode your friends up hopefully not you and the next one is earlier in your survival so when uh somebody places obsidian and will set the position which is a variable to pick random position from these coordinates which can go from way above ground 50 blocks above ground maybe to 100 blocks underground or maybe more so when they're trying to build an obsidian well another portal and trying to get another secret Blaze Rod it will it will set the position variable to random position somewhere in the world now teleport the nearest player to that position I knew my suffocate and then it'll spot if it doesn't suffocate or they'll both ground it will spot a creeper at their position and these are the four trolls so now let's see it in Python okay so first we have the uh blank position variable to get a Teleport your friend to a random place and then here the first role is when you get the uh try to place the obsidian it will make the position variable Global so you can use it inside the function and outside the function then we'll set the position to a random position in these coordinates teleport on the nearest player to that position and also the creeper to that position and then this happens when somebody places a city then this is when somebody breaks a diamond board so it will teleport the the nearest player to your opposite coordinates and it will uh spam cobwebs 10 cobwebs in random positions around you and then it'll spawn the prime TNT at your position so hopefully you're close to your front and ready to run away so this also happens when you break the diamond ore then this is when your friend sneaks and trying to Shield or just sneak up to you it will teleport them to you and then it will spawn a creeper so it'll blow them up even if their Shield might protect them they'll still take damage and if the creeper doesn't finish them off you can then this all happens when a player sneaks and finally when the zombie kills when a zombie is eliminated it will teleport the nearest player to you spawn two more zombies and then this happens when a zombie dies so now let's try it so first Let's Pretend We're in a mine and then wow there are diamonds so we didn't get diamonds yet so we get a gold we have a gold pickaxe even if gold isn't that good and we try to mine the diamonds bam so now this column this is TNT so and this time we even blew up the diamonds so we got diamonds yeah but sometimes if you look if you're well if you're lucky you're lucky um uh the the cardboard will trap your friend for example your friend is over here you're sneaking well at least I swear that was an example of the sneaking and then you'll get boom everything explodes Okay so that's mine so we also mind the diamonds right yeah okay so let's just get the weather back to normal okay so now we're trying to build the portal okay for this present pretend there's a room portal or the portal you start building portal place the block of Stadium what happens next I've been selling for it to a random place oh now I'm suffocating and now I got eliminated because we suffocated so then you you can't really build another photo it's so sad final one is where there are lots of zombies and you try to eliminate them so tonight or just go to a shade so let's go to trees so I have an iron sword prepared to fight them as well as a shield that's how it's very effective the more you sneak to protect yourself from creepers of The Shield the more creepers will spawn it's very very you can't hold her yeah this your shoes will eventually break okay and Alice I'm just an interesting because zombies will also naturally spawn okay I always did okay so we're gonna do always day to go off so we're gonna go tonight time is not no response out of nowhere Horizons so I'm just spamming the Iron Golems can we get teleported to somewhere else again play subsidian you want to play Super City bye bye zombie oh suffocate again pickaxe yay just in a random place I think we're in a cave so we're gonna eliminate ourselves so we can respawn okay these all these cheese uh trolls are very effective and you can use them but now here so for the zombie troll when uh it might not be as effective it keeps them forgetting because um the zombie because if the zombies die from like fire from because it's day or like fire from your flame arrows creepers skeletons or iron golems it won't spawn I mean it won't spawn soon more only if you kill it with your iron pickaxe but not like setting on a fire it doesn't work trapped them in the cobbler and then let's see the other hacks um when this traveled sneeze you might also get exploded or they might just use it uh you uh shoes and then um for the broken diamond ore we'll really be sure not to press run when you are a place or doing any of these actions or you will regret it and then um back to the house the house before the video ends okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for
