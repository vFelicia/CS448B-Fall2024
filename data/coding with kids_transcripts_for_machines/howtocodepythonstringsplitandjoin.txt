welcome to recruiting with kids my name is claire and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about string split and join so first we have msg which is message variable equals coding with kiss tutorial then there's a lot of spaces string split and joy and we have a second variable called oars equals emerald diamond collapsing iron which is a list of five fours from minecraft and there's the or list which is the list of the five cores so first we're going to do print list msg so it lists and makes our always list no it makes our msg into a bunch of letters so like there's a bunch of letters everywhere so then i'm gonna do print msg split so it splits our msg into words and there's no space that are here then we're gonna do print msg split then a space so now it includes the spaces that were not in the other then we're gonna play print type msg split so the type function is going to tell us the type of msc split so the class is list so msg.split the classes list print ores.split.com so it did the oars emerald diamond coal lapis and iron then print dash dot join or's list so so it did emerald dash diamond dash call dash lapis dash iron so it did dashes in between the orders and then we're going to do print dash dot join or list plus or is list so this time we did a plus always list so so it basically is the same as the last time except it repeated the list of ores so you can repeat it by doing the plus i'm going to do print then empty then dot join or list so it squished all the words together like they have no space then do print then empty again that you want msg split so it also did the same thing i squish the words together then we're going to do print msg replace this two empty this empty space with no no space so now we also squish the words together because it replaces these spaces with no space then we have the oars the oars variable again but with commas colon and the semicolon so then learn print comma join comma dot join or stop split semicolon dot split colon dot split com so that's a lot of splits so squish the words together all right oops me and save and then so did emerald diamond collapse and iron separated by by commas so remove the colon and the semicolon so another way to do this is to print replace or that replace the semicolon with comma and replace the colon with a comma split so let's say so it does the same thing as but it added the word replace that there is also no colon and no semicolon well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
