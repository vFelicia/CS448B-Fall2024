welcome to quitting with kids my name is andrew today we're in cod.org and this is the project i made called scary elsa and anna it's scary elsa let's see run from the scary elsa and oh no ah oh no there's attracting points two points okay now let's see how it goes so when run set actor one to baymax baymax is a character from big hero 6 and actor 2 to elsa which is from frozen and set actor free to hero which is from big hero 6 2 and set actor 4 to end another image so it's from frozen 2. then it will set a random background so it always have a different men have a different background it can be leafy grassy flower tile icy and snowy i couldn't choose which one so i chose random repeat forever move actor one random random pixels so after one can go up down left right or or random and it can go 25 50 100 200 or 400 pixels and i choose random so go so it'll go like random directions at random yeah pixels repeat forever move active for random and random it's just like actor one but just different actors no actor one actor four and actor two which is baymax anna and elsa you will move hero when up arrow pressed then move actor free up free actor free is hero so you need to move actor free then when down arrow it will move after free which is hero down when left arrow move after free left and right arrow it will move actively right so you can move hero with the arrow keys yeah when actor free touches actor one so when it touches baymax when he was touches baymax play win point two i didn't really like 1.1 so i choose 1.2 so it's like you get a point yeah it's a score point but over here you will lose points that's why it's called scary s and an honor so you shouldn't touch elsa and honor yeah when active3 touches actor 1 it will play win sound and score point but when you touch elsa he will touch elsa then play lose point no remove a point then when it touches on when hero touches on a 2 it will play lose 0.2 because there's two of lose point sounds so i use the one for elsa and one for honor and both of them will remove a point no he will he will say no i lost the point and baymax because baymax is a robot with a lot of armor okay i do it first who i need to get 10 points yeah cause they there's two evil people you got two points three points two points three points two points two points one point two point one point yes so like they can like go by you then like turn and like chase you yeah you don't know they're not coded actually to chase you there's just the code is said to go random and big max can also go where anna and elsa is so you can't get the points when baymax is in your aunt yeah you will just subtract points and get points so if you go near both of them you'll basically stay on the score you have right now yeah because you have the same score hmm elsa's kind of chasing you anna's looks like it's chasing baymax yeah elsa's always come to me on negative this is looking bad elsa i don't like elsa i killed i love that and i know because when i was little i didn't like them okay oh it's a different background oh yeah likes to stay together i don't like them i only like frozen two four four elsa wasn't chasing you oh no i my high school is four points five points half more to go oh shoot five points when they stop this show a little pose i wanna do this and baymax they really always have a different kind of pose so whenever andrew stop touching the arrow keys he will have some pose standing right there i wonder what's baymax but i can't control baymax well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the foot and subscribe bye bye
