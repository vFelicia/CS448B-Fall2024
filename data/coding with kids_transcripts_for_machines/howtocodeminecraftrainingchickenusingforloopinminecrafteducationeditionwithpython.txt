welcome to kids my name is my name is andrew today we're on minecraft education edition so today we're going to learn about repeat loops so first i'm going to create a new world so okay okay on top of the tree oh we take flat damage okay okay so first we're gonna do coding so we're going to do chicken rain chicken rain everywhere so it says let's get started with coding in minecraft why not add some life to your world maybe a chicken no let's have lots of chicken so in this picture you see a bunch of chickens yeah raining from the sky so let's start so that says put and and on chat command and rename it to chicken so on checkman so if you type whatever right now one but we need to change it to chicken yeah so when you type chicken in the chat it'll do whatever is inside here then we're gonna do put and spawn to spawn and chicken at your position so when inside the on chat command so the code under the on chat command will run when you type chicken in the minecraft chat zero zero zero is the relative 3d position of the players there's gonna spawn one chicken right where you are so it says change the spawn position to ten blocks above your player so like if you don't if you do zero zero zero the chicken is gonna spawn right where you yeah so this is where the person is and then the chicken is right here like you they're in the same place they're same person so the second number in zero zero zero means ten blocks above the player like where the player is the dash symbol means that the chord in it is a relative to the player so we're going to change the middle 0 to a 10. so it's the chicken spawns 10 blocks above the player not exactly where you are yeah go to minecraft press t in the to open the chat and enter chicken you should see a flying chicken chicken from the sky yes let's go to tea and type chicken chicken let let's go back to coding so next the chicken is lonely place a repeat loop around spawn to create a hundred chickens so if you don't have a repeat loop you need to like copy and paste it 100 times which is very tired or how many times you want to spawn that up so we're going to use a repeat loop to help us so we don't need to be so tired after yeah so repeat 50 times so to spawn 52 this is well done you've completed your first mop so we're finish and then go to the chat and type chicken exit oh chicken is found on top of there again yeah so let's do it one more time chicken oh so much so much chicken like spreaded everywhere yeah so let's go back oops to the coating so now i'm going to show you in python how it looks like it yeah so it says def on on chat for index and range 50 go do mobs dot spawn chicken position 0 10 0 so it'll spawn chickens 50 chickens above your head and play on chat chicken on on chat so it's a pie from version of the block yeah it will do the same thing okay so now let's have some fun so we'll put it back to blocks and we can spawn different animal how about a villager 50 villagers let's go back go to t like chicken oh shoot they all take damage yeah there's so much there's so much villagers different kind they're in the pond they're all in their ponds and playing yeah all different kind of villagers there's so much there's even baby villagers yeah little cute baby villagers now let's change it again okay one last time what should we do it to hmm parrot favorite okay there it's going to fly in the sky faster to android types chicken and attack wow oh oh see they spit out there's a lot of different kind wow so pretty there was the village i see a villager holding an emerald yeah that was so cool oh they're all like hanging out they're all crowded together yeah and there's a chicken right there so much bubbles a lot of things are in it yeah and moving yeah you put you push but they still like it yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
