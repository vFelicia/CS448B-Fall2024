welcome to puddin with kids my name is kalia my name is andrew today we're a minecraft education edition and we're going to do the tutorial in microsoft make code so we're going to do lava tower make a lava flow down from the sky look at when it gets close so right now we see like an image of it's all of us floating there be careful so you don't get like burned by the lava except if you're in creative mode hey let's try something dramatic this tab tutorial makes a lava tower it stole his descent from the sky and then our command waits for it to flow to the ground you can then add some water to cool the lava you're going to use a paws loop to add some wait time and let the lava reach the ground before cooling it down so right now we see a lot of um stone towers then here water and leaking onto lava those are stone towers because like when the water goes on the lava it'll make it into stone so it's basically so after like this it will become one of those yeah okay put in and on chat command and rename it tower so do this on chat command tower using place put a lava block in the sky 20 blocks above you so block place lava 5 then 20. so it'll be 20 bucks above you because you don't want the lava to be right where you are you'll get burned yeah use another place to add some water to cool the flowing law we want to make sure the lava has time to flow all the way to the ground before the water reaches it so make the water up appear very high in the sky 135 five blocks above you so we're gonna go to box i'm gonna try to talk water right there and we need 5 105 5 135 so spawn above the lawn okay get rid of the water use a pause of 1000 milliseconds add a place with air to dry the water you do after do pause policy yeah pause 1000 milli seconds done yeah place air five okay go to minecraft type teach open the chat and enter town don't move though lava water and air need to fall from the sky at the same position near you it will take some time for the lava to cool and for the water to dry be but be careful lava can be destructive okay now i'm going to stay in the platform so death on on chats chance doesn't function black stop place lava pushes in twenty five twenty zero then it'll place water above the lava then it'll pause for a thousand milliseconds then it'll block stop place air at where the water is and then play that on chat tower and you touch tower in the chat it'll run the function so we need to type tower and don't move listen don't move okay i can see the water the water is actually pretty pretty hot and the water is pretty fast too gets gets into the lava it survives no matter what yeah the watercolor i don't think the um yeah it's not coming stone it's not going to reach the ground oh it reached the ground wow okay let's see what is is the water drying yeah yeah it's just peeling then here there will be nothing until the lava and then it'll be a stone top when you wait wait wait the water flow into the big lake well the swamp chicken and sheep are going for shape poor shape i'll say poor sheep chicken escaped they both look good now it's a clean tower stone and it's still cleaning those walls because um after the root first source of the water all the other water will just disappear like evaporate now let's switch the water with the lava and the lava with the water in the code so back to the box we're gonna see what happens if we change the lava to water and the water to lava now the water is coming down oh it's gonna be very fast get off the ground you can barely see it the lava is gonna be very very slow i think we should change to 135 to do this because the the water stopped the water stopped excuse me mr lava how long are you gonna is it still one block yeah let's do one walk i don't think it's gonna ever float down just one flat piece of block oh it's going down it's going down but you can't see the other oh because the air block because the air block the air block is faster than the lava so it's evaporating the lava we should stay the air position and change the lava position so it'll like change the 135 to 50. don't give it more time this to let's find my box 140. okay now let's try again i hate those holes in minecraft just splashing through them if you're not looking away okay let's go on fire okay i don't want to what we're on fire oops water okay close okay let's wait look at the other lava right there only okay he's almost reached it and then the whole wall up here because that was a source block oh yeah so immediately destroyed the whole water that's what it does now there's there's a lava oh no now the lava is gonna go on the ground no it's not gonna reach the water now all the water's drying no more water disappear oh no what do we do level's gonna spread everywhere okay what does it do okay it just spreads around spreads around uh we need a place block to stop the blah blah i'll make a hole i made a hole okay they're smart enough to make a hole that you think you know these blocks no where's the air block i want to see the air block still it doesn't didn't reach it yet you see it's 140 blocks high don't think let's go go into the lava are you dropping down yeah i don't know it's all red we dropped very slow i think yeah because lava was slow maybe if you're in survival mode you find like a lava and night when you don't have torch it might be a good source of plant but be careful for burning yourself and then well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
