welcome to curtin with kids my name is kalee and my name is andrew today we're in scratch and in my account kit deco one two three and this one the projects i made called polo bear in the hair because there's one polar bear and one here their name is that so let's see what it does hmm playing music no stop music let's see the code to how it does that so this is a hair so when green flap clicked forever so when you click so that means you start the project it will forever if right arrow press that means if you press the right arrow then it will move five steps point in direction 90 so it move right and if key left it will press then move faster point in direction negative 90. so you it will the hair will move left so this you're like programming like how to move the hair yeah so it is the same for down arrow up here except the diamond area is pointing direction 180 so it'll go down and up arrow is point direction zero so you can go up so if forever it's touching polar bears so if the hair is touching the polar bear then it will say hello polar bear because they touched each other for 0.5 seconds that isn't even one second it's half of a second so this is the polar bear so it's like you control it the same except you use w yeah so this is gonna be a two player game then one green flag kick forever so it's if it's touching here it will say hello hair not like the hair saying hello pull a bit because they have nice manners i like the heart this backdrop there's a lot of music so first when green flag clicked forever change color effect by 25 wait 0.1 seconds so keep changing changing color look even the heart is changing the not the same color so then anyhow sounds music when f key press play sound dance magic so it sounds it's a song i have a lot of song here i don't know why i play so much song when f it will play dance magic b dance funk key the boss nova when stress space it will stop our sound so we'll stop the music m dan slomo uh what's this c classic piano my mom likes that one h chill so let's save it okay now let's see i'm gonna control the hair i'm the polar bear i'm upside down why yeah you can be upside down and you can't even go out of the screen you can't i mean no okay let's kind of play tap okay so who is it i've got you you're right because when you sing when they say something that means they touch i don't know i got you my turn i thought you went your turn i got ya no no no no no okay last one i got two dude there's a lot of music yeah i always don't remember the keys try to give me try to get me try to get it okay that was fun they always say hello polar bear when they touch i have no idea why so it's like a simple version of a two player game right but you can do any game you want yeah that's cool it's changing color almost like always yeah that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
