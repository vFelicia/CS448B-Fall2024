welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and mine was andrew today we are in scratch and in andrew's account starring snatch cat so today i'm going to show you my project dino dance so as you see the name is dino dance and you see dinosaurs so you know dinosaurs are going to dance so this is a dinosaur i got from the scratch library and yeah let's show you what the project does yay okay now let's show you the code so it was made the dinosaur 4 is the blue one so i changed it blue and it was original one of these green dinosaurs and so the code is when right arrow pressed key pressed point direction 90 and moved 10 steps so you'll go right and one left arrow key press point direction negative 90 and move 10 steps so you go left so when green 5 click that means when you run it then your set rotations start left right so left and right automatically then if forever move ten steps then if on edge bounce so bounce if it touches the edge then also when green flag clicked forever switch costumes to dinosaur for c which is this one the original costume and then what wait 0.5 seconds and then switch costume the dinosaur for d so it's this one this is kind of like a dancing costume and wait 0.5 seconds and like switch costume again so that's how so you can control the blue dinosaur then the dinosaur three does dinosaur two dinosaur free and dicey now five all have the same code so like i duplicated the sprite and i tried the code to them and added the same code to it so let's see the code of dinosaur two so when green flag clicked set rotation style left right so it's just like the blue dinosaur and then move ten steps of an edge bounce so that's the same as the blue dinosaur so it'll like go left and right and i'll also keep changing costumes over here just like the blue dinosaur but you can't control so like it just goes randomly yeah but you can control the blue diamond so that's the same for dinosaur two there's three and dinosaur five but there's no dinosaur five four so then the speed oh the dinosaur say party for two seconds and then the other speaker to well when green flag clicked wait two seconds because the other speaker will will talk for two seconds so after the speaker the other speaker is done talking then it'll say yeah for two seconds like the party spirit no look this is speaker one blah blah blah blah blah blah it's like there is talking this one is the this ballerina so when green flat clicked forever repeat three times this costume to ballerina a which is this one the like is standing and then wait 0.5 second switch costume to ballerina d so which is this one so it's like dancing and then it will repeat this three times and then it will repeat this two times which costume to ballerina a which is a standard costume and then wait 0.5 seconds and then switch costumes to ballerina b which is this one step up to dump yeah and then when up arrow key pressed you switch costume to ballerina c which is this one so it jumps up and one grief down arrow key pressed you'll switch costume to ballerina b so go down and like it's bending starting to jump so then the other one which is here the other ballerina when you can also control it with up arrow and down arrow keys and when green flag clicked set rotation style left right and then switch costs new to ballerina b which is this one wait three seconds then point in direction zero then move 50 steps and switch costume to ballerina c which is this one so jump and then break it down yeah and wait 0.5 seconds point direction 180 and move 50 steps then it'll go back down again so now let's play it and the background wait the background it green flag clicked forever change color effect by one so change color very slowly and then wait 0.1 seconds and keep changing color then when green flag clicks forever play sound dance around so it's a sketchy song i got from the scratches collection of songs so now let's do it i'm gonna go first yeah you're controlling the blue one yeah but i always change color i mean costumes as the same as the other ones yeah now let's do up arrow now the both valley rings are jumping down arrow now they won't get down up there yay yay yay yay does that oh the color changer yeah and when you see speakers are talking already yeah and the background is taking color it's like so cool and the dinosaurs are bouncing
