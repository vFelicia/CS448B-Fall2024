welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edible is a coding platform where there are lots of coding problems you can solve using different coding languages So today we're gonna do three easy coding challenges using python so our first coding challenge is called reform the word a word has been split into a left part and a right part we form the word by adding both Halls together chaining the first character to an uppercase letter so for example here there are two parts of a word C's and oh no so the actual word is seasonal so we had to combine these two parts and capitalize the first letter so first we have a function called get word with two variables the left and the right parts of the word so first we're going to join them together to make one word so we're going to do word a new variable equals left plus right so now we have the actual word but we still have to capitalize it so next we're going to make a word two variable with word.capitalize so the capitalize function will capitalize your the first letter of the word so then finally we're going to return the word to variable so now that some test cases there are lots of words this is far well there is fair and then well and then because capitals capital F and then far well and this person oh no so it's personal with a capitalized P okay so we pass all our tests onto our next coding challenge so our next coding challenge is called count syllables create a function that counts the number of syllables a word has each syllable is separated but with a dash so you can see here it will give us a word separated into syllables and it will be separated by dashes so we can use these dashes to our advantage so first we have a function called number of syllables with with a variable called word so first we're going to count how many syllables there are occurrences equals word account the dash plus one so I figured out that the number of dashes is how many syllables there are but you have to add one so example beautiful that's three syllables but there are only two dashes add one to make it three same here Monumental that's four syllables with three dashes in it so now the cow function will count how much of whatever you put in here in this case we put a dash is in whatever you put here which is the word so then we're gonna add the number of dashes in the word plus one to get the number of syllables finally we're going to return our variable occurrences so now let's see the test cases there is overly again there are two dashes and three syllables so we add one to get three and flew it one dash two syllables so one plus one equals two so we pass all our tests onto our final coding challenge final cutting challenge is called convert number to corresponding month name create a function that takes a number from 1 to 12 and returns its corresponding month name as a string for example if you're given 3 as an input your function should return March because March is the third month so we here we have the list of the numbers and the month names so whatever number out of 12 is whatever number whatever month when you get for example if we get the number eight we have to return the string August because August is the eighth month yeah okay you can expect only integers ranging from 1 to 12 as a test input so you don't have to worry about a number that doesn't have a month with it so first we have a function called month name with a with a variable called number which is the number we are given from 1 to 12. so first we're going to do if number equals equals one we're going to return January so we need two equal signs because if you only have one equal sign it's assigning something two equal signs actually means equal to so if number is one we're going to return the first month with January so then we're going to do the same with all the months and numbers from 1 to 12. here it's going to be very long code remember to use else if not else so else if num equals equals two we're gonna return February and do the same for all the months and the last else if you can also change it to an else else return December because if it doesn't have one to eleven that means it's 12 so you can be sure that is it December because there aren't no numbers over 12 or under one so this is very long 25 but it's just the same like same repeating the same thing except just different numbers and different yeah so now we're gonna check it and see the test cases so there is one to twelve and all the months okay so now all tests are passed well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash that button and subscribe bye bye
