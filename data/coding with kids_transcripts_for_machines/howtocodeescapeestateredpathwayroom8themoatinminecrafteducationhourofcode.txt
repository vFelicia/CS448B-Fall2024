welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in mft education Edition in the hour of code Escape estate so in the last video we opened the red door and now we're going to go through let's go loading it's the NPC NPC bye bye okay agent wait before you go I need to tell you one last thing this house is filled with Escape rooms you need to find clu solve puzzles and fix code to make your way out press C to reveal puzz the code run the code to see what happens if there are errors fix the code and run it again to test it that is called debugging sometimes Solutions won't be clear and not all puzzles take code to solve when you find a puzzle remember to run the code first to see what's wrong that the bug and fix the faulty code it's much easier than writing code from scratch keep an eye out for Clues such as particles to help you guide you okay let's go let's search room for particles right there right here a it's a it's a ender he has diamonds at okay let's see to see what we have to do draw a bridge the Enderman B needs your directions to get across the river please direct them to use their magic to teleport to the diamond block then have them move forward then move into position to pull the leather to let down the drop Bridge use a Teleport Enderman to Diamond function to get the Enderman across the river then use move Enderman forward function to position the Enderman in front of the lever and pull lever down function to pull the lever the Enderman Butler will automatically turn to face the lever when it's in the correct position so let's see the code example it moves the butler forward two times and oh it can't go touch the water so there's the diamond block right there and it has diamonds over here that means I can teleport so let's see what we have to do first let's see this this one okay it can't go into water so it can't move forward two times so let's see what happens if we don't move forward two times you still have move forward it's teleport okay move one extra step yeah oh still flip the switch S oh that was debugging the code okay so now we can go across the drawbridge thank you BL oh it can move oh hi Butler inside here we have a maze okay search room for particles it opened the door so iron doors can only be opened with lovers okay so let's see let's try to open all the CCT door okay so there's a the first purple one so let's try that but then we have to open all the doors and use code to move it forward have to open certain doors yeah so yellow and blue and then we have to switch the yellow one and then we have to switch the blue one so let's see code first maze direct the Enderman Butler to the emerald blocks on the other side of the maze the lover on the walls seem to have a color that matches a set of doorways in the midst you should flip these levers to create a safe pth path to direct the end Butler through to the emerald blocks they use the move Enderman direction direction function to help na navigate them through the mze okay so you can move it forward back left and right okay let's see switch oh you can't switch it it's a a correct path okay so we could go to open the blue yeah but the yellow blue okay let's still the blue one okay so this is a correct path you can go through the pink green pink and then blue okay so let's see we have to move for one two three four five times then move right one two three so move forward five times is first you can also use a repeat so we're going to do four I in range five times move forward forward and then for I in range three times we're going to move Ender spelled it wrong oops Enderman direction we're going to move right so let's see okay in the middle and then it goes across so now going reach the Pink Door so we have to move it one two three 4 let's see so it's over here one two three four and then left three times so move forward again for four times move Enderman Direction forward oops and then left three times move under Enderman Direction left okay so let's test this okay go okay now it has to move for one 2 three four four times four times do move direction for now we're going run the cook okay Butler goes through okay we got it puzzle saw so now it's super big but it still went through now it's com back out okay let's see here ooh light nothing he's putting the lights back on okay let's see there seems to be a pattern with the way the lights are flashing move the Enderman to each position following the pattern the light are making use the move Ender function to choose which color platform to the Enderman moves to so there's green yellow blue and pink so let's see the the code which is green then yellow green then yellow and that is wrong so let's see the pattern okay so it's first yellow then green yellow green okay so let's try that yellow then green so change this to yellow and then green now it should fix the lights okay now we have another part to do you have to do it again so blue green pink blue green and pink okay so let's do that again blue oh Green's right then move end Pink So now let's run it and it should get the second pattern blue green then pink okay now we have the last part so it's green yellow pink blue so green yellow pink blue green yellow pink wait it's pink it's go yellow and then blue blue okay go green yellow pink and then blue okay that's so soft no lights are disappearing and there's an portal to the next room so in the next video we're going to enter say bye to the butler next time hi Butler okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember smash the like button and subscribe byebye
