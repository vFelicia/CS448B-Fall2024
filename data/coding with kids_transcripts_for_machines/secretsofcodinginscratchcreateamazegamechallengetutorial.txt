welcome to quitting with kids my name is my name is andrew today we're in scratch and andrew's account starter scratch so starter scratch cat is an account for like easy scratchers and easy projects so today i'm going to show you my game maze game so it's a easy making yeah so this is for star scratch yeah so it's like starter code people so if you don't know much about code you can see my project and start a scratch cat so first there's this my sprite the orange cat so it's basically the scratch cat so it's the character the movie so when green flag clicked that means when you run it then set level to one so here's a variable level so it tells you what level you're on and then go to front layers that means it's right here that means this is the beginning of every maze and then set size to 15 so it's small enough to fit through the passages yeah and then go to x 10 wide minus 170 so that's also the start and then forever if key up arrow press and then change y by four if so this is programming um to move it with your arrow keys and then if touching maze then change y by negative four so it'll like you'll bounce off the maze so if you did not have that code in each of the arrow pressed then you can like simply go through everywhere and like you can go straight to the apple so yeah your goal is to get get to the apple and then another code is one great you can collect forever if punching apple that means your goal then place on cheer until then so that's the sound and say yay for two seconds and then go to 10 x y minus 170 so that's the beginning speakers so when you after it says yay it goes back to the beginning of the maze and then board has next may so it's a message and then change level by one so you go to level two let's go some mazes code so i uploaded the maze and look there's a little code so when green flag clicked switch costume to maze one so it's right now it's costume and then goes to x zero y zero so this big soul is like this and then when i receive next maze which is the message and nyx costume so costume there is eight costumes so that means eight levels okay then the apple so is this yeah and is one of the scratch sprites so i did not upload so when green flag clicks size to 25 and then goes to x minus 10 y 170 so that's right here and that's always where the end of the maze will be so now let's play so i'll play first so like you know because you played it already yeah played a lot of time so you know the answer is just like sometimes and then so when you're on level yay i don't know if the cat actually eats apples um okay see i can't go through the bags yeah because i programmed it to change y and change x maybe it may be a little bit tricky because you need to find the right time to press your arrow keys level 5. yeah okay go go go go nope this is stuck it's gonna go down oh yeah maybe you remember every where you need to go i usually add music to my yay i'm on level six now six pounds over there the way to the apple okay i'm level seven so this is the left the second second level in here sometimes it might be hard because like you can't go through the wall should you play it yes because this is actually using a lot of time i don't think you should play it yeah you won't play it you can play it sometime after and yeah i should play i'm in level eight okay yeah level nine is my turn because there is only one level you can't do all the mazes just do level nine which is basically level one because there is only eight maze costumes so there's only eight levels am i doing the right way oh yes yes i think so okay there you go you're telling me the way to eat the app the delicious apple thank you for watching remember to smash the like and subscribe bye
