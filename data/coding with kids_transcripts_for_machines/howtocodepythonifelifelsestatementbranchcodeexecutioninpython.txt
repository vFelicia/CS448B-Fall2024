welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python we're in visual studio code and today we're going to learn branch coding so first we're going to do a new file i'm going to name it branch coding dot p1 so first i want to make a value equals seven then if value equals we need two equal signs because one equal sign assigns something while two equals sign check if something equals something so if value equals seven you need a tab and then print value is wait my value is seven okay print okay now you press ctrl s to save what do you think it won't do i think it it will check if the value is seven then print value is seven then print finish i also think it too let's go to terminal and type p y branch coding dot p one let's say it's value of seven finished next we're gonna add else so else current the value is not seven now let's save it and what do you think it will do now well the value is equal seven so it will do the if it will print the value is seven okay let's change the value to six and save it now what do you think it will do i think it will skip the if then do the else print developers not 17 print to finish good now you can use the up arrow to copy what you last typed in since the value is not seven finished now we're going to add an alice oh this equals eight then i'm going to change the value to eight now save it and then do the end tab print the value is eight save it and now what do you think it will do if it will check if the value is seven if it's not um seven it will go to the elf then the value equals eight then it will print the vowel is eight descriptive else then go print finish i think so two let's do let's run it says the value is my goodness if clock blocks this is code block okay so first i want to do first that value equals true and then second second and u equals six goes six and then we're going to do f is first first value equals equals the first value in one minute got here we got here then print that here okay save it now what do you think it will do so the second number of value equals eight six i mean then it first back along first value equals nothing if second value equals eight six then print got here so i think the first value is true so that means it's basically meaning if true then it will do if second value equals six now print got here so i think it will just print got here this save it and then run it says got here and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe thank you for watching byebye
