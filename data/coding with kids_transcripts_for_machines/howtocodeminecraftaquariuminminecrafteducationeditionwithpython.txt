welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia is andrew today i'm on minecraft education edition and we're going to do one of those tutorials make microsoft record so in the a nice cozy aquarium for our reference we'll make it so our aquarium is built when we swing a trident add on item use your code and set the item type to try so the trident matches the aquarium because like the trend is supposed to be in water yeah so where's the trident uh a size of eight times eight protect my d hold enough specimen change default from position to five zero negative ten into position two twelve seven ten in your fifth be smaller than twelve at the negative 10. um i want to hold it and set the block type to water we only want to fill the inside of the aquarium so set the front position to 6 1 negative 9 and 2 position two eleven six nine so it's like very close to these numbers so we'll fill so we're gonna fill the case with water because clearly it's an aquarium so it needs water yeah so it's from six six one negative nine whoa that was a big chicken noise eleven six nine here's the oops and then nine okay the aquarium is ready to be populated well one more fish and coral living inside it so we'll need a repeat loop to create them off add one to the clothes how many times i don't know let's see more times let's start with the fish put in a sponge inside the repeat loop and change the animal type to your favorite fish okay so i'm not going to do um tropical fish because there's more types colorized tropical fish i'll pick random position inside the spawn and change the front and two positions to the same area as the water six one negative nine and eleven six nine random positions because we don't want all the fish to spawn at the same place so six six one negative nine eleven six nine drag a place inside the repeat loop and set the block type to your favorite coral drag a pick random position inside it and change the positions to six one negative nine and eleven zero nine three corresponds on the floor now we're gonna do the coral okay so we need a place we're gonna because we both like blue as our favorite color so six six oops yeah six one one negative nine it's always the same number eleven six zero oops zero nine so we didn't really bring your aquarium to life by adding more fish and coral in the repeat block to speed up the process copy place or spawn and insert when you're done go in game and use a trident to see your aquarium tanks so we're gonna just do the repeat more okay so how about 70. but that only will be 70 fishes and 70 corals which is defined on item interactive trident so that's the name blocks the fill glass position five zero negative ten position twelve seven ten fill operation that replace so this will make the glass cage or like tank then we're going to fill the water with the same command as the glass to put water inside the tank then we're going to do four index and range 70 repeat 70 times mob stop spawn tropical fish in random positions then we're going to do the same to the tube coral and then we're going to run the function when playing that on item interactive try so when we interact with the china so we're going to run the function yeah okay now let's do it okay so first we're gonna try to get a trident so we're gonna create it we recommend you to do this in creative because it's very hard to get a try for you let's set it here some of them are breaking even through glass because they're blaster i think too much it's pretty cool though but we have to change stuff here but still when you look inside there's lots of colorful fish right right we made two we made two because yeah because i didn't use it so that's why there was a holes and stuff so this is this is dry coral it's a dead one yeah but the chicken's like chicken has a chicken well there's still a lot of fish and floating corals okay um maybe we should add different kind of this one they're all gonna help okay let's go somewhere else so we won't here we don't want to follow me this is my choice i think yeah okay okay move over here okay we need to change some cold so go back to box so we first don't need the seven i don't want the same kind of fish so i think it will just spawn 10 of every fish how about 30 and 130 that would be too much okay so i'm add one more kind so let's do which one you still have these three yeah okay uh how about i like this okay fire coral and can we add um a dolphin dolphins yeah they're very big yeah all right one dolphin if you don't know turn it off or we could do it would be so funny on a panda in it if hannah was have a squid okay no i don't like squids sea turtles oh it's night time okay let's first make it in the morning first uh time day okay yeah so good thing the turtles are there there's like this glitch that the turtle spawns right in the glass i just tried to do it only one time away from but it's still very big so many turtles over here uh not much in the aquarium oh i thought i saw a fish like like being the waterfall turtles the turtles what well there's the chicken the chicken is getting wet and it's like there's black and white the chicken just got squished okay i don't think we could put one because if only we were a spider i mean the cave spider now we wow if we had night vision it would be like so much better i tried it when i went into like a ocean it was so good there's a lot of turtles probably a turtle or a fish turtle a fish oh i know turtle can't even go through on tight spaces like one block but you have to beat them now we're swimming i first fought one the tropical fish when we sank down it was a puffy fish this one the one that's right there this one because it's orange and it's like not moving it's really looks like a puffer fish to me oh we stand down no no or via turtle what fish i think we're a fish to say some land brooklyn aquarium with coral most fish just went out because they're more little yeah yeah the turtles too but they're like is this grass i want to go to sand but there's no water here yeah oh this is so weird well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching
