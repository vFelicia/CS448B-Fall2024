welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today i'm going to show you how to make the aliens underscore books game so first we have four variables aliens books score and spells so aliens is six books is 10 score is 111 and spells is six so first we have if if books is more than aliens print overpowering magic books so books are basically our magic books which help us defeat the aliens so right now books is more than aliens which is 10 over 6 so we're in a run so it says overpowering magic books let's see what happens if we change the 10 to a 5. okay now i'm gonna run it again so nothing happens because books is less than aliens but it's a print overpowering magic books we need books to be more than aliens okay so next we have books equals four so we restate the variable books from 10 to four if score is more than 110 and books is more or equals to four then it will print past level so our score is 111 which is more than 110 and books is more or equal to four so books is four so yeah no print past level so we're gonna run it again so it says overpowering magic books because over here we did not restate the books variable yet so over here books is still um 10. so it also says past level okay so next we're going to do if spells is more than five no print you gained the title protector so it's like an achievement in a game so like you get to like earn a title and like yeah like those like you achieve it and then you get to name yourself like that so if spells is more than five i'll print you gain the title protector so here we have six spells so it's like spells or things you collect along the adventure so you can gain achievements okay you're gonna run it again like it's xp yeah okay now we also have you gained the title protector okay that's a big achievement okay so next we have game over equals false so it's a variable so if game over equals equals true i'll print a game over else it'll print play on so right now we have game over equals false so run the else print play on so now it says play on so you still have lies left so if we turn it to true okay it's going to run the end so it's game over so you restart okay finally we have aliens equals two so we rename it from aliens equals six in the beginning of the program to aliens equals two so now we defeated four and then so far overpowering magic books so if aliens is more than one it will print a spooky is there still aliens left else if aliens is more than zero which can be only one because when you do two that is more than one so it'll just print spooky it won't go on to the else if or the else so if the alice can only be run if your aliens variable has the value of one if there's only one more alien it'll print get that alien because then you will pass the level this is the final level if you have zero aliens so you defeat all the aliens uh it'll go to else print congrats so i'm a master yeah you're a pro gamer so you finished level okay so first we have aliens equals two so print spooky because the variable is right now two which is greater than one so if we do one which is good one the elsewhere get that get that alien okay so if we use our magic books again or use our spells we'll get the aliens down to zero now congrats and then you continue on the game changing the variables yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
