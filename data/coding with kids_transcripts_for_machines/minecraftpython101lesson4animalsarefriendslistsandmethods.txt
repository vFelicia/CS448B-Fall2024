welcome to curtin with kids my name is kalia and my name's andrew today we're in minecraft education edition so we're in python 101 lesson four so first we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says hi there it's good to see you again i'm afraid that we will be needing your help once more we're developing software for an animal hospital so that they can take better care of animals with this software the better enerians will also be able to work on a larger number of animals at once using complex sorting code that we are developing okay so we're going to help eco so first i'm going to talk to the developer so the developer says hi would it be possible to get your help i need to write some code that will make a list of these animals and spine them in the correct pans however animals keep ending up in the wrong patterns can you write some code i'll miss each of these animals and spawn them in the correct areas okay so let's see first write some code in a list named my list of the animals going from left to right in the minecraft world place four more spawn mob by position commands after one that's already given use the information from the science and depends to complete these commands so first we are gonna do a list called my list okay then see so first there's cow and pig okay it goes cow cow pink okay and this there is sheep and horse okay then lastly there is a rabbit rabbit bunny yeah it's going to rad okay so this is our list then we are gonna do let's see so first we're gonna go to pen we're just gonna go to location number two because it already has location one okay so what depending on we have okay so we're gonna copy this one then we're going to paste it so we're going to change the location 1 to location 2 then we're going to have minus 2 so we're going to change to 0 to 2 because states which place in the list we want so here we have two which is sheep because it's zero index so it starts with zero which is cow one in pig two sheep and so on okay next we are going to do flip for locations free so now i'm going to go to the kitchen tree so i need my list four so i'm gonna change the location one to location three and then change to zero to four now we're going to do it for location four we're gonna change the location one to location four and then goes to location four so we need my list one which is the pink yeah finally we're going to do it for location five we need my list free change to five and change this to the screen so now we're show it correct so now i'm going to go to activity two one talk to the veteran so she says could i ask for any help these dogs have specific dietary requirements about what they can and can eat however i'm having some problems with the machine as opposed to make their food you write some code to make the food machine work okay so first we go here so it says give the first of everything that's already in the poor defined list by changing the values of the first four places block our position commands so that they each place in order one of the items in the list then give the food from the chest to dog number one okay don't wanna do dog food zero dog food one dog food two dog food three and finally dog food four now all right okay let's do this machine okay so we don't need vitamins right now okay now we're gonna wait for the chest and now open chest so we're gonna drag these if there's food beef and chicken into our hot bar and then we're gonna go to the first dog and we're gonna drop these down okay so the dog is hungry so when you run this again to give it more food okay okay now i'm gonna remove it again biscuits beef and chicken okay so i'm going to repeat some more okay so i'm going to pull it up so dark one is but it's done so now we're gonna go to dog two okay so now we're gonna do nyx give the second dog everything that's already in the list with additional vitamins added do this by doing by using the append method to add the variable vitamins to the end of the list then change the value of the last place of block please block a position command so that it places the vitamins in the machine then give the top food to dog number two so now after this we're going to do dog food dot append so i'm going to append vitamins so here we add the vitamins bowl into dog food then you're going to do or paste it somewhere going to copy this and then do this so we're going to change this to 5 which is vitamins so now so really the machine will give every single thing or dog too okay these biscuits so we added vitamins beef and chicken yeah okay so now let's go deep dog too and drop these now we're going to do it again because it's still oh it's always in different like order yeah and chicken is always glass and beef too okay okay so now we are done feeding dog too and now we need to dump three dogs through okay so now we are going to do give the third dog everything that's already in the list but but with no beat do this by doing the pot method to remove their little beef from the list and give the dog to dog number three so we're gonna do here dog food dog food.com so i'm going to do the pocket pop function and prophecy one because there's no b so zero base is zero then one is beef so now we're running okay so now there's no b so the rest the block doesn't go to redstone because we don't need b so now there are only vitamins biscuits and chicken yeah so there's nobody um i think no they all need chicken bone and biscuits okay okay so now i'm gonna feed it one more time right here okay now we're done feeding the donkeys now we're going to go to last activity to take the test so we're going to talk to the data scientist so the data scientist says sorry to bother you could i get your help i'm trying to make three pieces of code that will sort these cats means this will make it easier for vegetarians to keep track of which cat is which however the names again in the chat doesn't don't seem to be the correct ones can you help me by writing code for these for three different cases so first let me go to number one change the last name last cat name snowy to shadow which cat what cat is now in this position five okay so it says set the last name in the list to cast now to to now equal the string shadow change the value inside the say command so it's so that it displays the last name in the list then press the select a cap on and choose a cat shown in the chat so cat names patterns this one then we're going to see zero one two three four five i'm gonna do five equals we're gonna do shadow then we'll let's see in the chat so it's just chat so i'm gonna press this button which they select cat and then we can put the button on what which cat we need select which is shaft so this is shadow and last name and press the button so now it's correct and shadow appear golden blocks like now we're gonna go to number two show the list of the cast name automatically which what cat is now put let's position three so first let me change the five to a three and then one two three so it says sort the list of cat names alphabetically using the sort method then change the value into the same command so it displays the fourth name in the list then press the select cap cap button and choose the caption and chat so i'm going to do cat names it's cat noise dot sort and do the sort function to sort of alphabetically now we're going to do three okay now let's see so now we're going to do this again let's see which one is salmon smokey or you know sammy correct so now she's here and shadow's gone okay now i'm gonna go to the last one now reverse the order of cat names what cat is now in this position three okay so i want to keep this the same and okay reverse the list of cat names using the rest method keep the same value inside the c command then press the select a cap button and choose to catch one in the chat so i'm going to go here and do cat names and do another cat names dot raise verbs so this is the reverse function which will reverse the order of the value of the values inside the list so now we're on one see you soon princess select the traffic games which means princess smokey oreo sammy rockets everywhere because we finished it now we're going to the elevator and we can press this so now we're at the beginning again well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching
