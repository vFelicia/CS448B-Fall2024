welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python today we're going to learn about dictionaries so first we have three dictionaries one called common moths boss mods and uncommon mods so we have the keys as minecraft mod names and then the value is the number of the attack hearts so then we're going to print creeper in commonwealth so it'll print true or false depending if we have creeper key in common mobs let's check so there's a creeper key so pretty true so the true just as i predicted next we're going to do if creepers not incoming moms they don't print it is not here so creepers is not in common laws which means this is true because we only have creeper without the s four esses so print it is not here so it prints it is not here which means creepers is not in common then we have three empty dictionaries called mobs mobs one and mobs two then we're gonna do so this is version one moms.update common moms moms dot update uncommon mobs and then boss then we print mobs so using the update function we can add these free dictionaries into the dictionary mods okay so it added all three dictionaries into mobs so this this version number one of adding dictionaries into another dictionary is okay if you have a few dictionaries because if you have a lot of dictionaries you keep copying and pasting then there's number two you do for each group which is every key and value and then our free dictionaries then we'll do mobs one dot update groups so get the groups from these three dictionaries which is the three dictionaries into our dictionary mobs one so i'm going to create mobs one so now it did the same thing but yeah so this is the other way then we're gonna do number three mom's two so this is the fairway mobs two equals star star common mob star star and common maps and star storm boss mob so star star is unpacking and merging the dictionaries into a dictionary so we're going to print mobs too so it also did the same so no version number three is the best and because it does the least code to add dictionaries into a dictionary if you have more than two dictionaries well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
