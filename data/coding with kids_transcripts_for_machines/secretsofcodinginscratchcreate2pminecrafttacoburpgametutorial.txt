welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're in andrew's account in scratch techno468 so today i'm going to show you my remix called minecraft taco burp so originally it was a taco burp so now let's show you it it's a cloud server so i'm playing on the ipad so we so there can be up to eight players per game hmm where's kalia hmm oh i know where you are hey try to catch me taco taco taco okay so let's see what i changed so there's the player so i got these like steve so yourself when you play you are steve the other people are alex yeah so i got the head it was supposed to be a scratch cat yeah so i changed it into the steve with the body and the head it was kind of hard to only get the body not the head you have to cut it off and then the player body so i got the original body and then this is with the the glider and i the glider is another image and i had to like paste the glider on top of this body to make it like this and then the opponent is alex head and body it was kind of easier somehow to get the body because people cut the head more often and then there's the ultra it looks pretty which is the collider yeah and then yep i put the ultra on top of alex so like the body and head of steve are from different images and so like it might look weird so i changed the um code and yeah let's play tacos yeah which you can get damaged from yeah you only get damaged by other persons taco but not your taco because see the head looks kind of weird yeah especially when a vloggy body goes away and you can recover health yeah over time without being damaged you're covering your health is pretty good when you don't have any health but you can also damage your opponent when you're about to explode so your score is the damage you've made to the other part me no we got double eliminated but the other people's tacos are kind of like orange i was too close too when you're playing this game when somebody's about to explode don't be too close are you guys yeah even if you don't have the full health it's what i if you see your score increased that means you're hitting someone if you see your score decrease that means you're getting dude yeah this is sometimes hiding in the corners well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
