welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in scratch and andrew's account techno468 so we're going to show you my project virtual pet care so it's a virtual pet simulator and it's based on a tutorial so i have my octopus sprite which is the pet so the backdrop is the ocean and so when green flag click go to 2 minus 25 x and minus 1 y so that's the setup and first let's show you it so it's playing the saw and it's called hello my name is octa so this is pet and there's a water bottle on a soccer ball a fish and here's the instructions so so there's also beer couples of hunger first and fun so i'm gonna go to the water bottle don't care about fun right now it can't make you die okay so this is my virtual pet simulator and this is the set of code so it goes to original place which is x y coordinates minus 25 x and y is minus one so it's right and right there at that position right now and i switched costume to octopus b which is the right now it's costume which is the original costume and say hello my name is octo i'm an octopus okay sounds like a broken robot i mean so now like is introduction and then when this sprite clicked repeat two times which costume to sing that's another costume where it's like right here it's like playing the p the drum right here okay then after yeah no after switching costume to sing it'll place that ocean wave and then wait three seconds then switch costume to coffee so it's like tired after it's done playing the drum and then say break ah and then play sound splash so this is the coffee is drinking coffee let me see it's drinking the coffee there's a problem yeah there was also pirate by dinner even okay so then when green flag clicked set hunger to zero forever change hunger by one wait five seconds so there's a hunger first and fun so you try to make the hunger for zero while the you try to make fun 10. if hunger or first reaches 10 you lose but if fun goes to 10 you win okay so setting hunger to zero and then changing hunger by one wait five seconds so each five seconds hunger will go up one okay first and foremost yeah okay so the button so this is like i did it in a different font and then if touching mouse pointer that means it's like my key is touching it or a mouse or you're if you're on the ipad or phone if your finger is touching it or if you tap it so before i ever do this and it'll just um show the words or the instructions for a few seconds let's go to the fish which is the food when this right click forecast food so it's a message it'll go to the octopus so the octopus will go to the fish so that's all for fish yeah but the octopus has a lot of code yeah so when you receive food that means the fish when you tap the fish now switch costume to artist b which is the usual costume and glide one second to fish that means it will go to fish for one second then place on chomp that means it eats it and then change hunger by minus one so hunger goes down and then wait 0.2 seconds guy one second to this original position so that's how you can feed the octopus let's go to the water bottle so when green flag collects first to zero then forever change first by one wait eight seconds so first goes up every eight seconds which is slower than hunger so it's not that like hard to win but hunger i wonder why we get hungry so fast okay let's go to octopus drink yeah so when i've received drink so which costume to octopus be just like the other signals or the messages and like the usual costume then glide one second to water bottle and then play some splash that means is drinking it and then change first by minus one so first goes down one wait 0.2 seconds didn't go to his original position and finally the soccer ball when green flag collects set fund to zero so zero then if fun equals ten then switch cost him to check that means lucky you win and then say you win thanks for playing for two seconds that means you won it you win if you reach the fun to 10 and then when this right click forecast play so play is the final message out of the free then when i receive play which cost them to the reasonable cost to glide one second to the soccer ball play sound fly off because it's like happy because it's playing soccer underwater and change fun by one so it goes up not like first and hunger because first and hunger oh they go up two but you try to get first and hunger down while you try to get fun up and then wait two seconds zero point two seconds then glide your original position then there's this bright one which is the virtual octopus pet like his name and then okay that's all okay now i'm going to try it first now it also plays a song the song is so crazy the first variable just went down and i also clicked it so so it went to the singing costume now getting coffee i'm gonna eat enough fish now to ate the fish and the hunger would went up so i played the sound chomp and i went down okay let's go to fun okay i'm gonna keep eating because i don't want okay i'm gonna go to clay water hunger hunger is like more dangerous so you keep your eyes on the variables because hunger will go up every five seconds while first goes up every eight seconds so here's the instructions and that's the name okay okay okay okay okay now your turn this is a little hard this is like every five seconds and five seconds come back so sometimes if you click before 0.2 seconds it'll like go a little bit toward its original position but then it will go to what you clicked because like you tapped it already so it won't actually go back versus zero versus negative one you shouldn't go through this don't focus on first is negative one sometimes if you click um first or hunger the the right time like every eight seconds and you press it on the each second it'll like not change because it was go it's trying to go up but you pressed it so it goes down here you wouldn't see there's a check mark i go to water i mean thirst then play then food and repeat forever okay and thanks for watching remember to smash the like and subscribe bye
