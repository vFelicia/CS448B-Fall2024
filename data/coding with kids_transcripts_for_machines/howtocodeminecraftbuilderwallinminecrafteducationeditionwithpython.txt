welcome to creating with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition and we're going to do on this tutorial so we're going to do builder wall so this is as the builder movement advance we want to leave new books set trace path for the builder and use mossy stone grips for blocks so let's go look at these fans and builder chase pack from mark with a stop mask stone block right here then we need to add builder move forward before the bill trace pass markless so like i'll make 20 yeah right we'll fall back 20 then build a place mark and doesn't move left by five now we're building the wall yeah then after builder placement we need a builder move forward by 20 so we have this here then build and move up by one up by one then turn builder turn left and yeah left left then build a stone wall that is 10 rows high by putting the builder movement action into a loop so we're going to repeat 10 times after the builder replacement yeah so we need a loop repeat four times put the move forward and the other one's in repeat 10 times and then put back the repeat after it do build and move left by five and build a pace ah code and look up to see your new wall okay so before that let's add some to this so i'll check a minute when we press wall then it will run this code and forever agent teleport to player so when we're in the right place we'll press wall then because the agent is always following you when you're in the right space and the agent is the right space you do it so let's first see python so def honor chat so builder that moved left so the builder will move left five times now build through that mark so it'll make mark then for index and range 10 so it will repeat 10 times builder that move forward 20 times bit that move up one time another turn left turn two times and then builder that trace path mostly stone bricks build that place air and then player on that on chat wall on one chat so when you type wall run the function then def on forever no agent dot teleport to player then lose stuff forever on forever so that's a repeat loop so first let's see where should i make the wall we're the agent keeps still applying to us that's a pretty good one yeah it's like you can't do this code to defend your kind of city or town from invaders okay now andrew's turn where do you choose oh there's a bee nest over there i'll build it into in the lake go into the lakes so you can block some water yeah uh the agent is following us up one last time when you try to do it it's gonna be wrong oh it's right there maybe it's up there oh is this one is it super close i thought this one the one we just created was in the yeah water so that's very confusing yeah pumpkin pumpkin let's make one final wall somewhere near the pumpkin yeah oh the agent isn't teleporting to us it made another wall over here so now there are three walls jumpers if you have super super jump you can jump over here oh yeah i don't think you can jump over here to the other wall if you were in survival mode you will die yes cool well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
