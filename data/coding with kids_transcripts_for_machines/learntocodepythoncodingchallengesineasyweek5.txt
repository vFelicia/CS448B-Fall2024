welcome to coding with kids my name is khalida my name is Andrew today we're in edible so Arabic is a clothing platform where there are lots and lots of problems you can solve using different coding languages So today we're going to solve through three easy coding problems using python so first our first problem is called reverse a list we're a function to reverse a list so there are instructions are very simple and here are the examples so it will give us a list of um numbers so here is one two three four and you reverse the list so we should return the list essays four three two one if it gives us a empty um list when you give them an empty list don't forget to return the result okay so first we have a function called reversed and a variable called a list called list without an I so first we're going to make a variable called reverse equals list that reverse so the reverse function will basically will simply just reverse a list and reverse its contents this is what we're supposed to do is very easy and then we're just going to return the list so this still works if there's an empty bracket but technically nothing will happen so we're going to check in because it's empty yeah we're gonna see the test cases so here there's three three so we basically return the same thing because there's nothing to reverse because the numbers are the same same for negative one negative one and negative one and then five six seven we reverse it into a seven six five so let's see console all the tests are passed yay now on to our second easy challenge then we're it's called find the largest number in a list create a function that takes a list of numbers return the largest number in the list so here's some examples so it'll give us a list of numbers all of them have well there's a different number of numbers in the list so there's one example is four five one and three we're gonna find the largest number in in this list which is five so we we need to return the number five and here there's 300 200 600 and 150 largest number is 600 so we need to return 600 expect either positive numbers or zero there are no negative numbers so now we're gonna we have a function called um find largest num with um a list called nums so first we're going to make a variable called largest and then we're going to use the function Max on the nums list so the max function well um return the largest number in the list so we're going to store the largest number in the variable called largest and then we're going to return that number in the variable largest so we're going to check and see the test cases so here there is 30 to 40 and 3. the largest number is 40 so we're going to return 40. another test case is zero one zero zero one so here there are two ones we just returned the one that is that comes first in the list but either way you just return one and we have 32 35 37 to 39 so the greatest is 39 so we return 39. so the console all the chests are passed let's move on to our final challenge so our final challenge is called return the first element in a list create a function that takes a list containing only numbers and return the first element so here is one just three we're gonna return one because of the first value that occurs in the list it is negative 500 0 and 50 we're going to turn negative 500 because it's the first element or value the first element is in a list always has an index of zero so that's a clue so first we have a function called get for first value with a list called number list so first we're going to do a variable called value and then equals number list which is the list the pop zero so pop is a way to um get a value will kind of remove a value but you can specify which value by getting the list indexed so here the first item as I says here always has an index of zero so we're going to do zero here to remove the first element and then we're going to store it in a variable so we can return it and then we're just going to return the variable value so let's now see the test cases here there's 75 675 5 and 100 so the the first number is 75 675 so we're going to turn that and then there is five two and three so we're going to return 5 because it's the first value so all the tests are passed hooray so all these challenges are included with lists yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
