welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew today we're a microsoft maker a game where you have a character which is going left and right very fast and then you try to shoot it to the basketball bucket and then so i added a timer so here's the code on start so set background image to a bachelor port so i drew it myself there's a one a little pixel so step my sprite to sprite i'm a person of kind player so your player is just a random kid i could once pass the ball and set my spread position to x 78 y 97 that's velocity to the x 150 and v y zero so it'll go left left to right keep going and then set my spray bouncing wall on so you don't want your sprite to disappear out of the screen and then set my sprite 2 to sprite um a yellow square of kind hoop so this is basically the basketball hoop and i set my sprite to position to x80 199 which is where the hoop is supposed to be and then on down button pressed set projectile to projectile basketball from my sprite with vx0 and v1 negative 100 so when you press the down arrow key on your keyboard you will shoot the mask the basketball and then on sprite projectile overlaps other spread of kind hoops so when your ball it's the hoop they'll play some buzzer there's like a buzzer beater and then game over and then you win the game and then forever change time by one so time is the variable i made so basically the timer then pause every second to add one more onto the variable and then forever if time equals 15 then play sound buzzer and game over lose we have a second limit to get a bucket before you lose okay so now let's play i'm gonna go first you win is it do you think it's too easy um um and so this is pixels per second so let's make it 200. oh it's very hot oh why oh your turn okay this time oh what was that okay i think spamming i'm gonna try it um from spamming yeah you need to keep pressing okay i can't do that many clicks at one time okay i'm gonna make it even faster let's try 300 okay i go five your turn i want to make i want you to make it 2 000. no i mean 1000 1000 how about that um one time for each one okay one thousand oh i go first you'll probably lose that's cheating spamming his channel okay now don't expand fine go oh this is so hard you're running out of time 50 seconds is long no you're not even close at least i need to stand how about you try not to spin i'm going to tell you super hard you are spamming i made it no you keep missing you keep doing the corners i made it okay is there a obviously that's way too fast you tried fine is there two thousand ten thousand five okay it's way too fast and way too fast first shot try well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash it up and subscribe bye bye
