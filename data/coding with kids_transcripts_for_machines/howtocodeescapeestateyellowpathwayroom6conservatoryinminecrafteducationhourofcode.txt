welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition and the auto code Escape estate so we went through the portal and now let's go see it's like a Garden Room gardening room with lots of plants okay so that's such room for particles right click particles okay button oh now there's a fountain the the fastest thing is kind of broken because there's broken uh blocks and it's leaking water okay oh it's a box missing I think the water isn't like I think the water is supposed to go here okay here maybe this is for planting mushrooms I think it's water supposed to go for I don't know okay so now let's see to code to see what we have to fix okay you need more water and it looks like those cracked blocks are leaking use the move cursor going into position the cursor over cracked block and then break block to break it and let the water flow into the canal okay so the cursor we have is right there with the orange blue magenta and yellow okay okay so we have to go break these blocks the ones that are broken with dripping water should be um yeah they should be broken so the wire would go through so let's go let's run this example so this is an example it won't work okay okay so this is the same you can also do for Iron Range to do uh the command multiple times it's the same command like it's the same thing except it's just in a repeat Loop okay let's see here so let's see what this does first okay go down and then okay so we do not need to break that block so this code actually works so I think we need to go yellow two more times yeah and it will be have to be before they break Brock okay so go we're just gonna make a we're just gonna make a loop here so it's gonna be easier so we're looking for eye in the Range four times four times and then remember to add the tab only tap the move cursor so it can only that command will be okay break the first one break the seconds okay now we need to go to the bottom so we go two times magenta and then one time blue and then break block times matchup from oopsies um magenta two times so we can reach it so then we have to move sir blue and then like break a block please can then break block break block okay now let's run it and then we should break up three out of four blocks so now we have one more last one so I think we should go blue one blue and then two oh two times blue and two times magenta okay so let's go back to code yeah okay and then two times magenta and then last but not least break block one first one but the water is going into there the holes so I think we need to repair the oh no holes in the canal stop the water from flowing into the garden fill those holes to help the water along I used to move cursive funky to position the cursor over a hole and then Place Buffs to fill it in okay so let's see this color basically repair okay so this code example first glow Gold Blocks okay so it did the first two and then one two okay okay let's see okay so let's also do loops and then now over here so let's see what this does first first one second one okay one okay so this is good we need to go orange and then Place block okay beautiful cursor Orange and place block place okay then we should be all done with two okay okay oh no oh wait go back to code oh you forgot to add it okay okay this should work one two three four okay so now we still have two more holes so blue blue and an orange place block and then orange and then orange Place black and orange place block place and the same thing oh yeah okay I in range two times and add tabs to both move cursor and face block okay now run it and ish brick okay okay one two three four five six it's not fixed it so now the water should flow all the way so now the four blocks is appear and it's going to the mushrooms oh the mushrooms are growing the mushrooms we can use all mushrooms medium Russian and big oh we're supposed to go on to wait oh whoopsies wow there's more flowers and we can water them okay let's see but let's see to see what we have to do then we have the cursor and we have these uh flowers the concrete blocks okay so let's see there's some pattern with these flowers figure out the pattern and plant the flowers in the empty dirt using the move Chrissy to position the cursor in the plant flower supplies to pull out so there's a pattern let's see um oh the flu red and yellow flowers so the I think the first row the wine with the blue flower is also possibly blue and then yellow and then the red yeah over there is a blue one yeah so let's do that are you sure only uh the dark gray the dark brown or the only the brown I think all of them okay okay let's go code example so code example red one a rose but we should plant the yellow dandelion back to cutting and then this is also blue and it will be way better okay so let's go back here and let's see no it's not it's showing us that the actually that row is blue this Rose yellow and this rose red so it's actually not okay here that should be good and then we have to repeat this how many times let's see uh so that will be wait plant file one two three four five five times no three one two three four five okay okay so now we need to move down magenta okay yellow okay let's go um move cursor magenta I am rage five times flower yellow and then we will have to do move for sure I think it's orange see check no it's blue oopsies you should be done with the first two rows okay so now we need to move magenta and then Red Bull yeah yeah oopsies let's go back here then move cursor magenta sometimes before I range five times plant flower red red and then we'll have to do move cursor yellow okay one should be done gardening wait oh each time we have a concrete blocks are also changing along with our flower okay let's see head overhead it looks so cool okay now we're done enter the next room where is the portal over here so let's see this again like this is really cool in my personal opinion I think there should be more torches near the mushrooms because it's very dark well it's really only lanterns here because like this Garden this is some Secret Life yeah I don't think uh Lanterns have that much delight yeah I know okay no next video well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
