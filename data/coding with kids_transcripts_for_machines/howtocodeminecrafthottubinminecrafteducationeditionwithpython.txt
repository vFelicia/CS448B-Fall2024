welcome to coding with kids my name is khalia my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition so today we're going to show you the example of hot tub so here it's basically going to create a little pool and you can add soul sand or which we are also going to do magma cubes under so you can make bubbles so hot tubs have bubbles because it's very hot so we're going to add salt sand first okay so on trackman manhattan so you can type hot tub in the chat to run this and then there's also number one so it's a variable so you need to type um a certain number after a hot tub so then it's going to fill with air from zero like clear this space first yeah so it doesn't matter what terrain you're in so from zero negative two to zero to number one negative two number one so you can type the number to see how big your pool will be if you don't type a number it'll just be one block which is very small and then after it fills up air it'll fill with on soul sand the same place where you did the ears and then you will fill with water one block above the um megalithic oils yeah so then we'll have a little pool okay okay now we're going to show you the python okay so def on a chat number one so it's a function you can type a variable um a number for the variable and the block spell the air and then you'll fail you'll clear out the space around you and then it'll block stuff the soul sound in the same position as the air and then it'll fill water right on one block above the source and to create the pool and then player downtown when you type hot tub in the chat it'll run the function now let's try it okay so it goes to chat type 12 let's do which number should we do 10 20 20. oh that's it oh it's because it's 20 by 20 yeah okay now bubbles everywhere and you keep bouncing up because um soul sand and water makes the bubbles go up yeah okay another little bubble look look like the item yeah it keeps getting um bubbles up and up yeah okay so now let's change it to magnitude and maybe try lava oh okay but not gonna be two and a lava doesn't do anything it's just be a marvel crew okay now and change your souls down to that like magical block okay so now i think the bubbles will be different now let's go somewhere else right here uh do it ten by ten i don't want to be twenty okay these twenties a little too big right near but it gets you down yeah now you're stuck and you don't want to suffocate if you're in survival so you need to go somewhere else yeah you get into the regular water on your ground but it's hard to jump yeah because it's sticky but we're in creative mode so we're not getting any damage we're only like watching the show of the like the water drops keep popping everywhere so here the magma cube makes the water sucking down over here it makes your bow um in real life i'll rather it's so stunning so fan it's so sad so i guess you often yeah you keep going up and down as well i'm gonna see if i can can ball myself into there i don't even know how to can up also so you keep bouncing here so it's a little dizzy here it's way more stable but you can get slower and there are water everywhere over your eyes okay we're gonna do a lava pool yeah so let's just fill with lava right here and that makes things fit just like with lava and i don't think a lot um like magma will do any effect because there's already yeah okay is it still sucking down yeah yeah i can barely wait how about getting a glass because let's see i'm like down there what glass and put it like through like in like oh yeah okay you can see food wait like near an edge see it's a magma still right there yeah this magma fits with lava so i don't think it gets burned because it's still fire yeah oh that's so cool it's still there and then when you break your glass like over here you put grass and then you go here you can get mad or like um you can watch the show well it's yeah okay it's cool i like lava better because it's more cool yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
