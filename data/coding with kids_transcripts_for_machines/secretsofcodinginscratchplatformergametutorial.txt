welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name's andrew today we're in scratch in my account kit.com123 and this is the project i made called q platformer then my first platformer because it's my first made platformer let's try it welcome to cute platformer watch out for spikes they can hurt you a man touch the spikes and two spikes and spikes spikes okay now let's see the curve so first is the player my right arrow key pressed change x by 10 so like move forward and left arrows just change x by negative 10 and your min up arrow key press repeat seven times change y by 15 repeat then repeat seven times change y by negative 15 because you need a jump then go down but if we don't have this it would just jump it would stay there oh no there is when green flat clicks which costume two costume wonders to costume all of them are flat one of them are like usable like right now so there will be a lot of codes on the line green flat click go to x negative 193 knit y negative five so it's like where the starting point is then forever if touching color green which is the grass change your y by 10 because you don't want it to like sink down we is touching color red then broadcast we start so there's this spikes in the lavas if touching yellow which is the jump the color of the jump repeat seven times change y by 20 and change y by negative 20 so it will jump higher that's why it's called jump and there is if touching color blue change y by 10 it will be in the end and the follow and there is the green flat click forever if upward arrow and key write a repressed repeat three times change y by 15 change x by 15. repeat three times change y by negative 15 and change x by 50. i need this code because if you just press the up arrow and the right arrow it will maybe do first up arrow like jump then go right when it reaches the ground because one thing you need you press the first so it's the same for the if up arrow and left arrow except the change x will be negative 15. when i receive next go to negative 193 y negative 5 which is its starting position when i receive we start go to x negative 193 y negative 5. just same like the when i received next when down arrow pressed it will switch costume to custom to wait 0.5 seconds and switch costume to costume one so and there's the follow fave and low i got the costume from another person project but the code i code so when grief and click go to x 36 y 28 somewhere over here hi forever wait pick random 5 to 10 seconds it will show then glide one second to x 36 y negative 10 height and go to x 36 y 28 so we'll like come down like follow low fade and follow and there's the spikes and levels when greenfield clicked go to 36 x 36 y y 28 switch costume to level one when i received next next costume so there's a lot of costumes due to what level it is so level one doesn't have any danger which is spike and lava level two have one spike and you because the code it will when it's received next it will next costume so after you touch the star you will go to the next level there's the star when we in flat click forever if touching player which is the cube broadcast next wait two seconds so broadcast next so if the player is touching the star it will block a snake so you will do the next level when great frog click go to x 20 x 217 y negative 72 forever next costume wait 0.1 second so i got the costume one this costume from the scratch library and i keep doing it for five times and then i like change the position and there's a backdrop the backdrop will say the word and the backdrop the background color and the ground the code is when i receive next next background when i wrangle without click switch backdrop to backdrop one and forever place down super mario bros which is a super mario bros theme song now let's play i will go first oh oh there's a spike no no no no that spikes yay that's a big spike yellow yay good yeah that's again well not so spiky that's a big spike yay bye bye again and again love faith and follow well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
