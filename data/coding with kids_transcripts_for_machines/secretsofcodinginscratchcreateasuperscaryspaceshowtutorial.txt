welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in scratch in my account kick that code one two three and this is one of the projects i made called very scary special at first it showed you ready to be scared by space okay now let's see how it goes that's a struck snakes lightning ghost skeleton bat okay now let's see how it works so first let's go to ghost ghosts is this one it says when greenfield clicks that means when you start the project it will switch costume to go c which is this one because ah the other one this one looking this one's going away this one's just staring this one is like okay now it will hide so you won't see it well this is are you ready to be scared creeped by the space then wait two seconds forever wait two seconds go to random position so anywhere over here then show and play space red the only sound it will play that sound then wait two seconds and hide then there's a skeleton it's a dancing skeleton look all the costumes dancing so i just chose the one that's staring because there's no broken bones then when green flag click hide wait two seconds just like the same code as the others but it will play a different sound rattle because it's a skeleton then there is the nightmare i'm very scared of lightning at night when i sleep and there's a lightning i literally want to sleep until the lightning stops then it's the same code but play boom cloud it's the only sound i could find just like scary and for the lightning and there's a wizard todd it looks scary for me there is it will play teleport forever and wait one second and when green flag click hide it will play croc it's just a frog sound then there's sprite one which says are you ready to be scared by space and the whole thing is black then when green file clicks show wait two seconds and hot it will hide before all the characters shows because all of them wait two seconds then they will show there's a fact when green flag clicked it will hide and do all the same code and play sound owl i don't know why i choose album it's the most sound that sounds like a bat but i don't like and there is a shark it has some different kind of code because i try to make the shark like chomp because there's a sound bite so there is costumes that make this like first this one or or this one and then it will play the sound right well before it change costume so it will green flag click hi wait two seconds forever wait two seconds go to random position show switch costumes to shock to be so it's like the opening mouth one ah then it will wait 0.1 second place down fight and then switch costumes to shark to a so it's like and then hide and last but not least the snake i had to record the sound when screen's not clicked it will go to random processor and show replacing play sounds i recorded it because there wasn't a snake sound so i had to record it like a s really tried to make a snake sound so people think it's the snake next there's a stage it has screenshots clicked forever next backdrop wait one second when green flower click forever change color effect by 25 so it change color wait 0.1 second dead forever play sound mystery if the only son i can find that's very mystery scary and now let's see the show show show that's a tunnel and look destructor spiked it keep changing and there's two backgrounds there's a lot of different sounds and they're coming at different times different places disappearing and showing it's very creepy and there is space background i searched space when i went to the background and scratch and i found two these two the ones i liked for this one so they're both the one but there's other space but i didn't think it was good so that is so creepy thank you for watching remember to smash that and subscribe bye bye
