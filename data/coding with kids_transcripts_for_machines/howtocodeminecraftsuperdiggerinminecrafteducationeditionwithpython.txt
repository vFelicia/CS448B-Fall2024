welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're a minecraft education and we're gonna go to the tutorials and we're going to do super digger so as the picture and name shows you you know that this will enable you to like super dig oh look at that dig through anything without holding it what will so you can like fill fill you can fill the blocks around you so if we fill air around if we fill the blocks with air around us then it will like that the blocks will disappear because we replace them with air which is not a block but like nothing be from negative one negative one and negative one so the numbers are the ones are the places where you will fill the one fill these blocks and places with there and then next go to my and walk around don't fall in the void yeah because even if you are in creative mode if you fall to the board you'll eventually die oh look at that oh oh let me keep jumping okay go to the tree maybe i'll destroy the tree i know oh i think i got those right oh no yeah you stop moving it oh i think i'll i'm just getting darker let's see how can i go back up i don't know i need it let's just go back to code but i'm in this darkness i'm gonna keep going down don't fall in the void instead of running the code when the player walks when flying so fly so you like won't just just walk and you you know okay yeah and create a new world so we're saving next to this world which is completely black and we're going to create a new word to go into creative creative and then play so we can fly yeah because the creative you can fly that's lava pit okay but first we need to go to code and then press the super digger then we're to run it and press the run button now let's go forward fusum hello agent i'm going to go to a wall go to a wall see it clears the blocks that's so cool just disappear like it makes this huge hole yeah it looks so cool maybe you can mix it and show your friends look i made this huge don't you can't even get the water away oh that's so little you can literally get even a cow that is just so cool that'll be amazing so let's go back to code let's see what the agent needs to say go to minecraft.com no more falling into the board increase the volume now we need to change the ones into the five there so it will get get more deleted blocks oh that's gonna be more cooler than ever but first we need to change all these ones into five yeah until you can do it now we're going to show you python around you air the positions build operation that we play so it will replace that block into the air which is nothing then after we definitely find the function we're going to do so if the player flies then it'll run the function so replace the blocks around you two ways next go to minecraft fly away in the world let's do it yeah yeah if you just stay in the water the water will never if yeah you need to fly okay let's go up let's try to go they're like you can make a house in here or garage that's so cool but if we destroy that oh it's so cool super duper actually doesn't get animals away because it's only two plots yeah i think hey that was floating in the air wow like they literally lost half of the tree yeah don't feel like cut trees and you can mine yeah but you first need to disable it yeah because even though uh oh what happens to the llama just fell down how about drinks yeah no no yeah wow this is amazing let's go to this this big float kind of floating hill uh it's actually the top of our i don't know it's actually our garage there's so much mountains we're a destroyer mountain there's like a big deep hole in there oh you can put torches before you build your home in there yeah this skill is amazing look everywhere is stone because inside mountains are stuck yes to shape let's go away let's go forward a forest and see what happens literally destroying all the trees yeah every single one of them we're literally in a big cave yeah but how about water oh there's literally a giant square pool yeah it's like if we go forward it'll just like keep extending the pool yeah but not it's like like you can create a server and stuff well you can create your own amazing creations well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
