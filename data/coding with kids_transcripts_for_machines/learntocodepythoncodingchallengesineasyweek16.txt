welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edible is a coding platform that where there are lots of coding problems and you can solve them using different coding languages So today we're going to solve three coding problems using python so our first problem is called inches to feet create a function that accepts the measurement value in inches and Returns the equivalent of the measurement value in feet if we're just going to round up to the approximate if it's not divisible by 12. so here there's 12 inches which is equal to one feet and then 36 inches is three feet if inches are under 12 return 0 and 12 inches equals one foot okay so first we have a function called inches to feet with a number which is inches so first we need to eliminate the options that are less than 12 inches because less than 12 inches we're gonna round it to zero for zero feet so we're going to do if inches is less than 12. we're going to return 0 because we need to return 0 if it is zero feet then after we've eliminated all the other 12 options we're gonna calculate how many feet and rounded to approximate so I hope I think they're all divisible by 12. okay so then we're gonna divide it by 12 because there are 12 inches in one one foot so if repeat equals inches divided by 12. so now we have to feet we need to turn it and we're going to return the number of feet in the in the given amount of inches so now let's check it and see the test cases so there's 3612 inches is 301 feet and there is um 324 inches is 27 feet okay so now we pass all our tests onto our fine um our next coding challenge so then we have count the syllables create a function that Returns the number of syllables in a simple string the string is made up of short repeated words like la la la la which would have seven syllables so here you can see a cheat code is that it tells us that please note each syllable will consist of two letters only so this will make it a lot easier okay so here it's always the same repeating thing so first we have a function called count syllables with the text called text so we return the number of syllables so first we need to calculate how many syllables there are so remember that their each syllable is two letters so to make it easy we're going to divide each the length of each word with each text by 2 to get the syllables so we're going to do length equals Len text so the Len function is a function that takes the length of something for example the amount of letters in a text so now we have the length of the text we're going to divide that by two to get the syllables because each syllable is two all letters so here with a syllable use length divided by two finally we're gonna return that so return syllable so now here you can see there is DD which is two and then go which is only two letters so it's one and then is four so now we passed our tests onto our final coding challenge so our final coding challenge is called evaluate an equation so it's very simple instructions create a function that evaluates an equation basically like solve the equation yeah so here one plus two equals three and then three plus two minus four is one so don't print return a value and you return the uh answer not the equation okay so first we have a function called EQ and with the uh equation we're supposed we're supposed to evaluate so if this is very simple if you know how to do it so we just do a variable answer equals of all evaluate so the Evolve function is a very useful function when you're doing math in Python so basically just evaluates the given equation and we're just going to return the answer that we get so let's see some of the uh equations so what is three so is uh five times eight minus four is times nine is four wow and then three plus two minus four is one okay and then six wait three star star seven is two one eight seven wow okay so now we passed all the tests well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
