in his project animal race so this is my project animal race and it's a two player game and it's it's very simple and you the goal is to race by pressing the m and a buttons and your characters are these two and you're trying to get the balloons so let's show you how it's done who's pressing you know like who am i controlling oh you won m is the blue dog yeah so so let's go to the code so first the scratch cat here so it does very little things but it's still part of the project so when green flat clicked that means when you run it it'll set the variable count to zero so like is the countdown until the race begins so like to add more to add more excitement into the project then it'll repeat three times that means it'll keep repeating whatever is in the loop three times that it will change count by one and then say count for one second so i'll be like so count will be zero right it will change count by one which will add one to counts over one two three and then it'll say go and then it'll broadcast start race which is um a message and then the you can start moving the dog and the space dog and also when green flag clicked it will forever place on dance magic and i reversed it and made it softer so it also plays music so in the dog i'll call it a blue dog because it's not like a usual dog it looks like a sick dog when green flag clicked it will go to dog start which is right where the x is the expert is called dog start and then why don't you just hide them no whenever c start race that's the message the scratch cat stands after says go oh forever wait until key m press so you press m to move the blue dog and then wait until not key and pressed then move 10 steps next costume so as i walk in costume and then if touching the dog finish which is the blue balloon is called dog finish and then we'll switch backdrop to player one win with the worst p1 wins that means player one and they'll stop all the things and the project will stop and then the dog start and it has no code yet you just put it here dog finish no code that means bat finishing start has no code well it was originally a bad but i changed it to space dog so when green flag clicked for the space dog it'll switch back up to blue sky which is this black drop and then it will go to batch dot which is this the arrow and then it'll go to the front layer and then when i receive start race scratch cast sends forever wait until key a press so you use the a key to move the space star and then wait until not key a pressed move 10 steps next costume well it doesn't have cost only has one costume yeah so it's just staying then if touching the bat finish which is the yellow balloon and then it'll switch back up to p to when i use player two then stop all so it'll also stop everything so in the backdrops there's no code and there's two yes so i colored these by myself and i typed these with these tools and i like changed their colors and into pixel font so player two is green and player one is red so this is a blue sky backdrop and that's it three one two three i'm a let's last time three two one clear one wins clear wins no and you take up on the keys on the key your finger needs to be verified what's my finger isn't really so i got all these sprites from the scratch collection of sprites so you don't need to upload or anything you just choose it from the sprite library and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
