welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so first we're going to make a list called numbers so it's just like a variable but there's square brackets which is the list then we have three items one free and five and these items are separated by commas so in two other videos we learned about lists and list helper functions next we're gonna do print five in numbers and print eight in numbers so the n will like be asking print a question here the question is is an integer five in numbers and is a integer eight in numbers and then print is gonna answer with true or false so integer 5 is in the list numbers so for the first one it's going to print true yeah then it's integer 8 and numbers no so print will answer with false next we're going to do print five not in numbers so here we have a not so not in well as print is five not in numbers well five is a number so false yeah is eight not in numbers it's not a number so print will answer with true yes let's say we have ctrl s go to terminal and run dot list so the true false false and true just as i said so it worked next we're gonna do cities equal chicago london tokyo so now we have a list called cities with all with free names of free random cities next we're going to do a for statement for city and city so city is a variable which is like the items so it's going to repeat this for loop until it checks every item so like for each item in cities i'll print the item so print chicago london and tokyo because it's a for loop and then when it's done with printing tokyo it'll stop so let's save it and run it so did chicago london and tokyo it worked so next i'm going to do numbers equals then a bunch of numbers 4277 okay okay numbers. so sort is a list helper function that will sort our items in our list so here we have numbers so it'll sort from smallest to greatest so 4 8 15 16 and so on next we're going to do for number and numbers that means for each item in the sorted list because we sorted the list then well if number is more than 42 a break so stop the for loop if the number is checking the items ticking is less than 42 it will print the number so i expect it to print 4 8 15 16 23 and 42 and then it'll stop at 42. let's save it and see what will happen don't 15 16 23 and 42. andrew was correct so it stopped at 42 because the next item in the sorted list was 55 so i checked the if again is 55 more than 42 55 is more than 42 so it went to the break that means it stopped so next we're going to do value equals laptop 7 phone 3 dslr and five so we have a list called values with items of two data types integers and strings next i'm going to do equipment equals two square brackets which is an empty list so we have two lists then for value and values we're checking the items and values if is instance value string equals false so the instance function will get the type of the item we're checking if a string but there's equals equals false so if the item is checking is not a string will continue which means it'll go back to the for loop and check the next item if the item is a string then equipment dot append value so append is a list helper function that will add an item to our list so here we're adding the item we're checking if it's a string now we'll add it to equipment so let's save it and run it so oh yeah after it checks all the items we're going to print the equipment list so save it and right okay so it did laptop phone and dslr so it checked all the items and it did nothing with the integers and the list values but it added the string items and values which are laptop phone and dslr to the list equipment and then printed equipment which is all the strings items so next we're going to do import random and numbers equals 2 square brackets which is an empty list so import will tell python we're using a module and random is a builtin module so in another video we also learned about the platform standard library and modules so we also have an empty list called numbers then while then numbers is less than five so len is a function that will tell you the length of something and the length of our list numbers is the number of items is less than five you know numbers that append random.randit100 so append is a list helper function that will add an item and we need the random module because we're using the function randit so ran it will pick uh random integer from one to a hundred and we need to do random.randit because the random function is inside the random module and the append function will add the random number into our list numbers until our numbers has five problems then for number and numbers that means for each item in the list numbers you know print that number and then if number is more or equal to 90 now print that at least one number greater than 90 and then it'll break else it'll print no numbers greater than 90. so if it can't find a number equal to or more than 90 it'll go past the if and goes to the else of the forward statement it will always it'll print no numbers greater than 90 and then they'll always if even whatever it prints it'll always print complete at the end so save it and run it so it did 92 already that's the first number and printed number and then checked the if and 92 is more than 90 so it printed found at least one number greater than 90 and then printed complete that wasn't the first twice wow let's do it again 94 greater than 90 again please please oh the last number the last number was more than 90. let's see if we can get a list with no numbers more than 90 no numbers greater than 90 complete yeah okay mr andrew and then it followed andrew's command one more time no no more than nothing maybe because i didn't change its commands like computer okay i'll just say let's do what andrew said that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
