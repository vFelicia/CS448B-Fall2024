welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today i want to mark up education edition you know what coding is an important skill to learn it takes us creativity critical thinking and public science kids like us get creative by making games websites apps and more did you know there is a silicon valley technology education company called code with us they offer a free live online class from 6 to 18. you just need to go to code with us dot com slash free and schedule a class code with us has a free to one ratio for group classes and they also offer private classes today we're going to do one of those tutorials so the microsoft code i'm going to do the contest runs but i'm gonna make a fun game with it after we build it with the code so it's like a 3d compound this tutorial shows you how to create words and letters text from blocks this text is placed in the minecraft world at a position you choose using print the object you will make is called a contest rose this is a 2d maker showing the notes marker showing the north south east and west directions in the last step you will add another dimension to the compost rose to show the up and down directions okay put in an on chat command and rename it to compass rows so we're just gonna go to compass to be sure insert a print into your chat command change hello to e change the block from grass to glowstone so we're going to go to blocks then glowstone not glowstone victory of your current position the first number x of a position represents the east slash west location a positive value goes east negative goes west the symbol means that the position is relative to the player position rather than to the word tells 200 means 20 blocks east of the player's position so we're going to change this to 20. go to minecraft and enter compass rows in the chat the e letter is now printed 20 blocks away okay so first let's go away how are you doing are you doing good i think so but it doesn't answer but another print to show w 20 blocks west try it in minecraft west goes negative so the position is negative twenty zero zero don't move until all letters are printed okay west west and then glow stone again negative 20. then try a minecraft shoot shouldn't we do it insert more prints to show n 20 blocks north s 20 blocks south try in the third number z of the of d is the self slash north court a positive value goes south a negative value goes north so first we're gonna do no okay and this goes down close down and change the block and change it to negative 20. then let's do one more again that's easier okay that's then one twenty three then insert more print to show you twenty blocks up the 20 blocks down try it in minecraft the second number y of the position is the up down elevation a positive value goes up a negative value goes down okay so we're going to do even more so first i'm going to do it up and close down okay and second number up is 20 now so first def on our chat so it's a function so do blocks dot print e glowstone position twenty zero zero west so it will make the letter e and do the same with w which is west but they change positions yeah the end which is north west south northwest and there's all the glowstone block and then south west then the up west and the downwards then that's the function and then we're going to do player though on chat compass on unchecked so when you type compass in the track of what the so let's fly up into the sky so well at least like at least see the upside i mean downside okay this is in the middle of the desert oh as you can see mushrooms oh this is west a little west okay now let's play the game well kind of event okay so you just do this and then while closing your eyes and then you you think i'll give you clues of um which nearest well which your nearest to eat yourself okay or anything so but you need to close your eyes okay which one is it it's near north and south east no west yeah it's west okay okay my turn i got this okay it is near south near east correct it only could be two we don't get up and down anymore often yeah because we only turn this i try to turn down that but you look barely evenly wait when you fly up from the sky and look down at down the d it looks like a like a diamond it's so cool the light is like a diamond square or a triangle all right diamonds and then here's the same with the lava of a natural lava then there's the first i think everyone every you know all of them are you know diamonds and the stars up byebye up oh it's like is this kind of satisfying that i don't really know it's just freaking glass we're going down and we're breaking down well d oh no there won't be much light used okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
