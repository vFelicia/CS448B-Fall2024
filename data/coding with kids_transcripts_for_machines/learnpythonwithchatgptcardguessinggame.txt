welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're gonna make a guess the card game in Python with chat gbt so chat GPT is a learning AI chat bot that is very popular right now today we're gonna use it to help us make a card guessing game so first I'm gonna ask it to make a simple card game in Python because I had no ideas so it gave me a card guessing game it says sure let's create a simple card game called guess the card in this game the program will pick a random card and the player's task is to guess the value and suit of the card the player will continue guessing until they guess correctly here's the code for the game so first we're going to import the module at random so we can use some functions inside that module like Choice Dot random.choice first we're going to create a function to create a deck of cards we have a function called create Deck with two lists values and Suits which are the numbers and words we can guess so we have to guess both the value and suit to get the card right then we're going to create another list called Deck with value and Suits so for each value in values and four each suit in suits with these are two for Loops so this will make this deck of cards with so for example for value and values it will do it'll start with Ace and then it will do Ace Hearts Ace diamonds eights clubs eight space then two hearts two diamonds two clubs two Spades and we'll continue then we're going to return the deck next function we're going to do is to pick a random card from the deck for the program it's called pick card using the deck with of the and which is the list we just created then we're gonna do return written that choice deck so it's gonna pick a random card and random that choice is the function we're gonna use from the random module next function we're going to do is to check if this if the guest card matches the picked card called check guess with guess and card we're gonna return true or false depending on if the guess is equals equals to the car remember to put two equal marks or else you're just assigning if you assigning something if you just put one finally we're going to do the function to play the game play a game we're going to create the deck using the variable deck equals create Deck with the deck function then we're going to do Picard variable which will make the program pick a random card from the deck then we're going to print welcome to guess the card game I picked a card can you guess the value and suit of the card and then we're gonna do while true Loop guess value equals input enter the value of the card so here it's gonna let us guess the value with the input and we're then we're going to do the same with the suits then we're gonna put our guesses for the value in the suit in a guess variable then we're gonna do if check s guest pick card so here we'll check our guest using the check guess function we made and if it's right we're going to print congratulations you guessed the card correctly then we're gonna break down so thank you for playing in the prints if we don't get it right we're going to do else print oops that's not the right card try again so this is our first version so now we're going to upgrade it using so we're not tell chat GPT to make it so we get Clues so it'll be easier for us to guess it we don't have to guess every one of the values for the suits is easy because there's only four so here there are the changes it's the there are check uh so Clues so there's a whole new function called provide clues with guessing card so we're going to do two variables value clue and suit clue which is we're going to remain blank right now and then if the guess is not the card we're gonna give a clue for the value the value is different from your guess the value if the guess is the value we're going to print the value is correct same for the suit and then we're going to turn the value clue and suit clue then here in the play game we're going to modify a little bit so here um for the if check guess where we check our card guest and the picked card here if we don't get it right we're gonna put our um clues in a variable and then we're gonna print them so the player can know that it's not that it's not correct and then we're gonna modify again make it so that the clues for the values are bigger and small because the values are mostly full of numbers you can cut it down and make it more easier so bigger and smaller so if you guess two and the answer was five it will say like your answer is bigger or larger yeah so here um if guess is not card then when I put another if Loop in the provide clues function if guess is less than the card we're going to print the value is bigger than your guess if not this is going to tell the value is smaller than your guess and then the same for the suits because the suit there are no numbers then here is the same for the clues ex we're going to print the clues but the clues are going to be different so now our last modification we're going to make it so that at the end displays the number of guesses we take so you can compete with your friends or family and try to guess the number with the less with the least number of guesses so here basically little changes weren't in the play game function when I create a variable called guesses we're going to start as zero and every guess which is in the while loop we're gonna do guesses plus equals one which we add one to the guesses a variable because he had one guess but it wasn't right or maybe it is right and then at the end we're gonna also print number of guesses with the guesses variable which is the number of guesses we took now when the player guesses the card correctly the program will display the number of guesses made by the player during the game this provides feedback to the player about their performance so now we're done and now we're gonna run it in Visual Studio code so here you can see all the code and now let's run it I'm gonna go first and I'm gonna try to get the least number of guesses welcome to guess the card game I've picked a card can you guess the value into the car such a value of the car so let's put up the list so value I'm gonna go with six because it's kind of in the middle so I can get a clue on bigger or smaller suit I'm gonna go with diamonds the value is smaller and the suit is different so the value is less than six let's see I'll go with three and then for the suits I'm gonna go with clubs still so value is bigger the suit is different so let's see it's between three and six I'm gonna go with four and then for the suit I'm gonna go with hearts see yes I got it right I got it both right in one turn oh and we'll in a single troll well I both I got both so congratulations you guessed the card correctly thank you for playing then it gives our number of guesses three so now it's kalia's turn but um enter the value 10. 10 10. okay excuse me Jack queen and king bear suit Hut's diamonds clubs or Spades spit capitalize the s B let's see this value is bigger oh so it's Jack queen or king and the suit is different from your guess uh I'm gonna do a queen and then clubs okay the value is smaller than Queen so I think it's probably Jack and the value is some still something else um I'm in the suit hearts oops that's not the right card the value is correct the suit so it's it's the value there's only black and this has to be diamonds it's the only one you didn't guess yet yes she got four guesses I got three should we do it one more time sure okay let's do it again let's see the value I'm gonna go with five actually eat then the suit I'm gonna go with hearts so I got the suit already correct the valley is bigger than eight let's see I'll go with ten Hui no actually Jack and hearts the value is bigger than Jack so it's queen or King Uncle of the king all right king hearts the value is still bigger Ace is hearts the value is still bigger than the king I'm the best Queen and then um hearts congratulations I guess the correctly five okay let's see um value let's do nine and then close pretty high um space we've got it correctly in two tries yes I won so you can try guessing it and get it in one try to be clear well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
