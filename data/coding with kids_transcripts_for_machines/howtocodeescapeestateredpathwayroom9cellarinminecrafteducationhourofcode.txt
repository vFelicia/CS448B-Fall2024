welcome to coding with kids my name is Clea and my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition in the hour of code Escape aay so in the last video we solved this room and now let's go into the portal bye Butler oh the butler's already gone okay let's see oh where are we okay let's see right click particles okay so the button oh seems like we have to go up there let's see staircase use a cursor to build a staircase to ACC access the upper level use move cursor to position the cursor and place block to place a block in the position you have selected you could go up down left and right so let's see the code example okay okay so let's go so you can use the loop too okay so I'll go up here so let's see what this does first okay so we could do parkour and just like add another thing over here so we could move and then um move cursor and then I up is orange so move cursor Orange oops okay let's see okay so now we can do parkour and just jump because we just need to go up to the next level okay puzzle soloft so now we have these wind currents that seem that can blow us off okay let's go to code so now I think we need to use our cursor to block the wind currents so Andrew is Right windy Bridge you need to get across the bridge but the wind is too strong you need to place blocks inside the holes and where the wind is coming from to block it okay so use the move cursor and the place block function let's do this example first okay so let's see um got over here moved yellow and then two more yellows and up one time okay so move yellow Place block and then move yellow two more times for Iron Range two times you could just do the like do it two times but like I we going to use the loop move cursor and then we're going to do yellow yellow two times and then we're going to move up one time um move cursor and then we're going to do orange since orange is up and then finally Place block okay so let's see so we're going to go we're going to block the first one block the second one and then after that we need block the the last one okay so after we're up there we'll have to go two times to yellow and then go down one time so this time I'm just going to do the two move cursor yellow commands because they're basically the same length as the repeat Loop if you do it two times then we're going to do the move cursor ping to go down and then we're going to place the block the block now we're going okay so cover the first hole and then the last hole the S so now there's something called a create minion oh so so I think we need to help the create minion get across okay bridge builder the crate minion is stuck Oh no you're both stuck you should build a bridge for the create minion to get to the other side so they can press the button to reveal a staircase to help you out so same functions move cursor and place block okay so let's see this first so now we can basically do that except we just need to place one more block okay so let's go to code we see here so we can just use repeat Loop okay so delete and then we're going to have to do it for times so now we can run it oh you remember the top so it can be in the loop okay so one two 3 4 so now it will go and press the uh button for us to go up oh so now we can get up here now we have to remove this wall okay to get into the next R Block Breaker you need to break the blocks blocking the door so you can get out use move cursor to position the cursor and break block to break the Block in the position you're selected so let's see this first okay so that doesn't work so basically we just need to break this block and that block so we can just go one hole in okay so let's go to code so we can just first do break block and then we just need to move cursor orange so we can um go and break that other block and then we're going to break block function again okay so one and then two and then we can go here okay so in the next video we'll go in but for now say bye to the crate minion byebye oh it face planted ah walk right through it that's crazy where a zombie it's a baby zombie though yeah okay well well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe byebye
