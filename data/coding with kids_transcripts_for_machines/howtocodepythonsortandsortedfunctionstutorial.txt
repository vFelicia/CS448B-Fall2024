welcome to creating with kids my name is andrew and today we're going to teach you peppa so today we're going to learn about the sort and sorted functions so first we are going to do a list which has a bunch of numbers then we print a list before because we're going to change the list then we're going to print a list sort so i'm going to use the sort function we're just going to sort your list items then we're going to print a list afterwards now and save it and so did before this before and then when we did print a list of sort it did none because the sort function doesn't return anything then after the list now is sorted so it's not only five is one three because three is less than five next we'll do a list again and then we're gonna print those before and then we're gonna print a list that reverse now we're gonna use the reverse function which will reverse the order of your items then we're going to print a list after so now i'm going to save it and right so it did the before this and then the reverse function also doesn't return anything so it also prints none then there's the reverse list so free over here before was at the the last item now it's the first item so it reversed the orders of our items next we'll do a list again we're going to print a list before and we'll print sorted a list then we'll print a list after so now we're going to use the function so it did before and then now the sorted function returns something so it's the sorting list so it doesn't affect your regular list it makes a copy so there's one three five seven nine and then it does after so the regular that's the same as before next we're gonna do a list again i'm gonna print this reversed a list and another way to do it is print a list colon colon negative one so now we're going to do the reversed function so i did if it did three nine seven five one so that's reversed and the this one printed list quant negative one is the same as print list reversed list so reversed also returns your reverse list which is just like sorted before with the reverse function next we're going to do tuple equals e d c b a so this is a tuple with letters then we'll print tuple before and then print sorted tuples now i'm going to test the sorted function on a tuple and see if anything special happens you're going to print a tuple before after now when we do sort of function it does it turns the tuple into a list and then source the letters so the tuple turned into loops that's one thing that's special then after it's still the same next i'm going to try on a string so string equals hello there on our print string before then print sorted so to test the story on a string and you're going to print strings so i'm going to print it so did hello before and then when we sorted it it turned into lips and sorted its letters so now it's hello instead of hello after it's still hello the next word test it on a dictionary we have a dictionary with keys and values then we'll print predict this is a regular dictionary then it also turned it into a list so i sorted its keys not its values so did bird cat dog rabbit and then the after still the same so how do we do it if we want to sort the values so first i'm going to print sorted dicta items so the items in the dictionary are the pairs of keys and values then we're going to print a sorted value so this is how you sort these values in the dictionary then reference sorted dot values then we'll do reverse equals true so what this does last night does is that this first sorts the values of the dictionary and then it reverses the order because it reversed equals true so it first did the regular one then did one two three four which is the sorted of the values and then the reverse equals true did four three two one this is like a countdown next one do a list equals then there's negative numbers and regular numbers we're going to print sorted a list your prints sorted the list t equals abs so the key equals abs makes all these numbers regular numbers so the negative doesn't matter so i did this one then we're gonna list and then when did the abs it did negative one two negative forty four and negative five so the negatives now don't matter next we're gonna do a list inside the list then we're going to print sorted a list and we're going to print sorted a list t equals lambda item then item 2. so we in another video we learned about lambda functions so here the lambda function gets in the item index 2 which is which are the two g numbers 65 30 10 and 24 and sorts these items by these two digit numbers now let's save it and run so did first the sort of function so which is sorted a list so sorted by his first element which is the word so so bird cat dog and rap then here let's look at the two digit numbers so first is 10 then 24 30 and 65 so that worked well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
