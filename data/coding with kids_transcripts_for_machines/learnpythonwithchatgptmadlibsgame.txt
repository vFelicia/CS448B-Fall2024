welcome to coding with kids my name is Kia and my name is Andrew today we're going to make a mad lips game with Chachi BT and Pyon so Madness is a placeholder game where that you have a story and then there are these blanks in it and you can um put random words in it to make a funny story so I asked chb to create a Mad Libs game in Python and then I asked it to expand the on the story to make it longer so here's the story and then there was some bugs like not all the placeholders were filled so now I fixed it with Chach gbt and now it's good so first we have a function called mad lives and we have story template with placeholders as you can see there is a story and then there are these blanks like adjective place and then verb and adverb so we can fill these blank holders out by inputting variables into in the while running the code so we're then we're going to ask the person for words to fill in the placeholders we're going to do words equals and then here we're going to have all these and we're going to do input enter objective Place person Etc here we're going to insert all our words then we're going to do fi story equals story and then for each placeholder for each blank in there so these words will also repeat it'll insert all the words we entered into the story then here it'll hold the um completed story then it'll print your mad live story and then it'll print our story then here it just runs the function so now we're in the studio the clothing studio and now we have the code here and now we're going to run it so I'm going to do a story first and then you're going to do it okay so I'm going to do it in a a Medieval Times theme thing so enter an objective we're going to do um uh let's say shine name okay then a place we do let's just say a kingdom then we're going to do a person let's say a knight then a verb we're going to do uh riding around on a horse basically an adverb say swiftly because he's riding very fast then object let's say um sword then a n we're going to do what should we do uh head and gra it of let's do Jester then a plural noun we're going to do um let's do uh let's do apples then a creature let's do um a dragon dragon then finally an emotion let's do um Happy so here's our story so your mad lip Story Once Upon a Time in a shining Kingdom they lived a shining night so here you can see the the objective shining repeated two times because if we don't repeat we have to do we have to put a lot of words and the code will also be very long this Knight had a pecular habit of riding swiftly every morning one day while riding swiftly the Knight stumbled Upon A mysterious swords so some of these won't make sense but it it's you can it's fine it glowed with Shining Light and had gravings of a Jester on it so sometimes the grammar is wrong but whatever intrigued the Knight decides to riding it it rides the sword suddenly the Knight found themselves transported to a shining Kingdom filled with lots of apples the Knight explored the Strange New World riding with shining excitement after what seemed like hours the Knight discovered a shining sword another shining sword guarded by a shining Dragon so this shining sword must be very special if it's guarded to get an entry the Knight had to solve a riddle involving Jester and Jester so it's a very weird riddle with shining wit and Shining determination so everything so shining the KN successfully entered the kingdom inside they found a treasure Trove of apples apples and apples so now he has a lots of apples overwhelmed with happy or happiness then I decided to riding back home carrying memories of their shining Adventure so the Knight got lots of apples to bring home to the kingdom and the King now your turn objective so something that describes something colorful colorful okay then a place um a town town okay a person a person um um um a Madman a Madman then a verb it's a verb has an action an action um of making making okay an

even know what a noun is plural noun isn't riddles a plural noun yeah should didn't specify just go guess to The Riddles again why not then creature um a bunny bunny and then finally an emotion sadness sadly sadly so here's your story read it once upon a time in a colorful town there lived a colorful M oh colorful madman this madman had a pecular habit of making magically every morning makes magic that's crazy one day while making magically the madman stumbled Upon A mysterious potion it glowed with a colorful light and had Engravings of red on it so it's like enchantment from Minecraft
