welcome to couldn't win kids my name's clea my name is andrew today we're in scratch and in my account today one two three and this is a project i made called bowling soccer ball it's a soccer ball goes boing yeah i'm trying to get 10 points you can also get negative negative 10 equals uh okay so soccer ball sprite so you got all the soccer ball goalie and catcher from the scratch collection of sprites and i wouldn't lose you tight i painted it when so first when reflects forever if touching goalie which is this which is the player change score by one score is available variable yeah so you add one because you touched him then turn 180 degrees and move 10 15 steps so it will then wait 0.5 seconds so because if you don't have this code then it like if you're touching glowy you're like add so much more but why is so you need to try to get their ball to touch you yeah too not just like just leave the ball not touching the catcher which is supposed to be the goalie yeah so when green side clicks zero y negative one hundred and fifty three important direction forty five forever because if you did not have the block if on edge bounce the soccer ball would go out of the screen on his first bounce and you can never get it back unless you like go to an x y coordinate yes when i receive game over which is a message hide because if you don't hide then like you can like like yeah and like pretend to be like still playing yeah when i receive you win hide again and when it brings back click so yeah because you need a high when so you win or lose because like you can still play even if you win or lose you don't need to reset the game yeah next blow enough over everywhere because it will be x x coordinate not y so go like to left and right not up and down or any other direction yeah when green flaps play forever if score equals negative 10 then broadcast game over and we'll see game all game over are so high yeah so all of the sprites have when i receive game over hyde except the game over dash lose i mean dash win win dashboards when greens are click show when i receive over highway receive you win when green flag click forever if touching soccer ball which is this is behind the catcher right now changing score by negative one sorry minus one minus one point from the score yeah then wait zero point one second because if one time when i tried out my game and i didn't have this when i when i touched like the ball is touching it's like negative so it keeps minusing yeah i don't have the weight when green flap click forever move time steps if on edge bounce so it was like this spring yeah because it goes to left and right just it just goes left and right and if you did not have the on edge bounce code like you go like a little girl like one side out of the screen for yeah right just like you saw this is before the ever loop so it'll never stop unless you're loser when i receive game over so this is different the switch costume to gain all over the stop almost like nothing happens yeah it's like it's game over yes when i receive you win is like the same but win and it's not like the game over switch game over and you win game over is much larger than you win maybe like no like it might be player no i click high if you don't have that code then you would like win or lose at the media yeah yeah but you still see the other sprites when green flag could forever if score equals 10 then broncos you win i don't know why i put it over there just for fun like um there's backdrops i don't like the white black jump this is one is like game over or you win yeah so it's turned black but the first thing is talking too so when green flash clicks switch back drop to soccer to end forever place down excellent until done it's a sound let's hear it i i actually like i can't really repeat okay i actually copy the whole thing and keep paste paste paste paper it's not actually like a song yeah it just sounds like soccer music when i receive game over switch back to game mode and when i receive you win you switch back to game mode the game over backdrop is the one is the black backdrop yeah i know why it's called game over the first thing i do it oh just name it game over then i forgot to win so it's just like let's play it clears playing for zero score negative two one keep touching it no you're not four number five seven of an eight number nine oh you almost got but i'm almost lost but i won't let it okay my turn where is it don't let the catcher touch it or like the minus one point don't actually really like do the same pattern forever or it's like you're just nothing oh no negative two the catcher is actually really tricky at first i actually made a like a soccer but it didn't actually work so it literally like changed the whole game i keep touching it oh no okay you sometimes need to like trap the ball so it won't touch the capture and repeat that pattern forever oh no no okay i had to do it no touching me no touching my soccer ball oh i know i know how you can win you can just trap the soccer ball and keep bouncing it against the edge or something yeah and then you can keep having points until you get 10 points but the um the soccer ball moves when you touch it yeah it's a little harder negative zero negative come on i always bounce the soccer ball where the goalie is an improvement you can make is that like the goalie a random amount of speed game over last time i really tried to like make the game over at the middle guys so oh try to drop it oh no i can't you can't trap it oh no i'm trying to do this okay and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
