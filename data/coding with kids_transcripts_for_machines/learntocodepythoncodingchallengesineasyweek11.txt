welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edibin is a coding platform where you can do lots of different coding problems using different coding languages So today we're going to do three easy coding challenges and edit with python so our first coding challenge is called two makes ten our instructions are to create a function that takes two arguments both arguments are integers which are A and B return true if one of them is 10 or their sum is 10. so here for example they'll give us the the they will give us two numbers for example here's nine and ten so if uh the sum of both numbers is 10 or one of the numbers is 10 we're going to return true if not we're going to return false so here is 9 and 10 10 there's a 10 so we're going to turn true and here there is Nine and Nine um they equal to 18 and none of them are 10 so it's false yeah okay okay so now we have a function called makes 10 with two arguments which are A and B so first I'm going to do if a equals equals 10 or b equals equals 10 we're going to return true so here we're checking if uh if one of the numbers is 10 so we need to use two equal signs because you we don't want to assign something you just want to check if it's equal to we don't want to assign a to 10 or B to 10 instead we will check if a equals 10 or b equals ten yeah so if none of the numbers are 10 we're going to go to else if so else if the sum of A and B is 10 so a plus b equals equals ten we're going to return true so make sure you add two equal signs so if you know if the sum is not 10 and none of the numbers is 10 where new else return false okay next we're gonna check it and see the test cases so here there's ten and one there's a 10 so we're gonna turn true and there's a 12 and negative two so 12 plus negative 2 is 10. so ordinary terms okay so now let's go to the console and see all tests are passed so our next coding challenge is called movie theater admittance we have function that checks whether a person can watch it m a 15 plus rated movie one of the following two conditions is it require is required for admittance the person is either at least 15 years old or they have parental supervision so there's a parent to guide them the function is steps two parameters age and is supervised return of bullion so we're gonna either return true or false because these are bullions and yeah H is a decimal and is supervised is a bully okay so now we have a function called a set into movie you have two arguments called age and is supervised first we're gonna do if H is more or equal to 15 we're going to return true because if the person is more or um equal to 15 years of age they can go in and just go without any problem yeah so if they are less than if they're not 15 years old yet we're going to go to else if so we're going to check if they have parental supervision so if there's a parent with them yeah so Elsa is supervised equals equals true Where to return true so I'll still make sure to add two equal signs so if there if is supervised is true that means there's a parent so they can go watch the movie else if they don't have a pair and there are less than 15 years old we're going to do else return false that means they get kicked out with the movie here so you can't go in anyway because now it has cases it's 14.99999959 wow you just need like one more day until you're 15 years old but they're not still they're still not 15 years old it says true but there's a parent told supervision so yeah true they can go in when they're 15. okay so then now there's also 16 so they're 16 years old even if they don't have parental supervision they can go in so if you have 16 and you still have parental Vision that means double check marks so we pass all the tests onto our final coding challenge it's called convert hours into seconds this can help you if you're mad so it's a very simple instruction for a function that converts hours into seconds for example here two hours equals 7 200 seconds so 60 seconds in a minute and 16 minutes in an hour okay so here is how you do it so we have a function called how many seconds with a variable called hours so we're just simply going to make a variable called seconds equals hours times three thousand six hundred so when you multiply by 3600 because we first turn it into a minute and then an hour but you can do that once by multiplying 60 times 60 which is 3600 and then do hours times uh 3600 to see how many seconds while making this code you still have to use math yeah so then we're going to return seconds and now let's see test cases how many seconds 24 hours which is in a day there's 86 and 400 seconds loud that's a lot of seconds yeah in 10 hours there is 36 000 just add a zero to one hour yeah okay so all tests are passed well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
