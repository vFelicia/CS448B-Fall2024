welcome to pudding with kids my name is Kalia and my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edibit is a coding platform where there are lots of problems to solve using coding languages and you can use different coding languages to solve the problems so today we're going to do three easy coding challenges with python so our first coding challenge is called drinks aloud a bartender is writing a simple program to determine whether he should serve drinks to someone he only serves drinks three people 18 and older and when he's not on break given the person's age and whether break time is in session create a function which returns whether he should serve drinks so for example here it will give us the customers age and if he's on the break yeah so uh to for the bartender to give a drink to that person the person needs to be 18 years old and older and uh the um break variable needs to be false okay so we have function called should serve drinks with two variables age and on break so first we're going to do if age is more or equal to 18 and on break equals equals false so we need make sure to put the and because we need both of these conditions to be true so H is more than 18 and on break the variable equals equals false so we need him not on break because if he's on break he won't do any be doing any work and we need two equal signs because one equals sign will just assign something okay so if he is available and the customer is more than 18 years old we're gonna return true because the bartender can give a drinks to the customer if not we're gonna just return false because he can't okay so here are the test cases one of them are three years old of course it's false okay and then there's one that's 30 true okay so it's still false because he's on break so he's passed all the tests onto our next coding challenge it's called Matchstick houses this challenge will help you interpret mathematical relationships both algebraically and geometrically so we have pictures of little houses made with matchsticks our instructions are to create a function that takes a number as an argument and Returns the number of matchsticks and that's that see step one two and three in the images above so here's a step one step two and step three so each step we're adding one more house so here we need to see how many how many matchsticks are in the number of steps they give us okay Step Zero returns zero match sticks so if a zero just returns zero so here in one house we see that it's one two three four five six so the first house is six but when you add one on you count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven so eleven minus six equals five so after the first house every house is only five more matchsticks so first we have a variable called match houses with the numbers step so first when you do is Step equals equals zero we're just gonna return zero if there are no steps to eliminate that first okay then we're gonna do matchsticks equals step times five plus one so this variable holds the number of matchsticks for the steps and we do step times five with the star symbol because each house is five matchsticks but then you ask but the first step is six matchsticks so we're just gonna add one because it also multiplies the first step by five so we only need one to make it six so now we have the total number of matchsticks we're going to return the variable matchsticks and see how this goes so in the test there are 99 steps 496. that's matchsticks that's the highest one yeah and then there's zero and then zero so the first one is still six so we pass all our tests onto our final coding challenge our final coding challenge is called trophy or falsy a trophy value is a value that translates to True when evaluated in a Boolean context all values are truthfully unless they're defined as falsy all falsy values are as false false nonzero then these kinds of parentheses and then the quotation marks create a function that takes an argument of any data type and returns one fits through three and zero if it's falsy for example here the if it's false if it's a falsy we're gonna turn zero if it's a a truthy we're gonna return one yeah okay so make sort of a function called is trophy with the variable Val which is value so first we're going to do if value equals false so first we're gonna do if value equals false or none zero and then the brackets and then the quotation marks make sure to put both kinds of quotation marks so the brackets and the quotation marks are empty one yes not the ones with like letters of words yeah then they would be strings okay so if it's any of these we're gonna turn zero because they're falsies remember to put the um double equal signs for each if ball equals equals and then the value value because if you don't it for some reason it won't work okay so now we've eliminated all the falsies if it's not a falsy it's we know it's a truth B so we're gonna do else return one now let's see there is empty and then a zero there's none which is also a falsy there only there are five true fees true and this is a string false so it's one because it has words inside the quotation marks so let's see we pass all the tests well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
