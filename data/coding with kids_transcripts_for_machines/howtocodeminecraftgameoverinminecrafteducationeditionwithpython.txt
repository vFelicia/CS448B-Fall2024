welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition and we're going to explain you the codes of game over so it's a tutorial well it's really an example yeah so until command game over so when you type game over and chat it will change game mode to survival which we are already in because you can see the hearts and hunger bars and experience points and if you are with other people and they change their emotes to creative then they'll be insurmountable everybody will live in survival then tell about all players first we're going to do all players they're all entities so we'll get all the moms have little things really near us then to zero zero negative one thousand zero which is the void in the end yeah we're like so deep yeah okay you're gonna be teleported i guess click down there then pause for a thousand milliseconds and then it will change gamo back to creative so you'll be like stuck in the board nothing to do like ah what do i do what do i do until you set um the mode back to survival so you can die that's why it's called game over yeah okay now let's see it in python so def on a chat so this is a function gameplay.set game mode to survival so mobs target all players so it gets survived mode for all players now teleport mods dot teleport to position mobs.target all players but you're sending zero negative of thousands so zero for all the players to um devoid yeah and then loop stop pause a thousand milliseconds so it'll pause for okay and then gameplay.set gamemode creative mods target all players so once we're it'll wait until you're in the void and then it will set your game mode to create it and then player that on channel when you type game over in the chat it'll run the function okay now let's try get ready are you ready yes okay then game over uh oh right when we were about to die this is the void this is not before the end yeah this is like maybe it's the super um sky maybe that's a very deep sky look if i drop it probably takes a very long time you can't see anything like anything you can only see the sun he's my friend except right now we set it to only day like always day so it will never be night yeah it's just greatness let's turn ourselves to survivor or elsewhere because we're actually falling it's gonna take a long time okay so we're gonna do set you can do chat command or um settings or in settings aren't code but and just going to what so you just automatically die respawn so this is like a former video yeah and we want to with us i have fun time you have free tickets to the void okay okay are you ready yep last time game over where did they uh oh they all they all fell no we forgot to do the we forgot to do oh yeah oh yeah we forget so we're gonna go here blocks and we're switch it to all entities okay so they're going to teleport all i'm sorry there was um a problem please wait yeah okay in i just wrote it yeah okay then are you ready the trip will begin in three two one go oh they all just died automatically yeah we saw nothing we all died automatically i couldn't hear their sounds oh yeah i heard a spider i heard a lot of sounds and then it's all dye sounds and then they all just disappeared we couldn't even see the one i only really could hear a spider so i kind of heard like a scream maybe it's a ghast i guess yeah somehow it's like a screaming sound we even cleared all the um dropped like the drops oh these must be funny for us because they weren't close to us no i think they just spawned really yeah it's a baby sheep its head is really big yeah and it's like eating a lot the heads are the same size that's his third block and he's eaten okay so now you can see oh this is there's a lot of sheep the new because all the rabbits are gone but the beds are still there but these things we dropped and exploded i guess um are not here anymore yeah so if you drop an item in the board i wonder what happens to it probably just just disappears after you disappear from the end from the void okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
