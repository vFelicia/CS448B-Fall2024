welcome to coding with kids my name is claudia and my name is andy today we're gonna teach you python today we're gonna teach you a string helper function so first i'm gonna create a file i'm gonna name it p y and first we want to do message message equals string.capitalized first message then print message message equal second message capitalize and print message message equals third message print message dot capitalize so the capital string helper function is going to make the first letter of the of the message into a capitalize so right here in the first message the first letter is the f so it's going to capitalize the f the s right here and the t right here okay let's save it with ctrl s and go to the terminal type p y help dot p y o it's p y helper dot p y it says first semester second message and third message with the first letters capitalized so we're gonna delete this and do message equals hello world print message dot lower imprint message dot upper to the upper so the upper function will make all the letters uppercase yeah and the work will make all the letters lowercase the message equals message message.title the title function will make the first the first letters of each word into a capitalize then print message then print message dot swap case so the swap case function or swap is going to swap the lowercase to uppercase and the uppercase to do a lowercase let's save it and you can use your up arrow to copy what you last typed in this formula okay it says hello world hello world hello world hello so the first one is all lowercase then the next one is with the upper functions so they're all uppercase then the next one is has title function so the first letters of each word is upper case and the swap case is swapping the title the first one the first letters of each word are lowercase and the other letters in the word are uppercase which looks weird for me yeah i'm going to delete this and do location equal mississippi and print location don't count s so the account function is going to count how many of a letter is in mississippi yeah in mississippi so how many s's are in mississippi so many letters in this string so the length function is gonna count how many like letters is in this string in the print okay it's including spaces yeah okay then i'm gonna save it and run it 32 yeah there's 32 of them race car okay then print message starts with r print message doc starts with a a and print message don't start swift so the star wars function is gonna like return a true or false depending if it's true or false if the word is start with the r the word start with a or start with r a okay message then print message that ends with a i so the invest function is just like the starts with function except the inverse function if it ends with that yeah okay so let's save it and then all right true flash choo choo fast trail okay that was fun okay so it all worked today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
