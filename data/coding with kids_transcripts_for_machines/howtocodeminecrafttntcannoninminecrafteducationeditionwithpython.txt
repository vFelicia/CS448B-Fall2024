welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia today we're a minecraft education edition and we're going to explain to you the code of tng canons so tnt canon is basically a machine in minecraft which is just redstone to shoot tnt okay so on on chat command canon so when you type canon into the chat it will build their teleport to negative one zero negative ten so that's the coordinates so um in this code we'll only need the builder but a lot the builder is basically a visual agent used to build stuff it'll build our face itself upon a positive c so it'll face a certain way then build a place mark builder move forward by eight so it'll move forward eight steps forward um so just like just do this shuffle then build a placement then place block by name stone slab so place a soap slab the builder move up by one so just like float up yeah then place tnt so you it can be ready to shoot yeah and billow moves right by one again and bill replacement build and move forward by two so it in this code you need a lot of builder place mark and build and move forward and right and left and backwards yeah then it will left by two and move back by seven so like you can activate it and then like deactivate it then builder move forward negative one up so it'll move down on one left and negative two build a replacement then the building will place mark and then build and move forward by two but go forward again and then build trace mark tap mark with repeater facing notes so and then the builder yeah the builder will move forward by one and left one and then place lever on block top pointing south so like point like it's not it's like off then builder move back by one then place stone only one stone block then build and move down by one so it can place the water then build yeah then build and move back by four and build a place mark builder move back by two then build a trace path with marked by tnt so it can place the team now let's see so definitely south and builder dot mark so biller will move forward eight left two and back eight and then a little builder that traced past stone so that move right one and then builder that mark so it'll start tracing its path with stone the builder that place blocks by block name stone slab so place six flag then move up and place tnt and then build and move right one and that builder that mark so it'll then it'll do builder that move forward two and build that trace past stone so after that mark it'll start tracing with stone again and then um it will move right and build it up mark oh wait yeah okay then builder that place tnt so then move right one go to that redstone wire and then you'll do negative one one and negative two and then mark it again and move forward one and trace path restore again build that shift four negative one zero and mark again and then i'll do forward two and then build that trace path blocks dot repeater number four so it'll make the repeater facing north with the four um second delay and then dot builder dot shift one zero one and place box lever the block top face south went off so you can know which direction it's off and which direction is on and it'll move back one it'll place stone then it'll go down and place water it'll move back and then it'll do build it on mark and then it'll move back two more blocks and it'll trace pack with tnt builder the on chat when you type canon chat it'll run the whole first this is uneven ground so you can see the water getting out from underneath okay okay flip the lever this should work yeah yes this will work the the back need to explode so the front tft can go forward okay so let's get martin t please this is a stone slab and thank you for you okay look we got some apples oh apples yummy apples okay so let's switch them over again switch it off okay boom boom just a little higher it feels like a little bit make more tea like but you can't do it over here it'll like be more power because it's more tnt boosted right okay that's enough flip it flip it wow so far it's right there okay one more time three shots two one more try i thought we would we could do it on another place okay go down and just put one three three okay now let's go flip flip oh just stay there i think i need to like put only one over here but double you can do i can do double what do i do it's floating tnt fine i'll stick to my original idea like that because that won't work i don't think so okay last time okay please work please work oh two you can barely see the dash because oh because we already did like the same thing so it'll hit the same place new tree house over here there's like three kinds of wood yeah that kind of one this kind of wood and this kind of one yeah and a brochure yeah well it's at an exploding range yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
