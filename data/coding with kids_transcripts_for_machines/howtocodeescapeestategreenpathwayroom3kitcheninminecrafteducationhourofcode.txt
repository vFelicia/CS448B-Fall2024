welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew did I wear a Minecraft education Edition and in the hour of code Escape estate so we just completed this room the study in the last video and now we're gonna go through this door okay so now we went out we can't go there oh that's that's really nice friend okay oh where are we yeah because there's a zombie chef and there's wheat and stuff here this is cooking machines okay so now let's talk to the zombie chef he wants bread instead of brains I just said Brad Wow Let's go to Cohen do you see what I saw something on the wall like it says wheat number one and then chop it up two three you add some flour and then cook and bacon maybe that's how we make yeah the zombie Chef needs help making bread you see function below to create a bread recipe with zombie Chef can follow these are four functional Velda available that represent the different steps in Breaking Bread so yeah these are stuff harvest wheat so you first harvest the wheat um break the bread is the last thing make dough so this like um making the dough right here the third and middle wheat is the second so this is a code example let's see what is this fun okay zombie Chef got a wheat item then oh that doesn't work I can't make the the something the bread so he got the wheat he did it in the wrong steps yeah so now let's see okay so now chefs always want always keep a copy of the recipes around I wanna know where the zombie Chef had theirs figure out the correct steps then program a recipe for the zombie Chef to follow okay so this is not my recipe I saw on the wall is the correctness okay so first you need to get the wheat okay harvest wheat and then Mill weed is second so medium Mill wheat over here XX so the middle wheat was the last one now we press space and then after harvest we we did Mill weed okay and then make dough and bake bread that's right okay now we're gonna run it and see if the zombie Chef makes bread okay some Chef gets weak okay milk and milk get sugar sugar oh he's gonna cook it oh bread puzzle song wait what's this now it's something creepy there's a bunch of zombies coming on and there's something they're on platforms okay let's see what this has we have apples okay the whole house is hungry that's his family and what better to feed it than Apples salmon and mushroom stew see if you can figure out how many how many of each ingredient the house needs requires use the free house function to Define what items you want to feed it so um the options are Apple mushroom stew and salmon so let's see um oh top one needs money through the middle the bottom one needs Apple in the middle one needs salmon okay let's see what those like each of them have like different color example let's see the house four apples and one mushrooms too free oh it drops out of the thing oh it spits them no it's not a house oh it's not right eating it that's a whole face yeah it doesn't want it that's okay let's see this one is just with the um yeah it's a repeat Loop but it does just the same exact thing as this one yeah so yeah the repeat Loop will help us so it has it is the same thing crunch ooh crunch no it doesn't want that okay so now zombie chefs are holding food while they ride by on platters there seems to be a pattern here I wonder if they are here to feed the house figure out how many each food item the house wants them write a program to feed the house the correct amount Okay so so oh two mushrooms okay free apples and four salads okay okay free house so was free apples so we're gonna do four Iron Range to like um to Lucy's over here okay so for Iron Range we're gonna do it three times for apples free time for apples so I'm just gonna delete this because we just need apples for Iron Range free house apples do a tab so it's inside the um the loop and then it needs free apples two apples two stews so we can do just like do feed house um two stews and then like repeat it but we're just gonna do the loop it's the same amount of um code so fee house mushrooms do mushrooms no it doesn't look it's only the space mushrooms too it has a space right there okay and then feed the house four what is it four yeah salmon bead house it looks like a horse honestly song make sure you spell everything right or else it won't go correctly okay now let's feed them free okay apples mushroom and then some crunchy it's blushing cool so for the next video we're gonna see what is going on here zombie Wither Skeleton regular skeleton and Creeper all sitting at a table ready for dinner oh there's a diary page let's see this first entry free the kitchen dear diary today I stumble upon a large dining area here I found a frightening creature looming in the kitchen seemingly obvious of my presence when I gained the courage to speak with thee um with the with the chef it only grown bread there I help this goalish cook perhaps if I do it can show me the way out so that is like somebody who wrote it when it first met the zombie show so in the next video we're gonna help these four creatures these four mobs in doing something looks like something with the dishes anyways well that was fun and that's it for today
