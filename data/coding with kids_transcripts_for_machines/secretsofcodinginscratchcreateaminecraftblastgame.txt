welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch account techno 468 so today i'm going to show you my remix called minecraft blast so originally it was just a ball blast and this is here let's shoot mob heads and then you get you get golden okay so i'm sure you're watching so first in the player hit box is like basically a canon it was originally a canon and i changed it into a bow because that was like the only shooting thing that fitted originally it was just bullets so here i changed it into a minecraft arrow which fits the bow and then when you level up you get the trident then the balls which were like originally these number balls you're gonna shoot the ball until the number goes down to zero and then it'll pop and go into smaller like slime spike so first the ball is creeper it'll creep your the code like changes the creeper heads color so it might not be like this green one not like a usual one and then the second kind of doll is a zombie head then and the coins and changes so here there are coins so first this first simple coin was supposed to be a regular coin i change it into a golden and go and the second one into diamond because like it fits the original coin's color and then the third one lap is loose then in the skin player i just changed it into a bow so these were basically like shooting animations by just did this okay then the thumbnail was originally ball bass you can kind of see the white shadow to make it like pop out so i did minecraft blast over here and then the sprites this is where i got my sprites here i also changed the tight okay so now let's play so i'm gonna go first this way i might have escaped them but when andrew goes to level two i'm gonna play i'm not so good but final ball already now you go to level two so level two is like harder and there are more balls with more numbers now you can upgrade yes thirteen so so when you upgrade your coins you get like different like diamonds is oh no i thought i thought i would dodge it i saw two two on arrows i i think the two arrows are like more stronger oh this is so much harder than what i did final ball is a two that's so easy now 16 oh the 12 was too big and harder well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
