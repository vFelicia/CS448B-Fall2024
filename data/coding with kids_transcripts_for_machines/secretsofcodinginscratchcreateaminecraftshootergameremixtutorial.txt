welcome to curtin with kids my name is clea and my name is andrew today we're in my account called kid gekko in scratch and this is my project called minecraft shooter game because it was a remix yeah so i change over here it's supposed to be ghost but i change it into a creeper and you have to shoot these down you have to shoot the creepers down bad creeper one time when i played minecraft my a creeper right explode right in front of me and i almost died but luckily i have a i had a tow mid of undying but i lost my toenail dying that's why i don't like creepers i had to erase because um when i uploaded this picture it had a lot of white around it you can see it's transparent and there will be no right and then i have this and ghost and potion the arrow was supposed to be a diamond yeah a diamond and i really like it doesn't really look like a book because i erased some parts of it because it's i'm not a very bad eraser then tnt the creeper strategy because you know both of them explodes yeah so the originally the ghost shoot potions right yeah i don't know why then the line what's the line creeper so like the enemy yeah i also changed the health it was supposed to be 10 it was so hard so i changed it to 15 and when if there's still no creepers it may still shoot chance out of nowhere yeah so it's hard you also change the backdrop background right yeah is there any code in the background yes it's messages so when you get them okay uh wait wait where is it where is it okay so if you touch a tnt it will minus one health if you touching the creeper minus two so it's easy but you well the creeper go down so if you shoot a creeper you need them yeah before you before they touch you you can win but what if you shoot them they go down right what if they touch you you lose help that's harder but they like go straight down you can move away very fast and it's hard to move away so you uploaded the all the things right yeah creeper alex zero and tnt and the backdrop yeah backdrop let's play it let's see i lose i just added the loot you lose and you win you win wow let's play it okay kalia goes first space to shoot the arrows right and left arrow keys to move yeah there's 27 creepers yeah you have 14 health sometimes you can shoot two or three years i keep getting the tnt you you lose when you lose all your health and um uh you win by shooting all the creepers or the creeper you have one more o you lose look when you press again you do it again but you have to wait my turn oops you're a minus oh you're six five free oh shoot oh no wait see 27 creepers no no creeper touching me no oops don't touch the tnt now 10 held better than you at least the first row is the hardest because like they're so close so like you don't have not much time to escape i missed every creeper oh shoot my house my advice is to try to shoot the first roll of creeper then the second roll of creeper then stir from the flavor let's do white when i try to press the um restart button the creeper automatically responds you should add some music later yeah you're two more health no touch a creeper or two tnt i gotta say goodbye oh bye bye you touched the tnt i have something to change how to change the health to 20 choose the health to 20 yeah okay alex and code yeah and go up and twenty two zero okay let's play it again one more time no creepers down in one shot yeah it's really rare i really want to get out of here yeah oh no okay let's stop it and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
