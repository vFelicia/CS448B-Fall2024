welcome to calling with kids my name is kelly and today i'm gonna teach you python so first we already have a file string convert dot py so first we're gonna type first value equals in put then quotes then we're gonna do second value second value equals and put second number set two sum equals first value plus second value then print sum some some some colors plus string string string sum so here we need to type a string because this is a string two so let's say with ctrl s and run it p y s string first number bob if we do bob it will have an error because it it it is not a number first number 45 second number if we type not a number again it will do an error true so 89 plus 789 equals 878 that really worked now let's delete this then numeric oopsies numeric value you e equals seven then print numeric value dot is numeric then then save it with ctrl s and run it true because this is a number then let's do string string value u equals bob bob bob let's save it and i forgot something pranked print print string value dot is numeric now we can save it and run it true false because this is not a number that actually worked because this is bob is actually not a number so print false then we need a print call i mean yeah then one two three dot is so this function will do if it's false or true if this is a number or a letter in the out of it so a b c d e o g the whole alphabet let's save it and run it true because um one two three is a number let's try one two three one two e save it and let's see if this works it's true because it is a number and an alphabet then print is alph so this checks if it's a letter in the alphabet oh yeah i forgot should be back it's here brackets go save it i always forgot to forget to save it don't know why lph a yep then now we can save it and now we can run it true because this is in the alphabet now let's try one does it work don't don't now let's do print is this one is not um it is checking if it's a number yeah if it's a number so a check if it's not a number i'll print false but it if it is a number it print true one two three ctrl s to save it and now we can run it it's true but if we type let's see uh f ctrl s false because it's not a number then print tie is tight tall so this will check if it's a title so um the first letter of the word the first word in the first in the sentence it should be capitalized so that it's false how about this control s planet true because um this is capitalized now to make it easier we can just delete this because the next function will be just like this is upper is up so over here it will check if it's all uppercase so h a duh it's all uppercase so i'll print up um uh true true but if i change the a into a lowercase it will respond or fall false oops false because this is not capitalized the next one will be just like this but lowercase lower oopsies i mean w's this has to be all lowercase but if i save this and run it it'll print false because these two are not lowercase save it and let's test it false but if we change these two into a lowercase it will print a true next first value first value equals first number first number then if value i mean first value first value dot is numeric numeric two equals false then print value i mean is not a number then if you're a fast paper because the second value is just like the first value you can just copy and paste it it's the fastest way but first you need it exit the exit function oopsies then we can copy and paste control fee so the first changing to the second second second value equals second number hmm please it's ready if first value it will equals into second then print first value equals which is integer first value you can copy and paste this one to just change the first and two seconds we just need to do this into a second yeah here let's change into a second first value plus second value then print some plus whoopsies over here string oopsies tr sum we need to put this into string but if we don't have the string it's a integer because this is a string two let's save it and then run it first number bob value is not a number see if it's not a number it will stop so let's do it again first number 56 second number 45 sum 101 next one it will be just like this one so first we just need to change so now just the last one is like this one so we just need to delete this code here first delete this and this then this then this then change over here it will be first value first value is then over here or oopsies or second value dot is is murrick and this will be the other code so let's save it so over here it will check if one of them is bob or not a number it will stop so let's go first number bob second number it will won't stop until um we type the second number second number six if value is not number because first number is not a ball is a not a number it's bob so let's do it with 33 bob this will happen too so let's do first number 78 second number 90 it equals 168 that worked and
