so today we're in hour of code the villager and the elders so the basic story is that there are two villages the villager village and the elder village so they knew how to live together without the the help of the other village so now we are uniting them for six tests so today we're gonna go in to the villager village and we're going to go fix the farm so we're going to go past the rangers maybe they look so scary and then go past this bridge so we're going to talk to this farmer villager so the farmer says something keeps tearing up our beef oh no i'll just bet it's that scary ravager those illegals keep as a pet they keep denying about who else would do this you think you could build a fence around the farm to keep that rage out from star activity so you can see foxes over there so there are real things that keep on destroying these villagers somewhere impressive and we can give we can the agent can give itself bars on bars which we need to build the fence and the agent can place the bars down okay so first we're gonna do how many steps one two three four five and we need to do five so first for i range then we do five so repeat five times we'll do an agent dot give our bars bars comma one so because it will p then do agent dot move forward so we'll go forward because right now standing on the stone block we don't want it to build the fence on the stone block we're gonna build it on the wood blocks so then we're gonna do forward forward and then we're going to do agent dot place iron bar so now two two one so we're gonna do music let's see here's where i'm gonna do a comma and here comma okay that was place one down and place one down so we don't want to place forward this one block okay so i missed this one but we'll go back okay now we have three arm fences here so now i'm gonna change the direction is it still five i'm usually from five yes so now you go go and go left so we're gonna change the forward the left so now we have another side completed okay so now yeah move left one more time so it stands on a stone block okay okay so now we're gonna do that code again and we're gonna change the left to backwards okay so it moves back up here well the engine won't crash herself because you code it to do whatever it's supposed to do do this okay so now when you move backward again one more time i'm going to do things like that move okay so now we have one more side so we're going to do that code again this time i'm going to do right so i'm going to change the left to right okay so now it's another side completed so again me and move one more time left oops okay so now we have one more blocks we need to do let's move forward and then place the iron is down fusion.give our bar to one and then agent dot place one down okay okay oops we're gonna place these fences down okay so now we have completed it and talk to so the caretaker says thanks to the fence around the villagers farm we discovered it wasn't the ravage digging up the beach but a pack of fox that were the real culprits then the caretaker says the villagers learned how important it is to get the facts before making assumptions or treasures don't forget to check on your tree so now trees the foxes can't go inside to eat the beetle anymore so now we're going to look at our tree so now it's growing oh i just saw like a little shadows of it yeah now it's literally it's growing up very big out of the top can't burst out the stone is very very big so the elders and villagers are now starting to more work together and be friendly to each other again create a big community yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
