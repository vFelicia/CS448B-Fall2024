welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're back with education 101 lesson six so first we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says we are trying to further develop the capabilities of the agent by making a language triangle for now we are still in the testing phase with simulated environments however as soon as the code is finished the agent can be deployed to the developer so the developer says i need to write some code that will make the agent stop start wait for two seconds depending on the track can you write some code to make the agent wear the lights try to help the agent follow track so first here we do it so the agent will try to detect something agent detection dot block so try to protect the block so which direction so let's left so the agent will try to detect block to its left then if it detects the block to its left now we are okay so there are blocks to its left so go forward so go forward until the gold block so now we're in part two the red light okay so now here if not we're gonna add enough so if not so if the agent does not detect the block to its left it okay so it doesn't detect the block so move forward and you'll move then it detects this red block so it'll stop at this gold block okay finally we're at part three so now we have the yellow light okay so then do another f here so i'm going to do if asian oops if agent dot detect a gent detect detection dot block to its left still left then we're gonna loop 2 000 so here it will pause for 2 000 milliseconds so that means two seconds yeah then finally after it pauses because it's the yellow light dot move forward one time okay so now okay so first it pauses and then after pauses it goes to this now we're going to activity 2 i'm going to talk to the programmer so the programmer says i need to write some code that will give the agent the ability to navigate street corners by looking at the signs however it never turns in the correct direction can you write some code to make the agent aware of the signs okay so let's go for a station here and there's a sign here and then let me stop the old block okay so now we're going to try to help the agent to follow signs okay so first we have two variables that they give us so there's a variable called left it was blue glazed terracotta and right is pink glazed terracotta okay so first um for index and range and it has to be we repeat it nine times okay so for index and range nine times we are going to do if h is agent dot detect inspect inspect inspect so there's another function so the agent will try to inspect something it just don't inspect agent is fiction spectrum so here we do two equal signs so we're gonna see if the block is the left variable which is blue glazed terracotta okay then we're gonna do agent dot turn left turn left underscore return so the agent will turn left and follow the sign okay now let's run okay so there's a sign right there so here also else this one inspect asian inspection dot block forward equals equals right so now i'm going to check the right if it doesn't see the if it doesn't see since if it doesn't inspect the blue glazed terracotta it'll go to the lf which it'll inspect right which is pink glazed terracotta and if it does it'll do okay so now let's run so it turns turns again and does its final turn okay so now we're gonna go to 2d3 and we'll talk to the ai developer so the ai developer says i'm trying to make the engine navigate through these obstacles the eyes get stuck in the corner to the right and can't get up can you write some code that will get the agent from this randomly generated course so here is the force and the agent needs to try to not crash into anything and go to this block okay so now we're gonna help the agent to avoid avoid obstacles okay so we're gonna write some code to make the agent detect and import randomly placed blocks as it moves through the course to do this and if else conditional with an lf conditional imagery for the if condition use two agent detect command swift pan and not an operator in retrieve for the lf condition use two asian detect commands with an antenna operator in retrieve example two conditions with an and not operator agent dot detect vision detection the block direction and not agent dot detect agent detection that block direction okay so first we have 18 that moves left one right detect that detect agent dot detection dot block left so we're gonna change it forward to left agent dot move left one time so which is this one i'm just going to read that then here we're going to do lf agent dot detection no detect dot agent okay this one and agent dot detect so detect agent detection block left okay then um let's go agent yeah okay so is there are rockets so we can also do a little bit there are two steams cool they have that detection thingy too okay so now finally we're going okay so now we're back at the beginning well that was fun and that's it for today thank you
