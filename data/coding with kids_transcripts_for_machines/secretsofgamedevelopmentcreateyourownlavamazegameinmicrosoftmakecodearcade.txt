welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in microsoft make code arcade so this is a game i made called lava maze and right now the time running so let's stop it so we're gonna give you a sample how it works okay i hope i can get to the wall oops i'm good at this okay now let's tell you about the clip so you can go to javascript or python let's go to buffer first and javascript drop script doesn't have much code here okay now on start set my sprite to spread this kind of image a player then move the sprite buttons over here or the arrows on your computer then set title map which is the map over there to a lava maze with a water right there let's pause it and then camera follow sprites so the camera you'll always see where your sprite is coming this dark countdown 60 seconds we'll also place my sprite on top of random yeah so you but you won't go on top of the lava or the water you can go on the black yeah somewhere near the lava or maybe near the water then how you lose is that your sprite kind of player overlaps the lava then at any lava at location then game over at lose and place down power down until done neat you know that you lost so if the player touches the lava you lose yeah then on sprite of kind of player overlaps the water oh you're safe at location game over as wind when you press door when it can change or lose and you have no way of winning then play sound power up will you lose if the timer runs out yeah it will be much trickier if i set the timer into 20 seconds let's see if i will say i it's gonna be kind of hard without touching the lava before the timer runs out and going oh so close yeah when you it's like under 10 seconds that thing will blank i'm gonna win under 10 seconds 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 see it's blinking it's blinking because you need to pee faster i always press okay your turn angry i want to set it back to 60 seconds okay set it back to 60 seconds a little bit easier hey it's not here it's we're on start 60 seconds okay now i'm gonna play it will you success oh you're trapped yeah so sometimes you might go into my trap up there which you can't go because you're lava so i can fix that by going to the title map right here right here you can go to erased so about i think these two will be good and then when you spawn over here i don't think you're gonna spawn here you can just do but it might be kind of hard because there's a low chance you're gonna spawn there okay now let's do it you do it andrew you do it okay okay okay this is kind of easy because i remember the whole maze sometimes maybe you're too fast so i recommend you not too fast slowly a little bit steady go go yeah confetti confetti uh confetti and thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
