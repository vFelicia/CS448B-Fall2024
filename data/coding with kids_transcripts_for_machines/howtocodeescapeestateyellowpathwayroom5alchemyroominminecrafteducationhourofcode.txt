welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition and in the Isle of code Escape esting so in the last video we made the agent open the yellow door for us and now we are gonna go into the yellow door bye bye so now let's see what room we get teleport loading yellow bricks agent wait before you go I need to tell you one last thing this house is built of Escape rooms you'll need to find clue soft puzzles and fix cool to make your way up pressing to review the puzzles code round the code to see what happens and there are errors fix the code and run like it again to test it this is called sometimes Solutions won't be clear and not all puzzles will take code to solve when you find the positive remembering to run the code first to see what's wrong then deep up and fix the faulty it's much easier than writing code from scratch do you have an IR for closer is particles to help guide you okay so let's go search room for particles first let's explore the University so there's like wool here and then there are like the dispensers above the wool and then there's a school entry five the ultimate dear diary as my journey through the manor continues I'm starting to see that this is no ordinary match for example today I found a room dedicated to make potions not something you see every day and yet I can't shake the feeling that I've been here before so this is a room where you make potions okay so let's put some particles right oh there's glass is there it's a agent thing I think it's a ball clay ball it's a brown okay let's go to cook the ball to the gold blocks so it can open up the door to the next section use the clay ball move function to navigate the ball through the wall you can do it up down left and right okay so this is a cool example it won't solve it for us but just show us what it do it goes left and then right okay so when you make it on top of the gold blocks and there's a door right there so we need to move the clay ball all the way to on top so let's go back to coding and so this is the same thing but it's just like in a repeat Loop you can use sure to code to do the same thing as long okay so let's see what we have to do so first I think we need to do the left to be next to the gold block I think actually we have to like move the whole whole round so like go here and it go up move and then go down oh yeah because the barrels are blocking the first one it goes to right to be next to the wall so when you go right two times so clay about move right two times already did that but then we have to change it to move up and see how many times one to move up two times so clay ball move up two times okay so now let's test it let's see so right okay now all we need to do is reach the door which is left one two three four four times so we can do the um we can do the repeat Loop so we don't need to use that much code so for Iron Range four to repeat it four times we will do a clay ball move left so it can move left four times so now let's see so now when you go one block down so you can reach the handle the now remember to delete the tab yeah move down so now we should we completed it is soft do not open the door and then went through the door so now there's another puzzle very cute what is it clay Gollum it became a gold it has a weird face it has a weird face it's another pressure plates okay let's see what we need to do another right block okay Pitfall whoa legs no one rolling over for the skull we need to help it's we need to help it safely navigate to the gold ball when the Golem moves onto the pressure plate the block it needs retracts for retracts for a moment if we wait it seems to come back you see move column forward function to move the column and the weight function to make it wait for the block to come back so it's like when we press the like go on top of the pressure plate the block will go down so if we keep on moving forward the clay Golem will fall down so we have to wait for the block to come back up okay so let's see what this code does okay okay moves forward until another word block comes back okay now so there are Pistons that move the netheroid boss activated by the pressure plates so you can wait for the Red Zone signal from the pressure plate to stop then the block will come back okay so let's go back okay so go here so um the first one move forward this code works and then we have to move forward again two times so the next pressure plate so we can actually just repeat this two times and then move column forward one more time so we can delete this way okay and then we do the repeat Loop for eye in range two times and then add tabs so we can make it inside the repeat Loop so be repeated um these code for two times okay then we just need a move column forward one more time remove column forward okay so now let's see wait wait the block comes back three seconds three one two three okay I'll still need one more oh wait right oh we need to move one more time oopsies move column forward so now let's run it and then we should we should reach to this one two blue one two three puzzle saw oh it went away go I went through another one it's called it's over here it has a whole body now wow now there's like a recipe okay let's search room for particles Nether wart fermented spider eye and Phantom membrane these are all uh ingredients in certain potions oh wait the recipe over here oh it shows how much we need of each just the steps okay we delete this okay just delete this and then delete this and then attack it smells like one two and then three oh green green so now there's stuff coming out sick and to the next room so we solve the room so is I oh why is there air up there that's cool it's like air conditioning or something okay say goodbye to the club bye oh there's air oh it's for us to levitate to go up here oh so now it's the next room in the next video we're gonna enter this door well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
