welcome to pretty much kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch in andrew's account techno468 so today i'm going to show you my project among us hide and seek so it's not really hide and seek but it's something let's show you it well profoundly remember to love and save okay now let's see so there's a o2 which is the background and i uploaded it from google then there's an avatar which is the imposter and just call it the imposter yeah because you only need to find one of them so when green flag clicked ill forever if mouse down so if you click and touch it mouse wonder so if like you're clicking on the imposter it will show because it's hiding then you'll say whoa you found me remember to love and faith and then stop everything because you just supposed to find him and the game ends and i also play a song lying to me and then when green flecks like it'll go to random position so it'll go to random spot every time you run it and it'll hide so to the scribble i also drew it just a scribble when green flag select wait one second and then glide 0.5 seconds to the imposter so start in the middle and then collide that means go to the imposter somewhere near the imposter then you click around the scribble to find the imposter so if we didn't have this scribble then it would be like super duper hard to find the imposter because the imposter would be anywhere and there's no clue where he will be so now let's play oh i found him you found me 1911 okay please turn clap clock crack crap let's see can i play it one more time i found he was on the edge of the a screen yeah pet hamster well it's a little bit easy but it's okay well that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
