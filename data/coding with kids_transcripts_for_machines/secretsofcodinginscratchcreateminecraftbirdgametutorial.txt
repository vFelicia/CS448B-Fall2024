welcome to coding with kids my name's clean and my name is andrew today we're in scratch and in andrews account techno468 so this is my pro remixed project called minecraft bird so originally it was a flappy bird so i changed it into minecraft thing so let's see so i'm gonna do normal click click click click click poppy bird oops i guess it's going to zoom because i accidentally fell to the ground so let's see what i changed so first i was changing the the flappy bird the bird into steve but then i changed it into pear so there are two costumes so it can like change color color so there's this one and this one they're both blue yeah so then i did the logo so there's the minecraft word so when you run it you can see the name this little block then it says minecraft bird because that's the name of the project and then i also switched the backdrop so there are two backdrops so the second backdrop which is this one is for the hard mode so hard mode is a little hard yeah very almost impossible yeah the mode is basically called impossible and this is for the easy moves that's all my change and now let's play oh i explained the pipe cleaner's turn i'm gonna do it ready go click click my turn oh i slammed the pipe let's do it impossible one more time oops i accidentally so like you can see it's like much faster and the pipes are red so it's like a bit creepier because it's impossible mode so you can try it out yourself down below well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
