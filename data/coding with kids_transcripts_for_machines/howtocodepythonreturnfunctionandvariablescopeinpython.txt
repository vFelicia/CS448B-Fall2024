welcome to including with kids my name is colleen and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you pi farms so today we're going to learn about defining a function so first we're going to do def add numbers x and y so def is basically defined and we're defining a function called add two numbers so as the name tells you the function will add two numbers x and y so you can like type two numbers for x and y then it will return x plus y so basically it'll get the answer next we're going to do add two numbers four and six but this will this will do nothing because there's no print inside the defining function and if you use return which the answer is 10 and you capture the answer inside a variable so that's what we're going to do result which is variable equals add two numbers the function five and seven so the answer is twelve so basically it's result equals 12 then i'm going to print result which is 12. so save it and run it well because 5 if you just run the function like add 2 numbers four and six it'll do something but you can't see the function doing it next we're gonna do def create deck so now we're gonna define a function called create deck so it has free lists suits equals hearts spades clubs and diamonds ranks equals two three four five six seven eight nine ten jack queen king and ace then deck equals two square brackets which is an empty list so our checklist will store the cards with the deck and the ranks and suits we're going to use these two lists to make the deck of cards so nixon will use the four statements for suit and suits that means basically for each item in suits for rank and rank so we're going to put a force name inside for steam i'll do deck.append so a pen is a list helper function now add a card or item to your list extra rank of suit so the first time runs this in the suits list it will be checking the item hearts and for the ranks list it will be checking the item two so i'll append the item or card two of hearts and then i'll keep making cards until the last card ace of diamonds then we'll return the deck and we're gonna do my deck equals create deck so we use a variable to capture the create deck function again and so it's basically my deck equals then the card the deck of cards and then print len my deck so then is a function that will tell us the the length of something and here is the item so a deck of cards has 52 cards so basically print 52 so save it and run so that's 52 just as we thought so next we're going to do def sum function so it's silly that the name is called sum function then we'll do a variable called value equals 10 and return value want to print value so now let's see what happens so that error name value is not defined so the value inside the sum function while defining it you can only use that variable while you're defining it if you want to use a variable that has the same name out of while defining a function you may state it again so next we're going to do value equals one so now we have a variable called value the same as value equals 10 but outside while defining function so now we're still going to print value so now let's see if it prints 10 or 1. so yeah so printed one because we did not call the sum function or and we did not capture the return in the sum function so it just had the value out of the defining function so it's 1. finally we'll do some after print value which is one we're going to call the function sum function then we're going to print value so still print one because the sum function you didn't capture it because it returned the value but you didn't capture it so still one they're gonna do value which is a variable so you can restate variables equals some function so now we capture the sum function so when it returns the value it turns value into 10 so at the last print value will be 10 so it's going to print 1 110 so save just as we guessed and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
