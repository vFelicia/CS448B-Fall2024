welcome to coding with kids my name is cleia my name is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition and in the hour of cod Escape esate so it says click the logo to begin so let's click it Minecraft presents Escape estate so right now we're in the woods let's see it's a person I think it's us okay so let's see we go into somewhere okay anyways welcome welcome the following tutorial will teach you the basics of navigating Minecraft so we're just going to skip the tutorial because we already know how to use Minecraft but if you don't you can start the tutorial on Minecraft yourself okay so we're going to skip the tutorial okay let's see so now there's a man in a suit called Dr Bowski hello I'm Dr DOD Bowski I see you've received my invitation do you think you have what it takes to Escape the Mansion by Dawn and claim the 1 million emeralds excellent now head to the front door to begin your challenge let's go so we have to complete um a CH uh some sort of challenge or a set of challenges to get 1 million emeralds what's happening so the house is turning into a monster and then it's swallowing Us in that's weird okay so now we're in the house and we search room for particles so there seems to be something in underneath it's the agent hello is someone there oh my a human do you think you could help me I can't seem to open this floor I think my code may be broken do you think you could take a look and see what's wrong with it great if you can get me out of here I will return the favor and help you escape the attic which programming language would you like to use so we're going to use pipon okay first see that cursor over there on this floor it needs to move for three blocks to reach your trap door but it isn't working press C to view the code okay so we need to move the cursor to the trap door and open it so add a tutorial Green Path part one the box with the arrow on the floor is your cursor you use the cursor to liulate blocks to solve puzzles throughout the experience in this activity you use it to open the trap door and release the agent use move cursor function to POS the cursor and open trap door function to open the trap door you have selected so only valid move we have right now is orange okay so let's see the code example it's going to move the cursor two times and open the trap door but we're not under the trap door yet so we mean so I think we need to move three times okay let's see code here so let's add one more so you can also use a repeat Loop but we're just going to do it okay Orange so now it should the trap door should get to the trap door and open it okay open great it's open that's strange I still can't seem to get out can you check the code again and make sure I'm moving up two blocks okay so now it's called MPC so now we have to move the agent up two blocks to get out of the uh trapo okay let's see now the TR that the trap door is open you need to move the hent up two blocks to set it free use the H use the agent. move function to move the agent up the agent. move function takes one parameter that defines what direction it should move so we can move forward back left right up or down so let's see the code example it's going to move the agent one time but needs to move up two times okay so let's see we have to add one right here agent. move up okay up okay so the agent moves up two times thank you you fixed my coat now I'm in range to open the green door for you the path Behind the Green Door is an easier one you can take that path or talk to me again if you want to try opening the yellow door so we're going to try opening the yellow door so let's talk MPC so you want to try opening the yellow door for that I'll need more power luckily I can charge off of the Moonlight all we have to do is open the skylet above huh my code isn't working right try check in the my code to make sure that all four traps in ceiling or opening okay so let's look the cursor is on the on the roof now so now we need to open all four trap do okay so now we have more directions we have magenta which moves the cursor back blue which moves the cursor left and yellow right and orange forward okay so let's see the code example so it's yellow yellow yellow so opens one but it goes out of the thing okay so you can also use the repeat Loop for the same thing okay so over here let's see so open trap door move cursor yellow yellow okay so first we have to do a open trap door between the yellow and orange so do open trapdoor function then we're going to do another orange to get to the next trapo so now we're going to run it okay so now we got to the third trapo we have we have to open it and go to to we have to move blue so first open trapo and then we're going to do move cursor we're going to do blue and then we're going to do that two times move cursor blue finally we're going to open the trapo so we open the last trap door run it let's open okay let's see open the first one open the second one open the third one oh see move tyo okay let us St so now um the agent is drawing power from the Moonlight Wow way to go I've opened the yellow door for you now head through if you like or if you really want a challenge talk with me again to try opening the red door so we really want a challenge so let's open let's talk to it again we need to work together to get into the red door it will only open if I'm standing on the Gold Blocks let's give it a try can't get there how about a little help there th okay his code never works okay so here we have iron blocks blocking the way to the gold blocks gold block and there's a l so now we need to move the agent to move on the gold blocks but first it says to open the red door both you and the agent will have to work together flip the Leever to bring up the Iron Wall then move the agent then we have to left click then the Iron Wall will raise okay now the asent can move okay so let's see the coding sample so it's just going to move forward so this is the shorter way so you have to use a repeat loot let's see how many blocks we need it go one 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 let's try I think it's 18 No 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 it's just 14 okay let's try 14 okay so here we can delete all all of them except one so all of them okay you can delete one and then um do the repeat Loop but we can just delete all them and then make the rep Loop so remember to leave a tab inside the repat loop okay so now that should work and he the agent will go go on the gold blocks okay all the doors are open now choose the path you want to take each path has a different difficulty green is easier red is harder and yellow is somewhere in between so long human perhaps our past will cross again someday so in the next video we're going to go into that red door look the gold blocks turn red block yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe
