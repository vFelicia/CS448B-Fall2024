welcome to creating with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in code.org and this is my project called kalius minecraft 2 because it's called two because i have another video about my kalia minecraft so this is number two yeah when they spawned they made a lot of noises because i coat them too okay here goes the chicken so you can move your player with um your arrow keys on your computer or your fingers like you can drag steve if you're or press b yeah or if you're on a mobile device okay this you can tap the screen to look attack or use something uh well the kind of explorer but it will explode at night okay now let's review the code we when run spawn creeper every mob in here all up so you need to go up when you like crush the one then creeper one spot please sound chicken cluck why we want to make it confusing but there's already another chicken you will see drop gun powder because when creepers explode they actually drop gun powder in minecraft so when used flash explode when attacked flash explode one day add one score because you survived a creeper then one night at one score because you survived again but what if the creeper disappeared it dies and then you won't get a score that's sad yes because when spawn it won't add you a score so night spawn zombie and everything down so it will be near the house make it bigger make it bigger this is where they will spawn okay bigger then one day spun everything in the middle i think it's about boiling debbie i think this is about where here yeah because i always see a sheep always one next to the minecraft one it was i was very confused that i thought it was the cow whistling moon but it was actually the angola there's also a cow oh yeah they play different sounds then when touch drop iron ingot because the angle is made of iron but there's no iron block here so i do it i ain't got when used attack when attacked attack payback time one day attack i mean add one score because you're survived one night add one score disappear so they don't won't look woo the city i mean then zombie when spawned play creeper but there's also a creeper so they're playing the original sounds yeah but they're not but they're so one touch dropped diamonds and everybody will attack the zombies yeah then you'll get rich which i wish when used attack so it it will move one step forward you did yeah when zombie killed me in minecraft because i was hitting it with my hand like clearly down the same thing as attack because payback time one day i was going one night i was gonna disappear because that's what they drop slash explode flash explode a sheep will explode in my grass then one day eight and one school one night at one school disappear bye bye they all explode or attack you oh yeah i forgot the chicken chicken place down block collect because i didn't find any sound i want you can just do a chicken sand there we have a step farmland or something punch that's about just punching a block yeah it's a block place the same second yeah would break what break that's walking on board or something yeah well i have a pump uh that thing sounds good one touch drop egg because chicken and minecraft lay eggs then flash explode this one chicken can flash explode and attack because it's payback isn't that obvious then add one score and disappear because one night it doesn't add one to school yeah like this byebye and this is byebye to you one spawn plays down drop milk no buckets attack attack it can't attack you but it won't move forward you then add one score and i explode so you might not want to be close a cow when you think it's almost night in this minecraft now let's run it okay that's a loud sound but i always just hear a sheep and a stomach so these zombie explosions well it's oh this attack yeah those explosions can't remove the blocks but it can't remove the ground yeah okay your guys will help yeah and you can spawn i better get there you can it's near your house it's always there right now that pumpkin you can't sleep here yeah but you can open the door and go in your house okay cow oh attacked yeah it's morning keep attacking the clown keep attacking the cow oh because the angolan will die and it just did because the cow attacked it too much but in my real minecraft a cow can't attack yeah that's how just how my minecraft is okay that my creeper explodes why do i need to get so far you only only get hurt by the explosion here if you're two blocks close to it yeah so it won't be oh i have to attack you but there's nothing in front of it okay let me get this sometimes i like to exclude my house that's right and minecraft angry sometimes looks relative see when you bump into this sheep it drops wool and it's like it's naked yeah and that's how it's special okay let me show you again see i'm gonna bump into it think you want that it's like a spirit yeah spirit and now mr grow is rule yeah first wood block in the tree you destroy the whole tree and you get a wool plant which you can craft with only one block of wood yeah but here you can't crack anything it attacked me yeah you should be careful because at night the power explode and the chicken explodes too it looks exploding thing i can't get enough of andrew exploding things in the house even at lego time and everything spawns at my house i want to explode the house for some reason or for some reason i want to explode the house but you can't skip until night and angela loves not getting minecraft actually i don't know why but come on great bird i never said i'd like to like minecraft there's a bunch of whole storm uh sometimes you're like okay i'm next oh no not the cow this will explode at night look stand tonight no no i'm not i don't want to kill myself oh diamonds follow you because until you're following me okay i want you to try to explode the house nobody needs spawn close to my house yeah you can just they're all small on the bottom row yeah such a chicken okay well let's do it okay that's great and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye
