welcome to cody with kids my name is and my name is andrew and we're in encoder of course b lesson seven programming in maze so here you see angry bears i want to make a figure and the instructions say play with these blocks to see what they make the bird do get the birds or the pigs to complete the lab so here's red we're gonna use him to smash the page to complete yeah so here are where the blocks where you can you can go up north south east and west but don't bump into obstacles so do we need to go down hmm let's see let's try to go to the tnt no why okay go down go down and go west okay let's run it okay it's going to enchanting exposure it says keep coding something's not quite right yet hmm let's reset maybe we need to go stuff two times two times no because that time when we go itself two times we went to a tnt so we need one more south okay let's try it okay i hope we get to the piggy yay we got a smacky piggy down okay now it says above fix the code to help me get me to the pig okay so let's press run let's see what it says one two we're still stuck to the page do we need to go west east south or north let me add a west let's see will it work it says fix the code to get me to the let's run it and see what it does okay east east east west maybe we need to change the west toward east really let's change it to we know that east will still work so east east east then maybe we have to go to the east again yes let's try one two three four it's the masterpiece now it says add two blocks to get the number to the pitch there's nothing right here so we can do any plot let's do north north but it goes up then south south south then south no i think no but array workspace five blocks that wouldn't work so let's do let's see east east is two easy that's right east it's rocky peak again yippee happy yupi okay let's press continue okay now it says now try this puzzle from the start the pig is right here there's tnt there's very little space should we do east and south east and south let's try it okay yay i see another way let's practice replay we can even do south and east so i'll like switch the code around east let's see if it works south then east yeah yeah there's two ways to solve this puzzle you'd be happy and thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe on youtube bye bye bye
