welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew here we're scratching my account kidnap code 123. in this project i upgraded called minecraft crash game cat via stub version 1.1 so you see that i actually use the background to unfold sleeping very cute and now i'm going to show you what i changed so before you grilled salmon and for the raw salmon if the wolf touches it so if touching wolf it will place sound wolf sound and it will change scores bones will chewed by one so the wolf will get a point if it gets the fish in the raw salmon if touching the wolf is the same code as the um the grilled salmon except it's in another spring so in the um last version the wolf only got pointed if um it got the bone yeah and minus point seven touch the creeper so for the cat's update upgrade um if it is touching the creeper it will play the bite sound even though if a cat doesn't eat a creeper it scares it away um it will change scores slash 50 cat eight it will just be score that's why i just add the score slash fish to cat eight and i change the background to a cute little fox sleeping the other background was just like a normal minecraft background i thought that would be a little bit too lame so i just changed it into a cute box even though if a fox does nothing in this game yeah so let's play to use the last keys for um the box i mean the wall and um i guess the wolf has an advantage because it can get both um fish both fish so that's a advantage which this cat improved in the first round it's because it's because the fish always touches the my enemy fish with the bra so you should just get the creeper yeah but if but if the um solomon touches the um red line then it's going to minus points 15 to 5 again except the timer is 31 seconds which the other one was 41 seconds i guess yeah we took more time in this one okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like and subscribe bye bye
