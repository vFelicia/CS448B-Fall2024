welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia today we're in timecraft So today we're gonna do this one with the dinosaur and yeah so let's press it go to tampon get free interesting in this Thai split it seems that these long neck dinosaurs necks have shrunk it actually now looks weird yeah there must be a clue Left Behind as to what happened I have located a dig site where polenta lodges are discovering dinosaur fossils travel to North America Wilderness in the 18 000s 1800s and discovered whatever and archaeologists dig site North America Wilderness 1800s paleontologist it appears that the creature we have uncovered here had quite a short neck they must have climbed trees that eat their leaves wow climb that's weird yeah look the dinosaur in the dick site is missing its neck bones the culprit must have stolen them we need to put those bones back in place start a mission by using a talk device to teleport the agent to its start on a location so let's go oh that's the head and these and there's something on there wow these head looks yeah look it's a picture it's a picture a picture okay so let's use the top start activity yeah excellent now that a Time agent is replaced let's use code to replace those missing Network clothes see so we're I'm going to be make the bone so that we're gonna Place bone could your agent to destroy the four orange blocks and and place the bone block we've given it so the agent already has the bone blocks in its inventory these blocks locks with bones to make a long neck and our agent has 64 bone blocks okay so that's code so we have to our eggs we have to reach the orange block so we have to move one two two two blocks say agent moves forward by two and then we replace it so we're going to destroy the block destroy down and go right above the orange block then when you place the um please place the bone block down okay so we need to do it one two three four times turn use a repeat Loop and repeat it four times to shorten the code or else we'll have to like do this like do this code four times or press this screen button times yeah okay so let's go so fast fast yeah paleontologist wait this crazy actually had a very long neck it must have used it to reach the laser toss trees fascinating that's weird I think the culprit just replace it okay so amazing work you've repaired this moment in time now paleontology has a more accurate record of life on the earth from the last four billion years okay so let's close it scanning scanning where's the secret height secret from Secret detected so that's oh we're like the search and that we just saw it up here like a gold button okay it's right over there really that's nice oh go down the stairs you found the secret room take note of which time agents you see here and head back to the Institute okay is high jumping three two one okay we're back oh yeah go go pass fantastic work here repair the timeline but just barely now that we have this situation under control meet me at the center of the control room to store your time and get back in their paws okay now these are the cages it's so cool now they're all back in front of you will be the time major storage pods use your talk device to return your agent to your pod oh okay great work not to store everyone except you Yeti you stay right here until we can check you out what's up Yeti He's the bad guy clap clap you figured it out I'm the culprit but you're too late you might have stopped me this time but I'll be back I just said clap with those hands it's like I can't reach like the other hand it broke its cage go I'm fast I can't there's a bear yeah it just disappeared the whole time machine disappeared yeah the whole thing I'm not sure where the copper has gone but we'll find them it's just a matter of time you can go back and try again so here we go time time detected so we can jump off and see when you're ready use your talk device to replay this game oh okay so now here's the bone it's like a big dog bone or if this one and this one together it will make a dog yeah this one also looks like a muscle yeah it looks like muscle and the ones that like the strong guys be like this yeah but this but the green thing is the most weirdest yeah okay so now we're looking at here well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
