today we're in edible so today uh we're gonna do three easy coding challenges with python so edibit is a coding platform where there are lots and lots of problems to solve easy coding languages and there are also different kinds of coding languages you can use so for our first problem is called free coffee cups where each of the six coffee cups I bought I got a seventh cup free I don't know why would anybody buy Six coffee cups or one day that's a lot in total I guess seven cups I know um they are making a party and they need coffee that's to create a function that takes any cost for a bot in return total number of cups of debt so basically we have to calculate how many cups gets extra and then add it to the to the number of Cups he already has so the number of cups I bought plus number of cups I got for free only valid inputs will be given so let's go to code so we have a function called total cuffs and we have a variable called n so first we have to calculate how many three cups we get so we're gonna do three which is a variable equals int n divided by six so we need to turn it into integer by using the end function and we need to do n divided by 6 to see how many three cups we will get then we're going to reduce we're going to turn the 3 into string I'm going to make a variable called string and then we're going to use the string function to turn the free like the number three because we get into a string then we're going to make another variable called total then I'm going to do 3 plus n so here we're going to add the number of coffee cups we already have to the extra like the free coffee cups that we earned that's a lot yeah and then we're going to return the total number of coffee cups we get so while we're checking we're going to see the test cases so here the coffee goes there's one 200 I know the person needs um a lot for a um a cake a coffee cake that's still super much so there's three so here you can't get any extra coffee because because you don't even have six coffee cups so you just returns three there's 213 maybe they need coffee for the whole Army then here you'll get 248 and then um 12 6 goes into 12 two times so you get two coffee cups three coffee cups so 12 plus 2 equals 14. okay so let's go to console all tests are passed hooray you are free programmers and you hopefully pay them of course create a function that takes free numbers to hourly wages of each programmer and Returns the difference between the highest paid program and the lowest paid program so here for example there's 147 33 and 526. one get 526 and one get 33. so 526 is the most and 30 series the least so we're going to subtract 33 from 526 in order to get 493 and that 493 is a number would be more third another is one five and nine that's closer yeah nine and one are the uh highest and lowest so nine minus one equals eight so when you return the number eight notes don't forget to return the result okay so now in code we have a function called programmers and there are three variables one two three in terms of the hourly wages of the three programs very high so first when you create two variables called Y is called pause so we're going to set the values to zero for now and um for highest and lowest I'm gonna instead of two highest the highest and lowest numbers into these variables and then we're going to subtract them to find the difference so it's going to take a long time long code to figure out these but it's quite simple so first I'm going to do if one is more than two and one is more than three that means here in the scenario one is the greatest number out of all three numbers we're going to make highest equals one Whatever number one is then we're going to place the number in the height then else if two is more than one and two is more than three yeah here two is the greatest number we're gonna make highest into two else if it's not one or two we know it will be three because it has to be one of them so we're going to make highest equals three so we're now we're done with the highest we need to do the same thing with the lowest except we need to change the greater symbol into the lesson so if one is less than two and one is less than three that means one is the lowest grade yeah we're going to do lowest equals one and else if two is less than one and two is less than three lowest equals and then finally else if it's not two or one we're gonna make lowest into three so now we're done assigning values to the highest variable and the lowest variable so next we're going to do difference and find the difference between the highest and lowest paid programmer so I'm going to do highest minus lowest and then we're going to return the difference of the two numbers so while we're checking you're going to see the test cases so here it is 254. 345. well how did you get those monies and it's like hourly not like daily if you want to do 457 minus 234 which is 223. another one 43 33 and 43 so it's 43 minus 33. oh 33 the person that must be so sad yeah because the other two programs have the same amount of pay yeah so now constantly passed all the tests on to our final problem so our final problem is called half quarter and eighth create a function that takes a number and return a list of three numbers half of the number a quarter of the number and eight of another number so here are some examples so give us a number in this case it's six nine million divided by two which is three divided by four which is basically divided by half by two so three divided by 2 is 1.5 and then 1.5 divided by 2 is 0.75 so three is a half 1.5 is a quarter and 0.75 is at eighth yeah so if you're in this the order of the list is half quarter and eighth so here we have a form to call half underscore quarter underscore H which is variable called n so first we're gonna do half quarter and eighth variables to calculate the half coordinate of the number it's gonna do n divided by two and divided by four and divide by eight to get the quarter half an eighth yeah so then we're going to create a list by ourselves with an empty bracket then we're gonna append or add all the half quarter and each to the list so remember is that append half so append is a list helper function which will add an item to your list so we're gonna add half quarter and eight to the list so we're gonna complete our numbers list and return our numbers list the one we're checking to receive test cases where there is 14. 14 divided go to seven then three point five and then 1.75 okay and then there is six which is three 1.5 and 0.75 and now all the tests are taxed well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash that button and subscribe bye bye
