welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to show you flex code and it let's call vr that is like scratch so first if you know scratch you might want to try this too yeah so first we're going to drive forward robot down pin down move roll my pen down then we need a while while um the distance is bigger than one thousand one thousand okay distant is in the sensing wow well this is red yes okay then we need another wild block okay then we're good if if the millimeters is bigger than 500.00 it's bigger than 500 then set robot color to blue to blue okay okay then it will stop driving if it's less than 500. okay okay i think when it starts it will drive forward then move robot hand down then while the distance is bigger than 1000 millimeters it will set the robot pin color to red then if the distance is less than 1000 and bigger than 500 it will set the rubber pen color to blue then it will start driving okay so we're gonna go to playgrounds we're gonna do grid map yeah there are different kinds of maps playgrounds and maps yes we're gonna choose grade maps yeah okay and then there's 2d and 3d okay in 2d first yeah stop because it's less than 500 millimeters now let's do it to 3d now stop it first then we press reset okay and run no we do 3d first see it change blue now it stopped because the object in front of it is less than 500 millimeters next we're going to show you another fun project so we're good okay we're gonna fill these blocks to trash we're gonna do a different pay down it's very fun we're gonna forever loop and drive forward and we're gonna do another program this time and it's called dynamics castle crasher okay see it's look it's dynamic it's very fun too it's like there will be castle and the robot will crash into it they can fall down too okay let's okay let's do 3d okay let's press run hmm and there is python 2. we're going to show you after it falls down and the robot is going to fall down oh no byebye he's going to fall for him bye
