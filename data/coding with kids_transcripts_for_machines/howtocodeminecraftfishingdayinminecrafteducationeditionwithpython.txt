welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia my name is lindsay today with minecraft education edition and i'm going to explain to you the example of fishing day so on start um say let's go fishing say get a boat and a fishing box this is basically a decoration yeah so it's just like on chat it will say let's go fishing get a boat and a fishing rod then on item um boat used weather clear time set dawn so it will set the weather if it was raining or thunderstorm it will set it to clear let's go fish and get a bone fishing and then um it will be dawn so i'll play riding so when you're losing the boat you'll have nasa so like you know seasickness so but if you eat an apple you clear all the effects from yourself you're healed yeah but usually it's a milk bucket that will help you but here on the coast yeah so on item fishing rod use spawn um dc animals like um dolphin i guess this one's puff fish yes cod no this is not god uh salmon okay fish because this is very unique and this is cod the last one is squid you sure yes so they're all on different positions well some so the first two are the same the third and fourth are the same oh i'm sorry they're all different um so let's see it in python so define on the item interactive use a vote it will run function so another function on travel variety to mark to apply effectiveness here and then it will create you have seasickness and then player the untraveled when you're riding you'll run the function then on item interacted apple the mob style clear affect mobs that target local players so it'll clear all enchantments and effects like the nausea and then player down item interactive apple or run the function so when you eat apple you you will clear the effect and then define an item interactive fishing rod it'll spawn dolphin puffer fish salmon tropical fish cod and squid at different positions yeah and then play that on item interactive fishing rod it'll run the function so when you use fishing rod it'll spawn all these animals and then just do a player that'll say let's go fishing and get a boat and fishing rod because that's on start so just run it yeah okay so now there's only little ponds because this is a horse forever well it's not root for us to remember spaces where there are here it is and it's a little pond but it's not can they speak for us yeah okay so boat so immediately it clears so now you can go away oh no we got nothing again again it's very um yeah this fell from the sky every time you use the fishing rod so get out the fishing rod and get it back in wow they just all fall out of this fish really yeah oh hi i fish so now they're all squished from the sky yeah they're falling from the sky that's amazing what did i yeah i got a cod when i just got poisoned from the puff fish it's okay we're in creative mode no damage at least poison now i'm just gonna play new fish even though the animals will just keep spawning we got a cod oh dear they spawned again i think you shouldn't go on that let's see what we're going to get this time wait wait thumbs up puffer fish one time no not knowing about the effects whenever you you'll fish get poison yeah got another cod so when it's raining you can get more lucky stuff one time i got an enchanted book i was really sad because i only got caught should we spawn some stuff by ourselves sure because there's like still closed squid yeah should we do axolotls hey but but they attack other creatures glow squids are a little cooler than regular squids yeah they light up i'm gonna ride on the boat again nasty and try fishing while we have nausea and poison from a puffer fish it wore out the nausea wore out oh i got i got the the they just keep on spawning if you ever plan to have an axolotl in a pound always remember if you put it um well just put the eggs they just keep on falling squids look at its mouth it's cloney yeah it looks so weird spinal i want to see if there's a difference between a glow squid and a squid smell well a glow squid smell it's just basically different color it's basically the same desserts less creepy yeah because it's blending in yes it's sparkly and more blending it while these squids look red but um the glowstick is blue it's the same color so most of the proper fish here are just being um with all their spikes so you can get the voice in here but we're in creative manner so oh yeah i forgot turtle i think that's enough yeah they're pretty big let's call this the the the um the sea animal see animal pound without excellence well not all of them are seen some dolphins oh that's such a cool sight in green light okay i'm just gonna push this hopefully it'll oh tomorrow it's so smart yeah okay so okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye
