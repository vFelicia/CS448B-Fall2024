welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition and we're going to explain the code of tnt split okay so this is basically a tnt version of sleeves so you don't need to use shovels so uh you only need to place tnt and then you try to explode explode your opponents well over here we don't have any opponents so unchecked commands fleece so when you type split in the cat it will build um better dogs because you know um tnt can't explode that rocks yeah you won't fall out from zero fifty zero which is 50 blocks above you so it'll be in the sky okay 20 50 20. so it's like up over there somewhere up there so it's like a square or a rectangle yeah then fill with redstone torch these are lit already so like it's coating so the redstone torches will be lit even though there's no redstone source and it'll be right on top of the bedrock so if you break a dirt block block right here it you know the you can then slice the um tnt then it will explode because there's the restroom curve from the redstone yes so from 51 because you know it's supposed one block above the bedrock big rock twenty fifty one twenty so only like one block higher than the bedrock then go with dirt block 52 so it's two blocks from the bedrock one block from the western twitches twenty fifty two twenty so so it's where the players can walk and then they can place the team chance out of the on top of the dirt block and then the tnt will automatically start to explode it's like the sun over there yeah then teleport are all players which is only us right now to 10 55 10. so it's like um maybe three blocks above the dirt yeah you won't take fallberry give all players block our item tnt i'm not 64. so you won't run out and then you can explode all the other players so you have 64 tnt and change game mode to survive so you can die we're going to change it to all entities so and then there'll be mods and then we can explore them all okay also minecarts with chest yeah which is weird now look in the python okay so def on enchanted function lockstar fell bedrock so we'll fill the area with bedrocks here position zero fifty zero twenty fifties twenty so twenty to fifty blocks above you and fill operations that replace or replace even if there are blocks they will replace them with bedrock except you know clouds because yeah they're just decorations and then we'll fill the veteran torches with the same thing one block above the bedrock and then blocks that filled dirt position 52 20 50 to 20 fill operation dot replace so we'll get the dirt on another block above the redstone torch then we're gonna mobs that teleport to position so we're gonna teleport all the entities like all the mobs to on top of the dirt that we can explode mobs not give mobs the target all players tnt 64. so give all the players 64 tnt which is only us not the moms yeah because you can't give them all the items then we're gonna set the mode to survival for all the players and then yes yeah then player that on chat when you type spleef in the chat i'll run the function okay okay peggy you're gonna go up with us oh oh so much loot this i and this golden apple let's see what's in this chest wow glow berries and golden apples oh this is so lucky shall we collect this stuff oh no there's no way let's eat an apple although there were barely any holes in there because they all exploded sorry pig they're two villagers oh the asian disney uhhuh okay uh golden apples okay let's see there are glow berries and what will happen what will happen if you eat a blueberry let's see we can make it minecraft like do we you can't eat it we have a little hunger yeah we can make my cars but we yeah i think we do have sources and we can do have the this we have also have usual rain okay um i'm just gonna drop a few things you don't need them yeah dirt blocks i'm just gonna leave them and do another one oh is oh we respond here there's a long way off so we're just going to do another one all right no worries yeah it's a long one so we're just going to do it again obviously let's hope we don't get on board by all the mobs oh there's all them what what other mob for the moms what they died was there are all sloths from the village oh oh the angle just jumped off oh how did it survive oh yeah because it has a lot of help i want to explode this ocelot it won't take any fall damage but probably oh it's this one no yeah it already oh it already got damaged by the tnt explosion okay okay cow cow oh no it's gonna bother us we only got one heart okay let's go down let's see what's down there why you do that we had a walk oh here's over here it's not enchanted yeah um i'm gonna do it again wait but we don't have that many mobs but it'll be okay first time was the most exciting this last time and um okay this time it's dramatic oh dude how old are you zombie villager zombie though just saw me though oh no oh oh no you hit let's invite them to our sleeve this is actually the last time come on no no no oh it's live jump off i'll tell you jump off smaller wait what if we do it on the water no that one will be no fun yeah at least this last time there
