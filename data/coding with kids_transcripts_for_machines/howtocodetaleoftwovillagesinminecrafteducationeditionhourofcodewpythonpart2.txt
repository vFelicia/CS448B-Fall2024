welcome to curtin with kids my name is cleo mars today we're at minecraft education edition so we're in the hour of code the villagers and pilgers so the basic story is there are once two villages the villager villages and the pillager village so they both the both villages knew how to live in their own way but now they have separated so we're gonna do six quests to unite them so today we're going to introduce the ravager to the villagers so we're going to talk to this villager so this villager says ravagers are misunderstood creatures everyone in town is afraid of them but i learned that they can be friendly maybe if we bring this ravager around to meet a few villagers they might see how gentle they can be someone press next and the villager says have your agent introduce the waiver just to the free villagers standing near their house start activity and press the c so now the riveter is going to follow our agent so we can do the agent move and then the raven will follow and once we get to one of the villagers out out of their houses the they'll immediately introduce themselves so i'm going to do for i and range so now let's see how many blocks i'm going to go through this guy get okay so only one two three four five six seven eight nine so i'm gonna do a four i in range which will repeat the nine times we'll do agent move forward we can't do it backwards all right we'll move backwards next time forward so now we're going to run it let's see oh it's like the the river joins like sticks so now we introduce the researcher to this villager okay now when you count to that do one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so i'm gonna do twelve times and do twelve times before first and do agent dot move right okay let's see oops i'm gonna do two left let me do backwards agent dot move backwards and then we're going to delete this for now so now we're back on the path wait one more backwards so now when you go 12 block 12 blocks for that villager change it two and then agent move backwards yes backwards and then we're back on the path when you do turn left so i'm going to do agent move left and 12 times so now so now there was like a little bit of far worse and now we introduce the ravager to the second villager now to the last villager move backwards how many times one two is nine i think it's nine so one change to 12 to nine and change the left to backwards backwards they're always faced in one direction when you do two more do two more yeah step see where your just looks at the agent yeah two more steps we're going to change the nine to a two yay then the caretaker says the villagers have always been afraid of bravers based on the stories they had heard about them although they had never actually met a ravager their fear created a bias against the creatures so now the caretaker also says once the villagers saw that this ravager was gentle they started to rethink their opinions of them and realize that it is important to take the time to get to know someone before making judgments don't forget to go check on your tree showing a fast travel to the tree so now the tree is growing so the tree resembles the the villagers and pillagers going back together so now it's going pretty good and we have completed two quests before so we needed to do four more quests yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye
