welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in edible so edibit is a coding platform where there are lots and lots of problems you can solve using different kinds of coding languages So today we're going to do three easy coding challenges in Python so our first coding challenge is called is it true so in this challenge you will be given a relation between new two numbers written as a string rough functions that determines if the relation is true or false so here are some examples to give us um uh expression for example eight is less than seven so that's not true so we're gonna return false so here two equals two that is true so we're going to return true so tests will only have three types of relations z uh equals more than less than many approaches work here but the evil function is particularly useful so now we're going to go to the code so we have a function called is it true with the relation variable so first we're going to do a variable called answer and wants to evaluate the expression to see if it makes sense so the evil function will evaluate the expression for example a check if 10 is more than 10 is true for example right here and then it will replace the variable of true or false then here we're also going to use the replace function and replace a single uh equals Mark with two equals marking python so for example because here when it runs these 101 equals 101 just one uh equal sign in Python will not make sense only two equals sine will work because if you do one equal sign like a variable it's just assigning something not actually being making it equal okay so he uh store true or false in the answer variable so if answer is true that means the relation is true and it works and we're going to return true if it's not we're going to turn false now let's check it and see the test cases so here there is 2 equals two this is the first equal sign so it won't work at first when I did not use the replace function as like what why won't it work and then I saw it the one equal sign and I solved the problem so now in the console we test we pass all tests let's see one more test case there 15 equals 137. 157 obviously not so we're in a term false okay on to the next problem this it's called check if a list contains a given number so write a function to check if a list contains a particular number so here are some examples it will give us a list here there's one two three four five then it will go to the number then when you check if it's in the list of it here is three so one two three four five so three is in the list so we're going to turn true if not here there's the empty list they want us to check if five is in the empty list so it's empty so there's nothing in it so we're going to return false don't forget to return the result okay so we have a function called check and we have a list called list and a variable called L for some reason so first we're going to do if l in list return true so just it's very simple to check if something is in the list then if it's not you're just going to return false very easy and then now we're going to see the test cases one one two one five four seven so we're gonna check a seven in there which it is so we're gonna turn true and then here's one one two one once and there's only one and two in the list so it wants that to check for three there is no third in it so we will return false there's also one one two one five four seven oh sorry one one two one five four seven yeah and then we're gonna check if eight it's not in there so we're gonna turn false so let's see in the castle yes all tests are passed okay on to our final coding challenge it's called less than a hundred given two numbers returned true of the sum of both numbers is less than 100 otherwise return false so here's some examples less than 100 so it's the function 22 and 15 so 22 plus 15 equals 37 so right here and when 37 is less than 100 so we're gonna turn true and here there's 83 and 34 so the sum is 117 so that's more than 100 so we're going to turn false so now let's go to the code so there is a function called less than 100 and we have two numbers A and B so first let me find out the sum because we're supposed to check if the sum is less than 100 so we're going to do sum equals a plus b which is the variable with with the sum of the two numbers whatever the numbers are then we're going to check if it's less than 100 so if sum is less than a hundred return true yeah if not we're going to return false okay so now tests there are lots of tests that's a lot okay there is 74 and 53 that's more than 100 so it's false and then here there is 10 10 and 45 that's 55. so it's true let's go to the console all tests are okay test ideas it's just like okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
