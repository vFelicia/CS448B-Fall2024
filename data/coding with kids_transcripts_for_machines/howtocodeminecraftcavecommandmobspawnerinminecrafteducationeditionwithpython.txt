welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia my name is aaron today we're in minecraft education edition and we're going to create our own project so we're in a project well yeah called batcave so we're going to make a animal cave so first we need on chat command when you type cave in the chat because yeah you need a time set day so it will be morning which right now maybe it's morning i don't know then you need a repeat loop repeat 50 times fill with air from negative one zero negative one so we'll like make like a lot ear blocks around us that are invisible one two one so we're gonna like clear it clear the area out yeah dominion variable call back cave and then you sit back cave so this variable will be set to our position which is right here so then you have pause pause for 10 000 milliseconds which is like 10 seconds time set dusk so it'll be like more scary and that matches the theme of bats yeah because they're supposed to be in dark caves and then it repeat 200 times so it's like spotting a lot of um bats let's do 100 because we'll do more than one type of animal and then spa of course bats because it's called uh where's that here yeah but that and uh the variable back case so we'll spawn back to where we are and then we can like duplicate this and then just spawn another animal let's do uh how about so batcave which is variable position equals none so there's no value then def on a chat so it's a function global batcave so we can use the backing variable anyway in gameplay.time set gameplay.time day so we set it to daytime and for index in range 50 so repeat 50 times and do block spell air position negative one zero negative one and position one two and one you know so clear the area out and then you know the backing variable equals player position so we'll give that the back k variable or value which is our position then we're going to loop stop pause for 10 seconds then gameplay dot times that gameplay that time dust and then change it to dusk and then for index 2 and range 100 so we repeat 100 times modify that at backing position so it's where we're standing right here on the b of that composition and player that on chat k for the type and see our agent hi agent now i'm gonna do 10 seconds to escape 200 of them yeah they all spawn on the same position like now it's a storm it's a storm why don't we spawn other mobs that are ground mobs like okay what should we spawn spawn more bats of course because they can look more creepy parrots zombie horse how about villager and okay it's morning again run run splash into the water hide is it spawning yet oh mushrooms and that a lot of bats again mushrooms everywhere so many cows mushroom mania wait i think i saw a baby yeah a baby right there you see hi baby it doesn't have much mushrooms on his back hi baby it's a little bit creepy because their eyes are so black sea creature and then here um but right we need to move before we went to code okay so first let's just spawn dolphins wait but we need to move or else it will spawn i'm gonna go in here we're gonna always squish okay clear the water water wait those are sea turtles yeah look at that you're going out of the air they're going on oh because when it's on it set the bat cave we were actually in the air yeah it's it's full it's a sea turtle pool it's like super crowded pool all squishing into each other the ones on land can have more space yeah but still not too much and very noisy that's dolphins uh wait wait we first need to i want to spawn the villagers oh okay can we go down fast are they we'll hit the line i didn't do it yet i didn't oh yeah you need to type i always forget that okay one will it's fine in midair again maybe mob mania okay did the villager spawn yet no dude it's not dusky uh i
