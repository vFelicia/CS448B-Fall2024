welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia mine is Andrew today we're in Minecraft education Edition and in this hour code called Escape Austin so in the last video we finished um and we finished the kitchen so we helped these four mobs and now we're gonna go through this door so we cannot go back after we go through it oh where are we the shopping Rock it's chess cool so let's go down okay so this is particle articles right click part oh what's this polish Play It's like a puzzle I think we need to solve it yeah okay let's see it looks like these pieces are part of an uncomplete picture try rewarding them to see what it's supposed to be use the push pieces function to trigger the Pistons to move the pieces in that direction so so it's like this kind of puzzle where there's a picture but all the pieces are every are mixed up so you need to try to get them back in the right place so this is a code example it's not the right answer so let's see what it is oh that doesn't solve it okay so push the box to reorder them so all the different pieces make a complete picture so let's see first um we'll do push left and then push right and then up let's see if no push left up and then right okay so push left and then push pieces push pieces up and then push pieces right okay let's see if that works right oh it works it's a cane oh okay and then there's right click the king it has a creeper face it's a real chess piece now where I click it the button oh what's this oh the queen is up there okay so it looks like we have to make stairs there seems to be something on top something at the top of the bookcase see if you can create a way to get up there use move cursor to position the cursor and place block to place a block in your selected position so we need to make stairs for us to go up the bookcase and get the queen okay so let's go code Okay so this is an example we'll see what it does we have gold blocks looks rich you can't we can't go up there okay so we have to create like a staircase all the way up reset it good noise so um this is like easier way to use loop it's just like the same command as the this first one but it's um in a shorter code okay so this will also place the first four one the example gold box I'll take long longer code to do it yes if we don't use the loop okay so now let's reset it again so we need to so there's like these marks for us to know where to put it so free yellow we need yellow and yellow okay so first write that up we're gonna Place block free time so we're I'm just gonna let's try free first one two three okay and then oopsies now we need to move up which is orange okay so we'll end up here move up orange and then move yellow Place Block in the move yellow Place block okay and then we're gonna go move cursor orange to go up bespoke cursory oopsies right oh yeah oh it's supposed to be here okay and then we're we're ready up we're gonna do four eye in range which is basically a loop two times well you don't need a place block and then we're gonna move cursor yellow okay let's see okay one two three okay up one two okay so if you want to be faster you're gonna see if you can make this parkour okay Andrew's better at Parker than me we made it right click the queen it's not a zombie face it's crying it's like a witch I think it's a ghast okay let's see Queen takes this walk now there's a queen and king oh what's this pieces fifth fourth third second first January February March April May and the five by five chess board yeah it's amazing so it's like the coordinates of the where it is so the King's birthday is April April 1st so we have to move it to eat another cake oh this is the queen Queen's birthday it's May E4 so I think we need to move them to their birthday okay school code all right you free the king and queen but the door still isn't opening they must be in the wrong positions move them into the correct position so you can finally escape this place so use the move chest piece function to move the king and queen into correct positions so there's king and queen okay so let's see what this will do move to okay it's in 10 seconds but it's not the right birthday she need to look at the signs and see where their birthday is so King's birthday is April 1st so it should be all the way here here right here and then the queen is May 4th so it has to be uh here and then one two three like over here okay let's go to code so search your room to find where you move each test piece and then right then write code to position them to to the correct spots on the black and white checkered floor make sure the chest pieces don't button to each other so we can also use the repeat block yeah so we're just gonna do this on our own so first let's just do our King first April 1st so we move orange one two three four times and blue one time so orange four times and blue one time so for I in range four times we're gonna move test piece King Orange four times and then we're gonna move move tests oh no this is not in the um the loop okay or uh blue one time so we're gonna move it one time let's see okay May 3rd May 1st May 1st and April 1st yes it's correct now there's a check so now we got the king now we need to move the queen to where it's supposed to be so it is May 4th we need to move it orange one time and then yellow four times so for Iron Range for I in range four times but uh move chest cheese Queen and yellow and then we're gonna move it one time Orange so move tests case Queen and Orange okay let's see so first we're gonna move the King two three four okay April first queen May 4th reach their birthdays so now there's trophy a lot we have complete oh so that's our player the player goes to the port hello again it looks like you did it you managed to make your way through the Mansion Bravo we knew you could do it in fact we were counting on it close that's suspicious oh it's the time agents you see this place is more than just a mansion it's a interdimensional prison one that we could not Escape but we knew you'd figure it out so they used us aha surprise time agents are back now you're the one who is going to be stuck in this Mansion forever enjoy a new home not so fast now you're not going anywhere I'm giving you troublemakers a time out it may have trapped us here once but we won't fall for your tricks again the point always open you can't stop us you're out of time and so worry so long jumps portal that portal leads to the time orb they'll be able to use it to escape the only way to stop the time or is by using the Chrono cannons it won't take long for them to charge up the orb so we must quickly activate the defenses and stop them once and for all now go oh my God that's the time yes the time where we can use it to escape what part is that pesky player again so next video we're gonna end these time ages from once and for all all of the Chrono cannons are now activated prepared to fire so next video we're gonna feed those timings but for now we're gonna stay here well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the button and subscribe bye bye
