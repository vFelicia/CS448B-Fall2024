welcome to recording with kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch and andrew's account who's tough kid today my project is named super scratch drawer and the scratch cat right here is the sprite it's going to draw something in this background okay if the sprite name is scratchy because i need okay so first the green flag click that means right here when you run it it says go to x minus 150 and 30. so it's right here and then it will erase all you true set pen color to red set pen size to 10 and pin down so when it's pinned down it will start drawing if you command it to so it says forever go to x0125 and you and there's the weight so you can see um where it is and how it draws because if there's no weight blocks then it'll be super fast yeah you can't see where it's going yeah so it will forever draw a shape and then it won't collect forever next costume so costumes are right here and the costumes here the scratch cat will run yes so it's like running and drawing at the same time so when one when the green flag clicked it will forever change pen color by one so the pen color will keep changing color so if even if you go to the next round that that spot will be a different color yeah okay that's right let's draw your shape see now it's changing colors and this costume is running yeah so for my like evidence like you can't add so forever nyx costume it's like so fast i can't see it so you should like put a weight block it's control but wait one second is too too much so 0.5 that's right now you can still see it yeah that's going very fast it's hard to see okay and that's it for today thank you for watching smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
