welcome to coding with kids my name is Clea my name is Andrew today we're going to use chat gbt to make a game in Python So today we're going to ask chat gbt to make a two truths One Lie game in Python so there were lots of bugs after I asked it to make the code like the amount of statements what statements and things about the statements like mixing them up and not always guaranteeing one lie so now um don't look okay so first we're going to import the random module with so we can use functions inside of it for our game then we're going to define a function called truth truth and a lie so we're going to create two um lists truths and lies with aot bunch of statements in them then we're going to do a wild true Loop you can look we're going to randomly select one line and two truths so we're going to random that shuffle both truths and Li list then we're going to store the lie in a variable called lie and it's it's going to get the first statement that comes up in the LI list then we're going to store a truth in a variable called Truth sample and we're going to use random do sample and pick two random statements out of the truth list so here we're using functions from the random module then we're going to combine both our truths and lies in a variable called statements for game then we're going to shuffle those statements so they don't always come out in the same order like the LIE always goes first then we're going to print here three statements then it's going to repeat three times and it's going to print one statement each time then we're going to print which statement is the LIE enter the number so each number will be paired with a statement and you need you need to um enter the number that matches the statement you think is a liot then if one is less or equal to guess and guess is less than equals to three so if guess is a certain number then it'll say you're correct that's statement is the LIE else if it's not they'll say sorry that's not the lie if it's still not ill print please enter a valid number 1 2 or three then we're going to do play again equals input do you want to play again then you can answer yes or no if what you ENT is not yes then it'll break if it's yes then you'll repeat here then here we run the function so now let's play it okay do you want to go first you go first okay so here are three statements bananas grow on trees the Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest of all oceans and bees can see ultraviolet light which statement is a lie which one do you think number one number one you're correct that statement is a lie do you want to play again sure yes so now Kia can go here are three statements diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds there moon is about 1 six the size of Earth and the Atlantic Ocean is the saltiest of all the oceans which statement is lie I think it's number two number two yeah okay sorry that's not the lie so it's number one that's crazy okay let's play again now it's my turn oh I already know it's one but there's also new statements honey is the only natural food that never spoils Antarctica is the windiest continent under Earth that's like um reasonable I'm going to dud number one you're correct that statement is a lot now let's do it again and Kalia can go okay honey is the only natural food that never spoils the Atlantic Ocean is the salest of all the oceans the Great Wall of China can be seen from space since we already have had the first two ones I'll choose free okay you're correct that statement is the lie you can't see the Great Wall of China so let's do one more oh it's also one last one oops okay go a group of owls is called a parle a mon koalas are not actually bears and honey is the only natural food that never spoils so we know three is um a truth so which one one or two I think it's two two koals are not actually Bears I koals are bears you're correct that stimon is a lot Ks are bears that's crazy okay you can also change the statements with statements of your own and statements about you or another person well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe byee
