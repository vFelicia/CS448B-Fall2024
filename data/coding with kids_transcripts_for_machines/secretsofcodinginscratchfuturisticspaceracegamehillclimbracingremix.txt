welcome to clinton with kids my name is andrew today we're in scratch and andrew's account starring scratch cat so today i'm going to show you my remix called futuristic space race so first it was a hill climb race so i changed it into a space scene so um like there's no wheel and you're in outer space yeah so it's also futuristic because you know right now you can't like drive a car without a wii u yeah maybe in the future you can't say yeah so first in the background here it was originally just a game background so i changed it into space stream and add the feel score and personal best maybe you're racing on the moon yeah and then here in the car i had a star to make some deco races and then in the items i changed your coins instead of yellow to black because it's just so much space themed black is the color or white but these letters are white so you shouldn't make white so here in the wheel i erased everything because then the car and the motorcycle won't have any wheels and then you'll be floating yeah it's like but there's still dirt kicking up maybe it's like like this thing is that push the um car forward it will like kick up dirt maybe it's another alien planet that has still has dirt only like like um the moon with the earth but like in another place that is not really ours so human can bring i guess okay so first i want to do call right yeah you press to change and then use your arrow keys i like motorcycle more because like it's faster and it's more bumpy yeah like i think the motorcycle is more harder i like it uh oh oh oh oh man it's like kind of easier because you don't have wheels yeah but it's also kind of harder because you don't know when you will land and stuff right here oh what else now they want to do car okay car it has a star yeah it's a match of the star this is because it's space the car is a little bit easier it's not that hill i'm not even pressing the arrow keys right now i pressed too much in the start okay going up and down down going up the hill hill is like the most challenging yeah okay of course better than me you're not really good at handling okay up the hill down the hill we oh slow down don't go too fast that's what i did in the beginning so i didn't need to hold the um the arrows now go slow down the hill oh really it's just like those monster truck wheelies yeah okay well this looks like a monster truck you need a flu oh man and then i think we're gonna go down slap yourself no flop yourself three thousand school ah flop yourself keep going flap okay my turn your turn my turn i like the motorcycles because it's more feeling it's realistic i feel it it's more realistic you maintain balance you're gonna you're gonna it's like it's just like a bike yeah you also need to do some tricks and go faster and motorcycles get more points cars too risky oh three thousand personal best is nine thousand it seems like for you it's like three motorcycles yeah should we do one of them yeah okay should we do motorcycle motorcycle i like motorcycle okay motorcycle yeah okay boy you own gas okay uh don't i save them i saved myself one time with a wheelie wheelies um are like you perform it when you try to save yourself yeah so you like tipped on one of you like trying not to tip back let me get the gas oh yeah you can go backwards a lot of people didn't notice the gas and they don't know the gas and then they'll run out again like me yeah i don't even know that feels hard oh no i almost do a back flip yeah if you only like this here i'm still here why not that's my high score that's good one oh nine in the car i'm just gonna crash okay try to crash just keep on pressing then to get too much speed okay so our personal best is just four thousand i think it's 103.2 four i'm one eight so one else is i thought you were one of three or maybe i was looking at one place okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
