welcome to coding with kids my name is julia and my name is andrew today we're in codehog course f functions in minecraft so instructions say a function named billbridge right here is in your workspace all of the code you need to cross the river is built right in snap the small green builds bridge function block into your workspace twice to fix the path and get steve to the redstone torch redstone torches right here okay so the function build bridge makes the agent right here move forward place the oak plank and repeat it and then move forward two times and turn right so it will go here and yeah so it says we need how many little bridge functions do we need so d steve can get the restroom torches let's first do one let's see what happens now let's do steve and follow him uhoh we still need one more bridge but if you want to do the diamond how many bridges do we need let's do three of them and let's see what happens follow that agent hey throw it fast but he's much faster he says oh we're getting the diamond and we got the diamond now now we're on lesson nine there is ice in the way there clear path functions can help you destroy the ice and get steep to the minecart minecart is right here the function clear path destroys block moves forwards and plays great so there is let's do clear class one time and see what happens why do we need the gravel because when you break the ice there's water so we can't walk on water so we have to place something how many times do we need to do clear path two no three let's try repeat three times there's a problem so maybe we have to repeat four times let's try five hmm we need one more time so six times let's find that agent but don't get in front of him okay now let's get that minecart next one less than 10. can you spot the difference between the two functions in your workspace use these functions with other code from the toolbox clear a path for the minecraft then collect the flint and steel something still is right here we need to collect differences so first let's look at the function first function is called fixed load three times destroy block move forward and place rails so it goes forward and place rails in three blocks so what do we do okay let's see then the fixed short path repeats two times to show the buck move forward place rest so the difference between the two functions is that this repeats three times and this repeats two times so first let's try to fix long passers but first we need to turn light to get to where we have to be like we can just go forward see but we have to break blocks oops it has to destroy block first okay so we have to turn right turn right then press it and turn right let's see it's breaking your tracks oh just want here yeah turn what yes let's do it again i think we have to do something else oh maybe we have to turn right place rails then move forward okay turn right first then place rails turn right then place reds to fix the rails so we don't right now we don't need it yet just turn right then um right now we don't need that strong path because really do is nothing let's do shortcuts uh it's fixed on the path dance picture pack at least we still have to fix one girl so let's do termite place fast and move forward no clear all the blocks first then turn right place rounds then move forward why do we need a destroy block so we need a turn right place rails move forward place rails then turn left two times let's see let's press run hmm so it plays two rounds here now turn left now we have to break the blocks so we need repeat three times move forward repeat three times oopsies move forward then fix short path because it only has two blocks here now three blocks right like right there whoopsies short path now let's see okay now we can turn now we have to turn right and move forward two times let's do but the agent's right there he needs turn back and move forwards two times move over two times let's do it let's see now we have to fix long half so it will clear the three blocks right here so we can get to that flint and steel let's follow that agent to get thank you for watching smash the like button and subscribe to our channel
