welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in america vegetation so we're in python 101 lesson so first we're going to talk to the ceo since ceo says we're trying to develop a game the game is called agent later so it's like space elevators this idea is that you need to move the agent so shoes tickles blocks and gets points however we've been having problems with the different game mechanics can you help us so we're gonna help the ceo build a game called agent vader where instead of ships there's the agent and the enemies are gold blocks so first we're going to talk to the game developer this game developer says i need to get the agent to move left or right depending on which color the player stands on it should be for right and blue should be for left but for some reason there's tuition micro can you write your home code to help me for my problem so orange help the game developer with controls of the agent so that's like a tv and then there's a wire to the controls okay so we're gonna help right red is for right and blue is for left okay so first we're gonna declare function so we're gonna do def move so it's a function then if blocks dot test for block so it's testing for a vlog light blue concrete position zero negative one zero and then here so we're testing for light blue concrete because this is light blue concrete and when you step on it just like the controller so we want the agent to go left okay then we're going to make the agent move right agent dot move left one so we want the agent to move left because blue is for left right is for right okay then next we're going to do alif else if blocks dot test or block and do red concrete because instead of blue light blue concrete we're gonna do red concrete okay then position zero zero negative one then we will make the agent move right agent patient dot move right okay so we've completed the function then here we're gonna do a while true loop so while true we're going to call the function so move so then we can keep moving the agent so now we're going to run okay let's go blue so we go the opposite direction so we're going to change the left right and right with the left so when you actually completed it i'm going to try one more time okay right and left okay it's so fast his knees are swinging his arms okay next we want to talk to the programmer so the programmer says i need to develop the firing mechanics of the game the agent needs to shoot firework rockets into the blocks and replace them with air but my code is not working out and i do not know why could you write some code to help me so i'm going to help the programmer make the agent fire fire fireworks instead of instead of bullets in the regular game and it's going to be shooting at four blocks so here we're going to do another function called def fire because this function allows the agent to fire the fireworks then we're going to do if block stop test for block gold block positions dot at 18. position position zero two zero so here if so try to test for the block gold block two blocks above the agent so we can detect the gold blocks and shoot the firework rockets so get the position two blocks above so try to detect a gold block then if it does attack the gold block it will the spawn firework rocket so it shoots fireworks at the agent.get position which is two blocks of open then we're gonna pause for 100 milliseconds so we do loop stuff pause 100 so the agent doesn't like keep like it's going to be spamming yeah sparing the fire rocket so there'll be actual bunches of fireworks like a firework day but much more yeah then we're gonna do block stop place air positions that add agent dot get position position zero two zero so after we shoot the fire rockets after we wait we're gonna replace the gold block with air so so we basically destroyed the gold block okay and here down here we're going to run the function fire in the wall truth okay so now we're going to run it okay so shot the firework rockwood rocket at the first gold block and the gold box disappeared now let's move yay i want to do the next one sometimes the rocket gets stuck underneath go to part two okay part two now just stop one yeah okay so now there are two layers of blocks so there's one higher level instead of just one okay so up here we're gonna do we're gonna do lf and use the fire function lift blocks that test for block gold block so the same as the if body position is zero three zero so there'll be three blocks above the edges so you can shoot farther then do monster spawn firework rockets and asian dot get position so we'll shoot a firework rocket again and then we'll pause 400 milliseconds so it's just like the last code but you change the position yeah so we can shoot one block higher then block stop place air so replace it with air so then we're going to wrap it it's not a shot the second block two i thought it was like i thought first just one rocket it would disappear to both like both of them this is the tech boop okay it's coming at his head maybe there's like in a head there's like a lot of fireworks inside it and then they will shoot like the uh machines in july 4. okay nice look yay it looks like it looks like it looks at us and it's like when i look at it it's like did it do well balls it will say okay so lastly we're gonna talk to the game developer so the game developer says i'm trying to develop the scoring system for the game as well as the splash screens at the start and the end of the gaming session but for some reason it is not working can you write some code to help me with my problem so i'm going to help the game developer over the splash screens at the start and the end and the scoring so now here you can see there are more blocks and there's that number you can't break the dialogue okay so first in the fire function we're gonna do global score so we're gonna make the score variable global so you can use it everywhere then after we're gonna do score plus equals one so we're gonna add one to the variable score so here what it does is that if you if the agent detects a good block two blocks above it it will spot fireworks pause and replace it with air so there's a score when you when you destroy a gold block or a short ship you get a score so here you add one score if you can't if it if it doesn't detect a gold block two blocks above it it'll go to lf which is three blocks and then after all this we're going to do and add one to scored again means you also destroy one so and then here we're gonna do splash screen we're gonna do gameplay.title mobs.target nearest player so we're the nearest player we're the only player and then it will do the title agent vader's start and then we're also gonna hear while true and delete the true and do while while score is less or equal to 15. okay then i'll do okay and call these functions do gameplay.title mods.target nearest player it'll do congratulations you win after we finish the game and then we're going to do mom's spawn lightning ball at agents position so we're in lightning bolt the agent okay agent will say don't be sorry boss okay now all right okay let's put it down in your face oh it needs to go down oh it's going down so here you can't destroy the diamond blocks but it doesn't detect it because we don't have anything because we need a detective look at the lightning the agent got a little on fire i saw all right was it that yay more rockets was it was so weird um yeah back to the ceo the steve and the skeletons with the red glass that is actually the bullet for the sea steve head shooting at all those skeletons yeah hopefully the steve head doesn't die okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you
