welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're gonna use chat GPT to make a simple game in Python So today we're gonna make a game called scrambles letter guessing game so first I just I asked chat GPC to create a simple game in Python that takes a list of words then you will show one of those words both this letter scrambled and then the player needs to guess the word within a limited number of tries and then this is the coaching made me but I wanted it to be more fun so I also asked chat to GPC to add on to the game so that there can be two players a limit of five guesses and More Words added more words and now two players can play so you can play with your friends and you don't have infinite guesses okay so let's review the code first we import a module called random so we can use some functions inside the module random then we're going to make a function called words with choose word then we're going to return the random that choice words so we're gonna in this function it's gonna choose one of the words in the list so we can guess that word then we have another function called scramble word and we have a variable called scrambled equal list word and then we're gonna Shuffle the scramble which are the letters of the words so it will be mixed up and then we're gonna return us um we're gonna make it a string then we're gonna have the main function game Loop so first we're going to create the word list you can also change this list or whatever words you want and when we have two names player one name and player two names so the code is going to ask player one enter your name and the same for player two then you can enter the name and it'll call you by that name we're going to create a variable called chosen word with the function choose word and then we're going to choose a random word from the list and store it in that chosen word variable then we're gonna we're gonna scramble that chosen word to end a mix up its letters I'm going to store that word in The Scrambled variable then we're going to print welcome to the word scrambled game then I'll do player one name so answer your player one name and then player two's name you will take turns guessing the word so it's introduced introducing the game right now yeah you have five guesses each can you unscramble this word and then it will show the scrambles word and then we're gonna Loop for Turner range one and six we're gonna print what turn it is then if turn is um two equals equals one we're gonna do player e a name equals player name so we're gonna figure out what which player's turn it is so it's player one then open player one and then player two and then we're gonna do player the uh guess equals input then we're gonna enter the player name whoever's turn it is and then your guess and then we can put our guess in there the in that variable then we're going to check if our guess is the chosen word so if it is we're going to bring congratulations then whichever player got it right you guessed the word correctly so here it's kind of a team game and you have to work together to guess the word you want to break if it if it isn't the chosen word horn else if turn is less than five that means instead of turns left we're gonna print oops that's not correct and then we're gonna give the player name you have five minus whichever turn it is so you can get the turn it actually is guess it's left else if that's we we have five turns I'm gonna print sorry the number player you've used all your guesses the correct word was and then we're gonna show the word and then here we're going to actually run the function so now let's see the code here in Visual Studio code now we're going to run it so do you want to be player one wait it's oh yeah okay create the terminal and then we're gonna do py scrambled letters game okay do you want to be player one yeah okay I'll enter my name and then Kalia will enter her name and then Andrea Kalia you will take turns guessing the word you have five guesses each can you unscramble this word so it's a pretty long word ragirompmgn should we look at the list of the words or not that'll be too easy because it takes a lot of words you should not know the words okay what should we get program no oops that's not correct wrote Andrew you have four guesses left so what's your programming Pro gram me congratulations clay you guessed the word correctly okay so now let's play it again so our list of words like are involved in Python and like and coding code okay so I won't enter our name you can no do I need a scramble this word ailevrab let's see I think I know what it is I do not know what that is do you know what that is yes what is it I think it's variable oh congratulations me I guess the week you asked me okay how about this okay you can also make this a one player game with 10 guesses or you can change the number of guesses I'm gonna change the words okay okay you don't look don't look look see no I'm gonna do a um let's see and we're gonna check okay yes okay okay so enter your name just enter my name I didn't add that many words Rush okay what's the player two's name dot dot dot okay okay can you unscramble this word r e e r i e t e t n n ah that's gonna be hard I don't know internet I don't think it's internet internet it is okay I'm gonna do it again okay I won't answer your name just do anything clone okay u y e maybe they were too easy because they are related to this but you can change it and add a bunch of words like a bunch so your friends won't be mad at you yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash like button and subscribe bye bye
