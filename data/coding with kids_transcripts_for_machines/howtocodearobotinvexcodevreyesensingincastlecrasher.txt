welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in vex code so today the project is about eyes dancing this example shows how we avoid falling with the eye sensor and find castles to crash into playground castle so we're gonna crash the castle so first we're gonna do a forever loop and then drive forward detects red so if it detects red it will stop because because no if the down eye detects red then we're going to drive reverse for one 1 000 millimeters 1000. so because on the edge there's red there's no wall yeah so on the edge there's red right before you fall so if we detect red on the floor then we drive reverse to avoid following yes then turn left turn left for pick at random times so 1 times 10 equals 10 and it's going to choose 1 to 10 but there's also a times 10 so 1 times 10 is 10 2 times 10 times 10 equals 100 so we expect it to turn left for 10 to and then it will pick a number from 10 to 100 degrees because um 10 times 10 times 10 equals 100 and 1 times 10 equals 10. okay let's run it playground castle crashes yay so we don't know how many degrees it will turn yeah so far when it detects these lines it will drive reverse when it detected it would it drive you first at first oh that was so little yeah um we didn't question this maybe it will crash into it hmm that's a lot okay oh yeah oh you throw that out let's do it in 3d mode okay let's rinse the battery first and do 3d mode so now it's going to go another way because it picks around but first it will always flashing yeah because it's going to drive forward until it detects red on the floor and then it will drive reverse and turn a random amount of degrees yeah and that was fun and thanks for watching remember to smash your like and subscribe bye
