welcome to coding with kids my name is andrew today we're in minecraft education edition so today we're going to go on python and here there are a bunch of tutorials using python so today we're going to do agent farmer so here we're going to make an agent make the agent make a farm and plant wheat so let's create an automated farm using agent so first before you plant anything your agent will need weed seeds to plant you can use the agent.give command to give your agent items it works like so agent that give item quantity and then slot so here's an example agent.givestone 10 stone blocks and slot 3. so first we're going to do asian.give wheat seeds the 64 receipt at slot 1. so now we're going to run it okay so now you can let uh right click and then here there will be seeds so the agent gave itself seeds okay so next we're going to do now that not that the farming agent have been set up you need to tell the soil to do this you need agent.tail function here's how it works it's in that tail direction so your agent is currently above the dirt so you tilt down okay then and a lot at the line of code to tell the dirt down below your agent so here i'm gonna do you just stop until now do down so now okay okay look so i set up the farm okay so this is on a hill so just leak out so now i tilled the bottom the block below the agent this isn't really good because if you know the water is leaking out because it's like uneven terrain when the agent spawned the fire okay so the picture is in like a just like a black land yeah but we're not we're not in a flatland so the law just needs that but the ages successfully tilled the block below okay so next here time to start planting seeds you're going to check of the area above the below the agent is air if air is below the agent then you want to place a c if you do this in place when you will use an if statement which can be used to run specific chunks of code if a condition is true so here if a equals equals b so here we can use if statements similar to the example below if air equals air say true so of course that's true because air and air are the same and if one minus two equals one six true one one minus two is not one so it won't say true okay so here if text equals text i'm gonna say true so i'm gonna test that so i said true because true because text is text okay next we're going to check what blocks are around the agent you can use the agent.inspect function when you're running you if your agent checks what block is in the direction you say and the agent won't return the block this name cannot then be used in your code for example derpy this is how it works the agent that inspect direction and you can use agent.spec in an if statement to to only run code if your agent finds a certain block okay fix the code below to have your agent inspected down is equal to okay so agent inspect so here inspect down so the block below the agent so i said true found air because the block below is air so every time you run it we make a new farm because you see we always run through functions yes okay so just keep moving this way okay so next we're going to do now you need the code the agent to place down we see to place the c you can use agent.place here's how to use it agent.placeslot direction but can you add code to have the agent place a c down from slot one so here after say found air i'm gonna do agent dot place can you have can you add code to the agent please c down okay so i'm gonna do first slot one down because in slot one we have wheat c sixty four of them so now we're gonna run until four right here okay so now this is a better farm yeah because now it's even terrain so now the plant did the recede in the first till block so it worked okay so next after your agent has planted a seed you will need to get it to move to next block of dirt to do this you need you use agent.moves this is how it works you shouldn't move direction so add the code to move your agent forward after you place the seat so after here we're going to do agent move and do forward okay now um okay moved forward to the next block so work okay so stepping you have coded your agent to till the ground plan c to move to next block but you want this code to run over and over again to tell all the blocks here hi cal okay so then loop lets you run sections of code over and over again for a set of times here's how you can make a loop for count and range for p4 blah blah blah okay the code only repeats two times make it repeat six times instead okay so here this is the number of times that will run so we're gonna turn the two to six so we can get the cows lacking so we can tell all the blocks okay now make a new five over eight okay sound that's still so now all of these we seeds are planted so that row is done yeah okay so now first i want bone medium to make it um grow faster yeah okay so we're going to use it okay so now they're all wheat it will be broken yeah so now we can break them and we'll get but we're creative okay so next i want to change instead of wheat seeds let's do this seed there's thing called let me search it wait this is cocoa beans uh seed there's beet root melon so let's but the melon pumpkin is actually after you do the bone meal you still have to wait yeah okay so we're going to do b b root c okay so change the wheat c's here to eat fruit okay one right there oh there you sleep because there'll be receive you forgot the underscore i think let's again let's try to tame one animal with wheat so here we oh i just got these yeah because i stomped on it okay so now we're gonna try to tame one cow it was like facing the other way now it has hearts yay there's another one yeah because they oh yeah they're gonna mate okay let's see another one they're gonna follow you well they don't need to but how about sheep sheep i'm trying to assume are a little far away so i'm going to try to i should come come come come follow me okay because we have seed uh okay i'm just gonna spawn them because i don't see any chickens here you just see your cow okay chicken your spawn chicken uh let's turn back no there's okay now they're making chicken babies say hi to your other siblings so we're gonna try to grow this one oh it it grew up now we're going to finally try to grow up the little cow oh yeah okay one two okay this is taking so long now they're gonna mate and now another baby cow ah zombies zombies don't like wheat okay they can't eat wheat the final farm is over here i broke some of them now they grow back you jump you jump to break it to get some meat or see they all want me let's grow these sheep sleepy shape alex like there's no space here so it's suddenly pop and then hop up yeah okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you
