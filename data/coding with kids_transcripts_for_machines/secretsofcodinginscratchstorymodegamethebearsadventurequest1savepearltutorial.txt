welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today was question this is my account kit.com123 this is the project i made called beers of adventure quest one singing they're all stacked up together and the probably a little sad let's first see the bears it's called the bears so when green flag clicks set size to 70 or they will be very big 100 oh it's like two bits so i set it to 70 then high so you won't see it then when i receive first row finish because there's a lot of message go to x minus i mean negative 267 y negative 55. so it will be right here show god one second to x negative 180 y negative 59 so it's like walking over here whenever you see second show finish say oh no pearl is gone and now how are we going to go to oceana it's like a place i made up for two seconds when i received game star set size to 20 so it will be small repeat until pearls equals five so pros is a variable glyph 0.3 seconds to mouse pointer which is your mouse if touching will be these change pearls if touching pearl jump which is this one change pearls by one and wait 0.1 seconds so if you're touching the rubies it will minus the point if you're touching the pearl which you need to get five pearls then it will like add you a point next there's pearl when the green flag click show set custom to purl four so there's a lot of costumes there's only three i mean there's purl four purl five and purl one then go to x 95 y negative 50 right here then wait two seconds switch custom to purl five place down ah until done hide so ah is the sound i record for myself so i'm just saying ah when i receive free pearl which is the end show switch costume to pearl one so the pearl one is this one standing smiling and then she will say wait one second first because jake over here will say something then say thanks for freeing me i'll give you two i will give you a ride to ocean for two seconds then jake has a lot of code let's go up when green flag click high variable pearl so let's hide so you won't see it right now then it's self high too when i receive second show finish so go to x 64 y negative one hundred and twelve wait two seconds say no worry prayers i know how to get go and get the key but first you need to pass this course for four seconds because it's very long say snap for one second it's like he's snapping his hand so it would change to like the game backgrounds then broadcast third show finish like first show done and wait say you need to get five pearls to get the key but don't get the ruby or else you will lose a performance like a mini game yeah for four seconds then set pearl to zero so you won't like have your the score you used to have then show the variable pearls then you can see it and broadcast games start it has about a lot of these messages hi forever if pearl equals 5 then broadcast game win so if the variable is 5 then it will broadcast game win and wait whenever you see free pearl switch backdrop to underwater jail well it's just underwater then show say great you got the water key we free the pearl for one second wait two seconds because pearl's going to say something then stop fall so that's the end of the whole project then there is the pearl a gem you need to get these to free pearl to get you know the key the water key when i receive game win hide when green flag click hide it has very little code when i receive game start show repeat until pearl's equal five go to random position wait one second so it keeps going to random position until you get five yeah when screenshot clicked this is for the wizard yeah switch customers to wizard a it's an evil wizard it's the bad guy go to x negative 150 y negative 31 say ha found those magic helpers so he's like there's a lot of magic helpers and this is episode one switch costume to wizard c it has a lot of wizard costumes wait two seconds which cost him two wizard a because he's doing things grab one second to x 165 y negative 24. switch costume to wizard b broadcast first show finish and that will be the first you know like that then wait 1.5 because the bear is going to say something it took me so hard to do 1.5 seconds then it will like after the bear say something that he will think should i tell them what happened because he stabbed pearl and the bears are asking what happened to pearl yes then he answered himself for two seconds say i sent her to my ocean prison and you will never catch her for three seconds hi broncos second show finished and there's a ruby there's free movies so when i receive game win high when i receive gain start show repeat unto pearls equal five go to random position and wait one second one green flag clicked hot so it's just like the pearl and the ruby gem 2 and will be gem 3 is the same and there is a key when green 4 click hide we when we i receive game win go to negative x negative 30 y negative 27 show block is free pearl and wait and last there is the stage when green flag clicks switch backdrop to ocean view so there is four backdrops and this one is like the bottom walk so you can see the ocean sand and where people walk then when i receive third show finish switch back up drop to underwater one and when i receive free pearl switch backdrop to underwater two and when i receive almost the end switch backdrop to city with water so it's like it's a view of a city with water then let's see andrew will play today she yelled there's the bears and the brown bear is talking as i run into ocean pears and you will never catch a and it changed the background just like he did it like a magical ha ha poop it's hard to catch them because only very little time then you will get them back like courses hello here i'm here i'm here they're all doing the same code so they all go to a random position at the same time as you see the rubies are very nasty they keep and keep trying to get you're so confused the rubies like you'll never get the key it's the evil wizard who set this whole course to let until the key that he thinks that nobody's going to ever pass this course just like evil villains in movies they think haha i'm so good but good people i can crack this there's like you know the evil people i'm so good but they're actually not so good but actually just uh not really good people who really wants to trap good people it's a little hard i almost got eight three points the underwater well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash that button and subscribe bye bye
