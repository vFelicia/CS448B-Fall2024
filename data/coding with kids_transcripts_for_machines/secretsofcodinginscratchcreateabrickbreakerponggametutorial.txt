welcome to quitting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in scratch and in my account get that code one two three so this is what my game i made is called brick that rhymes that rhymes brick breaker is a silly name because it rhymes game over you touched a red line it's like a palm yeah so over here when i receive bounce that's the ball sprite yeah so bounce is a message point in direction one minus so move ten steps so if it's not touching the paddle it will move ten steps one click green yeah i can even do is because it's under one is not really getting a number yeah then when green sag clicked forever it's touching line then broadcast came over that means the red line yeah the red line right here when green frog click go to x zero y zero that is is x y coordinate that means uh the middle yeah point in direction 135 then wait one seconds and forever remove ten steps if on edge bounce if you don't have the code it's going to get out of the screen but when you green fox like it'll go here again then it's touching paddle broadcast that means if it touches like you then it will broadcast into itself and yep then game over game over that means just the same place the ball starts yeah and when i receive the message game over the show when green flag clicked set rotation style don't rotate yeah go to x 130 y minus 140 that means where kind of where it is now yeah but point towards mouse pointer both 10 steps set y 2 minus 140 so point forwards mouse pointer it will like you'll follow your mouse pointer yeah but and not rotate so it'll go in a straight line like this but if you did not do set rotation style don't rotate then your paddle would like follow your key all around it could go just past the ball and go through line everywhere it's kind of hard to say when bringing that click hide so it's not there there's uh it's gonna create clones so let's set score to zero it's a variable variable yeah and you can see it you can see it right there set size to 50 you don't want it too big yeah go to minus 200 y 140 so that's just x y coordinates and then repeat four times four times seven times clone of myself change x by 65. that means it will place a clone of itself that means a copy of itself every 65 x coordinate there's six x two minus two hundred change y by minus three hundred whatever it makes twenty eight clones okay so you can just do repeat twenty eight times but yeah when i start at the clinic that means this is programming the clones forever if touching ball then broadcast bounce again yeah score by one and then delete this clone because you broke the brick like this you win sprite the enemy of the game over sprite okay so when green flag clicked go to x zero y zero same as the game mode the ball and the game over and hide set score to zero wait until score equals 28 because there's 28 bricks show then stop so that means it'll show you win that means the player will know that he won yeah and then yeah then the line when green flag clicks show so when the ball touches the red line it'll stop all and the game over will show okay the ball is originally red the background also changes color and plays the music oh yeah i don't make it game over but i did it in a special kind of way it's like sunset if it's that color one green frog cake forever replace down dance chill out it's a song i got from scratch yep forever i like it it's kind of relaxing but not so relaxing the bricks are called if you can find them in the sprite library or scratch yeah you can find all of these sprites in there except the game over and over because i literally typed that yeah it's just a few words i always died like always released when i almost oh i did two of them when you oh my turn this is very hard for you i had ten more blocks to go until i won come on you need a favorite okay one more time me oh thank you for watching remember to smash the like and subscribe bye
