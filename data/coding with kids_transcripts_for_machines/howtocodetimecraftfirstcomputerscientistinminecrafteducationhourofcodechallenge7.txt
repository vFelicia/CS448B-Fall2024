welcome to cutting with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in timecraft So today we're gonna do this one with the computer and the question mark so let's get brief yeah I I haven't detected a Time split in the 18s that have erased computer programs from history this is around the time the first computer scientist reveals her program to the world we need to go to London England and debug this issue so let's enter pot and press button time jumping in three two one residents one London England 1800s computer scientist no this can't be my program isn't working it worked perfectly before but I must present my program tomorrow but it will take weeks to make new Punch Cards what am I going to do Tara oh no the color must have altered the punch card in her computer there on the desk we must help her fix her Punch Cards let's take a closer look move towards the desk this is a desk that's the computer too the punch card is inside of the computer you can't fix it directly but your time agent can shrink down and repair for you press the button to zoom in on the punch card so you can give your time ancient instructions to fix it so this is the button press oh we're inside enough you're now zoomed in and looking down on the punch card let's color our time each and make the right holes in the punch card oh so this is the punch card start start activity so if agent got super small yeah let's use code to punch holes in the car to create the right program so right now when you punch the brown blocks that are in front of our agent so someone filled in the computer scientists Punch Cards that contained the instructions for the first algorithm code your agent to destroy the brown blocks to make the cards work okay so our agents right there and we need to destroy these brown box of code so agent have to move forward and then destroy down down and repeat it three times three times three times and then let's run it one two oh yeah we have to move one more forward so let's do this move forward so I say move two and then now when you do the other half yes go to the brown block so we move right two times agent move right two times one two so right now when you do it backwards yeah so let's get this away and then the agent destroyed down first and then we need to move backwards two times and then we need to repeat this three times so I can punch all the holes destroy destroy the shore congratulations time split repair now we're out great job your time agent has now returned to its normal size there is a dig streak yeah you're a scientist how on Earth my punch card is fixed I can finally review the first computer program to the world can you see me can you see me amazing work you prepare this moment in time don't you think it's funny how I use coding to save coding oh that actually I didn't what if it didn't work then how did we even go here here it doesn't really make sense yeah detect it oh the saw right here yeah press it it's probably it's the bed yeah fine secret you found the secret room take note of which time ages you see here and head back to the inside so there's Yeti and Gremlin okay Gremlin is always so suss because he's really cool grind me and Yeti too it's a Yeti and Mission time jumping in three two hi okay we're back let's pick ground Gremlin understood we'll keep a close watch on the agent so in this times Craft series we've completed all of them like all of these coding challenges and let's look at all of the things from our Victory so this is the last one the science this is the dinosaur this is the bear pet this is the punch car we did today one zero zero one zero punch punch this is wait which one is this I think it was the car one this one's the Mona Lisa this one's the Wall of China this is Apollo 11. this is the Pyramid of Giza and this is the first trumpet one so we completed all of it all of them well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
