welcome to cutting with kids my name is andrew today we're on minecraft education so we're in playful 101 lesson three so first we're going to talk to the ceo so the ceo says hey there it's good to see you again as we need your help at the company you would be surprised to know that software is used in every branch of mortar industry an example would be that we are developing software to help farmers this software makes people's lives easier and their jobs more efficient so the programmer says hello can you help me i need to make this sorting machine work but every time i run the code it gives me the wrong combination can you look at the sequence on the wall and write some that will give the right combination and chat turn your combination out by pressing the buttons in the same sequence so now we'll look at the variable sequences a c b and d so first we need to go to code builder so it says create two new new variables called b and c the value of b should be mount and the value of c should be apple so after a varies we're going to do c equals apple basically and b equals a so this will assign the fruit variable to a which is berry so then we're going to do play without say fruit so it'll say berry then here broken fruit equals c so now we're resigning it to c so do when the player does say fruit it'll say apple then and do this one here and do fruit equals b so he'll say melon and then finally there's fruit equals d so do player dots say berries so run it okay so first let's just say berries apple melon soda the developer developer says could i ask for your help i need to plant these crops on a defined location however i always get the coordinates wrong can you write some code i'll place the right crops in the correct positions i'll turn on your world coordinates for you so you can see them on the top left hand corner okay so now we have our coordinates on so first we're gonna go here okay oh it was right above us and we need so the instruction says look at each of the five different location variables over here and see what crops are at these coordinates you can create five place block of positioning commands with either pumpkin or melon block at the correct location variable to master crop at the corner you see the coordinates and coding window at the same time click on the half coating window button and okay here so we can see our position so first we're going to do this so we're going to do blocks dot place black spot please melon so so the mountain block is at location one so we're gonna do block stop placement block location one so we're gonna add an underscore here and next we're do we can do after this box dot place whisper i'm going to do melon blank again and black and location two okay then we're gonna do for location for every blocks dot place pumpkin location free kitchen free and for location four we're gonna do blocks dot place pumpkin location full and finally we're gonna do blocks top place melon block at location five looks like the other melon blocks you did the l okay so now that all the firm is planted on the right board so i'm going to go to our last activity somewhere let's talk to the data scientist the data scientist says hi can you help me i need to calculate the sums of three different lists on the monitors but for some reason i always get the total cost wrong can you write some code to calculate the free different final cost so first here this says look at to use monitor one and calculate this sum shown by creating a new variable called cost run the code to show the total cost in the chat press the matching button for that total so we're going to create a new variable called cost so we'll add up all this stuff so first we're going to do apple plus melon plus berries star which is times two because there's the order two berries and then plus plus one potato okay so now we're right then we're going to player that's a cop so we know which costumer all right then we're gonna go to screen two so did calculate okay next look at a tv monitor number two you now need to add a new crop pumpkin do this by creating a variable called pumpkin okay and then set this value as a formula that is the difference between the variables berries and apples so berries and apples so 20 minus 10 is 10. then add a new variable pumpkin to the variable cost then run the code and press the correct button so after potato and we're gonna add plus pump kit so we added pumpkin so now we're running this new tv monitor the value of the crops apple and melon have now changed apple has increased by price in two so we're going to change apples 10 to 12. melon has decreased in price by free it's been a minute okay somewhere change the melon to also 12. okay okay so now so we can see it okay so that costing was one apple one melon two berries one potato and one pumpkin so that's the same but we we increased the apple press and decreased the yeah so now we're let's see 76 press the button okay so we're going to go on the elevator because we're done you can press this so the door is closed and we're at the beginning again well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
