welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to scratch it in my account kit.com123 and this is the project i'm going to mix called minecraft bubble so you know it was like a bubble pop game like this yes i'm gonna have the matching bubble and pop the pop oh i don't want yellow i want red um yeah so in the balls you can see there are mobs yeah but with that exact color yeah so i just changed the you know the car so originally avatar was a scratch cat with a backpack this is the alex head and this is the head too which is supposed to be a blanket so i just made a rectangle and we made it black fill out the eyes yeah and this is sad and they should be the same as the original yeah look just exactly this is a little bigger yeah and there's the body so the head is like sometimes a little big that is like silly yeah and there's the bubbles so first there's the red which is i changed from the mushroom so originally in the bubbles they were like scratch characters there's like still signs of these trash cans the red there's the mushroom then the yellow is the ocelot then the green one is still a flag yeah the blue one is a phantom and you can literally see that her one is undermined yeah but it doesn't really show in you know and i changed the background too there is first a desert it used to be just a desert i changed it into a minecraft desert the woods i just found like this picture i like and the underwater so much corals and i added the subwoofer lullaby yeah and at the border i changed it into like a quick zoom pixel and and now let's play i'll go first level one is easy need a minute but there i'm going slowly but i'm actually a pro at this because this is just level one until you get into those hard levels there's about i think 26 levels yeah okay level phase angels okay wow yay um hmm so they're like send a chain reaction it's a little bit easy yeah but sometimes it's a hard way to go there so you need to pop some bubble before you go there no matter what color they are you can still pop it yeah pop it i just do here actually sounds like a better plan right here i think there's 26 levels it needs to take a long time to play them all hey there's a hole for you to go to those purple i call it purple because it's purple or lightning right i'm just gonna oh man there's not a bunch of blues here yeah what should you do you have a blue maybe that's not a good corner i'm just gonna do this i'm gonna switch to the mushroom switch switch if you get out of bubbles you will lose yeah but then well you can play yourself well that was fun and that is for today thank you for watching remember to smash that like button and subscribe bye bye
