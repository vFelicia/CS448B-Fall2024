welcome to getting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python today we're going to show you how to make a module and use it so first we will make a file called processor dot py so first we're going in depth process numbers so def is basically defined so here we are defining a function called process numbers and then you can type something here to check and get the numbers then we'll do process list equals to an empty list so the process this will store the numbers then if it's instant so here it will be using a if statement to check if what you typed here is a list if it's not a list it will return an empty list if it is a list it will check the items so for each item in the list you typed in if it's instance item it so if the item is integer it will add the item to the process list which is basically the final list then after we check all the items if it's not a and then you know alif is instance item string if it's a string then if item is numeric if it's a number then converted item equals into item and then it'll process list that append converted i so append the converted item then we're going to process the process list dot sort so it'll sort the list and then it will return process list next we'll define process names so you know then before it was process numbers now and processed names then unprocessed list so we're going to have the process list again and if it's in someone check if it's a list again if it's not a list it'll return the process list and then for it'll check if it is a list it will check the items so if instance item string if it is a string then it will check if it's not a number if it's not a number it'll append the item and then check all the items after it checks all the items they'll sort the list process list and then it'll return processes now we're gonna save it and go to demo dot py or whatever folder so i'm going to do import processor so we can use the functions from the processor dot py file and then be checking this list my list equals five dead four seven steve amy and a bunch of other stuff then we're also going to be trying my bad list which is the variables to see what it will do if we also check a thing that is not listed so first let me check my list is the process numbers function and the process names function once at the after it returns the process list list you know it'll put the list in numbers and names variables and then printing numbers and print names next we're going to check check my bad list so i'm going to do numbers which is a variable equals going to check and use the function process numbers on my bad list now print numbers and names which is a variable again equals processor dot process names my bad list so now we're going to process the names in my bad list then we're printing it so let's save it and so it did for the first one when i was checking process numbers for my list you got four four five seven seven nine so the first list is correct now it checked the process names on my list it did amy dan jill kim and ron dunsty so you can see it's sorted out the list so see amy dan jill steve kim and ronda so that worked and then it's two empty lists because it checks when we define a function it checks if the thing you typed is a list but my bad list is a variable it's not a list so it immediately returns empty lists well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
