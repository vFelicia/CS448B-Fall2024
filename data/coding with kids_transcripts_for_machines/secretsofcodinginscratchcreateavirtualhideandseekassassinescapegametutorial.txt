welcome to recording with kids my name is kalia my name is andrew today we're in scratch in andrew's account cool stuff kid so today i'm going to show you my game assassin escape so first there's the background i uploaded the image from google because i couldn't find the right background from scratch okay so it's just like it looks like a black hole in the middle yeah it is a space background then i have the scratch cap which is the player so the up arrow down arrow left arrow and right arrow is like how you control it so change y and change x which are the x and y coordinates to move scratch cat so you can move scratch cat with your arrow keys or yeah you can only move them from your arrow keys and then when green flags look that means when you run it show then set health to one that means you have one health and forever if touching assassin dash goes which is the ghost's name like sprite name then set health to zero broadcast game over lol that's the message then hide out loud so it'll broadcast the message to the ghost no to game over to game over actually yeah then when green flag clicked reset timer so this is programming the time forever yeah if timer equals 20 that means 20 seconds then say you win for two seconds stop all so you'll stop the game so yeah so if you survive for 20 seconds then it'll say you win but it's a little hard to survive for 20 seconds because the ghost will teleport to an unknown place like anywhere on the screen yeah escape so now the ghost is code so when i receive game over lol hide because before i did this code and i tested it the game over would would show but the scratch cat and the ghost would still be here like it's over the game over screen so you can still see them okay so the other code is for the assassin and ghost is when green flag clicked show forever point forward scratch cat so point four sketch then go to random position wait one second then repeat so ghosts go to random position that is why it is hard to avoid the ghost because you do not know where it is going yeah and game over screen so i also uploaded the game over screen yeah game over so when green color clicked hi because if i did not hide it then it would be game over and the player was like what i did not do anything and then when i received the message game over lol you know show because it's game over then play sound clapping because like it was like good playing okay let's run it okay teleported to me they always find on top of you sometimes yeah it can sometimes spawn on top of you stay in the corner oh no 18 seconds that was almost your turn your turn that's out of the screen don't go out of the screen that's 11 seconds so the health turns zero if you touched a ghost where am i oh i'm not looking on top okay try to dodge it try to die oh that was so cool i went to to um yeah too close to the ghost okay never go close to a ghost kids i'm an old grandma so the ghost is the assassin that's why it's called assassin escape because you have to escape from the ghost which is also an assassin and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash your like and subscribe bye
