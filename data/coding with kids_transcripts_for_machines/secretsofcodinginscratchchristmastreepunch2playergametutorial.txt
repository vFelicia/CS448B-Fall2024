welcome to cutting with kids my name is my name is andrew today we're scratching andrew's account techno468 so today i'm going to show you my christmas tree punch 2 player so it's basically a santa claus via scratch cat and they both need to punch the christmas tree so it's kind of like yeah a clicking game so it's two player so when you try to get the most clicks for 30 seconds and whoever has the most points which is clicks will win okay so first in scratch there's one w key press so the controls are w for scratch can up arrow key for santa so when scratch cat and then w key press broadcast cap punch which is a message change scratch cap points which is a variable over here by one so you get a point switch like a scratch cat kit yeah the police causing it to cost them two so i added like an explosion because it's punching it yeah it was like a very big force yeah like more dramatic and then wait one second change back to the regular costume and then play some point when you hit the tree and settle down so when green flag collector switch costs inputs first costing so it won't be the explosion scratch cats points variables and then forever change timer by one so it'll be one it'll be the timer then wait one second if timer equals 30 seconds you know broadcast end game and stop all because this game is only 30 seconds for santa for so long yeah when greenfield clicked it'll go into his first costume to also added a explosion for santa is there actually the reindeers that's kicking yeah when up arrow key pressed it's basically the same but santa kick message santa points um and it's different costumes so it's also the boiling sound for the tree which is christmas tree and green flower collector switch costume to tree is it regular so i also did two more costumes where like a shaking animation for the tree so when i receive cat punch or santa kick from scratch cat and santa when they punch and kick then they switch costume to tree so it's a regular costume and then wait 0.3 seconds change it to 2 3 2 so shake and then wait 0.3 seconds go to the other side and then return to the usual costume yeah i'll do the same for cat punch then there's this winner's thing which is basically the winner screen when green if i clicked a high so when i receive end game from scratch cat when the timer's 30 seconds let's show and then if santa points is more than scratch cap points and it'll switch causing two santa wings santa wins else if santa points is less than scratch count point the switch costing you scratch cap scratch can't win okay i'll see sprite 2 which is basically the instruction around the back or santa okay so the background's basically on yellow and red to be kind of christmas themed colors i like um red and green yeah okay i'm gonna play one round okay and i'm scratch cat three two one go now so you can play with your siblings or maybe friends if you don't have a sibling prepared because you need to complete the sound and the animation we're racially tied i think it's going to be that's a tied forever santa only has six reindeer okay scratch cat wins i won but i have 22 because he clicked after the timer that's bad you can play it yourself you just the link is in the description well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash like and subscribe bye bye
