welcome to getting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about iterating through lists by using the four statements so first we're going to do suits equals so it's just like a variable but this square bracket marks the list so hearts spades clubs and diamonds are the four items and they're separated by commas next we're going to do ranks so it's like another list with two three four five six seven eight nine ten jack queen king and ace so right now we're gonna be printing out the whole deck of cards by using nested four statements so next we're gonna do four suit and suits so now this is a four statement so like fours each something so that something is suit which is a variable for the items in the suits so first item is in suits is a heart so it will check hearts first and space then clubs and diamonds so then we're gonna put a four statement inside another four state so for rank and ranks so then we're gonna do the ranks list then print f string rank of suit so it's first let's check hearts and then it'll first check two in the ranks then it will print like the two items that is checking in the list so uh it'll first print two of hearts on the first time it runs the for loops i'm going to save it with ctrl s and run it so i did p y list not p y so let's go up here there's a lot of that actually yeah so there's two of hearts six of hearts eight of hearts this is really long but not too loud then there is eight okay then nine of spades oh yeah there's a lot there's two of hearts three of hearts four of hearts five four hearts six of hearts seven hearts eight of hearts nine of hearts ten of hearts jack of hearts queen of hearts king of hearts and ace of hearts and it will repeat for spades clubs and diamonds so now let's see what will happen if we switch the suits in the first for loop into ranks and the inner for statement into suits let's change the suit to rank and the students into ranks and then the ranks to suits and the rank to suit so now it will be like two hearts no it will be two yeah two of hearts two of spades two of clubs and two diamonds and then it will be oh yeah and then free of hearts free of spades free of clubs and free of diamonds and it will repeat so let's save it and see what will run now so let's do oops py let's stop py so here is the bottom of the water printed there's the ace of diamonds ace of clubs eva spades ace of hearts and it repeats that for all the items in ranks so like reversed the thing so like there's two parts not hearts of two well there's two parts two of spades not hearts of two and hearts are free now next we're gonna do import random and numbers equals then a bunch of numbers so import what's help hyphen we're using a module and random is the module we're using and is a builtin module so in another video we also learned about the python standard library and the and import so next we have a list called numbers with a bunch of random numbers then we'll do selected number which is a variable equals random.choice numbers so we need to do random dot choice number so choices function because the choice function is inside the random module so the choice function will choose a random item from our list numbers and then that item is stored in the variable selected number then we're going to print selected numbers so you can like make it into a guessing gate next we're going to do selected numbers which is another variable different from a selected number because that's s then random choices numbers k equals free so choices will also pick items out of your list randomly well pick multiple random items so k equals free is how many items you want choices to pick from your list and those items will be stored inside the variable selected numbers and then print the selected numbers again so let's save it so now let's run it 42 it got the first item in the choice and then the choice is got 8 101 and 77. now we need andrew just what number at least one of the numbers it will come it has to be in the list numbers yeah 23. yeah 23 came out your turn just a number 101 oh my 220 freeze there's no 77 my turn choose 55 55 16 16 there's 16 so the choices is easier because there's free items that it chooses so like there is more chance you will guess that item but choice is harder because there's only one item it chooses that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
