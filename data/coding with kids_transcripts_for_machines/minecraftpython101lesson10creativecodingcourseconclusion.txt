welcome to cing with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew today we're in a Minecraft education Edition So today we're going to do python 101 lesson 10 so this is the last lesson so first let's talk to the CEO he says I want to thank you for being of such a great help here at coding mine we just need your help with one last thing we want to ship the agent out to the public however we need to stress test it a bit more first that is why we have developed a testing area where you will be able to complete challenges that will test the usefulness of the agent so now you can also compete against a friend and press two players but right now we're only going to do one player so we're going here and then here then we're going to have to complete a certain amount of challenges within and each challenge has like 300 seconds so our first challenge is blinding lights so you can see a timer at the top for each challenge so first blinding lights make the agent place the Redstone lamps in its inventory on top of the redstone blocks while walking toward forwards on the walkway to the gold block so here we have to place the Redstone lamps on the redstone blocks so first we can see a pattern here there's one on the right then you walk two times there's left and then it repeats until it goes all the way to the gold block so let's do a loop for our Y in range we're going to do one two three three times we're going to do um agent. Place uh we're going to do right first then we're going to do agent. move oh and include the column and the tab then forward two then we're going to do agent. place left then after we go left we're going to do move forward again to the right one to the uh redstone blocks on the right so now let's run it says placing all the blocks and now I reached the gold block so now it'll see correct and it'll go to Nick's challenge so if you do anything wrong you can also go to here and press the button to reset the challenge so now we have to can you well uh can you make the agent move over every block in the area sideways row by row without a turning so the agent has a turn a commands which would take more time but we have a way of we a shorter way of getting here of getting to the gold block without making a turn so we can also make it go sideways by doing agent. move right or left so first we're going to make it go right one 2 3 4 five 6 seven eight eight times so we're going to do agent do move right I'm going do eight times then to go to the next row we have to go to agent. move forward one then we're going to go left eight times and then move forward to the next set of rows and then we're going to repeat all this with a four with a four Loop for I in range we're going to do it let's see one two three four four times and then we're going to add the Colin and tab then we're going to run it and we may have to make it go forward the last time or maybe not so go first pair of rows now second pair of rows third pair and the final fourth then reach the gold blocks next we have pumpkin or Melon okay so our next challenge is to destroy the melon so make the agent move forward to the gold block while breaking the melons but leaving the pumpkins alone so the green blocks are melons and the orange ones are pumpkins so I like to do it manually so you can just code the agents to move forward and break the melon blocks another way to do it is to do a repeat Loop and where the agent inspects each block on his right and if it's a melon it will uh destroy the block I I will use the manual way so first we can see the first first three pump uh melons are in a pattern so we're going to make the agent move first I'm going to make the agent go move forward one time then we can go in a repeat Loop so for I in range and do it three times we're going to do agent. destroy on its right and then I'm going to do agent. move forward two times to the next pumpkin I mean to the next melon then uh I think that works let's see destroy destroy and Destroy so now I'm kind of miss one pumpkin so it's to move backwards and then destroy it so we're going to delete the four Loop and we're going to agent. move uh back one time and then destroy the right so now we only you need to move forward three times destroy and move to the gold block move forward three times dest dra right and then move one more time to the gold block destroy the melon and then onto our next challenge so our next challenge we're going to we delete the quote so already deleted that from the beginning and end of each line finish the code so that the agent moves towards the gold block and counts each diamond block it passes over at the end when the agent reaches the to the gold block the agent should then place the number of diamond blocks passed over in front of it one by one these blocks will be automatically stacked by a piston so now we're going to add an if Loop right here if agent. inspect so here it inspects a block somewhere so we're going to do it down down and then it'll get the type of the block and equals diamond block diamond block here we're going to add one one to the variable Diamond which helps the agent count um the number of diamonds it passed over now we're going to run it and then it'll just all you can see is just going all the way here so now it's going to stack the number of diamond blocks passed over using data from the variable so now we got it on to your next challenge what's that syntax this one is kind of fun so here we have custom blocks which syntax left parenthesis right parenthesis quotation marks commas columns and periods so here our instructions are the code below is missing all of his syntax add the correct syntax in the coding wi to make the code run then place the matching missing syntax blocks in the world so have to do stuff manually so here's the sample code we have to fix the sample code and add the syntax so first we have a four Loop so for I and range is correct then we have to add parentheses 10 that's the parentheses are the mixing missing uh syntax then we also have to add a colum for the for Loop tab doesn't matter because it's already there so agent so for the function we have to do agent dot move so we have a a a period there and then we also have parentheses and a comma for the the second line then for the third line we have to do player. save because it's another function then we're going to do parenthesis finished so here we're wishing we're U missing the period the parenthesis and the quotation marks so here we're going to go the agent to Gold block then we're going to get the quotation blocks and then we're going to add the missing syntax so here first in the first line we're missing two parentheses and a so we're going to add these blocks right that seems so fun call yeah it is so fun they also extra blocks so in case you make any mistakes you can just keep doing it then second line we have a period first period Then parentheses then parentheses comma and parenthesis uh this is comma okay then for our last line we have a period parenthesis and quotations so period parentheses and then the two quotations so this is probably the most fun next is challenge spring arrival so here we have to in the coding window you have been giving a code that does not work delete the quotes in the beginning and end of each line this code is supposed to plant flowers on each block of grass for making the agent move through the area row by row can you finish The Code by adding conditional UND debuging the main Loop so first we're going to move the quotations so the code will can run okay then we're going to have to look for um debugs well bugs and we have to add a condition I think so here we're trying to put roses I think on each of the grass blocks so now I fixed it and now here we have to change from the four repeat Loop to five so that it will match up and reach the gold block then here instead of the if true because then it will place block it'll try to place a rows on every single block which is uh not good we're going to change the AG to Asian inspect and look down and see if it's grass then it if it it is grass it will Pro place down the rose if not it will move forward then the others are just uh the agent. move and turns to go down the rose so now we're going to run it and you should place the Roses on the uh grass blocks so one rows two rows sometimes it would just walk so slow we got the third rows we got the fourth rows and then the last rows and then now it only needs to reach the gold block okay correct now our next challenge okay so for our next challenge it's very simple first we have to make the agent mine the diamond ore behind it and then drop the M Diamond into collection area at the other end make the agent return mine the emerald ore that will appear and drop it in the collection area so basically the agent is the minor so first we're going to do a repeat Loop since we have to do diamond and emerald so for Iron Range two times we're going to first agent. destroy in the back then we have to do asent do collect all to get the diamond and emeralds um then we're going to agent do move forward eight times to the pit we're going to drop all agent. drop all then we're going to move back to the block Place m. move back eight times and then it should run for both the diamond and the emerald so now there's also extra XP the agent's fast yeah it's so fast correct next challenge is diamond or dirt so here we have three diamond blocks and three dirt blocks so here we have to place the blocks in the gold blocks for us okay so here first it's a math question write some codes to calculate the aners to these four Expressions shown here you need to get the agent to Gold block do this by placing a diamond or dirt block from the chest depending on the answer of expression from left to right if the answer is one place a diamond block if it's zero place a dirt block so here we can easily solve this by using a pretty fun function so here in Python it's pretty easy to solve an expression today we're going to use agent do wait we're going to do player. say this will help us this will make us a run uh say something in chat so we're going to copy the Expressions we're going to put them in say then the function will solve the expression and write and our player will say the answer we're going to do the same for all of these um expressions and the the answer is will only be one or zero okay so we're going to do this and then if it's one I think if it's one you place a diamond block if it's zero you place a dirt block okay then we're going to last one uh now we're going to run it so here we have one0 one0 so we place one diamond block one dirt block diamond block and one dirt block now we're going to do agent. move forward agent. move forward how many times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight six okay eight times so we can walk over the air last challenge is the agent librant it's basically a maze navigate the agent through the maze write some code to use the colored blocks as forward left and right controls for the agent movement then control the agent to the end of the maze by standing on the colored blocks so here you just have to get the agent through the maze so first we going to move forward three times two oh yeah two agent do move for two times we're going to run that then we're going to move it right one two 3 four five times and then move forward two times again yeah for two times then next we have to move left write three times okay so now we have to move left five times six times six times left six times then it to also move forward two times right yeah one two yes next we have to finally move left four times then we can delete the forward we're going to run it and now correct so congratulations lesson complete your score is nine so your score is like based on how many challenges you completed correctly so there are 10 challenges okay so now we basically completed python 101 well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe byebye one 1 0 right so this no okay
