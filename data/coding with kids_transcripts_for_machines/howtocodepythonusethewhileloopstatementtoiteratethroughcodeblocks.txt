welcome to recruiting with kids my name is my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about iterating in python so first we're going to do import random so import will tell python you're using a module so random is a module that is built into python and in another video we told you how to use modules from the python standard library so random is in the python standard library so it's built into python so then we're going to do rule equals zero so rule is the number you rolled so we're going to make a dice rolling game it's a variable yeah then we're gonna do count equals zero so count will keep track of how many times you rolled the dice then we'll do wall roll five well not when while roll is not five then count equals count plus one so it's adding one to the variable count because you rolled one time then roll random dot random one five so you can row one or two or three or four or five yeah so random is a function inside random and it will pick a number or an integer from one to five yeah then we're going to do print rule so it'll print the number rule rules so like you'll have a number from one to five then print a string so you can put the variable count in there it took count rolls to row of five so that's how many times you ruled to roll the five if the it printed a number that's not five then it'll repeat the while loop until it prints a five yeah okay let's save it with ctrl s and then go to the terminal and type while p y wall dot okay then it says five it took one rules to roll a five let's do that again okay up arrow to copy when you last typed in a terminal five it took one roll to roll a five again three five it took two rules to roll a five so now we know it worked because first it did two times five now it did three five now it we know it works because it wrote three then five again then it took two rows to roll five yeah let's try one more time it says four five it took two rules to rule a five i always do five it has two okay now we're gonna make the version two of our dice rolling game and it's gonna have better yeah i'm just gonna have player names okay then we're gonna do before the wild rule is not five we're gonna do print first person to rule five wins so that's like the instructions so it tells you how to win then we're gonna do after the while rule is not five then name equals name is another variable that has your name input so you can type your answer enter a name or queue to quit i won't quit so after it prints enter a name or queue to quit you can type a name yeah but right now we don't have the code for cube yeah then we do if name equals two q that means if you type q to the question enter a name or queue to quit you type q it will do break and then it will go down to print you roll count times so it will skip and go out of the while loop then we're going to do else after a print f name world rule so print f name f string name word rule well like for example if i take bob as the name then i'll do bob ruled for example free and then if it's still number five it'll go to wins if it is a five it'll do bob wins if bob ruled five then after that you'll go to printf string you will dice count times so i'll also print you rule the dice count times if you pressed q that means quit and then save it and go to here and do p1 wall dot py so first person to roll five wins that's an instruction enter a name or cue to quit andrew enter world one okay your turn type kalia leah clear roll the two enter name look you to quit okay you rolled the dice four times and we didn't get a five so it did not say who won because no one rolled the five i just typed quit and then it says you rolled the dice four times let's do it again first person to rule five okay i can do a for you what about five a win dice one time a a tomorrow four again clear clearly i will die six times okay now we're finally gonna make our third version the last version okay so let's do after the name and put enter name or queue to quit it'll check if you typed a space yeah if you typed no matter how many spaces you type it'll strip we use the strip function to remove all the empty spaces and then if you just typed a bunch of spaces then it'll remove all spaces that means you type nothing and then it will continue which means it will restart the while loop again so you um type that name yeah so it will print enter a name or queue to quit again because you basically type nothing so after that you will do if name dot strip equals q break so it's just like the other code checking if name equals q so if name got stripped so we added the strip function then it'll do that means it'll do quick so it'll break so go all the way to you roll the dice count times so let's save it and run it so first person to rule five wins enter name or queue to quit i'm gonna do andrew andrew world one space so it says enter a name or q to quit again because you rarely type nothing yeah because remove the space we cleared a bunch of spaces i guess do enter it does it again because how many spaces do you do you still need to at least type one letter onto it continue yeah okay rule two okay let's do bobby bobby five bobby wins my bobby you hold the dice three times so if you type a space it doesn't count as when you roll the dice because it continues so enter a name or q to quit did not do count equals count plus one okay one more time okay let's do andrews your turn okay okay two next tommy when well tommy thomas larry ladies roll five lettuce wins you roll the dice four times that you ticked us four times to do lattice yeah that is one letter so lucky girl why doesn't it do kania or andrew okay that's not how you spell with me i press enter too fast okay and that's it yeah and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like and subscribe bye
