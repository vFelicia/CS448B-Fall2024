welcome to curtin with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you pipelines today we're going to learn about dictionaries in python so first we have mob equals and curly bracket so mob is the dictionary's name then we have the key then the value so we have three keys and three values name so the name is wither then hearts 500 and enemies and there's a list with players sand and mobs so this is a dictionary so dictionaries values can have integers strings and lists now we're going to print them all to see how a dictionary looks when we print it so now i did name whether hearts 500 enemies then the list player sand and mobs so printed the key then the value okay next one we do print mob name so name is a key so when we do this we get the name key and it will print the value which is weather it's now a printed weather next we're doing print mob docket color so we're gonna see what happens if we try to get a key that does not exist so it did none because there is no color key in the mob dictionary next we're going to do print mob docket color then the default value is not found so we're going to save it and do this so it did not found because we did the default value then we're going to do mob name equals ender dragon then we're going to print mob get name so here we're changing the value of the name key so before it was withered now we're changing it to ender dragon so now let's see if we worked successfully so we use the key again and it did ender dragon which means we change the name value successfully make sure we do mob color equals blacks then we'll print mob dot get color so mod color equals black is how we add a new key in value did black because we successfully added the key in that next we're going to do print mob sprints save it so it did this so it up it added the color black and it's like the name value is still under drag next we're going to do mod.update so with this we can update the key and values so here we change the heart's value to 700 instead of 500. now i'm going to print them all so now it's hard to change from 500 from the last time we run it now to 700. if we're going to do dell mob and then we're going to print them up so dell is basically delete so here we're deleting the value print ma so pop is basically delete but it'll also return the values now save it so the name equals underdragging and color black so now there's no hearts print hearts then did 700 so the pop returned the value so delete is different from top yeah so now we're going to print the lens mop so the link function here when we use it on the dictionary it'll show us the number of pairs of keys and values so i did two because now there are only two more pairs of keys and values so next we're going to print mob dot key so the keys function will show us the keys that are in the mob dictionary so now there are dick keys which are dictionary keys name and color so there are only two keys left then we're going to print mod values this is just like the keys function except it will show us the values inside the dictionary so now i dedicate values under dragon and blacks there are still two we're going values print mob the items the mobs the items the items function will show us the remaining pairs of values and keys so detect items name enter dragon and then color and black so it's the keys and values next we're going to do before statement so for each key in the mob dictionary we're going to print the key now i did name and color because those are the remaining keys and we're going to do that same except we're going to print the keys and that at least in the mall of the icons so now it did name enter dragon and then color black well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
