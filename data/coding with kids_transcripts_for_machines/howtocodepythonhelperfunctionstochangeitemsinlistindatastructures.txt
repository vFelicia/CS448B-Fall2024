welcome to cutting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're going to show you python today we're going to learn about python list helper functions every item in the list is separated by commas so each color is a item so in another video we learned about python lists so after we do the list we're going to do print colors because we're going to use the helper functions list helper functions to change the list so when you print it to see how it changed so first i'm going to print colors like this push the square brackets yeah with the square brackets and the columns next i'm going to do color which is a variable equals colors which is the list so their names is very similar but this does not have the s equals colors dot pop zero so pop is a python list helper function that will remove an item using its index number so the first item is always zero yeah so it's index number zero so red is zero so we're going to remove red so the last item is whatever number it is so yellow is one orange is two and it keeps going off so purple can be negative one and you can also fro count from the back to the front so here we're gonna pop zero so color is red now now you're going to print popped red because here it removed red and color is red then we're going to print the new list colors let's do control s to save it and go to the terminal and type p y list dot p y so did the original list then popped red and then it did yellow orange green blue and purple so first out red first it print the pass then it say pop thread then it print the new list without read byebye so next we're gonna keep using our colors list so we're going to always use the colors let's throughout all our programs today next we're going to print colors again print original then colors dot append black and colors dot append white so append is a list helper function that will add items so here we're adding black and white and these items go to the back of the list we're also going to do colors that remove yellow and colors that remove orange so remove is just like pop but you for remove is slower and you need to type the exact item in here yeah so we're going to add black and white and we're going to remove yellow orange finally we're going to print colors again so let's save it and you can use the up arrow to copy what you last typed internal so it did the original then red green blue purple black and white so it removed yellow and orange and i added black and white oh yeah so next we have the list again and we're gonna do colors that remove whatever it's not in the list yes so we're gonna see what happens if we try to remove an item that is not in the list let's save it and run it so it did a bug it said list.remove then xs whatever you typed in is not in the list so if you try to remove an item that is not in the list then you have a book no next thing i do new colors equals lime and gray so this is another list with two colors lime and grey that's another color two other colors next we're gonna do colors.extend new colors then print colors so the extend helper function will add two lists together so the new colors is going to be added to color yeah and the items are going to be at the back of the list so let's save it and run it oh what happened so it yeah so there was lime and gray at the back next we're gonna do print colors so you know original list then we're gonna do colors.clear so the clear helper function will clear your list and it will be an empty list there will be it'll clear every single item in the list except the um square brackets yeah that two square brackets is an empty list finally we're gonna print the empty list let's save it and run it so it did the original list then blank it has no items no anything in the list just two square brackets yes yeah that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
