welcome to recording with kids my name is andrew today we're in microsoft education edition and we're going to make a project which is called rabbit invasion so kalia changed it kind of like changed it so you don't have to kill a rabbit so originally it was one of just four tutorials but clearly like changed so like if you put a bed and then there will be maybe rats yeah instead of um killing rabbit to make two more spawn so first i'm gonna do when so on your bed place good so when you like want to go to sleep yeah it doesn't matter which color then you need to do a set i mean we need to make a variable first call rabbit because when you like um keep track of the rabbits like yeah then random so we're going to set the um pick random and we the variable set rabbit two so we're going to pick random from zero to five so it might spawn zero rabbits or one two three four five then so we if the um thermal rabbit is zero then you don't do anything so if rabbit equals two so rabbit has a value yeah so we're gonna keep track how many rounds there are so if there are zero then you do nothing then if rabbit equals one because it chooses normal like random then you need a spawn a rabbit so so here like after we pick how many rabbits um it's gonna spawn we're gonna spawn so rabbit and then you keep like one two three four five but we need a repeat loop and hopefully here repeat two times so we spawn two rabbits and then three four five you can spawn like hostile mobs if you want but right here we're doing rabbits so we you can search monster because the spawn animal only spawns uh mobs that are not hostile so all you have to do to change these spawn rabbits is change the rabbit equals so you can change four or five stuff and you just change the repeat number so you can do like 10 but that will be adding a lot of code 100 is too insane i would think it's really the same code yeah so let's read the code in python okay so rabbit equals zero so this is the variable so right now it starts as value as zero so there's zero rounds so define shows a function on block place the bed global rad so we can use the interval rabbit everywhere the rabbit moves around where you are so it's position zero zero zero so spawn one then rabbit equals two and four index and range two so we'll spawn two rabbits then it'll be the same four with rabbit equals three if gravity equals four and if rabbit equals five and then block stop unblock placed bet so when you place the bed it'll run the function okay now let's get a bed which color should be yet blue light blue light cyan or cyan uh light blue white blue okay okay that's right okay now i'm gonna place it i guess it only allows white bed or maybe that it dudes zero okay let's do it again guess it only allows white to bed it's gonna do like that one of them is a baby this one's a baby oh it's three it's three one black two little brown okay next oh two two so they spawn all at the same time so at first when you look down they're all at the same spot yeah but then when they start moving you can see this time four no five that's the highs and three of them are big so cute okay should we change it rabbits to um well that was fun so if we change rabbits into what should we change it oh zombies zombies yeah okay let's do it but we need to change a lot of things but it's okay yeah okay so monsters we're gonna do monsters here okay if so monster let's do zombies and we're just gonna duplicate it so we get a lot so we just need to change the um spawn yeah if you're in survival mode this will be a little bit insane because every time you want to go to sleep then some style moms yeah but you can't sleep on hostile malls like zombies okay okay get ready they're burning oh spit me tonight no maybe we'll spawn some lucky zombies with help i don't think so now they're all burning all over the place and they're oh they're heading to a pound you lucky one these smart ones oh we got zero wait why aren't they going to the pound before they die yeah that one's smart this one go go go oh no that one also oh that one's a pro oh this one's not gone they're still getting damaged because every time they jump now these ones are safe because they spawned in there i want them to change into a drown when your weight oh it's a baby one i want to get a drown you just need to wait keep jumping around most of them will just get burnt let's uh do another one what should we do creepers yes if you're like so um thing like the variable doesn't match that you might want to change it but do you let's oh it just exploded the other creepers how sad okay let's do it one one yeah it's just one explode the bed boom exploded the two first two blue beds and the bed we just placed yeah hi rabbits okay it's chicken a pig okay let's go to a forest i want to go to the florida but the other one all right oh it's the next one let's see how far now we can explode trees which is more friendly oh we got one boom logistics will be part of it it's on right on top of the bullet that okay let's explore one on top of the tree oh we can't place it on yay so we did zombie creeper skeleton the three most um common moms whole stuff okay skills skeletons were also born then go to this little pal okay oh let's go wait is it why isn't that burning i guess they're still but the brownies look different oh you got zero this time oh seriously oh five what oh they're so smart they're way smarter than the zombies yeah they're all just in march through march yeah it went the other way to the trees oh yeah the trees provide trees um uh provide shade okay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
