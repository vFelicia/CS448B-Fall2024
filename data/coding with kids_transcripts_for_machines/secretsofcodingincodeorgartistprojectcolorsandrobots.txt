welcome to recruiting with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in kodak and this is the project i made called clothes and robots because there's a lot of colors and robots so let's see the art is so fast so fast yeah he's drawing a lot of lines with colors and robots and now let's see so one run for counter from fifteen to three hundred that means like the circles so counter is a variable right here and then set with to counter divided by zero say alpha counter then move forward by counter pixels right now we're coding so it will draw like these the colors then turn right by 61 degrees which will make the turns and set color to random colors that's how there's a lot of colors yeah after it's one straight line it'll change color so this is the code then jump to the middle center position because if we don't have the jump middle position we ended right here so the artists are like out of the screen yeah so you need to jump to the middle center position before you make the circle of robots yeah which is right here then repeat 10 times because i need to make a like a full circle draw robot with size 1000 pixels so it's this big turn right by 104 degrees so they're not gonna go all on the same place you can choose a lot of different like this mouse i think that's a squirrel unicorn wizards alien that's a zombie looks like one oh this one is one alien this i thought that was angry bird like it has a stomach that's white and you know red fur and i chose the robot because angel really like wanted the robot now if you keep clicking it click the four counter like this it like it changes color because it's always random colors so click clicking it's like it's the color is moving like magic but there's no wizard in this world except somebody pretends that so let's see the audience it keeps drawing and drawing different colors well it can be the same color but where because it is random and then i'm gonna say that very slow okay not too slow mr fastest so slow it's very slow yeah it's like overlapping each other look so if i set it to let's see no that's too much that's a 100 yeah 100 well look there's like and then there is one two three four five six seven about seven robots here so it's like another drawing yeah so it's like much prettier because there's another layer or something over there something black let's change it to c uh that's llama's a rabbit and there's a lot of ears now yeah let's see one last one pika pika wow there's a lot of wings her wings are big yeah and they look so pretty so pretty okay there's the robot let's do it one more time faster oh looks like it's bright colors over here oh no this token over you break colors and they become darker and darker you see this one this is very light and then peach comes darker and darker and then oh yeah yeah the tendons make these because it's their top yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
