welcome to curtin with kids my name is andrew today i'm scratching in my account called keep that code one two three and this is the project i make called balloon pop so let's see play balloon is getting bigger is it gonna pop baby oh there's a time variable how many times 10 oh there's 44 oh meter and some balls so now let's see the code so first is the balloon when this right click change clicks by one to change the size it clicks as a variable of how many clicks yeah and every time you click it it will change size by one so and how it like gets bigger yeah it's like it tells you that it's about to pop yeah so when i receive playtime which is a message switch costume to balloon 1c so which is this balloon let me down she got it from the scratch collection yeah then go to x 11 y negative 11 which is this place then when reflect click show set clicks to zero switch costing to balloon one c set time to zero and set size to 100 so because i need to do set size to 100 because every time you click it will add one so if i don't have this the next game it will be wow it would like absolutely look so big we can't see anything yeah when i receive play time show variables clicks repeat ten times so you're adding like because it's called top wait one second change time by one show variable time so oh every it's like a timer and then if clicks is bigger than is greater than 20 then switch costume to a costume 2 so if it's less than 20 it will not pop this is costume two it's the popped balloon the balloon popped and then it will brought a kiss and next is the instructions so when you press the instructions button you'll say click on the balloon as many times and 10 seconds for three seconds so it tells you the simple instructions yeah then when green flag click go to the position it is right now then show then whenever you save play time it will hide because you're playing so you don't need the menu yeah then the play button when this sprite click broadcast play time hide you need a broadcast deploy time because when you click it it's time to play then when green flag clicked show how good is the popup meter when green flag clicked high and go to the position which is right here and when i receive and show because you don't want to see the popup meter when you're playing and there's the slider when grapefruit click hide and go to over here yeah about there here and then when i receive end is where i will tell the instruction where to go if clicks is greater than 70 and less than 100 or clicks equal to 100 so if i don't have the equal to 100 if you do 100 clicks you'll like the it'll do your popping here nowhere yeah just stay here like i have nothing to do then glide to one second to the green space on the how good which i called the popup meter on the green space because you're so good like 70 to 100. so using the glide to go like pop the blue and show your score yeah but if clicks is greater than 40 and less than 70 or clicks equals to 70 it will go to the yellow spot so it's the same for the other ones but it's just the 20 to 44 and when i start as a clone so we're now coding the clone show glide one second to random position go to balloon and wait five seconds and then hide and then there's one backdrop which i made and now let's play i'm gonna go first there's only 10 seconds so this girl will be here in real life i don't like balloons popping oh over here monitor yellow the common one if you're very good at clicking you will get the green one to get green yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
