welcome to coding with kids my name is Kalia my name is Andrew can I wear a Minecraft education Edition so right now we're gonna press play and go to the library so it says View Library so over here like do coding and now we're gonna go to out of code and go to alphco escape estate so it's like a person with chest with a lot of emeralds so let's create world since we didn't create this world Minecraft creative we have to like load it to so we can play in it so it's right now building to rain so we have to wait a few moments without it okay welcome to hour of code 2022. let's start with a short tutorial to begin user device to either left click or press the correct control scheme that best applies to you so we're going to use a keyboard and then click the logo to begin Minecraft presents Escape estate oh it's like it's like a camera and there's a person right there I think it's us person in this thing blue one well okay welcome the following tutorial will teach you the basics of navigating Minecraft so we're gonna start the tutorial until when you move or Mouse around to look at the ore so you can use your mouse to move around here okay press W to move forward a to move left W to move forward D to move right so we these are the controls to move um Left Right and forward in Minecraft navigate past the wall can't jump over the wall it's okay you can move press W to move and then space to jump space to jump okay jump congrats you completed the movement tutorial for my instruction on how to interact with the world has H2 show controls okay so now right click on the button right click oh there's a guy wow it's tall guy Dr berserky okay right hello I am Dr Dodge Breezer I see you've received my invitation do you think you have what it takes to escape the Dementia by Dawn and claim the 1 million emeralds excellent now head to the front door to begin your challenge let's go just like this game shows we're yet to do something and then you get awarded yeah here in Minecraft you get awarded with um a lot of emeralds because you can trade um emeralds well what is that a tongue the the house has got a huge it's like a monster search room for particles like there's this thing called the last guy diary I guess it's a diary trophy unlocked first note connected wow cool okay right click to open lost diary you found a lost diary you can't find all 10 missing pages as you explore the Mansion so we're gonna go to the next page entry one that actually dear diary last week I received an invitation from some mysterious person challenging me to escape the smash the note said that if I escape by Dawn I'd win a million emeralds wow though I don't I didn't need the emeralds I fought a challenge like this would make a great video for my channel just like how we are doing it okay so search frame for particles again oh there's something oh hello is someone there oh my a human do you think you can help me I can't seem to open this door but Forefront I think my code may be broken do you think you could take a look and see what's wrong with it yes great if you can get me out of here I will return the flavor and help you escape the attic which programming language would you like to use so there's a blocks in Python you're going to use Python but if you're like a beginner in coding we recommend you to use blocks okay python okay first see that cursor over there on the floor it needs to move forward three blocks to reach the trapdoor but it isn't working press C to view the code okay so there's this is the cursor so and the agent is inside here we need to open the vent door to let it out okay see the box with the arrow on the floor is your cursor so use the cursor to manipulate block to solve puzzles throughout this experience in this activity you'll use it to open the trapdoor and release the agent use move the move cursor function to position the cursor and open trapdoor to open the trap door you have selected the move cursor function takes one parameter that defines its direction that parameter is the color of the area that represents the direction you want to move ballot directions are orange which is forward so you can put orange inside the parentheses to make the function uh to make the cursor move a Direction so this is a good example let's see what it does so it goes move oh okay Sports and then try to open it but it doesn't work no that's not quite right the cursor needs to move to this tractor and tell the two of them okay so let's go see it to code so this block doesn't work so this code doesn't work so we need to move the cursor so it's positioned above the wooden trap door okay so we need to move so this is wrong this code is not correct and then we have to move cursor one more time to reach the trapdoor like right underneath it underneath our cursor Orange oopsies don't ever spell anything wrong when you're doing coding language or else there will be something wrong with it okay so we need to move cursor three times forward and then open the trap door so we're one two three open great great it's open that's strange I still can't seem to get out can you check the code again and make sure I'm moving up two blocks okay now we open a trap door but the agent still needs to get up okay I wonder who trapped it there oh now that the trap door is open you'll need to move the agent up two blocks instead of three use the Asian dot move function to move the agent up the Aging dot move function takes one parameter that defines what direction it should move in five directions are forward back left right up and down so this is a code example so agent dot move up so only moves up one time so that doesn't work so let's try to in so over here is where we coat it so it moved already one up but has to move two times so let's do it my agent that repeat it so it's two times then he'll come up okay uh up not anything else but up okay thank you you fix my code now I'm in Rage open the green door for you the pathway Behind the Green Door is an easier one you can take that path or talk to me again if you want to try opening the yellow so there are doors here I think that's the yellow door oh there's something over here I think it's a red and that that sounds like it's another group so in our next video we're gonna go into the green portal but for now we're not it looks very serious look at our characters oh right so that first person we saw in the beginning is us so it's like so mysterious okay let's wait for that video well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching Remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye
