welcome to good news kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew today we're in vex code so this project is going to be about dynamic eye sensing description this example shows how we avoid falling with the eye sensor and use eye sensor to find castle to crash into so first we need a forever loop then drive forward detects so right now it's gonna drive forward for him then if down i detects red then drive is first for 500 millimeters because red is at the edge of the playground and after the red you can fall yeah then turn left for pick random from pick random from 30 to 90. 30 to 90 then set degree which is a variable turn left for so it will pick a random 30 to 90 degrees to turn left after it dries reverse for 500 millimeters to prevent falling then set degree to zero so degree is a variable and repeat until until we need or or and if distance found an object distance found an object or degree is more than 345 345 345 degree variable degree so if it spins around in a full circle or distant family and object if it found an object it will change the degree by five so change degree by five so it's a variable then turn left for degree degrees so the first degree in turn left for degree degrees is the variable degree so turn left for variable variable i mean degree degree degree degrees so right now the degree is five so it'll turn this for five degrees and i'll keep adding five and it will repeat that until if it turns more than 345 degrees then it will stop and drive forward again now let's test it so let's run it into the mode first yay crash into this one first so it's gonna go so right now it's just driving forward and then since the red end it went backward and it sensed that block and it pulled it kicked it off and now it's knocking over the castles yay okay going forward that little castle i think it's gonna kick it off right oh didn't kick it off at least it moved it oh it's this blue castle okay yes are we gonna knock something down yes that's just a little okay i'm sensing that one yeah is it gonna push one this one too oh that was a lot yeah that's so good this big oh at least this one fell oh um i knew it was gonna slip up but now i detect this one but it hit by the edge again which i don't really like by just sitting by the edge um but i didn't kick it off she's still here let's just click red again that one nope this one nothing is going for this one yeah let's go into 3d mode 3d mode and go okay it's going straight for the red line yeah that's how it begins because the code is first drive forward until you detect red and drive reverse and turn and then it'll sense um okay i can't see anything oh it's going back here and then here byebye building i didn't get off it's my building nope and i almost got the small building yeah oh now i guess let's do it in 2d mode this is what's happening in a full screen 2d mode yeah i like 2d mode more because you can see the whole screen and this thing's falling out of the screen this one out oh that one was almost that's fun okay let's go for this one yay yay push it off oh yeah all the pieces off yes it's gonna clear this one now nope this one yes this one i think it's going to no it's this one yeah this one the closer you get you know which block it's sensing this one block yep it's this one it has to be bye bye yes and thanks for watching remember to smash a like and subscribe bye bye bye
