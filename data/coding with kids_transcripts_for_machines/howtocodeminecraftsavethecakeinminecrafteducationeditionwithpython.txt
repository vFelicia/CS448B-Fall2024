welcome to cutting with kids my name is a tutorial so we're going to save the cake cake so place a cake block at your current positions make a new variable called kick sitting variable to player's world position so two variables player world position and now make another variable to remember what the time is when you start to land away from the kick name this variable lander set the window variable to current game time using time so then make lander okay and then set one two times okay next use it forever loop to check how long you've wandered away from your cake inside the loop use an if condition to check to see if the game time is long enough to make your return to the cake so enough forever loop if then then go to math logic over here switch it game time is larger than zero then inside the if condition subtract the time in wander from the current game time make the condition true if the time difference is greater than 300 ticks so 300 then minus for math minus then the variable and get the variable right here and put in the other slot then put it back into the eighth loop then if the 300 tick time expired broadcast to the game that you're going back to that your kick save teleport your player back to the cake if the 300 ticks have exp also set the winner variable to the current game time so forever tote port to cake okay run your program and start walking away from it did you get pulled back to the kick after one okay so let's see first let's see the python so def on chat pass and player.lunch have run on chat so that's on forever so this is forever global wander so it's a global variable container if gameplay that time for a game time minus lander is more than 300 and the player will say back to gift then player dot teleport to the cake position where is off in case variable equals clear dot position reminder equals game played that time okay so let's see where is the key that's uh first before we cleanse it but it's not an eatable cake because the agent has been smashed into it you can't plant it what if we're safe oh my god um oh man i'm gonna eat the cake oops well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to subscribe and subscribe bye bye
