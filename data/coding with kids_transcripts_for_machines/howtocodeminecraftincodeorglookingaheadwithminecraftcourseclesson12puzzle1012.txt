welcome to recruiting with kids my name is andrew today we're going in coda or getting course c lesson 12 looking ahead with michael so steve says walking into molten lava is a bad idea place cobblestone to create a bridge then mine at least two of the iron blocks so first we're going to move forward and then place cobblestone ahead some beers sink into the bottom yeah because lava is dangerous so then we're gonna move forward two times to reach the first of the arm blocks over here this drawer block so we can destroy the two irons now let's run okay avoid the lava and then mine the two iron blocks but we didn't have them before after the short box so we need a phone now i want to make it okay get one iron and get two yay now we're gonna go on to number 11. so the instruction says lava is hiding beneath some of these blocks which you'll need to cover up before moving forward and if command will come in handy here add a move forward command in the correct place to mine these blocks so steve has given us these blocks repeat seven times this drawer blocks and flower head do place cobblestone ahead so we're gonna add the mufart here so we don't just like stay in one place just keep doing it seven times nothing happens yeah so we're gonna run so mine the first block the thought off to replace it and then we keep moving forward and mining be cold avoiding the lava and mining the iron no more that's what it looks like the last one is awesome okay finally to number 12. now steve says now things are getting my free redstone but don't fall in love use an if command to place cobblestone over any lava you cover spaces with red speckles are where you will find redstones so first we're going to do a repeat block repeat two times okay it will move forward the stroller block is lava head please okay so we'll repeat two times it'll move forward so go here then they want to check for blocks by destroying the block trying to destroy anything ahead of steep then if lava is ahead we'll place cobblestone to avoid the law then let's see the code okay so check for blocking in mind the first wrestling block can cover it destroy block perform the struggle and then move forward turn right and store block move forward turn right on the story block drink it now okay so mine the first one avoid the waterfall and go to these redstone okay there's no lava remind this redstone and replace it yay well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye
