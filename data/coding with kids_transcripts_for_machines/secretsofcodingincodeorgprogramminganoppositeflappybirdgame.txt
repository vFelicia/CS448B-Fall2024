welcome to coding with kids my name is kalia and my name is andrew we're in coda og and this is called opposite flappy game plus random because it's random and opposite wrapping c one hits the ground endgame one hit an obstacle score a point when pass obstacle end game when click flap um random map c because it's really um and crazy it's very slow because except when runs the obstacle random set um ground random set scenes that play are randoms that score when set scores zero can't be random speeds random so that's what i'm super slow which is bad that's why i don't really like super slow now this is faster good so when you go through the pipes with you um in the real flat begin you have to put this to the opposite one okay let's add more hmm one flap set player two random then one hit obstacle so seems too random i always choose random cause when it hit obstacle the next time i'll stay the same okay now when um hit an obstacle press uh point i don't think that's that will be good hmm let's see oh that's a good end game sound but not really so one pass obstacle hmm smash yes then when this set play flap sound uh okay let's try that so when i click every time it change characters so i keep clicking so you and one is because it's quite smashed now let's hit the ground after one point oh man i hated that did you hear it it was a little bit too um the endgame sound was a little bit too soft so okay let's play sad okay let's press reset run see and let's see hmm this is gravity i forgot gravity first so i'll just do this gravity it will be a little bit harder to set a normal no it's a random gap that says so slow so now i will skip every super slow ones this is not very slow the gravity it's like very hard sometimes let's set gravity to very high very hard i would keep clicking to go up or i'm gonna fall gravity too very low well uh i can see myself that will be very bad but it's tricky but it's random much better just now i can't stand the two slow games so i skip it i just love that sounds like somebody slapping it in other person's face thanks for watching remember to smash the like button and subscribe
