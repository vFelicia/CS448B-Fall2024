welcome to getting with kids my name is andrew today we're going to teach you python so today we're going to learn about defining a function so my question is when do we use a function so we use functions when we want to make our program shorter neater and to change things faster so first we're going to do def say hello so def is basically defined and we're defining our first function called say hello and after this we can program what the function does so our function is going to print hello world then to try out we're going to do say hello so let's save it and run it so printed hello world when we try to use the function and that's exactly what we typed while defining a function so now let's see what if what it will do if we did say hello before we explore defining the function so now oops let's do it save it and run it so it did error say hello is not defined so there will be a book if you try to use a function before it was defined yes so it's ever because you need to define it first then you can use it yeah next we're going to do def say hello name so it's just like the last time but now we have name which is an input parameter so an input parameter is just like a variable and using input parameters that is how we can change things faster with function so we're gonna print a string hello name so that's what the say hello does but how do we know what name is so we can state what the input parameter is when we run it so we're gonna say hello bob so when you write bob that will be stating the input parameter name so it will print hello bob so let's save and run it so it did hello bob so you can change the input parameter every time you run it so now let's see what will happen if we use input parameter while defining a function but don't state it while we are using the function so save it and run it so that error say hello missing one required positional argument name so what if you use an employer while defining a function you need to state it somewhere right so there is an error yeah so if you don't state you need to state it while you run it next we'll do that say hello but we're gonna state the name info parameter equals world while we define it so you don't need a stated there so we're gonna print that string hello name which will print hello world so now we can just run it without stating the input parameter or changing it but you can still change it because we already stated it here so if we do this i will print hello world next i'm going to do say hello bob so we can also still change the importer name or swirls right here but when you run it you can also change the input parameter so here we're changing the input parameter name which is world right now into bob so for hello box so let's save it and run so did hello world here because already stated so it will be hello world and then the second time it will change into bob which is hello bob so next we're gonna do death say hello and we have the name equals world input parameter again and we have a second input parameter called greeting which is none right now which is basically nothing so next we're going to put if inside while defining a function so if gradient equals none which is true i'm going to print f string hello world because name right now is world if reading was something else it will print greeting the name but right now there is no greeting so it will do if yeah it will print hello world so first we're just gonna run it usually so just say hello which will be hello world then we'll say hello bob so we're going to change name which is world into bob so open hello bob then i'm going to say after hello world yeah then say hello again greeting equals howdy so it changed greeting from num to howdy yeah so it'll go to the else now and it will print greeting and name so name is world now so it's gonna do howdy world then our fourth time and last time we're gonna print hello bob and howdy so name is bob and greeting is howdy so go to the else again because reading is not none so it'll print howdy bob so let's save it and run it so it did it did hello bob and there's hello world up there and howdy world and howdy because in the last program we get none yeah we which we just did greeting is none so what type is not so we're going to use the type function which will tell us what type is not so let's save it let's see and run it in class because it's none so i have to be nun yeah because none is basically nothing so it's none type that means no type oh that means like it's nothing but it's still stated as an input parameter yeah yeah well that was fun and that's it for today thank you for watching remember to smash that like and subscribe bye bye
