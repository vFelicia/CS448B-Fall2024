welcome to queen with kids my name is and my name is scratch so i'm we're in my account and yeah today i'm gonna show you how i made this pong game so it's a called poke ball pong because the ball is turned into a poke ball from pokemon so the pokeball i drew it in the costumes so i used this and drew it with my mouse if you're on the ipad or iphone you can use your hand and then here code is when the green flag is clicked so when the project is running it will forever if touching the paddle right here then you'll change score by one right here and turn 180 degrees and move 15 steps so the turn will make it bounce off the paddle and then it will go forward so that you need a more fast off yeah then place on boeing so like you add some more saturn and then wait 0.5 seconds okay again when another green flag clicked pointing the same green flag 68 then forever move 15 steps if on age plants because sometimes if you don't have if on edge bounce the sprite that means the character will go out the screen yeah and you'll maybe never see again unless you like stop the code and press the green flag again yeah okay so then when green flat clicked reset time so there's a timer right here that's still running so it'll like count the times how many seconds you have playing this game then in the paddle code is when green flags like forever replace sound stays energetic until then so it'll forever play this song where i got from songs and then you can go here and add a sound yeah okay so the line wait uh here there's one green flag click says score to z because if you don't do this this code then um the points will still be the same point yeah the last time if you don't have this code the last time the player played pretend he got 100 points the next time he comes he he is this when he runs it the score will be a hundred ready so you know reset then when green flag clicked forever set x to mass x says set x to mass x code will make the paddle move in the direction of my key more mouse than the line when green flag clicked forever if touching pokeball that means the the pokeball the ball and stop all code because this line if the pokeball touches it you will lose because if you don't have this line or this code the ball can just bounce off the bottom and like you will never lose okay yeah play let's suppose okay okay let's play so now he is pointing see when i touch the red line it stops everything because you lose in the actual game and i touch this the wall yeah the pokemon touched the paddle one time so i got one point so here we have username and the timer that was fun and that's it for today remember to smash the like button and subscribe bye bye bye
