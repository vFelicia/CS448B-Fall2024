00:00 - you've probably heard people talking
00:01 - about checked and unchecked exceptions
00:03 - in java but what does that mean what
00:05 - exactly is the difference between a
00:07 - checked and an unchecked exception and
00:09 - what do you need to know about how to
00:10 - handle each of those types of exceptions
00:12 - in your java programs we'll cover all of
00:14 - that with some concrete coding examples
00:16 - in this video my name is john i'm a lead
00:18 - java software engineer and i love
00:20 - sharing what i've learned with you in a
00:21 - clear and understandable way i also have
00:23 - a full java course available and a link
00:25 - down in the description if you're
00:26 - interested let's get to it so first what
00:28 - exactly is the difference between a
00:30 - checked and an unchecked exception well
00:32 - a checked exception is one that is
00:34 - checked for at compile time but what
00:37 - exactly does that mean well let's talk
00:39 - about it with an example let's say we
00:40 - have a method in our program where we
00:43 - want to just read from a file so one way
00:45 - we could do that is private static void
00:48 - read file and it takes in a string
00:52 - called file name and one way to read
00:54 - from a file is using a file reader call
00:58 - it reader equals new file reader and
01:01 - that takes in the file name that we want
01:03 - to open and we can call this read file
01:05 - method from our main method here just by
01:07 - doing a read file and passing in the
01:10 - name of the file that we want let's just
01:11 - say it's called my file
01:14 - dot txt but as you can see here eclipse
01:16 - is giving us an error it says unhandled
01:19 - exception type file not found exception
01:22 - so what's happening here is when we try
01:24 - to create this file reader it could
01:27 - throw an exception if the name of the
01:28 - file that we pass in doesn't actually
01:31 - exist it could throw a file not found
01:34 - exception and java is giving us an error
01:36 - here and telling us that we need to deal
01:39 - with the possibility of this file not
01:41 - found exception happening when this
01:43 - piece of code is called and that is
01:45 - because a file not found exception is a
01:48 - checked exception checked exceptions are
01:50 - exceptions that java makes you deal with
01:53 - one way or another at compile time that
01:55 - means that before your program will even
01:57 - compile successfully java checks to
02:00 - ensure that you're dealing with the
02:02 - possibility of that exception happening
02:04 - and it won't compile until you do so
02:06 - right now if we try to run this program
02:09 - we can't because we still have a
02:11 - compilation error this error is blocking
02:13 - us from even compiling our code if the
02:15 - file not found exception was an
02:16 - unchecked exception we wouldn't be
02:18 - seeing this error here we'll talk more
02:20 - about unchecked exceptions a bit later
02:22 - in the video so how do we deal with this
02:23 - error that we get for checked exceptions
02:26 - well we can do it in one of two ways the
02:28 - first way is that you can surround this
02:30 - line of code that throws the exception
02:32 - with a try catch block so to do that you
02:35 - would just write a try and then inside
02:37 - your try block you have the line of code
02:39 - that could throw the exception in this
02:40 - case the file not found exception from
02:43 - this piece of code here then you have it
02:45 - catch a file not found exception
02:49 - called fnfe for file not found exception
02:52 - inside this catch block you just want to
02:54 - put whatever code you'd like to run if
02:56 - this exception happens to get thrown so
02:58 - in the case of a file not found maybe
03:00 - you just want to print something out to
03:01 - the user that says hey that file doesn't
03:05 - exist if we run our program instead of
03:07 - seeing an exception and a stack trace we
03:10 - see hey that file does not exist the
03:12 - exception was caught here in the catch
03:13 - block and all it did was print out that
03:15 - message instead of blowing up the entire
03:17 - program the other way you can deal with
03:19 - that error is instead of having a try
03:21 - catch you can just tell java yep i
03:24 - totally understand that this piece of
03:25 - code that i'm calling could throw an
03:28 - exception but i'm not going to deal with
03:30 - it so i'm just going to declare to you
03:32 - java that i could throw it and whatever
03:34 - piece of code that calls this method
03:36 - they're just going to have to deal with
03:37 - that exception themselves and to do that
03:39 - you just put a throws declaration right
03:42 - here in the method signature right
03:43 - before the curly braces so we'll say
03:46 - throws file not found exception all
03:49 - right so great now we no longer have
03:51 - that error here in our code that we had
03:53 - before but now we actually have an error
03:55 - here where we're calling our read file
03:58 - method and it's the exact same error
04:00 - unhandled exception type file not found
04:02 - exception what happened is that now if
04:05 - that file not found exception is thrown
04:07 - there's nothing in this method to catch
04:10 - that exception so that exception will
04:12 - just get thrown from this method out to
04:14 - whatever piece of code called that
04:16 - method since this line calls that method
04:19 - now this line could throw a file not
04:21 - found exception and since it's a checked
04:24 - exception still that means we have to
04:26 - deal with it here so if i try to run the
04:28 - program now i can't because i still have
04:31 - a compilation error here and we can deal
04:33 - with the possibility of that exception
04:35 - being thrown here the same way that we
04:37 - could down here we could surround the
04:39 - statement with a try catch or if we
04:42 - don't want to do that we can just
04:44 - declare that we throw this exception in
04:47 - the method signature by adding throws
04:49 - file not found exception now you'll
04:51 - notice that putting that throws
04:53 - declaration here doesn't cause another
04:56 - error like it did when we put the throws
04:58 - declaration down here and that's only
05:00 - because this method is the main method
05:03 - at the very top of our program once that
05:05 - exception gets thrown up past your main
05:07 - method your program just dies right
05:09 - there immediately and all you'll see is
05:11 - a stack trace output for that exception
05:14 - all we did was tell java hey i'm going
05:16 - to throw that exception we didn't have
05:17 - anything that actually dealt with it so
05:19 - our program still dies so eventually
05:21 - somewhere in your method hierarchy you
05:23 - do want to have a try catch that catches
05:26 - that exception and deals with it
05:27 - properly and you can check out this
05:29 - video here for a much more in-depth
05:31 - tutorial about how to use try catch now
05:34 - on to unchecked exceptions as we know if
05:36 - you have some code that could throw a
05:38 - checked exception you have to deal with
05:40 - it either by using a try catch block or
05:42 - declaring that you throw it in your
05:44 - method signature that is not the case
05:46 - for unchecked exceptions so what does it
05:48 - look like with unchecked exceptions
05:50 - let's say we just had a method like this
05:51 - one here that just takes in a string
05:53 - we'll call it my string and all it does
05:55 - is just print out the length of that
05:57 - string so it prints out my string dot
06:00 - length so up here we could declare a
06:02 - string let's call it a name and set it
06:05 - equal to john and then we can call that
06:07 - print length method and pass in name and
06:11 - of course it prints out four because the
06:13 - length of john is four characters but
06:15 - what would happen if instead of
06:16 - initializing this name string to john we
06:20 - set it equal to null so of course what
06:22 - happens is we end up passing in null as
06:25 - the parameter to this print length
06:27 - method then when it tries to take that
06:28 - parameter and call the length method on
06:31 - it it's going to get a null pointer
06:32 - exception because this my string will be
06:34 - null and if we run it of course we do
06:36 - see that it gets a null pointer
06:38 - exception so obviously we have a case
06:40 - here where this method could throw a
06:43 - null pointer exception right but java
06:45 - doesn't give us any compilation errors
06:47 - here it compiles fine and then only
06:49 - explodes when we actually run it and
06:51 - that is all because null pointer
06:53 - exception is an unchecked exception java
06:56 - doesn't make us catch it with a try
06:58 - catch block and it doesn't even make us
07:00 - declare it here in the method signature
07:02 - that we might throw a null pointer
07:03 - exception that's the main difference
07:05 - between checked and unchecked exceptions
07:08 - that doesn't mean you can't do those
07:09 - things though if you want to you can
07:11 - absolutely put a throws null pointer
07:14 - exception here it just doesn't really
07:16 - matter whether you do or not and you
07:17 - also absolutely can add a try catch
07:20 - around this piece of code and you
07:22 - probably should because if you don't
07:24 - that exception is going to get thrown
07:26 - and your program is going to die just
07:27 - like it did for us here so we put that
07:29 - in our try block and we can catch
07:31 - null pointer exception npe
07:34 - and just print out string cannot be null
07:38 - and now if we run our program again we
07:40 - don't get any exception we just get a
07:42 - message to the user that says the string
07:43 - cannot be null here's another big
07:45 - question though how does java determine
07:47 - which exceptions it treats as checked
07:49 - exceptions and which it treats as
07:52 - unchecked exceptions here's an image
07:54 - from how to do in java.com that shows
07:56 - java's exception hierarchy java's
07:59 - exception class is a subclass of
08:01 - throwable error is the other subclass of
08:03 - throwable errors are separate from
08:05 - exceptions they're usually for things
08:07 - that can't be recovered from like out of
08:09 - memory error stack overflow error things
08:12 - like that so it's a bit outside the
08:13 - scope of this video anyway all
08:16 - exceptions in java are subclasses of the
08:19 - exception class one subclass of
08:21 - exception is runtime exception and there
08:24 - are many subclasses of runtime exception
08:26 - like null pointer exception that we saw
08:28 - in this video number format exception
08:30 - and many many others in java the runtime
08:34 - exception and all subclasses of runtime
08:37 - exception are unchecked exceptions and
08:40 - any exception that isn't a runtime
08:43 - exception or a subclass of runtime
08:45 - exception is a checked exception and
08:47 - that includes the exception class itself
08:50 - and any other subclasses of exception
08:53 - besides runtimeexception that includes
08:55 - the file not found exception that we saw
08:57 - in this program and tons of others so
09:00 - runtime exceptions and all of its
09:02 - subclasses are unchecked exceptions and
09:05 - every other type of exception is a
09:06 - checked exception this will illustrate
09:09 - the difference pretty clearly if inside
09:11 - this method we just flat out throw
09:14 - a new exception we get that compiledtime
09:18 - error unhandled exception type exception
09:20 - and we have to deal with it for our
09:22 - program to compile but if instead of
09:24 - throwing an exception we throw a runtime
09:28 - exception now we don't have any
09:30 - compilation errors at all and that's
09:32 - because exception is a checked exception
09:35 - and runtime exception is an unchecked
09:38 - exception now again you should deal with
09:40 - unchecked exceptions in your code
09:42 - somewhere along the line with a try
09:44 - catch just like you should for checked
09:46 - exceptions the difference is just that
09:48 - java doesn't check to make sure that
09:50 - you're dealing with them at compile time
09:52 - for unchecked exceptions but it does do
09:55 - that check for checked exceptions if you

Cleaned transcript:

you've probably heard people talking about checked and unchecked exceptions in java but what does that mean what exactly is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception and what do you need to know about how to handle each of those types of exceptions in your java programs we'll cover all of that with some concrete coding examples in this video my name is john i'm a lead java software engineer and i love sharing what i've learned with you in a clear and understandable way i also have a full java course available and a link down in the description if you're interested let's get to it so first what exactly is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception well a checked exception is one that is checked for at compile time but what exactly does that mean well
