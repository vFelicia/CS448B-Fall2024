00:00 - you know that keyboard shortcuts can
00:01 - drastically improve your productivity
00:03 - while coding plus they help you not look
00:05 - like a total Noob when somebody else is
00:07 - watching you code but IntelliJ supports
00:09 - hundreds of keyboard shortcuts in this
00:11 - video I'll show you the absolute best
00:13 - way I know of to quickly and
00:15 - effortlessly memorize the keyboard
00:17 - shortcuts for everything you do in
00:19 - IntelliJ even the ones you never even
00:21 - knew existed I also have a full Java
00:23 - course available in a link down in the
00:25 - description there you'll find over eight
00:27 - hours of exclusive video lessons
00:28 - covering dozens of java topics so if you
00:31 - haven't already go and check it out when
00:33 - you think about memorizing keyboard
00:34 - shortcuts you probably think you have to
00:36 - look up some Shortcut cheat sheet online
00:38 - print it out and hang it above your
00:40 - monitor so you always have it handy or
00:42 - maybe have a friend quiz you on them and
00:44 - give you an electric shock every time
00:45 - you get one wrong that can certainly
00:47 - work and it's how we had to do it back
00:48 - in the olden days these days there's a
00:50 - much better way and it's a free IntelliJ
00:52 - plugin called key promoter X so how
00:55 - exactly does it work what does it do for
00:57 - you it's your personal automated short
01:00 - cut coach let me show you what I mean so
01:02 - let's say you wanted to rename this
01:04 - names variable but you didn't know what
01:06 - the shortcut was for it or maybe you
01:07 - didn't even know that there was a
01:09 - shortcut for that so you try and figure
01:10 - out how to do that without a shortcut
01:12 - and you end up you know right clicking
01:14 - and then going down to refactor and then
01:16 - up here to rename but when you do that
01:19 - suddenly
01:20 - out pops the magic of keep promoter X so
01:23 - what the plugin did is it presented us
01:25 - with this little notification and what
01:27 - it's saying is hey dude I noticed that
01:30 - you just renamed a variable by using the
01:32 - mouse and right clicking and navigating
01:34 - through a bunch of menus like a caveman
01:37 - you should know there's a shortcut for
01:39 - that and it's shift F6 now of course
01:41 - you're not going to memorize everything
01:42 - after just one prompt so it will
01:44 - continue to prompt you every time you
01:46 - perform some action manually that has a
01:49 - shortcut available that you can use so
01:51 - if I try and do this again you know I
01:52 - right click go to refactor and rename
01:55 - and pops up the same thing you know it
01:57 - says there's a shortcut for that it's
01:58 - shift F6 and you've now missed it two
02:01 - times it's kind of like a helpful and
02:03 - somewhat judgmental senior programmer
02:06 - sitting right next to you all the time
02:08 - and key promoter X does this with just
02:11 - about everything so let's say you run
02:12 - your program by clicking this play
02:14 - button here it says hey there's a
02:16 - shortcut for that it's shift F10 or Ctrl
02:19 - shift F10 if you're on an older IntelliJ
02:21 - version anything you do at all that has
02:24 - a shortcut available it will tell you
02:26 - about even something as simple as
02:28 - clicking on the project menu now that
02:31 - particular shortcut to me is a bit silly
02:33 - I love shortcuts as much as the next guy
02:36 - but for this just opening up the project
02:38 - menu I'm just going to click the project
02:40 - button but luckily what you can do if
02:43 - there's a particular shortcut that it
02:44 - tells you about that you just don't care
02:46 - about so let's say I click project again
02:47 - it's going to pop up the same thing I
02:49 - can just say suppress alerts for this
02:51 - shortcut and it will never bother me
02:53 - about that shortcut ever again so in
02:55 - that case it's a little better than a
02:57 - seed your programmer sitting next to you
02:59 - watching your every move because they
03:01 - would never stop bugging you about it
03:02 - anyway after you've been coding for a
03:04 - while you can open up the plugin menu by
03:07 - clicking here and it will list all the
03:09 - shortcuts that you missed ordered by the
03:11 - ones that you've missed the most often
03:13 - at the top so you can quickly see which
03:15 - ones will gain you the most productivity
03:18 - so you can focus your energy on learning
03:21 - those first it'll also show you all the
03:23 - shortcut tips that you suppressed in
03:25 - case you change your mind later so if
03:27 - you want to take any suggestions off of
03:28 - your suppressed list just double click
03:30 - them and if you want to suppress any of
03:32 - the suggestions in the list here just
03:34 - double click them as well you can hit
03:35 - reset statistics here if you want to
03:38 - clear all of these for some reason you
03:40 - can also snooze the shortcut
03:41 - notifications by just checking this box
03:43 - so you know maybe you have to present
03:44 - your code to someone else and you don't
03:46 - want the pop-ups embarrassing you about
03:48 - your lack of shortcut knowledge in front
03:50 - of your colleagues or maybe you just
03:51 - need a little break from the judgey
03:53 - shortcut coach either way just remember
03:55 - to uncheck this box to re-enable the
03:57 - notifications once you're ready to get
03:59 - back into it now if you don't know how
04:00 - to install plugins it's super easy you
04:02 - just go up to file and settings or yes
04:05 - you can press Ctrl alt s and then click
04:08 - on plugins be sure to have the
04:10 - marketplace tab selected so you can
04:12 - search for any plugins you don't have
04:13 - installed and then go ahead and search
04:15 - for key promoter X and if you don't have
04:18 - it installed yet there will be a green
04:19 - install all button here then once it's
04:22 - installed click restart to reopen
04:24 - IntelliJ with your brand new plugin up
04:27 - and operational it's a dead simple
04:29 - plugin that's free easy to install easy
04:32 - to use and makes it basically effortless
04:34 - to learn every single shortcut that you
04:36 - care about in IntelliJ as always if you
04:39 - enjoyed this video or you learned
04:40 - something please let me know by leaving
04:42 - a like and also let me know in the
04:43 - comments if there's some other plugin
04:45 - that you really like for IntelliJ
04:46 - whether it's really popular or you know
04:48 - one of the Lesser known plugins out
04:50 - there thank you so much for watching as
04:52 - always and I'll see you next time
