00:00 - in this video we're going to talk all
00:01 - about enums in java we'll go over what
00:03 - they are and when you should use them
00:04 - and walk through some concrete examples
00:06 - of how you can implement them in your
00:08 - java programs my name is john i'm
00:09 - thrilled to have you here with me let's
00:11 - get right to it so what exactly is an
00:13 - enum enum is just short for enumeration
00:16 - an enum is used when you have something
00:18 - that has a predefined set of values that
00:21 - don't change a common example people use
00:23 - is like days of the week they're always
00:25 - going to be the exact same seven days
00:27 - and they're never going to change so you
00:29 - might want to define in your code what
00:30 - those seven days of the week are in a
00:33 - way that people just can't add more days
00:35 - of the week because that just wouldn't
00:36 - make sense so using that example let's
00:38 - go ahead and create that enum for days
00:40 - of the week the easiest way to do that
00:41 - in eclipse is to just go ahead and right
00:43 - click wherever you want that enum to be
00:45 - and go to new and this is how you
00:47 - usually would create a class but instead
00:49 - we're going to pick enum just like a
00:51 - class you can name it whatever you want
00:53 - but we're going to name it days of the
00:55 - week and hit finish and there you go you
00:57 - can see it looks an awful lot like a
00:59 - class but instead of public class days
01:01 - of the week it says public enum days of
01:03 - the week so now we have the shell of our
01:05 - enum but now how do we go about listing
01:07 - the set of valid days of the week well
01:09 - we can just do it right here in a comma
01:12 - separated list so we can just say sunday
01:14 - monday tuesday etc we do have to end our
01:18 - comma separated list with a semicolon a
01:20 - couple things to note here though
01:22 - although it's totally valid to have
01:24 - these days of the week enum entries as
01:26 - all lowercase is typically the
01:28 - convention to have these in all
01:29 - uppercase in eclipse there's actually a
01:31 - cool shortcut for making text uppercase
01:33 - and it's just ctrl shift x by the way
01:36 - check out this video here if you want
01:37 - even more awesome eclipse shortcuts so
01:39 - how do you go about actually using these
01:41 - values back in our main method we can
01:43 - create an object of type days of the
01:45 - week just like we could for any other
01:47 - type of object so days of the week day
01:50 - equals you might be thinking we'll say
01:52 - okay new days of the week but if we try
01:54 - and do that with an enum java is going
01:56 - to give us an error cannot instantiate
01:58 - the type days of the week that's one
02:00 - thing that's different about enums than
02:02 - any other typical java class because an
02:04 - enum is intended to be a predefined set
02:07 - of values you can't use the new keyword
02:09 - to just create new values so what you'll
02:12 - be doing is just using the existing
02:14 - values so you'll just say days of the
02:16 - week dot and then you have your choice
02:18 - of any of those days of the week to use
02:20 - let's say we wanted to pick thursday so
02:22 - now this day variable has the value of
02:24 - thursday and you can use this variable
02:26 - in your code similar to how you would
02:28 - use any other type of variable for
02:29 - example you could say if the day equals
02:32 - days of the week dot thursday print out
02:35 - yay it's almost friday and if we run our
02:38 - code of course since the day we created
02:40 - was thursday it prints out yay it's
02:41 - almost friday all enum classes in java
02:44 - actually extend from the
02:46 - java.lang.enum class you don't have to
02:49 - put extends enum or anything here java
02:51 - just does that automatically but because
02:53 - it extends the enum class it gives you
02:54 - some built-in functionality that's
02:56 - pretty cool for example if you wanted to
02:58 - get all of the possible values of that
03:00 - enum you can just say days of the week
03:03 - dot values this actually returns an
03:05 - array of all the possible days of the
03:07 - week so if we wanted to do something
03:08 - like print them all out we can just do a
03:10 - simple for each loop so for each days of
03:13 - the week call it my day so this will
03:15 - loop through every possible value in our
03:17 - days of the week enum so all we have to
03:19 - do is print out myday inside that loop
03:22 - and we can see it prints out all the
03:23 - possible values of our enum but there's
03:25 - even more really cool things you can do
03:27 - with your enums for this example i've
03:28 - created an enum of cereals we've got
03:30 - cap'n crunch froot loops reese's puffs
03:32 - and cocoa puffs real quickly though one
03:34 - thing i like to do with my enums is put
03:36 - each enum entry on a different line like
03:38 - this i just think it makes your enums a
03:40 - little bit more readable plus now
03:41 - there's more room for my beautiful face
03:42 - here in the corner just like your
03:44 - regular java classes your enums can have
03:47 - fields so what we can do is add a field
03:49 - here like an int let's call it level of
03:52 - deliciousness and we can also create a
03:55 - serials constructor that takes in a
03:57 - value for that field of deliciousness in
04:00 - this constructor we would just set this
04:02 - dot level of deliciousness to be equal
04:04 - to the level of deliciousness passed in
04:07 - now you can see we have an error for
04:08 - each of these that's because now in
04:10 - order to create each cereal enum we have
04:12 - to give it the level of deliciousness we
04:14 - can pass that in here as a parameter at
04:17 - each one of these declarations so let's
04:19 - go between 0 and 100. captain crunch
04:21 - would be like a 50. fruit loops i like a
04:23 - little more let's say that's like a 60.
04:25 - reese's puffs though probably my
04:26 - favorite let's do a straight up 100 and
04:28 - coco puffs about a 75 and now we can
04:31 - save that and back in our main code we
04:33 - can get any of those cereals level of
04:35 - deliciousness by just calling cereals
04:37 - dot whichever one we're interested in
04:38 - let's say fruit loops and say froot
04:40 - loops dot level of deliciousness and we
04:42 - can just print that out if we want
04:44 - and we get 60 which was the level of
04:47 - deliciousness of fruit loops what you'll
04:48 - probably want to do with these fields is
04:50 - make them final so that they can't be
04:52 - changed for each entry so why would you
04:54 - want to do that well if you don't have
04:56 - final what somebody can do they can
04:58 - change that value and that's probably
04:59 - not something you want to allow so they
05:01 - can say cereals dot fruit loops dot
05:03 - level of deliciousness equals
05:06 - 107 and we can see that that change
05:08 - actually does take effect so somebody
05:10 - can go in and just change froot loops to
05:12 - be a level of deliciousness of 107. now
05:14 - froot loops are good don't get me wrong
05:16 - but they're not 107 good so this isn't
05:18 - something we want to allow so to make it
05:20 - so that value can't be changed once it's
05:21 - set we just make this final and then
05:24 - back in our main code we can see that we
05:26 - get an error when we try to change that
05:28 - value so making this field final stops
05:30 - the fruit loop fanboys from being able
05:32 - to mess things up and you're not limited
05:33 - to just one field here you can have more
05:35 - if you like so you might also want
05:36 - something like final double price all
05:39 - you have to do is just add that as
05:40 - another parameter to your constructor
05:42 - and pass in a value for that new field
05:44 - in each declaration here if you liked
05:46 - this video or learned something please
05:47 - let me know by hitting the like button
05:48 - be sure to check out these other videos
05:49 - here to keep on learning i also have a
05:51 - full java course available in a link
05:52 - down in the description if you're
05:53 - interested oh man i spelled captain
05:55 - crunch wrong i am ashamed
