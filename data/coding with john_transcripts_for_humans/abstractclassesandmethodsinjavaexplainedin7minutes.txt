00:00 - abstract classes can be a really
00:01 - confusing concept when you're learning
00:02 - java when i was learning they were
00:04 - pretty confusing for me but in this
00:05 - video we're going to go over exactly
00:06 - what an abstract class is how you make
00:09 - one and how you can use one with an
00:10 - example and why you would want to make
00:12 - one in the first place we'll also talk
00:13 - about the differences between abstract
00:15 - classes and interfaces my name is john
00:16 - i'm a lead java software engineer and i
00:18 - love sharing what i've learned in a
00:19 - clear understandable way so if you
00:21 - enjoyed this video please consider
00:22 - subscribing so you don't miss each new
00:23 - java tutorial i also have a full java
00:25 - course available in a link down in the
00:26 - description if you're interested so
00:28 - first things first what is an abstract
00:30 - class all an abstract class is is a
00:32 - class that you can't instantiate you
00:35 - can't create objects from abstract
00:37 - classes so what does that mean well you
00:38 - know if you have like a normal class
00:40 - like this cat class here if you want you
00:42 - can create objects of that class so you
00:44 - could say cat my cat equals new cat but
00:47 - with abstract classes you can't do this
00:49 - so if i go back into my cat class and
00:51 - make it a public abstract class if i go
00:54 - back into my main method i can see that
00:56 - now i get an error here cannot
00:58 - instantiate the type cat and by the way
01:00 - this abstract keyword here in the class
01:02 - definition is the only thing you need to
01:04 - make a class into an abstract class
01:06 - probably the first question that comes
01:07 - to mind is why the heck would i want to
01:09 - do that why would i want to make a class
01:10 - that i can't create objects from so
01:12 - here's a situation where it makes sense
01:13 - to use an abstract class let's change
01:15 - this class back into a regular class
01:17 - instead of just being a standalone class
01:19 - let's say it extended a class called
01:21 - animal and let's say the animal class
01:23 - had a couple of fields like int age
01:25 - string name it totally makes sense that
01:27 - you could have an animal class that
01:28 - would have subclasses of actual animals
01:31 - like cat dog horse whatever and it makes
01:33 - sense that you could create objects of
01:35 - those subclasses like you could create a
01:37 - cat object but what doesn't make a whole
01:39 - lot of sense is creating an animal
01:41 - object you know it's just kind of weird
01:43 - what kind of animal is it so you might
01:44 - want a parent class like animal so that
01:46 - your subclasses can share some fields
01:48 - like age name and maybe some methods
01:50 - that you write but you might not want to
01:52 - be able to create objects of this animal
01:54 - class all you have to do is make this
01:56 - class abstract so an abstract class is a
01:58 - class you can't instantiate but you can
02:00 - absolutely make subclasses of an
02:02 - abstract class that can be instantiated
02:04 - now what about abstract methods in any
02:07 - of your abstract classes you can choose
02:09 - to have abstract methods let's say we
02:11 - had a method like public void make noise
02:14 - of course it makes sense for an animal
02:15 - to be able to make noise but each
02:17 - individual animal is going to make noise
02:19 - in its own way a cat's going to meow a
02:20 - dog is gonna bark so because of that it
02:22 - might not make a whole lot of sense to
02:24 - actually implement this method make
02:26 - noise here in your abstract animal class
02:28 - what you can do is make this method an
02:30 - abstract method when you make a method
02:32 - abstract you don't specify a body for
02:35 - the method all you do is declare it and
02:36 - then end it with a semicolon but then in
02:38 - all the child classes of your abstract
02:40 - class you have to actually create an
02:42 - implementation of this make noise method
02:44 - so if we go back over to our cat class
02:45 - now we can see that it's giving us an
02:47 - error that the type cat must implement
02:50 - the inherited abstract method make noise
02:52 - so of course we can write it all out but
02:54 - we can also just use eclipse's fix tool
02:56 - here to add the unimplemented method but
02:58 - now this cat class can implement this
03:00 - make noise method however we want print
03:02 - out meow so because this animal class
03:04 - declares an abstract method make noise
03:07 - any child class of this animal class has
03:09 - to provide its own make noise
03:11 - implementation so now back in our main
03:12 - method we could take my cat and call
03:15 - meow and if we run our program we can
03:16 - see that it says meow now of course we
03:19 - could in our animal class you know get
03:20 - rid of this abstract method and in our
03:23 - cat class just declare a make noise
03:25 - method that says meow and if we go back
03:27 - and run our program again it still says
03:28 - meow so why do we need this abstract
03:31 - method what do we want that for what the
03:32 - abstract class does as a whole is kind
03:34 - of enforce and organize exactly what
03:38 - every subclass of animal has to have so
03:40 - this animal class is saying hey if you
03:42 - want to create a new type of animal it's
03:44 - going to have an age it's going to have
03:45 - a name and it has to be able to make
03:46 - noise every type of animal might make
03:48 - noise in completely different ways but
03:49 - this makes sure that every single animal
03:51 - type is able to make noise as a side
03:54 - note though in your abstract class all
03:55 - of the methods don't necessarily have to
03:57 - be abstract you can create actual
03:59 - concrete implemented methods in your
04:01 - abstract classes so you could have like
04:03 - public void print name just prints my
04:06 - name is name so now every subclass of
04:08 - animal will also have this print name
04:10 - method available to it but since it's
04:11 - not abstract they don't need to
04:12 - implement it themselves they can just
04:14 - use the implementation that's here the
04:15 - question a lot of people have and what's
04:17 - actually also a big interview question
04:19 - is what's the difference between an
04:20 - abstract class and an interface let's
04:22 - say we had an interface called like
04:25 - animal stuff here in an interface we
04:28 - could say how about public void poop
04:31 - just like every animal might make noise
04:32 - in different ways every animal is
04:34 - probably also going to poop in different
04:35 - ways in interfaces you don't need an
04:37 - abstract keyword in your methods every
04:39 - method in an interface is assumed to be
04:41 - abstract so you uh you don't need this
04:42 - keyword as you probably know if you want
04:44 - to implement an interface so all you
04:46 - have to do is instead of extending
04:48 - another class you just say
04:50 - implements the interface which is animal
04:53 - stuff and now that we implement this
04:54 - animal stuff interface we have to
04:56 - implement this poop method you see right
04:58 - now we get an error that says type cat
05:00 - must implement the inherited abstract
05:02 - method poop we can just click the
05:04 - suggestion here to add the unimplemented
05:05 - method print out
05:07 - like
05:09 - sounds pretty poopy so just like this
05:11 - abstract make noise method made any
05:13 - subclass implement this make noise
05:14 - method this interface also makes any
05:17 - classes that implement the interface
05:19 - implement this method they seem like
05:20 - they're doing the same thing right
05:21 - what's the difference the first key
05:23 - difference is that you can implement as
05:25 - many interfaces as you want in java
05:27 - there's no limit but you can only extend
05:29 - one class and you can totally do both if
05:31 - you want to you can extend the animal
05:32 - class and implement the animal stuff
05:35 - interface another difference is that in
05:36 - interfaces if you declare any fields
05:39 - like if you had end age and string name
05:42 - every field that's declared inside an
05:43 - interface is going to be static and
05:46 - final that's why i'm getting an error
05:47 - here because it's final i have to
05:49 - instantiate it with some kind of a value
05:51 - larry because every field in an
05:53 - interface is automatically static that
05:54 - means the same values apply to every
05:57 - object in that class if i say age equals
06:00 - one that would have to apply to every
06:01 - class that implements this interface so
06:03 - it really doesn't make a whole lot of
06:04 - sense to have fields like this inside
06:07 - interfaces that's why we have abstract
06:10 - classes like this so you can say hey
06:11 - every animal has to have an age and a
06:14 - name but i'm not going to tell you what
06:15 - it is right now because that doesn't
06:16 - make sense each individual cat object
06:19 - dog object and horse object can all have
06:21 - their own age and name values so you can
06:23 - do that with an abstract class but not
06:26 - with an interface so you might want to
06:27 - create an abstract class if you have a
06:29 - lot of closely related classes that you
06:31 - want to have the same functionality and
06:33 - the same types of fields available but
06:35 - you might want to make an interface
06:36 - instead if you have a lot of unrelated
06:39 - classes that you all want to be able to
06:41 - do a certain thing that makes it so you
06:43 - can guarantee that other types of
06:44 - classes will be able to poop even if
06:46 - they aren't animals that might be the
06:48 - weirdest sentence ever said in a java
06:50 - tutorial if you have any questions or
06:52 - clarifications let me know in the
06:53 - comments or if i got something wrong
06:55 - feel free to shout and rant at me
06:56 - angrily thanks so much for watching and
06:58 - i'll see you next time
