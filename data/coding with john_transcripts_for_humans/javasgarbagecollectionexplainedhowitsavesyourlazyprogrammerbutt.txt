00:01 - have you ever found yourself frustrated
00:03 - by just how much memory management you
00:05 - have to deal with in your Java programs
00:07 - nope you haven't that's because Java
00:09 - takes care of it for you automatically
00:11 - like magic without you even having to
00:13 - know that it's happening like your
00:15 - coding Fairy Godmother we'll go over the
00:17 - basics of what Java does behind the
00:19 - scenes to manage memory so you don't
00:21 - have to my name is John and I'm a lead
00:23 - Java software engineer and I also have a
00:25 - full Java course available in a link
00:27 - down in the description there you'll
00:28 - find over 8 hours of videos exclusive to
00:31 - the course that cover dozens of java
00:33 - topics so if you haven't yet go check it
00:35 - out now this is just a super simple
00:37 - program I whipped up that we can use to
00:39 - illustrate how Java manages memory
00:41 - behind the scenes so here's the main
00:43 - method all it does is call this do cat
00:46 - stuff method down here which just makes
00:48 - a new cat and makes that cat meow then
00:50 - after that back up here it prints out
00:52 - I'm done doing cat stuff as you may
00:54 - already know or at least you probably
00:56 - heard Java is what is called a garbage
00:58 - collected language and no that doesn't
01:01 - mean that a truck comes by at 6:30 every
01:03 - Monday morning throws Java in the back
01:05 - and rides off to a landfill although
01:07 - some commenters I've seen would
01:08 - apparently love that what it means is
01:10 - there are a lot of aspects of memory
01:12 - management that Java just takes care of
01:14 - for you without you having to worry
01:16 - about it you can still cause yourself
01:17 - problems if you try hard enough but you
01:19 - have to work really hard to do it
01:21 - overall the function of garbage
01:22 - collection is to just delete objects
01:25 - from memory that your program doesn't
01:27 - need anymore without some mechanism for
01:29 - doing that your program would just
01:30 - accumulate more and more objects in
01:33 - memory over time and so you'd quickly
01:35 - run out of memory and your program would
01:37 - come crashing down in a fiery blaze of
01:39 - incompetence but how exactly does it
01:42 - figure out what objects in memory your
01:44 - program doesn't need anymore so we can
01:46 - get rid of them well at a high level
01:48 - it's pretty simple so in Java when you
01:50 - create and instantiate a new variable
01:52 - like this so cat my cat equals new cat
01:56 - well so what you actually end up with
01:57 - behind the scenes is this very iable my
02:01 - cat that acts as a reference or a
02:04 - pointer to this new cat object that I've
02:07 - created out here in memory just need
02:10 - some whiskers there we go essentially
02:13 - how it works is that if some part of our
02:16 - program either a variable or some other
02:18 - object has a reference to this object in
02:22 - memory it won't be a target for Java's
02:25 - garbage collection as long as we can
02:27 - still access it it's not going anywhere
02:29 - and that makes sense right Java doesn't
02:31 - want to get rid of something we could
02:33 - potentially need and can still access
02:35 - back to our code though at some point in
02:37 - this program this mycat variable is just
02:41 - going to be out of scope now in this
02:43 - case our mycat variable is declared
02:45 - inside this do cat stuff method that
02:48 - means the scope of that variable is only
02:50 - within that method so after our program
02:52 - calls my cat. meow and then returns back
02:56 - to this line where it called that method
02:59 - well after that this myat variable just
03:02 - doesn't exist anymore it's now out of
03:04 - scope so even if we wanted to do
03:06 - something like call my cat. meow up here
03:10 - well we couldn't because my cat wasn't
03:12 - declared in this scope it just doesn't
03:14 - exist here so here's what happens we had
03:17 - this my cat variable with a reference to
03:20 - our cat object in memory but now since
03:22 - we're outside the scope where this mycat
03:24 - variable was created that variable
03:26 - doesn't exist anymore and when the
03:28 - variable goes away so does its reference
03:30 - to this cat object in memory now what we
03:33 - have is this poor Lonely Cat object
03:36 - floating all by itself out in memory and
03:39 - absolutely nothing in our program knows
03:41 - where it is or has any way to access it
03:44 - ever again all it's doing is taking up
03:46 - space in memory this is what Java's
03:49 - garbage collector is on the lookout for
03:51 - stray forgotten objects that no longer
03:54 - serve any purpose to our program now
03:56 - it's important to note that a variable
03:58 - going out of scope like this isn't the
04:00 - only way that an object could become
04:02 - unreachable in memory so for example if
04:05 - we went back to our code and we took our
04:07 - my cat variable and set it equal to
04:11 - another new cat object well what that's
04:14 - going to do is create a whole new cat
04:16 - object in memory beautiful as always and
04:20 - now instead of referencing that old cat
04:22 - object in memory it now references this
04:25 - new cat object our original cat has no
04:28 - references to it anymore more and thus
04:30 - becomes a target of Java's garbage
04:32 - collection to get cleaned up now another
04:34 - way that could happen is instead of
04:37 - mapping my cat to a new object you could
04:40 - instead just set it to null so let's say
04:42 - back in our code we just said instead of
04:43 - my cat equals new cat we could say my
04:45 - cat equals null well pretty much what
04:48 - that does is just gets rid of this old
04:50 - reference and now my cat isn't
04:52 - referencing any object at all but just
04:54 - the same this poor old cat object in
04:56 - memory now has no references to it and
04:59 - Java's garbage collector we'll need to
05:00 - clean it up but how does Java actually
05:02 - go about doing this garbage collection
05:04 - behind the scenes so quietly that you
05:06 - never even notice it actually Java has a
05:09 - whole bunch of different garbage
05:10 - collection options most of the time you
05:12 - can just let Java use its default
05:14 - garbage collector settings and it'll
05:16 - work just fine now it gets way more
05:18 - complicated than this but here's just a
05:20 - basic explanation of how the garbage
05:23 - collector works by default all right so
05:24 - let's just say your program is chugging
05:26 - along you know it's creating cats in
05:28 - memory calculating student GPA or the
05:31 - average cost of a Big Mac in Guatemala
05:34 - whatever and the whole time it's
05:36 - creating these new objects in memory
05:38 - whenever it needs to and to begin with
05:40 - all of these new objects that get
05:41 - created go into What's called the Young
05:45 - Generation Heap young gen the Young
05:48 - Generation as its name kind of suggests
05:50 - holds all objects that were created very
05:53 - recently all new objects start out here
05:56 - then at some point the Java garbage
05:57 - collector goes eh this Heap is starting
06:00 - to get sort of full I think I better
06:03 - take a look at this and start to get rid
06:05 - of some things that we don't need
06:06 - anymore and at that point it does what
06:08 - is called a mark and sweep basically all
06:11 - that means is that Java will check each
06:13 - of these items to see if they still have
06:16 - any references to them and if they do
06:18 - Java will mark them as still in use so
06:21 - let's say it marks this one and this one
06:24 - as still having references and all the
06:26 - other ones don't so once it's done that
06:28 - it then does the sweep step and that's
06:30 - when it removes anything that wasn't
06:33 - marked freeing up more memory space for
06:35 - additional objects to be created in the
06:38 - future but here's something else cool
06:39 - that it does to try and reduce the
06:41 - overall time that it has to spend doing
06:43 - this garbage collection the garbage
06:45 - collector starts to notice hm you know
06:48 - some of these objects have been around
06:50 - here for a long time they don't seem to
06:52 - be going anywhere every time I go to
06:54 - check these objects always still have
06:56 - references so they're probably pretty
06:58 - important to this program and I can
07:00 - expect them to stay around for a while
07:02 - so what it does is it takes those
07:04 - objects that have survived so long in
07:06 - the Young Generation and moves them over
07:09 - to an old generation Heap so it says all
07:13 - right you've been around here for a
07:14 - while you've been around here for a
07:16 - while let's move you over here now the
07:18 - reason that helps is because Java will
07:20 - do a mark and sweep of this old
07:22 - generation Heap way less often which
07:25 - makes sense right for two reasons first
07:27 - it's just going to fill up more slowly
07:29 - and second it's full of objects that
07:31 - have already survived previous rounds of
07:34 - garbage collection now it's still going
07:35 - to be doing multiple Mark and sweeps of
07:38 - the Young Generation pretty often as it
07:40 - continues to fill up with new objects
07:42 - that your program creates but because it
07:44 - took the time to move these long- lived
07:47 - objects over to the old generation Heap
07:49 - it doesn't have to waste all its time
07:50 - checking all of these really long- lived
07:53 - objects that are very unlikely to be
07:55 - cleaned up anyway so it's able to do the
07:57 - Young Generation Mark and sweeps much
07:59 - faster now this is a very simplified
08:02 - explanation of this whole process in
08:04 - reality all the little details of Java's
08:06 - garbage collection algorithms are
08:08 - ridiculously complicated but this just
08:10 - gives you an understanding of the
08:12 - fundamentals and you can now kind of
08:14 - start to code with that in mind for
08:17 - example that's one of the reasons it's
08:19 - recommended that you create variables in
08:21 - the smallest scope that they're needed
08:24 - because then as soon as you don't need
08:25 - that variable anymore it becomes
08:27 - eligible to be cleaned up by the garbage
08:29 - CL C and you can free up some memory and
08:31 - if you're all interested in seeing it in
08:33 - another video we'll go over some
08:34 - additional simple ways that you can
08:36 - start to code with the garbage collector
08:38 - in mind as always thank you so much for
08:41 - watching I really do appreciate you
08:42 - being here with me and I'll see you next
08:58 - time
