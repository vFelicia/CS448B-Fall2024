00:00 - do you know how long a variable name can
00:02 - be in java hopefully this is a question
00:04 - you've never asked yourself because you
00:05 - you're always making nice meaningful
00:07 - variable names right but just how long
00:09 - can you make the variable name until our
00:11 - program explodes we're gonna find out my
00:13 - name is john i'm a lead java software
00:14 - engineer and i love sharing what i've
00:16 - learned in a clear understandable way so
00:17 - be sure to hit the subscribe button so
00:18 - you don't miss each new java video i
00:20 - also have a full java course available
00:22 - in a link down in the description if
00:23 - you're interested
00:24 - so i was thinking what's the best way to
00:25 - find out how large you can make a java
00:28 - variable name of course we could
00:29 - probably google it or something but come
00:30 - on where's the fun in that we're going
00:31 - to find out by just making longer and
00:33 - longer variable names
00:34 - until our program explodes let's get
00:36 - right to it we're going to create an
00:37 - int variable first let's create it with
00:39 - just a normal name like bacon
00:41 - int bacon equals three and we'll also
00:43 - just make a line of code to print it out
00:44 - just so we know that our program is
00:45 - working into bacon equals three print
00:47 - bacon
00:48 - prints out three everything looks good
00:49 - now let's see how large we can make this
00:51 - variable name first thing i want to do
00:53 - let's put this uh variable name on its
00:55 - own line and get rid of the beginning
00:56 - tabs
00:57 - just so we can know uh by looking at
00:59 - this
01:00 - position indicator down here exactly
01:02 - what the size
01:03 - of the variable name that we're making
01:05 - is right now so now that we've got it
01:06 - all set up let's make this variable name
01:08 - huge
01:08 - to do that i'm going to do the very
01:09 - advanced technique of copying and
01:11 - pasting
01:12 - here we go bacon bacon making bacon
01:14 - making making makeup make bacon copy
01:15 - that whole line
01:16 - and start pasting that all right up to
01:18 - 2760 let's copy that whole line and keep
01:21 - pasting
01:22 - hey what what what the heck so on that
01:24 - last time we pasted
01:26 - the whole line just vanished so what's
01:28 - weird is i have the cursor on this line
01:30 - i can keep pressing the right arrow and
01:32 - it doesn't go past this point in the
01:33 - line so it looks like at something a
01:35 - little more than
01:36 - 30 000 characters there's some kind of
01:38 - bug in eclipse that just destroys your
01:40 - entire variable name and it doesn't even
01:42 - work but let's actually see if we can
01:43 - make our program run with that size of a
01:46 - variable so let's copy this variable
01:47 - and paste it here in our print line
01:49 - statement and just try and run our
01:51 - program
01:51 - yep works just fine with a 32 000
01:54 - character variable name but i don't know
01:56 - i think that's just a bug with eclipse
01:58 - so what actually i'm gonna do is copy
02:00 - this program over to intellij and see if
02:02 - we can get our variable name
02:03 - even longer all right so i've copied the
02:05 - program over to intellij where i'm able
02:07 - to also
02:08 - run the program just fine let's see if
02:09 - we can make this variable name
02:11 - even longer in intellij and it looks
02:13 - like we can it is not crashing after we
02:15 - continue
02:15 - past 32 000 so let the copy pasting
02:18 - resume
02:19 - now we're up past a million characters
02:21 - and intellij still hasn't crashed on us
02:23 - each pace now makes intellij freeze for
02:25 - like 10 seconds alright so now it looks
02:26 - like we're up past
02:27 - 10 million characters let's copy and
02:30 - paste that and double it
02:32 - 20 million copy paste if there is such a
02:35 - crime as computer abuse
02:37 - i am definitely guilty of it okay wow we
02:39 - are up past
02:40 - 62 million and intellij seems to have
02:42 - frozen so i'm going to kill it again
02:44 - okay we're back all right so now we get
02:46 - an alert that this file size
02:48 - is too large to even do any editing in
02:51 - intellij anymore okay so let's back up
02:53 - let's take the file that we at least had
02:54 - working in eclipse and copy that over to
02:57 - intellij the one that had the 32 000
02:59 - character variable name we're going to
03:00 - start with that intellij and just work
03:02 - our way up until the program breaks
03:03 - since we can't even edit this file in
03:05 - intellij we're going to just delete it
03:07 - and recreate it
03:08 - java io exception cannot delete this
03:10 - file okay well let's go into windows
03:12 - explorer and try and delete it
03:14 - manually can't delete it because it's
03:15 - open in intellij so intellij can delete
03:18 - it and windows can't delete it because
03:19 - intellij has it open so
03:20 - let's once again kill intellij sorry try
03:23 - again to delete the file
03:24 - okay the file is deleted in case you
03:26 - didn't know a cool thing that you can do
03:27 - is just copy the entire text of this
03:29 - class and then over in intellij just
03:31 - highlight
03:32 - the source folder and hit ctrl v to
03:33 - paste and it'll actually automatically
03:35 - create that class and put all that text
03:37 - in it pretty cool so we know this works
03:38 - since we tried it before
03:39 - let's go ahead and double this to 64 000
03:43 - see if it still works and it does so
03:45 - let's um double that again to 128
03:48 - 000. all right so there we actually did
03:50 - get an error our variable name is
03:51 - finally
03:52 - too long for java to deal with it so
03:54 - somewhere between 64
03:55 - and 128 000 is the limit so before i
03:58 - start just wasting my life adding single
04:00 - characters after 64 000 until it breaks
04:02 - i actually did do a little bit of
04:04 - googling and it looks like the magic
04:06 - number
04:06 - might be 65 535
04:10 - so let's go and give that a test to see
04:12 - if that's right all right so now we're
04:14 - at exactly 65
04:16 - 535 remember it's off by one so we see
04:19 - down here 65 536 here we go moment of
04:21 - truth
04:22 - okay it does work now let's add one
04:25 - more character so now we're at 65536
04:30 - now let's see what happens and yes we do
04:32 - get that same error so
04:34 - the exact limit to a variable name that
04:36 - you can have in java
04:38 - is 65 530
04:42 - characters now why would that be why is
04:45 - that the magic number
04:46 - it turns out this is actually due to a
04:47 - limitation in the jvm the java virtual
04:50 - machine so it actually says down here
04:52 - deep
04:52 - in the jvm spec documents that the
04:54 - length of field and method names
04:56 - is limited to 65 535 characters by a 16
05:00 - bit unsigned length of a constant buried
05:03 - deep in the jbm so that makes sense
05:05 - why well because 16 bits means 2 to the
05:08 - 16th and guess what 2 to the 16th is
05:10 - 65 536
05:13 - the actual maximum value of a 16 bit
05:15 - unsigned number
05:16 - would be 65 535.
05:20 - i can only hope that knowing this
05:22 - maximum limit to a variable name in java
05:24 - is absolutely useless to you if you ever
05:26 - try to make a variable name in java
05:28 - that's more than
05:29 - 65 000 characters long may god have
05:32 - mercy on your soul seriously

Cleaned transcript:

do you know how long a variable name can be in java hopefully this is a question you've never asked yourself because you you're always making nice meaningful variable names right but just how long can you make the variable name until our program explodes we're gonna find out my name is john i'm a lead java software engineer and i love sharing what i've learned in a clear understandable way so be sure to hit the subscribe button so you don't miss each new java video i also have a full java course available in a link down in the description if you're interested so i was thinking what's the best way to find out how large you can make a java variable name of course we could probably google it or something but come on where's the fun in that we're going to find out by just making longer and longer variable names until our program explodes let's get right to it we're going to create an int variable first let's create it with just a normal name like bacon int bacon equals three and we'll
