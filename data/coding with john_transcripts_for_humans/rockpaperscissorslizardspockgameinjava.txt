00:00 - in this video we are going to enhance
00:01 - the rock paper scissors game that we
00:03 - made
00:03 - and implement a full rock paper scissors
00:05 - lizard spock
00:06 - game in java this one is for all the
00:09 - programmers out there who are somehow
00:10 - even bigger nerds than me
00:12 - if you haven't already seen the rock
00:13 - paper scissors video go ahead and click
00:14 - here to view it it won't take long to
00:16 - get through that and it'll just be a few
00:17 - easy enhancements to create rock paper
00:19 - scissors lizard spock
00:20 - if you're new to the channel my name is
00:21 - john and i make a java tutorial video
00:24 - every single week either a video on java
00:25 - topic or a full programming tutorial
00:27 - walking through
00:28 - how to create something from scratch be
00:30 - sure to leave a like and hit the
00:31 - subscribe button so you don't miss the
00:32 - new video every week thank you for
00:33 - taking the time to like and subscribe
00:35 - it's the only way these videos get out
00:36 - to help more people and so i really do
00:38 - appreciate it and as always the full
00:39 - java source code for this rock paper
00:41 - scissors lizard spot game is available
00:43 - in the link down in the description so
00:44 - go and grab it the original rock paper
00:46 - scissors source code is also available
00:48 - in a link down in the description
00:49 - so you can grab that if you want to
00:51 - build off of it to make rock paper
00:52 - scissors
00:53 - lizard spock yourself first like i said
00:55 - if you haven't seen the original rock
00:56 - paper scissors video
00:58 - go ahead and watch it here we're going
01:00 - to start with that code because it gives
01:02 - us all the structure that we need the
01:03 - flow of the game
01:04 - the randomness the computer move the
01:06 - player move all the main
01:08 - flow and aspects of the game are going
01:10 - to stay the same we're just going to
01:11 - take that rock paper scissors game
01:13 - and add some enhancements to make it a
01:15 - rock paper scissors lizard spock
01:17 - game so this is our original rock paper
01:19 - scissors game and let's just do a quick
01:21 - run through of how it works
01:22 - well the whole game is structured in a
01:23 - wild true loop so you can just keep
01:25 - playing repeatedly if you want to
01:26 - and we start with this array of strings
01:29 - r p and s for rock paper scissors
01:31 - and to do the computer move we just pick
01:32 - a random element from that array and
01:34 - then to get the player move we just
01:36 - print out please enter your move
01:37 - and then use the scanner class to get
01:39 - the string input from the user
01:41 - we expect the user to enter either r p
01:43 - or s for rock paper or scissors
01:44 - and if they don't send in one of those
01:46 - we say hey that's not a valid move
01:48 - and go to the top of this while true
01:50 - loop here again so they can re-enter
01:52 - and then after that we have the computer
01:53 - move and the player move and all that's
01:55 - left is to do the logic
01:56 - of who wins and print out the result so
01:59 - we print out the computer played
02:00 - whatever they played and then the logic
02:02 - for printing out the result begins
02:04 - first if the player move and the
02:05 - computer move are equal if they're the
02:07 - exact same then we say the game was a
02:08 - tie
02:09 - otherwise we have a section for if the
02:11 - player move was rock
02:12 - so if the player move is rock and the
02:14 - computer move is paper then we say that
02:16 - you lose because paper covers rock
02:17 - otherwise if the computer picks scissors
02:19 - you win because rock crushes scissors
02:21 - and then we have a section for if the
02:22 - player move is paper
02:24 - of course paper covers rock scissors
02:25 - cuts paper and then lastly we have the
02:27 - section for if the player move was
02:28 - scissors
02:29 - scissors cuts paper and rock crushes
02:31 - scissors and then we just ask the user
02:33 - if they want to play again
02:34 - and if they enter the letter y it
02:35 - restarts the loop again and allows the
02:37 - player to play all over again
02:38 - and if they enter anything else the game
02:40 - ends so overall pretty simple pretty
02:42 - straightforward right it's a good
02:43 - beginner game to make
02:44 - so now how do we enhance this to make
02:46 - rock paper scissors
02:47 - lizard spock basically we're going to
02:49 - keep the same structure we're not going
02:51 - to change how the game flows or anything
02:52 - like that
02:53 - we just need to redo the set of moves
02:56 - that are possible for the computer and
02:57 - the player to make and then down here we
02:59 - need to make a lot of changes
03:00 - to how the logic works for determining
03:02 - who wins and printing out the result
03:04 - because there are a lot more
03:05 - possibilities
03:06 - with five different options than with
03:08 - just three so first let's just start
03:09 - here
03:10 - at the top the string array of possible
03:13 - moves that we have
03:14 - is right now just rpns rock paper or
03:16 - scissors so
03:17 - instead let's go ahead and add the two
03:20 - options for lizard and spock
03:22 - so for lizard of course we can just add
03:24 - l as a possibility
03:25 - now since spock also starts with an s
03:28 - and that's competing
03:28 - with the s for scissors let's go ahead
03:31 - and just pick a different one how about
03:33 - k because k is at the end of spock i
03:35 - really want to keep it one letter to
03:37 - make it easy for the user to input and
03:39 - so we can just make it k
03:40 - to make it different from everything
03:41 - else and so now that we have more
03:43 - options here we should probably rename
03:44 - our string array variable from rps to
03:46 - rps lk
03:48 - now a fancy way you can do this if you
03:50 - are working in an ide like eclipse
03:52 - you can use the rename functionality so
03:53 - i can hit alt shift
03:55 - r when i'm selecting rps and then i can
03:59 - change this to be
04:00 - rps lk hit enter and you can see that
04:02 - it's automatically
04:04 - changing that variable name everywhere
04:05 - it's used so that's super convenient
04:07 - as we move down in the code we can see
04:09 - that the computer move is already
04:11 - selecting
04:12 - a random element from that array and it
04:15 - uses the length of the array to get that
04:16 - random element
04:17 - so even though we added a couple of
04:19 - options to the array
04:21 - it should now automatically include
04:23 - those two as possibilities so there's
04:25 - nothing we need to do there at all
04:26 - moving down in the code we have a system
04:28 - out print line statement that says
04:30 - please enter your move
04:31 - rp or s so we do need to change this to
04:34 - r p
04:35 - s l or k rock paper scissors lizard
04:39 - or spock and then we collect the next
04:41 - move from the player
04:42 - no change needed there and now we have
04:44 - our validation where if the player
04:46 - enters rp or s
04:48 - we break out of this loop because they
04:49 - entered something valid so we do need to
04:51 - add lizard and spock as
04:53 - options here so we'll just copy and
04:56 - paste
04:56 - that blizzard and spock so we got r p
05:00 - s l and k are now all valid moves for
05:03 - the player all right then
05:04 - below that we just have a print
05:06 - statement where we print out what the
05:07 - computer played
05:08 - no change needed there and then here is
05:10 - where most of our changes are going to
05:12 - take place where we're printing out
05:14 - the results of the game and who won no
05:17 - changes needed to this first part here
05:18 - where
05:19 - if the player move is equal to the
05:20 - computer move it's still a tie but we do
05:22 - need to add
05:23 - all of the combination results uh now
05:26 - that we have
05:26 - lizard and spock added as possibilities
05:29 - so all of the rest
05:30 - of this logic is going to be changed up
05:33 - quite a bit
05:33 - now what are the actual rules to this
05:35 - game that we need to implement so i
05:37 - brought up
05:37 - this image here that i found on
05:39 - instructables so what we've got is
05:41 - rock crushes lizard lizard eats paper
05:43 - lizard poison spock
05:44 - spock vaporizes rocks box smashes
05:46 - scissors sisters decapitates lizard
05:48 - scissors cuts paper paper disproves
05:50 - spock
05:50 - paper covers rock and as always rock
05:53 - crushes scissors so it's basically all
05:54 - the interactions with the lizard
05:56 - and the spock that are new to our logic
05:59 - that we need to add so let's just move
06:00 - down the code in our logic
06:02 - and add what we need to so first we have
06:04 - a section
06:05 - for if the player chooses rock so
06:08 - underneath
06:08 - that inside this else if we're going to
06:10 - have all the conditions that the
06:12 - computer could play
06:13 - against it so right now we have a
06:14 - condition for if the computer chooses
06:16 - paper
06:16 - and scissors and so we just need to add
06:18 - two other conditions
06:20 - for lizard and spock but just for fun
06:22 - also let's go ahead and
06:23 - type what the result is in addition to
06:26 - just whether the player wins or loses so
06:28 - for example here if the player plays
06:30 - rock
06:30 - and the computer plays paper we can
06:32 - print out paper
06:34 - covers rock and then you lose
06:37 - and here we have rock crushes scissors
06:40 - you win so now let's copy this else and
06:44 - create the condition for if the computer
06:47 - played
06:47 - lizard against the player's rock let's
06:50 - go off our cheat sheet here for
06:51 - rock and lizard rock crushes lizard so
06:54 - rock crushes
06:55 - lizard and the player wins and then
06:58 - let's copy that again
06:59 - for the spock play remember spock is k
07:02 - and not s and it is a spock vaporizes
07:06 - the rock
07:07 - spock vaporizes
07:10 - rock so in that case the player loses
07:13 - okay so that should cover all the
07:14 - conditions where the player played
07:16 - rock paper covers rock and so i would
07:18 - lose rock crushes scissors
07:20 - so i would win rock crushes the lizard
07:22 - too so i win
07:23 - spock vaporizes the rock so i would lose
07:26 - the rock is covered let's move down
07:28 - to paper we'll have similar things here
07:30 - so paper versus rock we have
07:31 - paper covers rock you win scissors cuts
07:35 - paper
07:36 - you lose and then let's copy this else
07:39 - for lizard and spock l and k
07:43 - so paper versus lizard is lizard eats
07:45 - paper
07:46 - lizard eats paper so i lose
07:50 - and then paper disproves spock so i win
07:54 - spock win all right that covers all of
07:57 - the paper scenarios where the player
07:59 - plays paper
08:00 - and the last of our current entries here
08:02 - is for scissors
08:03 - of course scissors cuts paper rock
08:05 - crushes scissors
08:07 - as it always has you lose copy paste
08:10 - our else ifs for lizard and spock l
08:13 - and k so scissors decapitates a lizard
08:17 - scissors decapitates blizzard
08:20 - so i would win as the scissors player
08:23 - spock smashes scissors
08:24 -  smashes scissors
08:28 - so i lose that covers all of these
08:30 - scissors scenarios now since in our
08:32 - original game the computer couldn't play
08:33 - lizard or spock we need
08:35 - whole other sections for when the
08:36 - computer plays a lizard or spock so
08:38 - we're going to copy this
08:40 - entire section and paste it down here
08:42 - for if the player
08:43 - plays lizard so let's go down the line
08:46 - lizard versus paper lizard eats paper
08:48 - eats paper you win rock crushes the
08:52 - lizard
08:52 - so i lose now here now since we copy
08:55 - pasted we have a lizard versus
08:57 - lizard the tie games are accounted for
08:59 - way at the top
09:00 - so we actually need to change this to uh
09:02 - scissors but the result here is the same
09:04 - the scissors decapitates lizard but
09:06 - since i'm the lizard here i lose
09:08 - i'm getting decapitated i'm getting
09:10 - decapitated which is always
09:12 - an inconvenience now lizard versus spock
09:14 - it turns out
09:15 - lizard poison spock zerd poisons
09:19 - spock so since the player played lizard
09:21 - you can say you win
09:23 - alright so that covers all the scenarios
09:24 - where the player played
09:26 - lizard let's copy and paste all of that
09:29 - one more time for when the player plays
09:32 - spock
09:32 - k now we have spock versus paper which
09:35 - is paper disproves
09:37 - spock so in that case since i'm spock i
09:39 - lose
09:40 - nexbach versus rock and in that case
09:42 - spock vaporizes
09:44 - the rock spock vaporizes
09:47 - rock so the player wins we have spock
09:50 - versus scissors
09:51 - spock smashes scissors
09:54 - smashes scissors so the player wins
09:57 - and now here again since we copy pasted
09:59 - we currently have a spock versus spock
10:01 - so we need to change this to a spock
10:02 - versus lizard and we already have the
10:05 - outcome here lizard does poison spock
10:07 - but in this one since i am spock
10:09 - i would lose because i'm getting
10:11 - poisoned okay that should account for
10:13 - all the different possibilities let's do
10:15 - some play testing and see if everything
10:17 - works as it should so i'll hit ctrl
10:19 - f11 to play the game so i'm just going
10:21 - to play through this a handful of times
10:22 - and make sure everything's working fine
10:24 - let's play a spock computer play lizard
10:27 - lizard poison spock you
10:28 - lose so it's working play again yes or
10:30 - no i can enter y and play again
10:32 - and to remove a lizard lizard eats paper
10:35 - i win
10:35 - okay i'm gonna do this a whole bunch of
10:36 - times to get a really thorough test
10:46 - okay i think i encountered every single
10:48 - scenario the game could offer and all of
10:50 - them
10:50 - worked great now you have a fully
10:52 - functioning rock paper scissors lizard
10:55 - spock
10:55 - java program so if you've got friends
10:57 - who are big bang theory fans or
10:58 - especially those who are programmers
11:00 - it's pretty cool right you made your own
11:01 - little unique game like this

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are going to enhance the rock paper scissors game that we made and implement a full rock paper scissors lizard spock game in java this one is for all the programmers out there who are somehow even bigger nerds than me if you haven't already seen the rock paper scissors video go ahead and click here to view it it won't take long to get through that and it'll just be a few easy enhancements to create rock paper scissors lizard spock if you're new to the channel my name is john and i make a java tutorial video every single week either a video on java topic or a full programming tutorial walking through how to create something from scratch be sure to leave a like and hit the subscribe button so you don't miss the new video every week thank you for taking the time to like and subscribe it's the only way these videos get out to help more people and so i really do appreciate it and as always the full java source code for this rock paper scissors lizard spot game is available in the link down in the description so go and grab it the original rock paper scissors source code is also available in a link down in the description so you can grab that if you want to build off of it to make rock paper scissors lizard spock yourself first like i said if you haven't seen the original rock paper scissors video go ahead and watch it here we're going to start with that code because it gives us all the structure that we need the flow of the game the randomness the computer move the player move all the main flow and aspects of the game are going to stay the same we're just going to take that rock paper scissors game and add some enhancements to make it a rock paper scissors lizard spock game so this is our original rock paper scissors game and let's just do a quick run through of how it works well the whole game is structured in a wild true loop so you can just keep playing repeatedly if you want to and we start with this array of strings r p and s for rock paper scissors and to do the computer move we just pick a random element from that array and then to get the player move we just print out please enter your move and then use the scanner class to get the string input from the user we expect the user to enter either r p or s for rock paper or scissors and if they don't send in one of those we say hey that's not a valid move and go to the top of this while true loop here again so they can reenter and then after that we have the computer move and the player move and all that's left is to do the logic of who wins and print out the result so we print out the computer played whatever they played and then the logic for printing out the result begins first if the player move and the computer move are equal if they're the exact same then we say the game was a tie otherwise we have a section for if the player move was rock so if the player move is rock and the computer move is paper then we say that you lose because paper covers rock otherwise if the computer picks scissors you win because rock crushes scissors and then we have a section for if the player move is paper of course paper covers rock scissors cuts paper and then lastly we have the section for if the player move was scissors scissors cuts paper and rock crushes scissors and then we just ask the user if they want to play again and if they enter the letter y it restarts the loop again and allows the player to play all over again and if they enter anything else the game ends so overall pretty simple pretty straightforward right it's a good beginner game to make so now how do we enhance this to make rock paper scissors lizard spock basically we're going to keep the same structure we're not going to change how the game flows or anything like that we just need to redo the set of moves that are possible for the computer and the player to make and then down here we need to make a lot of changes to how the logic works for determining who wins and printing out the result because there are a lot more possibilities with five different options than with just three so first let's just start here at the top the string array of possible moves that we have is right now just rpns rock paper or scissors so instead let's go ahead and add the two options for lizard and spock so for lizard of course we can just add l as a possibility now since spock also starts with an s and that's competing with the s for scissors let's go ahead and just pick a different one how about k because k is at the end of spock i really want to keep it one letter to make it easy for the user to input and so we can just make it k to make it different from everything else and so now that we have more options here we should probably rename our string array variable from rps to rps lk now a fancy way you can do this if you are working in an ide like eclipse you can use the rename functionality so i can hit alt shift r when i'm selecting rps and then i can change this to be rps lk hit enter and you can see that it's automatically changing that variable name everywhere it's used so that's super convenient as we move down in the code we can see that the computer move is already selecting a random element from that array and it uses the length of the array to get that random element so even though we added a couple of options to the array it should now automatically include those two as possibilities so there's nothing we need to do there at all moving down in the code we have a system out print line statement that says please enter your move rp or s so we do need to change this to r p s l or k rock paper scissors lizard or spock and then we collect the next move from the player no change needed there and now we have our validation where if the player enters rp or s we break out of this loop because they entered something valid so we do need to add lizard and spock as options here so we'll just copy and paste that blizzard and spock so we got r p s l and k are now all valid moves for the player all right then below that we just have a print statement where we print out what the computer played no change needed there and then here is where most of our changes are going to take place where we're printing out the results of the game and who won no changes needed to this first part here where if the player move is equal to the computer move it's still a tie but we do need to add all of the combination results uh now that we have lizard and spock added as possibilities so all of the rest of this logic is going to be changed up quite a bit now what are the actual rules to this game that we need to implement so i brought up this image here that i found on instructables so what we've got is rock crushes lizard lizard eats paper lizard poison spock spock vaporizes rocks box smashes scissors sisters decapitates lizard scissors cuts paper paper disproves spock paper covers rock and as always rock crushes scissors so it's basically all the interactions with the lizard and the spock that are new to our logic that we need to add so let's just move down the code in our logic and add what we need to so first we have a section for if the player chooses rock so underneath that inside this else if we're going to have all the conditions that the computer could play against it so right now we have a condition for if the computer chooses paper and scissors and so we just need to add two other conditions for lizard and spock but just for fun also let's go ahead and type what the result is in addition to just whether the player wins or loses so for example here if the player plays rock and the computer plays paper we can print out paper covers rock and then you lose and here we have rock crushes scissors you win so now let's copy this else and create the condition for if the computer played lizard against the player's rock let's go off our cheat sheet here for rock and lizard rock crushes lizard so rock crushes lizard and the player wins and then let's copy that again for the spock play remember spock is k and not s and it is a spock vaporizes the rock spock vaporizes rock so in that case the player loses okay so that should cover all the conditions where the player played rock paper covers rock and so i would lose rock crushes scissors so i would win rock crushes the lizard too so i win spock vaporizes the rock so i would lose the rock is covered let's move down to paper we'll have similar things here so paper versus rock we have paper covers rock you win scissors cuts paper you lose and then let's copy this else for lizard and spock l and k so paper versus lizard is lizard eats paper lizard eats paper so i lose and then paper disproves spock so i win spock win all right that covers all of the paper scenarios where the player plays paper and the last of our current entries here is for scissors of course scissors cuts paper rock crushes scissors as it always has you lose copy paste our else ifs for lizard and spock l and k so scissors decapitates a lizard scissors decapitates blizzard so i would win as the scissors player spock smashes scissors smashes scissors so i lose that covers all of these scissors scenarios now since in our original game the computer couldn't play lizard or spock we need whole other sections for when the computer plays a lizard or spock so we're going to copy this entire section and paste it down here for if the player plays lizard so let's go down the line lizard versus paper lizard eats paper eats paper you win rock crushes the lizard so i lose now here now since we copy pasted we have a lizard versus lizard the tie games are accounted for way at the top so we actually need to change this to uh scissors but the result here is the same the scissors decapitates lizard but since i'm the lizard here i lose i'm getting decapitated i'm getting decapitated which is always an inconvenience now lizard versus spock it turns out lizard poison spock zerd poisons spock so since the player played lizard you can say you win alright so that covers all the scenarios where the player played lizard let's copy and paste all of that one more time for when the player plays spock k now we have spock versus paper which is paper disproves spock so in that case since i'm spock i lose nexbach versus rock and in that case spock vaporizes the rock spock vaporizes rock so the player wins we have spock versus scissors spock smashes scissors smashes scissors so the player wins and now here again since we copy pasted we currently have a spock versus spock so we need to change this to a spock versus lizard and we already have the outcome here lizard does poison spock but in this one since i am spock i would lose because i'm getting poisoned okay that should account for all the different possibilities let's do some play testing and see if everything works as it should so i'll hit ctrl f11 to play the game so i'm just going to play through this a handful of times and make sure everything's working fine let's play a spock computer play lizard lizard poison spock you lose so it's working play again yes or no i can enter y and play again and to remove a lizard lizard eats paper i win okay i'm gonna do this a whole bunch of times to get a really thorough test okay i think i encountered every single scenario the game could offer and all of them worked
