one of the core concepts a node is the concept of events in fact a lot of nodes core functionality is based on this concept of events an event is basically a signal that indicates that something has happened in our application for example in node we have a class called HTTP that we can use to build a web server so we listen on a given port and every time we receive a request on that port that HTTP class raises an event now our job is to respond to that event which basically involves reading that request and returning the right response so as you go through node documentation you can see that several classes in node raises different kinds of events and in your code you might be interested to respond to those events so in this lecture I'm gonna show you how to work with the events module now back in notes documentation once again in the list of modules you can see here we have this events module so in this module we have one class that is called event emitter it's one of the core building blocks of node and a lot of classes are based on this event emitter so let's see how we can work with this event emitter I can be asked Oh first let's load the events module so require events now here when we call the require function we get the event emitter class so constant event emitter note that here in terms of the naming the first letter of every word is uppercase this is a convention that indicates that this event emitter is a class it's not a function it's not a simple value it's a class a class is container for properties and functions which we call methods so in this event emitter class we have these metals that you see here in the documentation so a class is a container for a bunch of related methods and properties now here in order to use this event emitter first we need to create an instance of this class so constant emitter we set this to new event emitter so here this emitter is an object in case you don't know the difference between a class and an object let me give you a metaphor a class is like human and an object is like an actual person like John Mary and so on so a class defines the properties and behavior of a concept like a human but an object is an actual instance of that class okay so here this first event emitter is a class it's a blueprint it defines what an event emitter can do but this second emitter is an actual object this is the one that we're going to use in our application so this emitter has a bunch of methods look these are all the metals that you saw in the documentation now even though here we have more than ten metals most of the time we use only two of these methods one is m8 that we use to raise an event the first time I saw this method it didn't make sense to me because English is my second language and I didn't know what m8 means so if you're in the same boat ma it basically means making a noise or produce something in this case we're making a noise in our application we're signaling that an event has happened okay so that's the meaning of Emmett here we pass an argument that is the name of the event let's say message locked in the future we're going to extend our lager module and every time we log a message we're going to raise an event called message locked okay now if you run this application nothing is going to happen let me show you back in the terminal node fjs look nothing happened because we have raised an event here but nowhere in our application we have registered a listener that is interested in that event a listener is a function that will be called when that event is raised okay so let's register a listener that will be called when the message log event is raised so register a listener so emitter dot look here we have this method add listener but we have an alias for this that we use more often that is on if you're worked with jQuery you have seen this before so on or add listener they're exactly the same but quit often we use the on method now this method takes two arguments the first one is the name of the event in this case message locked and the second one is a callback function or the actual listener so here we pass a function and this function will be called when that event is raised okay now for now I just want to lock a message in the console so console let's say listener called like this now let's run this application so node FJ yes and we got this message listener called so this indicates that when we raise this event function or listener was caught okay and of course the order is important here if you register this listener after calling the Emmett method nothing would have happened because when we call the Emmett method this ammeter iterates over all the registered listeners and calls them synchronously okay so this is the basic of raising events and handling them using the eve an emitter class hi guys its mosh here thank you for watching my know tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete note course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
