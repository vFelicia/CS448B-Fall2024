in this video I'm going to show you one of my favorite shortcuts in vs code and that's go to file let's say we're looking for a file called product list one way to find it is to go to our project and dig into various folders to find that file this is timec consuming there's a faster way we can press command and P on Mac or control and P on Windows this brings up the search box now here we can type product list and this shows all files matching this pattern but there's a fast surve we don't even have to type the full file name we can type abbreviations for example we can type prod list and again we get all files matching this pattern now if you're looking for a file called Product list. test. TSX again we don't have to type the full file name here we can just type test to narrow down the search result follow me for more useful videos like this
