sick of endless tutorials that get you nowhere ready for a real road map to a high pain Tech job then let's cut the fluff and fix the mistakes that are sabotaging your progress I'm MH hamadani and I've spent the last 10 years not just as a software engineer but also teaching people like you how to code I've seen the same mistakes hold even the smartest folks back so in this video I'm taking that experience and giving you the shortcut the five critical mistakes to void so you can land that coding job fast mistake number one learning too many things at once you hear JavaScript is essential but then someone says python is the easiest then you see job postings asking for C++ or Java so before you know it you're down the rabbit hole of languages and feeling totally overwhelmed here's the thing trying to master Everything at Once is a recipe for par out let's simplify want to build awesome websites JavaScript is your Chan dreaming of making games C or C++ is the way to go fascinated by Ai and data python is your starting point now you might hear someone out there saying but you can do all of that with JavaScript yes it's true but JavaScript really shines for web development it's not the best language for game development or machine learning so pick one language and stick to it mistake number two thinking one language is the Magic Bullet so you have picked JavaScript for web development awesome but here is the truth mastering JavaScript alone is is not going to land you a job you have to learn a bunch of other stuff as well for example to become a web developer you also need to master HTML CSS react and a bunch of other tools and that brings us to the next mistake chasing the shiny and unrelated you have all done that you're learning JavaScript then bam blockchain or AI is the future next thing you know you're halfway through a python course your website is unfinished and you're starting to doubt yourself focus is your superpower right now if you want to succeed as a developer you need to have a goal what kind of job are you looking for do you want to be a frontend developer a backend developer a game developer a data scientist what do you want to do these are very different paths requiring different skills if you don't have a Target you will never hit the mark do your research check out job postings in your area see what skills are in demand and what kind of salaries you can expect now mistake number five tutorial hell look tutorials are great and I create them myself but bouncing between YouTube videos leaves you feeling lost when you are starting out you need structure you need a clear path that's designed to get your job ready fast and here's the other side of tutorial hell a lot of people find really long courses on udemy and assume that just because a course is long it's very detailed and teaches them everything they need in reality most people hardly ever finish these courses because they have so much padding and repetition plus as I said to become job ready you have to learn a few different skills not just one programming language you don't have 68 hours to spend on just JavaScript look this other course is 62 hours if you spend 50 hours on each of the essential skills you need for a job you need 450 hours just to watch these courses let alone coding and practicing which often takes double the course length that's a Target you're never going to hit instead look for shorter courses that packing the most essential skills in the least amount of time I hope this gets you pumped and back on track let me know in the comments which mistakes you struggle with most and don't forget to like And subscribe for more nonnonsense coding advice
