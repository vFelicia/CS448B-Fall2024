now quite often when you want to raise an event we also want to send some data about that event for example in our lager module when we log a message perhaps our remote login service will generate an ID for that message perhaps we want to return that ID to the client or it may give us a URL to access that log message directly so here when raising an event we can add additional arguments which we refer to as event arguments so we can add an ID like one and we can add a URL but as you can see these magic values here are a little bit confusing if you want to send multiple values about an event it's a better practice to encapsulate those values inside an object so here we have an object we give it a couple of properties like ID we set it to ID of this message that is logged and another property URL like this okay so we're referring to this object as event argument now when registering a listener here this callback function is actual listener can also receive this event argument so here we add a parameter called org you can call it anything the name doesn't matter but by convention we often use arc or some people use e to refer to the event or event art whatever you prefer is perfectly fine so here we have art now let's log it on the console very simple let's run this application so note okay look listen are called and here's our event arc and with this technique we can pass data about the event that just happened now one last thing to make this code a little bit simpler in es6 or equal script six we have this feature called arrow function with an arrow function we can get rid of this function keyword so here we have the arguments and after that we have the body of that function now to separate the two we use an arrow and that's why we call this arrow function you can see this syntax is a little bit simpler and a lot of people prefer to use arrow functions in es6 now here's a simple exercise for you let's imagine in our lager module just before calling our remote service to log the message we're going to raise an event called logging and while raising this event we also want to send some data and it's the message that we're going to lock so what I want you to do is to use what you have learned in this lecture and raise and handle is logging event it's a very simple exercise I just want you to get used to this syntax hi guys its mosh here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching is part of my complete note course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
