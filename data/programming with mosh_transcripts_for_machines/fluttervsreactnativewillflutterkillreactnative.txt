in this video we're gonna talk about react native versus flutter will flutter killed react native let's find out hi i'm mohammed ani and i've taught millions of people how to become professional software engineers through this channel and my coding school in this video i'm gonna compare react native with flutter and then towards the end i'm gonna give you my unbiased opinion about which one you should learn from mobile developer so react native and flutter are the two top frameworks or building mobile apps for iOS and Android react native is created by Facebook and has been around since 2015 here are five apps that are built with react native Facebook Instagram Pinterest Skype uber EADS and many many more flutter is created by Google it's a neuro framework that came out in 2018 here are three apps built with flutter Google at Alibaba realtor.com and of course many many more as you can see on Google Trends flutter has gained a lot of popularity recently and has overtaken react native that's because a lot of people are curious about flutter I want to learn it having said that at the time of recording this video there are not as many job opportunities for flutter developers if you do a quick search on indeed calm or your favorite job searching website you can verify this yourself indeed calm they're currently 250 jobs for react native developers in California compared to 42 jobs for flutter that's because react native has been around for much longer than flutter even though Google has invested a lot in developing and improving flutter react native is more mature and stable so it has a higher adoption rate now where you live these numbers might be different and there may be more job opportunities for flutter developers so don't just relate on what I tell you do your own research and see which framework has a better job market now in terms of programming languages react native uses JavaScript so if you're a web developer and no JavaScript react native is the most straightforward path for you to get into mobile development flutter on the other hand uses dart which is a new objectoriented programming language created by Google it's very similar to Java and JavaScript in terms of syntax so if you know Java JavaScript or C sharp you can quickly get up sweet with dart I think dart is a beautiful language that has taken the best ideas from different programming languages however it's still new in the developer community whereas javascript has been around for a very long time and has a huge community there are lots of books courses articles developers and millions of lines of JavaScript code we can use in our apps darts still new and growing its community now one of the selling points of flutter is that it comes with a comprehensive library of beautiful UI widgets so for any kind of app you want to build there are many beautiful widgets available right out of the box that's not the case with react native you have to reach out to thirdparty libraries so building and shipping apps with flutter can be faster but of course that really depends on the developer skills overall I think both react native and flutter are great here on my channel I have a comprehensive to our tutorial on react native but I'm creating a similar one for flutter by the time you watch this video my flutter tutorial might even be ready so check the description box below for the links now should you invest your time and energy and react native or flutter well here's my guidelines first of all ask yourself why you want to learn react native or flutter think about your goal do you wanna learn mobile development to get a job or do you have an idea for an app and want to turn that idea into a reality your goal will determine the framework you need to learn if your goal is to get a good job with a good salary the job market determines whether you should learn react native or flutter so look at the number of jobs advertised where you live don't listen to people telling you you should learn this or that do your own research and decide based on data on the other hand if your goal is to build an app then the job market doesn't matter anymore what matters is time to market being able to quickly build and shape your app if you know JavaScript well and you also happen to know react then react native is the fastest way for you to get into mobile developer react native is based on react so everything you know about react also applies in react native you just have to learn some additional stuff on the other hand if you don't know JavaScript then you might want to consider a flutter because all you have to learn to get started is the dart language and flutter itself it's faster than learning JavaScript yeah and react native
