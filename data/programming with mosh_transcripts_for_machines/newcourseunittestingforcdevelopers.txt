welcome to unit testing for csharp developers my name is Mohamad ani and I have taught over 140,000 students around the world chances are you've heard of unit testing but you're not sure how powerful it is or perhaps you've tried it and it didn't work for you it's a skill that every senior developer must have unit tests help you get instant feedback on your code to see if it really works this means we can catch bugs before you release your software so ultimately you will save time effort and money in this course I'm going to take you on a journey to master unit testing but in a fraction of the time it took me I read several books watch tons of videos and tried various approaches to write unit tests some failed some worked what you find in this course is the result of years of my experience packed with best practices realworld examples and exercises so by the end of watching this course you'll be able to write great unit tests that help you release better quality software with less bugs more specifically you'll learn what to test and how tips and tricks to write clean and reliable tests the pitfalls to avoid how to refactor a legacy code into loosely coupled and testable code all about dependency injection and mocks and much much more so click the enroll button to get instant lifetime access to the course and here's my promise to you if you're not satisfied ask for a refund within the first 30 days all your money back no questions asked so you've got absolutely nothing to lose it's a hundred percent riskfree I'm really looking forward to sharing my knowledge with you take care and happy coding
