meet Luke back in 2020 he set a crazy goal build a website with a million visitors a month guess what he crushed it but then disaster suddenly his traffic was tanking this isn't just about Luke many website owners been facing the same problem they worked so hard on their websites created amazing content and then starting in January of 2023 they saw their visitors slowly disappear it can be really frustrating so I was curious and started reading com comments people are blaming it on all sorts of things Google's changing algorithms bad content technical problems the usual stuff you always here now I'm not going to pretend to be an SEO expert and I'm not sure what exactly happened with Luke's website but there is something interesting about all these stories of website traffic suddenly dropping the problem seem to pop up around January of 20123 that's roughly when chat GPT went totally viral think about how you search for things now I personally much prefer asking chat GPT a question and getting a straight answer instead of the whole Google search dance you know clicking links dealing with a million ads popping up from every corner and scrolling through articles that sometimes take forever to get to the point so I think that could be a big reason why website traffic has dropped for so many people so out of curiosity I ran a poll on YouTube Twitter and Linkedin and guess what the results were super interesting on YouTube 61% of you still use Google more while 39% use chat GPT more over on Twitter 45% go with Google while 54% prefer chat jpt and on LinkedIn 59% of you use chat jpt more often Google's usage seems to have dropped to about 41% here's the main point across all these platforms a lot of people are using chat GPT very often sometimes even more than Google this could be a big reason why so many websites have seen their traffic drop since January of 2023 if people are getting answers directly from chat jpt they may not need to click through to websites as often and that brings us to an interesting question does this mean blogin is dead if people can get their answers so easily from chat GPT why bother with the whole process of writing articles or blog posts but here's something to think about AI tools like chat jpt learn by reading lots of text if you stop writing blogs what will they learn from how will they know about new things happening in the world so what do you think will blocks disappear or is there a new way of websites and AI to work together I want to hear your ideas so let's talk about it in the comments if you like this video please give it a like And subscribe for more videos about tech
