feeling lost in tutorial hell you're not alone I used to do that when learning jazz piano constantly bouncing between tutorials without learning the foundations tutorials are great for a quick concept I make a lot of them as well but here's the problem most people get stuck bouncing between them never building real skills you learn bits and pieces cool tricks but struggle to see the big picture how to apply it to solve real problems sure you can follow someone building a project and just type along but you're not building those critical problem solving skills you're not learning the whats the wise and the house you're just following someone else if you want to build real skills that get you hired find a well structured course start and finish it whether you take my courses or other people's it doesn't matter take a good course and actually finish it do the exercises and build those critical problem solving skills you'll be amazed at the progress follow me for more useful coding advice
