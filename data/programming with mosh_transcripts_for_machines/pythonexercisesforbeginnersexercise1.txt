Alright! Time for an exercise. I want you to write a program to display the even numbers between 1 to 10. So when you run this program you should see 2 4 6 and 8 and after these I want you to print this message we have 4 even numbers now here is a quick hint before you get started you should call the range function with 1 and 10 do not use the third argument which is called step so basically I want you to iterate over all the numbers we can want to tab check if each number is an even number and then print it on the terminal so pause the video spend two minutes on this exercise when you're done come back continue watching so we started with a four loop for a number in range one to ten we check to see if the remainder of division of this number by two equals zero so if number modulus 2 equals zero then we print this number now let's run this program so we get two four six eight beautiful now to count the even numbers we need a separate variable so let's call that count initially we set it to zero now in this if block every time we find an even number we need to increment count so we set count plus equals one and finally after our for loop we can print a formatted string we have count even numbers let's run the program and here's the result hi guys thank you for watching this tutorial my name is muhammad ani and i have tons of tutorials like this for you on my channel so be sure to subscribe and also please like and share this video if you want to learn Python properly from scratch with depth I have a comprehensive python tutorial for you the link is below this video so click the link to get started thank you and have a fantastic day
