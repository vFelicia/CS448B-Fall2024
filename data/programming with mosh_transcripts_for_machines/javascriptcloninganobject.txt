in the last lecture you learn how to enumerate the properties of an object now using this technique we can get all the properties in an object and copy them into another object so let's say we want to create another circle object which is a copy of the circle object here I'm gonna call that another so constant another initially we set it to an empty object now we can use the for in loop to iterate over all the properties in this object and copy them into this new object so for let key in circle now we use the bracket notation to access a property with the given key so we said another of key to circle of key so basically here in the first iteration key will be radius so this code will be equivalent to this another of radius so we're setting the radius property of another object to circle of radius now here on the right side of the assignment operator we are reading the radius property of the circle the value of this property is one so we'll get one and put it in the radius property of the another object okay now let's log another on the console save the changes so here we have this radius property is set to one and here's our draw method so if we call another draw everything works as we expect beautiful but this approach for copying or cloning an object is a little bit old in modern JavaScript we have better ways to achieve the same thing one way is to use the object assign method let me show you so I'm gonna comment out these few lines we have this object that you have seen before this object has a method called assign now here as the first argument we can pass a target object which can be an empty object or an existing object you will see the difference in a second and then we can pass one or more so objects let's say circle what this method does is that it takes all the properties and methods in the source object and then copies them into this new object and finally returns the result here so this line of code is exactly equivalent to these three lines if we save the changes we get the exact same result now this target object that we pass here it doesn't have to be an empty object it can be an existing object it can have one or more properties or methods so as an example let's add a color property here we set that to yellow now save the changes so this new object has the color property that we initially had here as well as the members of the circle object so this is the object the design method now let me revert this back to an empty object I'm going to show you yet another simpler and more elegant way to clone an object we can use this spread operator so another here we set this to a new object and then use this spread operator which is three dots to spread this circle object basically what this operator does is that it takes all the properties and methods and this object and puts them here in between these curly braces so this is the simplest way to clone an object save the changes again we get the exact same circle object as before so here's what I want you to take away object of the sign copies the properties and methods from one or more sources into a target object and we can use that to clone an object or combine multiple objects into a single object and the spread operator is used to spread an object which basically means getting all these properties and methods and putting them into another object hi guys thank you for watching my javascript tutorial this tutorial is part of my JavaScript course where you learn all the essential JavaScript features that every web and mobile application developer must know if you're an absolute beginner or have some experience in JavaScript and are looking for a fun and indepth course that teaches you the fundamentals of JavaScript this course is for you this course is also packed with tons of exercises that help you master what you learned in the course in fact many of these exercises are questions that come up in technical programming interviews so if you're pursuing a job as a frontend or a backend developer or if you simply want to have a more indepth understanding of JavaScript I highly encourage you to enroll in the course for a limited time you can get this course with a discount using the link in the video description click the link to find out more about the course and enroll
