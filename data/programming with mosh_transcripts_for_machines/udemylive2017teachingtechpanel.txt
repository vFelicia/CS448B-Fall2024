hello everybody my name is madani I teach mostly c.net courses as.net and the framework and some angular courses I started 3 years ago but I knew about you didn't be long before in fact my inspiration was Mark lass off if I pronounce his last name properly I don't think he's here um one day I came to his page on Facebook and I saw he has he had like 5,000 students and the price of his course was like $100 and I said wow this guy is making million dollars with with just one course and I didn't know all these courses are sold at $10 or $20 so I wanted to do that for a long time but um working fulltime as a software engineer it was really hard when I came home it was I had no energy to pruc of course until I decided to quit my job and uh decided not to look for a new new job and created my first un course so I spent about 3 weeks to create one hour of content hardly made $0000 maybe $50 and then I created another course for 6 hours which took me about six weeks of production and that was one of the on demand courses in un Miss Hot Topic list and that course also didn't sell it was like $100 at the best and then I looked for a new job and they said okay you're going to start 3 weeks and I thought okay what am I what am I going to do in those three weeks I don't want to sit at home watch TV so I ended up creating my third course uh that was my C Advanced course and I started to earn about $1,000 a month and I thought okay this is working all I all my expectation was about 500 extra cash a month nothing more I wasn't like I want to become a millionaire on you that no just wanted $500 extra and I order to reach my goal and then I discovered my passion for teaching and I never really looked for making money on this platform was just getting feedback from my students about what they wanted to learn from me and I created lots of courses and then they organically grew in terms of funny story they wanted me to share I used to live in Melbourne Australia and I I just moved to LA about 2 months ago and one night I was out salsa dancing and people in this crowd would do a bit of Latin dancing they know the etiquette so you dance with one person they say thank you and then you move on to the next person so after I finished dancing with a lady a guy tapped me on the shoulder like he wanted to ask me for a dance and he said are you m hamadani and I looked different there because I was wearing a hat different look from what you see in my videos and I said yeah he said I'm one of your students I've taken a lot of your courses so he was the first student that I ever met in person I think the last two that I ever met did you dance with no it l yeah so in in my courses in every section at the end of the section I have a practice which is a coding exercise not a quiz not question and answer it's a coding exercise they have to build something and it's something that they can do in 30 minutes not something that they're going to spend two days three days and then become disappointed sorry and then I also showed the solution myself how I start that project check how I'm thinking throughout this journey how I change my code how I refactor it and make it better give them some tips along the way like some shortcuts to write code faster uh something more than just giving them the solution I I show them the house and wise um and then I also upload the code to GitHub some people love GitHub the others don't like it they like attachments as zip fi so I I try to cater for different kinds of audiences how many of those exercises do you typically include in your horses how how many so each course I have on average has about 10 to 15 sections so one exercise at least a section sometimes two in fact U I've asked my students in my surveys uh what do you think about my teaching what do you think I can improve and I still get a lot of feedback we need more exercises even though sometimes I include two exercise per section they want more how do you stay on top of that sorry how do you stay on top of all of the exercises it's really hard um because um I have limited time just like everyone else throughout the day and part of me wants to create more content for those people who are hungry for learning more but at the same time I have to slow down and um yeah create more exercises for people who need a little more Health yeah YouTube I had zero subscribers I started there just like everyone else and I never thought I could have 70,000 subscribers but I got it pretty quickly um all you have to do is upload really good quality videos don't be greedy thinking oh no I want to keep the good quality ones for my course and just show an introduction for two minutes it's like an advertisement people are not going to get your course share as much content as you want be as you can be generous uh like my YouTube videos are about 1 hour sometimes one and a half hour and they can learn a lot from that they don't have to come and en roll my course but those who are more passionate they're more dedicated to learn I put a link in the video description and I give them a coupon uh in terms of um something I wanted to add for to previous question when I want to publish a course I almost announce on YouTube about two months before say hey in a month or two months uh I'm going to publish this course so I give them heads up and a lot of people start to get excited about that then when it gets closer about the week before I send another announcement sometimes it's a short simp video that I take with my phone and then when the course is released I send the coupons and I say this is valid for 3 4 days uh and then after I take these videos off my YouTube channel because I don't like it to look salesy it's just for a special location this is actually very good question Cu uh both Max and I recreated our course from scratch just because of an update for SC so I feel your pain um sometimes if there are dramatic changes you really have to create a course from scratch because in my case I tried to patch the course and that didn't work I tried to add supplementary videos in between and also some PDFs attach them to specific lectures saying these are the syntactical changes some people loved it they said that's perfect there were a lot of people who complained and that's why I ended up recreating the course from scratch um so honestly I don't have a specific formula that works for everyone but these are the things I played with and you can try them on your own so options are patching the videos or adding supplementary materials but in forms of PDF or video or recreating the course from scratch hopefully that won't happen
