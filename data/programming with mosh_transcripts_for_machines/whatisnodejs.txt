no js' or note is an open source and crossplatform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser quite often we use no to build backend services also called api's or application programming interfaces these are the services that power our client applications like a web app running inside of a web browser or mobile app running on a mobile device these client apps are simply what the user sees and interacts with they're just the surface they need to talk to some services sitting on the server or in the cloud to store data send emails or push notifications kick off workflows and so on node is ideal for building highly scalable data intensive and realtime backend services that power our client applications now you might ask but mosh there are other tools and frameworks out there for building backend services such as a speed a bed rails Django and so on so what's so special about no well note is easy to get started and can be used for prototyping and agile development but it can also be used for building super fast and highly scalable services it's used in production by large companies such as PayPal uber Netflix Walmart and so on in fact at PayPal that rebuilt one of their Java and spring based applications using node and it found that the node application was built twice as fast with fewer people in 33% fewer lines of code and 40% fewer files and more importantly they double the number of requests served per second while decreasing the average response time by 35% so node is an excellent choice for building highly scalable services another reason for using note is that in node applications we use JavaScript so if you're a frontend developer and know JavaScript you can reuse your JavaScript skills and a fullstack developer and get a better job with better pay you don't have to learn a new programming language also because you can use JavaScript both on the front end and on the back end your source code will be cleaner and more consistent so you will use the same naming conventions the same tools and the same best practices and finally another reason for using node is that it has the largest ecosystem of open source libraries available to you so for pretty much any features or building blocks you want to add your application there is some free open source library out there that you can use so you don't have to build this building blocks from scratch and instead you can focus on the core of your application next we're going to look at the architecture of node hi guys it's maj here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete node course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
