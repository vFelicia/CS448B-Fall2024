in the category of reference types you have learned about objects and arrays now let's take a look at functions functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript a function is basically a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value let me show you a couple of examples so I'm going to declare a function using the function keyword now we need to give it a name let's call that greet after that we need to add parentheses that's part of the syntax for declaring functions and then curly braces now what we have here inside the curly braces is what we refer to as the body of this function and this is where we add all these statements to define some kind of logic in our application for example the logic for this function should be to display a message on the console so here we can add console the log hello world now note that here we have a statement so we terminated with a semicolon but when we are declaring a function we don't need to add semicolon at the end because we are not declaring it like a variable like this okay this is a function declaration right so now we have a function we can call this function like this so we add the name of the function and parentheses again and then semicolon to indicate that this is a statement save the changes now we have hello world on the console but that's pretty boring what would we do this let me show you how to make this more interesting our functions can have inputs and these inputs can change how the function behaves so let's say instead of displaying hello world we want to display the name of the person here like hello John so we can add a variable here in between parentheses we refer to this variable as a parameter so this greet function has one parameter called name and essentially name is like a variable that is only meaningful inside dysfunction so inside of this function we can work with this name variable but it will not be accessible outside of this function the name is an input to this function so instead of displaying hello world we can display hello then add a plus here to concatenate two strings so we can add name after now when calling the great function we need to pass a value for the name variable or name parameter more accurately so we can pass John here now we refer to this as an argument so John is an argument to the greet function a name is a parameter of the greet function it's one of the things that a lot of programmers don't know they don't know the difference between a parameter and an argument so a parameter is what we have here at the time of declaration but the argument is the actual value with supply for that parameter okay now let's save the changes so we have hello John now we can reuse this function but with a different input so we can copy this line here and change on to Mary save the changes now we have two different messages on the console now a function can have multiple parameters so here we can separate parameters using a comma so let's add another parameter like last name now we can change our console not blog add a space here and then display the last name now when calling this greet function we should pass another argument for the last name right but let's see what happens if we don't do this so I'm gonna save the changes see what we got hello John undefined because as I told you before the default value of variables in JavaScript is undefined so because we did not pass a value for the last name by default it's undefined so I'm gonna pass another argument here we separate them using a comma John Smith and we don't need the second call to the greet function save the changes now we have hello John Smith hi guys thank you for watching my javascript tutorial this tutorial is part of my JavaScript course where you learn all the essential JavaScript features that every web and mobile application developer must know if you're an absolute beginner or have some experience in JavaScript and are looking for a fun and indepth course that teaches you the fundamentals of JavaScript this course is for you this course is also packed with tons of exercises that help you master what you learned in the course in fact many of these exercises are questions that come up in technical programming interviews so if you're pursuing a job as a frontend or a backend developer or if you simply want to have a more indepth understanding of JavaScript I highly encourage you to enroll in the course for a limited time you can get this course with a discount using the link in the video description click the link to find out more about the course and enroll
