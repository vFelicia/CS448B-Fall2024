one question that often comes up is what's the difference between angularjs angular 2 and angular for and how did we jump from angular 2 to angular 4 well angularjs was introduced in 2010 as a JavaScript framework for building client applications soon it gained popularity an angular team started adding new features to the core but the framework was not designed with the needs of today's applications in mind plus it was overly complex so angular team decided to rewrite the original framework using typescript and as a result angular 2 came out in mid 2016 this new version is entirely different from angular 1 to the extent that you can think of it as a completely different framework now this made a lot of developers unhappy because they had a lot of applications built with angular 1 with each application over a few thousand lines of code that had to be rewritten but overall I personally like the direction that angular team took and how they rebuilt angular with typescript this is a much better framework it's a lot cleaner and it's a lot easier to understand and to work with now after a few minor upgrades to angular 2 something strange happened we were up to angular 2.3 and then all of a sudden and your 4 came out so a lot of developers including myself wondered what happened to angular 3 we thought we made something really big here but unlike angular 2 angular 4 was not a new framework with a lot of breaking changes in fact it wasn't even a major upgrade so let me explain what happened angular consists of a few different libraries that are distributed as separate node packages via NPM for example we have the core library that we use in every application we have angular compiler we have angular HTTP for calling HTTP services we have angular router for adding navigation to applications and a few other libraries now all these libraries were version the same except the router library so in order to align these versions and avoid confusion in the future angular team decided to go straight to angular version 4 so in a sense angular 4 is not a major upgrade to angular 2 and you can think of it as angular 2.4 as simple as that now after all this confusion in the community about angular versions the team decided to drop the version suffix and simply call the framework angular so now we have two kinds of angular we have angularjs which is the first generation of angular written in JavaScript and it's going to die sooner or later and we also have angular which refers to angular 2 or later in our discussions in our articles and whenever we want to talk about angular 2 or later we should really use the word angular like I'm gonna angular developer instead of I'm gonna angular 2 developer or I'm an angular 4 developer C it's really weird we should use versions only when we need to talk about a specific release for example when we want to upgrade angular 4 to angular 5 then everybody knows what is the scope of this upgrade and what are the potential breaking changes that can impact an application so this is all about angular version history hi thank you for watching my angular tutorial if you enjoyed this video please like it and share it with others also you can subscribe to my channel for free new videos every week this video is part of my complete angular course with almost 30 hours of high quality content where you learn everything about angular from the basic to the advanced topics all in one course so you don't have to jump from one tutorial to another in case you're interested you can get this course with a big discount using the link in the video description and if not that's perfectly fine continue watching as the next section is coming up
