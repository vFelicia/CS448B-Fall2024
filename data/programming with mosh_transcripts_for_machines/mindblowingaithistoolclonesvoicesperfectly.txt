just a few days ago open AI That's the company behind chat GPD revealed a groundbreaking new technology called voice engine let's break down what it is what it can do and what are some potential dangers so voice engine is a new AI model that can clone anyone's Voice using a 15second audio sample so you give it a 15second sample and some text and it will generate Supernatural speech that closely resembles the original speaker let's hear an example here's the original voice force is a push or pull that can make an object move stop or change direction now listen to the version created with a voice engine some of the most amazing habitats on Earth are found in the rainforest a rainforest is a place with a lot of precipitation pretty mindblowing right but why is this such big news let's break it down well first of all voice engine isn't the only text to speech tool out there many tools EX exist for this purpose some of them use AI While others use more traditional methods but the reason voice engine stands out is that it can generate incredibly realistic speech capturing Nuance language and accents using only a 15sec sample in contrast play. HD requires a 1hour audio sample to do the same job and I don't know if the quality is as good so voice engine is pretty cool and it has many potential uses it could help patients who have lost their voice due to illness or injury for example take this young patient who lost her speech due to a brain tumor hi everyone this is what my voice sounds like losing open now listen to how she sounded in the past when you have all of your ingredients together you are going to put the chopped broccoli and chopped banana peppers inside the bowl so they gave the sample to voice engine and here's what's generated hi everyone this is what my voice sounds like using open ai's new text to speech model called voice engine voice engine can also allow businesses and creators to translate content and reach more people around the world using their own voice for example here's another reference audio friendship is a Universal Treasure it brings joy support and laughter into our lives no matter where we are in the world now with voice engine we can generate the same speech with the same voice but in different languages like Spanish Mandarin German and so on let's listen to a few generated samples it's really really cool now in the future you could potentially have your favorite celebrity read you a bedtime story imagine getting Morgan Freeman to narrate your favorite book it opens up a whole new personalized experience but as with any amazing new technology there's always a downside imagine someone cloning your voice or the voice of a politician and making them say awful things with elections coming up this Tech could be a weapon for spreading fake news and damaging reputations that's why open AI is taking extreme precautions right now voice engine isn't open to the public only a small group of trusted Partners can use it and they absolutely need permission from the original speaker to avoid misuse plus they're adding hidden watermarks to the audio so if someone tries to do something Shady it can be traced back to them so we all have to start thinking about how such Technologies impact Our Lives how do we know what's real and what's fake when voices can be perfectly imitated should there be laws to protect us from people using our voice without our permission these are conversations we need to have and we need to have them now so what's your take is the future of voice technology exciting scary or a little bit of both let's get a discussion going in the comments below if you found this video interesting please give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more takech updates thanks for watching
