across web development is very competitive if you're starting out you might face some difficulty getting your first job it's usually the first job that is hardest to get because your portfolio is empty but as you add more projects to your portfolio and get more skilled getting jobs will become easier as well now don't let that discourage you it's estimated that there are almost 24 million developers around the world if these people could get a job so can you you just have to be determined also you should know that web development is a fastpaced industry so you often have to learn new things new languages new tools new ways of doing things if you're passionate about learning it won't be a problem at all but if you want to learn something simple and do it over and over for the rest of your life well you're just going to have fewer job opportunities and one more thing web development and programming in general requires sitting for long hours in front of a computer if you find that boring and you would rather socialize with people well programming is not for you i'm just being honest with you now do you need a degree well it depends companies like apple and google don't care about your degree as long as you can demonstrate that you have the required skills i have a master's degree plus a bunch of microsoft certifications but none of my previous employers ever asked me for those papers but there are other companies out there that require you to have a degree in computer science or software engineering in my opinion a good employer should care about your skills and knowledge and not a piece of paper so in reality yes there are companies that require you to have a degree but there are many other companies that don't care about your degree as long as you can demonstrate your skills okay now let's talk about what you need to learn to become a web developer well first you need to decide what kind of web development you want to do every website has two parts a front end and a back end the front end is the part that you see in your browser and interact with all the visual aspects the backend is the part that powers the front hand it's behind the scenes and is mainly about storing data in databases and providing it to the front end so web development jobs fall into three main categories frontend development backend development and fullstack development which involves both frontend and backend development if you're starting out you should just focus on frontend or backend fullstack development is something you want to consider after you've been in the industry for at least a year or two now what is easier frontend or backend development well it really depends who you ask some people find frontend development pretty straightforward whereas other people are more comfortable with backend development as part of this series i'm going to give you exposure to both these areas of web development so you can decide what resonates best with you in the next two episodes we're going to talk about the specific skills you need to know to become a frontend or a backend developer if you found the information in this video valuable please give it a like
