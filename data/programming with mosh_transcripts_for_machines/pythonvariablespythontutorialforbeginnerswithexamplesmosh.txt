let's start this section by a discussion of variables which are one of the core concepts in programming we use variables to store data in computer's memory here are a few examples I'm going to define a variable called students under line count and setting it to a thousand when we run this program python interpreter will allocate some memory and store this number thousand in that memory space then it will have this variable reference that memory location so this variable is just like a label for that memory location we can use this variable or this label anywhere in our program to get access to that memory location and the data is stored there so now if we print students count and run our program we will get the number of thousand so this is the basic of variables now what kind of data can be a store in computer's memory well we have several different kinds of data in this section we're going to look at the builtin primitive types in Python primitive types can be numbers boolean and strings let me show you so here we have a whole number we refer to this as an integer in programming we can also have numbers with a decimal point let's take a look so rating we set this to four point nine nine this is what we call a float or a floatingpoint number and this terminology is not specific to Python in the future when you learn a new programming language you're going to hear these terms again now let's take a look at an example of a boolean is published we set this to true or false these are examples of boolean values in programming so boolean values can either be true or false and these are exactly like yes and no in English later in the course you will learn that will use these boolean values to make decisions in our programs for example if the user is an admin user perhaps we want to give them extra permissions so these are the boolean values now take into account that Python is a case sensitive language which means lower case and upper case characters have different meanings so boolean values should always start with a capital letter like what you see here if we type false or false these are not accepted boolean values in Python only what you see here is a valid boolean value so false or true and finally let's take a look at an example of a string so course under line name we set this to your string like Python programming so string as I told you before is like text whenever you want to work with text in your programs you need to surround your text with quotes so these are the basics of variables so these are the variables from the last lecture now I've got a question for you there are four things that have consistently used in this program can you spot them if you want you can pause the video think about this for a few seconds and then continue watching so here are those four things the first thing is that all my variable names are descriptive and meaningful so students count represents the number of students for a course or course name clearly explains that this variable holds the name of a course one of the issues that I see a lot amongst beginner programmers is that they use mystical names for their variables something like this see n as in short for course name when someone else reads this code they have no idea what CN stands for or they use variable names like c1 when I look at that code I wonder where you see two and what is the difference between c1 and c2 so these variable names are very mystical that's a bad practice make sure your variable names are always descriptive and meaningful because this makes your code more maintainable now there are times that you can use short variable names like X Y Z if you're dealing with things like coordinates so that's an exception now the second thing that I have consistently used in this code is that I have used lowercase letters to name my variables so here we don't have course name all in capital or in title case all letters are lowercase right let's delete this the third thing that I've consistently used here is that I have used an underscore to separate multiple words and I've done this to make my variable names more readable because in Python we cannot have a space in variable names so we cannot have course name and if you put these two words together it's a little bit hard to read that's why we use an underscore and the fourth thing that I have used consistently here is that I have put a space around this equal sign again that's one of the issues I see a lot amongst beginners they write code like this this is a little bit ugly this is what we call dirty code dirty stinky smelly you should write code that is clean and beautiful so other people can read it like a story like a newspaper are you should be formatted properly and that's why we have Pep 8 in Python now the good thing is if you forget these rules when you save the changes auto pay paid kicks in I didn't automatically reformat your code but that aside you should always give yourself the habit of writing clean code without relying too much on the tooling so these are all the best practices about naming your variables next we're going to look at strings in more detail
