hey guys Smosh here I'm super excited to announce that the second part of my data structures and algorithms series is out in the first part we talked about the linear data structures such as arrays link lists stacks queues and hash tables in this part we're going to talk about the nonlinear data structures so you're gonna learn all about binary trees AVL trees heaps tries and graphs this series is packed with tons of interview questions and stepbystep solutions it's a must for anyone who is preparing for a coding interview or anyone who wants to become a better programmer because it teaches you problemsolving skills it teaches you how to design fast and scalable algorithms had tons of requests for this course because data structures is one of the topics that comes up in job interviews quite a lot especially if you're looking for a job at big companies like Microsoft Google and Amazon these companies always ask you questions about data structures and algorithms to see if you can think like a programmer they don't care how many programming languages or frameworks you're familiar with if you can build a website or an app but cannot solve a basic computer science problem you're gonna fail and that's exactly why I created this course for you to help your master is very important topic every single exercise an example you see in this course is a popular interview question I'm super excited about this course and I wish when I was learning this topic back at school we had a course like this because most data structure books and courses out there are super pouring and dry plus the code you see in this books look disgusting you see a lot of mysterious variables like n K a and B and you have no idea how these algorithms work in this course not only will you learn everything about data structures on algorithms but you will also learn how to implement these algorithms with beautiful code the color code that can be read like your story you will see how I start with a simple solution then refactor my code and make it better and more expressive this course is a must for any computer science students whose lecture failed to explain these topics as well as people who want to get a software development job at a good company or I would say anyone who simply wants to become a better developer because these algorithms we have covered in this course train your programming brain they change how you think about programming so if you're interested in this course you can get it on my coding school code with mass comm this course just got launched and the first 200 students can get it with a discount if you're interested click the link below this video thank you and have a fantastic day
