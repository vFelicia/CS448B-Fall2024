to become a mobile app developer there are five essential skills let's go over them one by one there are basically two ways to build mobile apps native or crossplatform with Native development we can build an app that runs only on a particular platform like iOS or Android this approach gives us full control over the capabilities of the target platform resulting in great performance and the best user experience however the downside is that if you want to build the same app for a different platform you have to create a separate project in an entirely different language and ecosystem this means two separate projects and two sets of bugs to fix that's where crossplatform or multiplatform development comes to the rescue with crossplatform development we can reduce development Time by reusing the same code for different platforms and potentially reduce bugs fixing a bug once means it's fixed across multiple platforms check out my full video link in the description
