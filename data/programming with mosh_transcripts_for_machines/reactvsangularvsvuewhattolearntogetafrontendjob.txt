Are you wondering what JavaScript framework or library you should learn to land a job in 2019? Let me help you out. In this fiveminute video, I'm gonna quickly compare the top three JavaScript frameworks, we're gonna look at their history, their job market, their learning curve and then I'm gonna tell you what framework to learn to get a frontend or full stack development job in 2019. First let me get the terminology clear what is the difference between a library and a framework some developers use these terms interchangeably but they're actually different a library is a collection of reusable code that is used to solve common problems there are various libraries out there for solving different types of problems for example we have libraries for performing mathematical calculations we have libraries for machine learning and so on react is a library for building interactive user interfaces if framework on the other hand gives us a lot of reusable code just like a library but it also provides a structure or a skeleton for building applications so when using a framework we have to build our application according to that framework frameworks have opinions in terms of how we should structure our application how the application should get started how various components should interact with each other and so on angular and view are both examples of popular frameworks for building frontend applications now one of the questions I get a lot is Masch why do we have to use a framework or a library to build an application can we just use plain old JavaScript the answer is yes we certainly can it's a waste of time here is the reason imagine you want to build a desk would you buy pieces of wood and put them together or would you go to the forest and cut the trees first there is no reason to cut the trees when there are already pieces of wood ready for us to reuse we use frameworks and libraries to increase our productivity and speed up the development process there is a lot of code that is tested and is ready for us to reuse so this is all about libraries and frameworks now react angular and view are the top three tools for building applications these days but which one is better let's find out look at the results of this deck overflow developer server in 2019 that just came out here's the list of the most loved web frameworks and the winner is react it is closely followed by view this year and angular seems to be losing its popularity compared to previous years if you look at Google Trends you can see that react is the most popular library out of the three now let's have a quick look at the history of these frameworks angular is the oldest of the three it's developed by Google and was initially released in 2010 until 2016 it used to be called angularjs in 2016 angular team released angular 2 which was a complete rewrite of angularjs in fact it had nothing in common with the previous version of angular it was a completely new framework so to reduce confusion angular team decided to drop the jas from the original name and they called the new framework angular this made a lot of developers unhappy any applications that were built with angularjs had to be rebuilt with angular also over the last three years there have been several releases of angular and we have experienced several breaking changes as an online instructor this made me very unhappy because my angular course got outdated pretty quickly and I had to do a lot of patches to the course and at some point I ended up recreating the entire course from scratch but it came soon after the course got out beta react is developed and maintained by Facebook and it's been around since 2013 currently it's at version 16 and is being used by Facebook Twitter Netflix PayPal and uber to name a few it has a huge community which means somebody out there has already solved the problems you may encounter so there are tons of thirdparty libraries packages tools extensions as well as tutorials and courses view or view Jas is the youngest kid in town unlike angular and react view isn't developed by a big corporation it was originally developed by an exgoogler employee in 2014 and now it's maintained by a group of passionate developers even though it's a new framework it has gained a lot of popularity over the past two years now what about the job market well this really depends on where you are located so wherever you are look at the number of jobs advertised and the most popular job seeking website here is the number of jobs advertised on indeed.com in the US right now in April 2019 they are roughly about fifty nine thousand react jobs followed by fourteen thousand angular jobs and three thousand view jobs based on the popularity of react I would say that you would probably see the same pattern in other countries in the world but that's just my guess so if you're looking for a job in the u.s. react is definitely the way to go now what about the learning curve well angular has always been famous for having a steep learning curve because it's a fullblown framework or a complete solution in contrast because react is just a library and not a complete solution it has fewer concepts that you need to learn and understand I would say learning view requires roughly the same amount of time and effort it's definitely easier to learn than angular some argue that it's even easier than react but it's very subjective so if you're starting out I would say start with react because it's definitely easier to learn than angular and it gives you tons more job opportunities once you learn react if you want to expand your career options or if you're just curious you can learn view transitioning from reactive view is fairly easy and I personally think that going forward we're gonna see more job opportunities for view in 2019 and 2020 another benefit of learning react is that you can quickly learn react native to build mobile apps react native is the king of crossplatform development so again you will have plenty more job opportunities ahead of you so if you're looking for a job as a frontend or a fullstack developer invest your time and energy in react now how do you learn react I have a comprehensive our tutorial on my channel you can see it over here I've also put the link down below this tutorial walks you through all the core concepts and react even though I made it last year in 2018 it's still valid and up to date because react is a stable library and you won't encounter breaking changes Facebook takes the stability of react seriously so watch this tutorial first but if you want to master react I had a complete course for you that is 12 hours long it goes far beyond my youtube tutorial and touches on concepts such as Bill complex user interfaces routing and navigation calling back and api's authentication and authorization handling and login errors and deployment pretty much all the concepts involved in building real applications in this course you will learn how to build a real video rental application with a node backend this is an online video course just like my youtube tutorial and you can watch it anytime anywhere as many times as you want you will also receive a certificate of completion at the end that you can add to your resume we even offer a 30day moneyback guarantee if you're
