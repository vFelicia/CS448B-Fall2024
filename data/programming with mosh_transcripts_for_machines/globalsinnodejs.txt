so in the last section we use this console that log function to lock something on the console now this console object is what we call a global object so it's part of the global scope which means we can access it anywhere in any files we have a bunch of other objects and functions that are also globally available in node for example we have set timeout which you have probably seen before we use this to call a function after a delay like one second two second whatever so this is just part of the standard JavaScript we can use this on the client we can use this inside of a browser or inside of node we also have clear timeout similarly we have set interval which we use to repeatedly call a function after a given delay we also have clear interval which we use to stop that function from being called repeatedly so these are the global objects in JavaScript now he node we have a couple other global objects that you're going to learn about later in this section now in browsers we have this window object that represents our global scope so all the variables and functions that are defined globally we can access them via this window object so we can call window that console dot log or simply just console dot lock the JavaScript engine will prefix this statement with window dot console dot lock because that's where this object is defined similarly all these other functions you see here they belong to the window object so we can call window dot set timeout or call it directly by the same token when we declare a variable let's say message that variable is also available via the window object okay however in the last section I told you that in node we don't have this window object instead we have another object called global so all these functions and objects we have here we can access them by the global object so we can do global that console dot log or global that set timeout and so on of course it's easier to use the shorthand instead of prefix in them with this global but one thing you need to know about note is that these variables that we define here they are not added to the global object in other words if we do a console dot log of global that message we are going to see undefined on the console so let me show you I'm going to delete all the code here now back in the terminal let's run node app is so we get undefined in the console so as you can see the variables and functions that we defined here they are not added to the global object they're only scoped to this fire app dot j s so they are not available outside of this file and this is because note modular system that you're going to learn about in the next lecture hi guys it's mash here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete note course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion then you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
