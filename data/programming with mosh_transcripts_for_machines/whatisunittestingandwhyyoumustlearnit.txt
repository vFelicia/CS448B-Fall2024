what is unit testing and why is it often listed in job descriptions unit testing is a type of automated testing where we write code to test a small unit of our application that small unit can be a function a module or a component we have other types of automated tests like integration tests where we test multiple units together and end2end tests where we test our entire application like a real user but in an automated fashion so with automated testing our code base consists of two types of code the application code also called the production code as well as the test code or simply tests with these tests in place every time we make changes to our application or before we are ready to deploy it we can run hundreds or thousands of tests in seconds or a few minutes to find out if all the features are working as expected this is much faster than manually testing every feature every time you update our code or or we are ready to ship our software plus it helps us catch bugs early change or refactor our code with confidence and honestly sleep better at night because knowing our application is well tested brings a whole new level of peace of mind that's why big tech companies like Google Amazon meta and many other companies that ship Rock Solid applications rely heavily on automated testing and that's why they pay big bucks for developers who know automated testing so so if you want to stand out from an average developer and land a better job you must learn this critical skill if you want to see unit testing in action I have a few tutorials for you here on this channel click the links in the description box and start learning and also make sure to subscribe for more videos like this
