hi my name is Mohammad Ani and I've taught over three million people how to code or how to become a top professional software engineer and here's my story yep that's me a typical day in college studying for my master's degree in software engineering pretty impressive right I was bored with so much theory and irrelevant subjects when I started working I realized that only 20% of what I learned was actually useful the other 80% was a complete waste of time and money so that's six ten years or twenty three hundred days or eleven thousand hours that I will never get back that's why I started code with mush to help you get your dream coding job and make more money by teaching you what I have learned over the past 18 years forget spending yours in a classroom blowing money on books and learning things are never gonna use you can learn coding right from your own home you ma should I throw out this calculus book please about this physics book that one too and uh biology what does boil is you have to do with programming these are the subjects that colleges make you pay for and you will never use at code midmarch comm we teach you the actual skills you will need to become a top professional software engineer the kind of engineer that companies love to hire you have online courses on web and mobile app development for people at all coding levels if you're tired of instructors that overexplain copy paste code sound like a robot and are boring as hell you're gonna love my courses they're all clear and concise and based on realworld examples no fubar buzz nonsense here all courses come with a 30day moneyback guarantee and a certificate of completion all of that for a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of what you pay for college here are a few reviews from some of my happiest customers here is Vahid he had trouble passing technical interviews but after taking my courses he could answer every single question in these interviews here's Anna after taking my courses she became a certified web developer and now she's working at a fantastic startup here's Daanish he used to be a security guard but after taking my courses he got his first job as a software developer and here is Quran he has been winning code competitions in India and extending his work every single day you can't be one of these people I strongly believe in you so head over to code with Marsh calm and subscribe now to get unlimited access to all the questions you will need to become a top professional and software engineer hey Marsh look at chemistry book voice and EFI began by week Messiah for Billy's beautimous dive in and quarter
