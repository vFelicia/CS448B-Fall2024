one of the questions that often comes in programming interviews is the fizzbuzz algorithm you might be surprised that there are a lot of developers out there with even years of experience but they don't know how to solve this simple programming problem that's why I decided to include this in my course so let's see how this algorithm works and then you can spend 10 to 15 minutes on this exercise on your own so here we have a function fizz buzz that takes on input and depending on the input we give it it returns different results here are the rules if the input that we give it is divisible by 3 it will return the string fizz let me show you so we run this program we get Fitz if the input is divisible by 5 it will return Buzz take a look here's buzz now the third rule if the input is divisible by both 3 & 5 it will return fizzbuzz so let's pass 15 here we'll get fizzbuzz for any other numbers it will return the same input so if I pass 7 it's not divisible by 3 or 5 it will return 7 itself so spend 10 to 15 minutes on this exercise you will see my solution next all right let's see how we can solve this problem so we get the input and check to see if input is divisible by 3 then we can set a variable like result to phase now let me temporarily simplify these rules because I want to show you a really cool technique so let's imagine if the input is divisible by 3 we'll return fizz otherwise we'll return bus so LS we set the result to buzz and finally we'll return this result variable this is one way to implement these rules but it's not the best way there is a better and cleaner way let me show you so instead of defining this result variable and then returning it we can simply return this string here and also here and then we can get rid of line six so we remove one unnecessary line of code this was one technique the other technique I want to show you is when you have an if statement and in your if lock you're returning a value you don't really need an else clause because if this condition is evaluated to false the control moves to the else clause and all we are doing here is returning a different value so this is the only possible outcome so here we can remove this else clause and simply return bus so with this technique I remove an unnecessary indentation as well I've made our code more linear okay now let's go back to our original algorithm so if the input is divisible by three we'll return fizz now we check to see if the input is divisible by five will return bus so here we don't really need an Elif because if this condition is false we'll get here anyway so we can check if input is divisible by five we will return buzz once again if this condition is false the control moves here now we check the same if the input is divisible by three and it is also divisible by five then we will return fizz bus now this expression is a little bit long I would prefer to make it more readable by putting parentheses around the first and second parts like this that is cleaner now if this condition is also false the control moves here that means our number is not divisible by three or five so we should simply return the input once again we don't need an else or another if we simply return the input now let's run this program and see if it's working properly or not so we call our function with three and we get fizz beautiful let's call it with five we get Buzz perfect what if we call it with 15 we should get fizz bus however we get fees what is going on here the reason this happened was because when we pass 15 here line two is executed obviously 15 is divisible by three so that is why we immediately return fizz to solve this problem we need to move this condition which is more specific to the top so I've selected these two lines using alt + up I move these lines up beautiful all right now let's run the program one more time so we get fizzbuzz once again let's test it with three now we get fares let's test it with five when writing functions don't assume that your function is working make sure to test it with all different kinds of values let's test it but 5 we get Buzz beautiful what if you pass 7 which is not divisible by 3 or 5 we get 7 beautiful hi guys thank you for watching this tutorial my name is Mohammad Ani and I have tons of tutorials like this for you on my channel so be sure to subscribe and also please like and share this video if you want to learn Python properly from scratch with depth I have a comprehensive python tutorial for you the link is below this video so click the link to get started thank you and have a fantastic day
