JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and arguably the most hated due to its weird parts and chaotic ecosystem in JavaScript we can declare variables using the let keyword JavaScript is a dynamically typed language meaning the type of variables is determined at runtime in JavaScript we have two categories of data primitive types and reference types primitive types include strings numbers booleans null and undefined reference types are objects arrays and functions JavaScript has a lot of weird parts for example if you add two empty arrays we get an empty string if you add an empty array to an empty object we get the string object object but if you swap the order of operant we get zero and if you add two empty objects we get not a number what the hell in JavaScript we have arithmetic operators for computations comparison operators for comparing values two equality operators loose and straight you also have logical operators for logical operations and bitwise operators that nobody uses in JavaScript we have two ways to control the flow of our code if and else as well as switch and case similar to Java or C++ we have three types of Loops for repeating an action multiple times four Loops y loops and do wide Loops JavaScript doesn't have a standard library in a traditional sense like python or Java it has a few Global objects and functions that are always available like math date and Par in and a bunch of other other stuff that largely depends on where your code is running JavaScript code can run in a browser or on the server with no JS Doo or bun JavaScript has a gigantic ecosystem of packages libraries Frameworks and even meta Frameworks that come out every day by the time you learn a new framework it's already outdated and replaced by something newer and shinier for almost every problem there might be hundreds of packages claiming to be the perfect solution we can install these packages using package managers like like npm yarn pnpm and Bun JavaScript is constantly evolving and the latest features may not be supported by older browsers so we use transpilers to translate or convert modern JavaScript code into a format that can run in older environments the most common transpilers are Babel typescript and Tracer we use build tools also called bundlers to turn development code into production code build tools combine and compress our JavaScript code into one or more bundles that can be used in a browser the most common build tools are webpack parcel rollup and Es build and that was JavaScript in 2 minutes want to learn JavaScript check out my JavaScript tutorials on my YouTube channel
