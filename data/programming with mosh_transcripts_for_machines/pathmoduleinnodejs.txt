so in the last lecture I told you that in ode we have a few useful modules that are built into the core of node with these modules we can work with files with the operating system with a network and so on so let's have a quick look at this built in modules head over to node J s org then go to Docs on the left side go to version eight point nine point three that's the current stable release chances are by the time you're watching this video this version might be different so that doesn't really matter just pick that version now hearing the table of contents you can see the builtin modules of course not everything you see here is a module for example we have console which is our console object we have buffer which we're going to learn about in the future in this course again that's a global object but you can see that this is a fairly short list and some of the items in this list are built in modules in No so just that you can see there are not many modules built into node I'm gonna highlight a few very useful modules that you should be aware of for example we have file system to work with files we have HTTP that you're going to learn about later in this section so with this we can create web servers that listen for HTTP requests we have OS to work with the operating system we have path which gives us a bunch of utility functions for working with paths we have process that gives us information about the current process we have query strings which is very useful in building HTTP services we have a stream which allows us to work with streams of data again you're going to learn about this in the future and a bunch of other modules now in this lecture we're going to look at is past module so on the documentation you can see all the functions defined in this module we're going to use the parse method now if you scroll down you can see how you can use this module so I've seen the required function before we call the module using the require function get the result which is an object and store it in a constant so back in vs code in app Jas let's call require and as the argument use path now the argument that we gave to this require function no it assumes that this is a built in module if there is no built in module by the name specified here then node looks for the existence of a relative path to a file in this application so if we have period / or period period / whatever then node assumes that this is a file in this application now in this case we're going to load the building path module and store it in a constant called pass so this is an object with a bunch of useful methods the method we're going to use is the parse method so I'm gonna give it is underline underline file name which is one of the arguments and the module wrapper function that you saw in the last lecture so let's call this and store the result in pass object and then finally log it on the console has object now back in the terminal let's run this application this is the past object it has a few useful properties we have root we have D which specifies the path to the folder containing this file here's the name of the file after Jas here's the extension and here's the name of the file without the extension so if you want to work with paths it's much easier to use the path module as opposed to working with strings in the next lecture we're going to look at another builtin module that gives us information about the operating system hi guys its mosh here thank you for watching my know tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete note course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
