I see a lot of my students try to learn many unrelated programming languages at the same time they learn a bit of C++ while learning JavaScript and python look each of these languages has certain strengths and is often used for a specific kind of job in the tech world for example C++ is a powerful beast when it comes to building amazing games or controlling physical objects like SmartWatches selfdriving cars and all the cool gadgets on the other hand JavaScript is all about making websites interact Ive and dynamic so someone learning JavaScript and C++ at the same time is like someone trying to become a dentist and a heart surgeon at the same time let's be realistic if you only know bits of JavaScript and C++ you can't build either a game or a website if you want that coding job you have to focus on one language at a time and then learn the other tools and technologies that go with it so you can build something that employers will actually care about
