in this lecture I'm going to show you how to get information about the current operating system so back in no documentation in the list of modules if you scroll down you can see it's OS module let's have a quick look here so these are the methods that are available in this module for example we have free mem which returns the amount of free memory on this machine we also have total mem which is the total memory we can get information about the current user we can get the uptime of this machine and so on so let's use a couple of these methods here so if you scroll down you can see this is how we load this OS module just like loading other modules we call the require function and store the result in a constant called OS or anything so back in vs code I'm gonna delete all the code here and define a new constant OS and study to require OS now we can call total mem method or free mem or other methods so let me declare a variable and store the result here and similarly for the free memory free memory and finally let's lock these values on the console so console dot log single code we add total memory and append this total memory here now we can simplify this expression by using a template string which is available in more recent versions of JavaScript that we refer to as es6 or ES 2015 which is short for ACMA script 6 or 2015 that's the specification that defines what features are available in JavaScript so every year akima defines new features that should be added to JavaScript and as you know different browsers implement different set of these features but the v8 engine that we have inside of node that's pretty uptodate and it implements a lot of new features of JavaScript that is defined in Eggman script so in Eggman script six or eight most script 2015 we have a feature called template string which helps us build a string without concatenations let me show you how that works so console dot log now instead of a single quote we use the backtick character backtick is the character before number one on your keyboard so here we add some static text like total memory now we want to add something here dynamically so we use dollar sign and curly braces to add a placeholder for an argument in this case our argument is this total memory variable so we can see with a template string we don't have concatenation okay now I'm gonna duplicate this line and change total to free and here let's add free memory okay now we don't need this first console log we're done with this let's go back to the terminal and run this app so note app but Jas and you can see the total and free memory on my machine now what is interesting here is that before note we could not get this kind of information using javascript javascript used to run only inside of a browser and we could only work with the window or document objects we couldn't get information about the operating system but when using node or javascript code is executed outside of a browser or as some people say on the server with this we can get information about the operating system we can work with files we can work with the network for example we can build a web server that listens for HTTP requests on a given port and I'm gonna show you all this later in this section hi guys its mosh here thank you for watching my know tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete note course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
