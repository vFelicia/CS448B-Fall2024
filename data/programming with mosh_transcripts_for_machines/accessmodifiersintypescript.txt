all right so here I've created a point object with an initial coordinate now what do you thin our program you want to have this rule such that when we initialize a point object we should not be able to change the X or Y values with this implementation I can always come here and set point dot X to a different value how can we avoid this sometimes we need this feature in our programs because it will make them more predictable it reduces the chance for bugs so how should we prevent the coordinate of this point object to change after it's initialized well in objectoriented languages we have this concept called access modifiers an access modifier is basically a keyword that we can apply to a member of a class to control its access from the outside so in typescript we have three access modifiers public private and protected public and private are the most common and by default all members are public let me show you what I mean so here in our point class we have three members right we have two fields and one method so let me create a pointer object and type point dot look these are the members of the class and because they are all public we can access them here and that's why we can see them in the intelligence however I can go here and prefix this field with the private key word now once we create this point object if I type point dot look X is not in the list it's not accessible it's private so if we try to set point at X 2 3 look we have a compilation error in typescript it says property X is private and only accessible within class point now with this technique I can go here and apply the private keyword on the Y field as well and now once I initialize a point object I can no longer change is quite innate I can only call the draw method ok so this is why we access modifiers to control access to certain members of a class from the outside you can apply these access modifiers on field properties and methods now by default if you don't set an access modifier is assumed to be public so here the draw method as you know is public I can also add the public keyword here but this is redundant it's just making my code noisy so you don't really need to add this it's better to keep your code short and clean and use the private access modifier only when you need to next I'm gonna show you one of my favorite features of typescript around access modifiers hi thank you for watching my angular tutorial if you enjoyed this video please like it and share it with others also you can subscribe to my channel for free new videos every week this video is part of my complete angular course with almost 30 hours of high quality content where you learn everything about angular from the basic to the advanced topics all in one course so you don't have to jump from one tutorial to another in case you're interested you can get this course with a big discount using the link in the video description and if not that's perfectly fine continue watching as the next section is coming up
