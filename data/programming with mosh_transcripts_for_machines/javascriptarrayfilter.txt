in this lecture I'm gonna show you how to filter an array based on a search criteria so back to our numbers array let's say we want to return only the positive numbers so we can use the filter method like this filter once again we need to pass a callback function this function has three parameters value index and array so out of this we only care about value we don't care about the index because I just want to see if the number or the value is positive so function value now here we can write a simple expression like this if value is greater than or equal to zero so when we call the filter method this method will loop through this array and execute this callback function for each number for each element now if the element matches this criteria it will add this element to a new array and finally we can get the new array here so filtered let's take a look at the result filtered so in our filtered array we have only one two and three now earlier you learn about arrow functions so this is a good case where you would use an arrow function you have a single line of code in this function and we're simply returning a value so we get rid of the function keyword put a fat arrow between the parameter and the body of this function we don't need the parentheses because we have a single parameter and because we're simply returning a value we can also exclude the return keyword as well as the curly braces and then put everything on the same line like this now we can make this code a little bit shorter so in this case we can use an abbreviation like V for value or n for a number because it's obvious that we're working with the numbers array so we filter and we get numbers where number is greater than or equal to zero here we're dealing with an array of numbers in a real world application you would be using an array of objects for example here on the Yelp website we can click this button to find only the restaurants that are open now so this is one kind of filtering so if you want to implement something like this instead of an array of numbers you would have an array of restaurants and each restaurant has opening hours so you could filter restaurants that are currently open and return them hi guys thank you for watching my javascript tutorial this tutorial is part of my JavaScript course where you learn all the essential JavaScript features that every web and mobile application developer must know if you're an absolute beginner or have some experience in JavaScript and are looking for a fun and indepth course that teaches you the fundamentals of JavaScript this course is for you this course is also packed with tons of exercises that help you master what you learned in the course in fact many of these exercises are questions that come up in technical programming interviews so if you're pursuing a job as a frontend or a backend developer or if you simply want to have a more indepth understanding of JavaScript I highly encourage you to enroll in the course for a limited time you can get this course with a discount using the link in the video description click the link to find out more about the course and enroll
