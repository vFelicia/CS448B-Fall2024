in programming we have a common data structure called stack which resembles a stack of items in the real world imagine you have a stack of books the last book that you put on top of the stack is the first book that you can remove you refer to this behavior as lifeall which is short for last in first out so this is a stack data structure and it's very common in real world applications a good example of that is your browser whenever you navigate to a new website your browser keeps your browsing session in a stack so when you click the back button it takes you to the previous website let me show you how it works so we start with an empty stack now let's say we navigate to website number one now here for simplicity I'm using a number if you're building a browser instead of a number we'll use a string which is the address of the current website now let's say we navigate to a couple more websites and then click the back button at this point the browser removes the item on top of this stack and then it will redirect us for the previous website now let's say we press the back button a couple more times so we'll end up with an empty stack at this point the browser will disable the back button this is how a stack works last in first out now let me show you how to use a stack in Python basically we can use a list object as a stack so here I'm gonna define a variable like browsing session and set it to an empty list now let's say the user navigates the website number one so we call browsing session dot append method and add the address of the current web site now let's say the user navigates to website number two and then three let's have a look at what we have in our stack so we printed and as you see we have a list of three items now when the user presses the back button we should remove the last item in this list right how do we do it we use the pop method so we call browsing session dot pop the we'll remove the last item from the stack and return it so we can get it here but in this case we're not gonna use this value let me just print it on the terminal so you can see that so three is removed from the stack now if we print our stack one more time print browsing session you can see three is removed and we have only two items in our stack so we need to take the user to the previous website which is the item on top of the stack and we can get that using a negative one index very easy so back here browsing session of negative one this returns the last item so we print it and I would like to add just a label for clarity redirect let's look at the result so when the user presses the back button we redirect them to the previous website which is website number two now here we need to check if the stack is empty or not if it becomes empty we need to disable the back button so that is very easy earlier in the course I told you about the faulty values so number zero an empty string an empty list these are all false II values so if you apply the not operator to an empty list we'll get the boolean true so to see if our stack is empty we can simply read code like this if not browsing session then at this point we'll disable the back button so let me recap we use the append method to add an item on top of this tag we use pop to remove the item on top of the stack we use index negative one to get the item on top of the stack and of course before doing that we need to check to see if our stack is empty or not because if it's empty when we run this code we'll get an error so if not browsing session then we'll get the item on top of this stack these are the operations that you can perform on stacks hi guys thank you for watching this tutorial my name is Mohamad ani and I have tons of tutorials like this for you on my channel so be sure to subscribe and also please like and share this video if you want to learn Python properly from scratch with depth I have a comprehensive python tutorial for you the link is below this video so click the link to get started thank you and have a fantastic day
