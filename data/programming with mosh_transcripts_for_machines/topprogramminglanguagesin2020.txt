in this video we're gonna talk about the top three programming languages to learn in 2020 whether you're an absolute beginner wanting to learn programming for the first time or you're an experienced developer looking for new job opportunities this video is for you I've picked these languages based on Google Trends and the results of various surveys and studies these are the most versatile programming languages that offer you the best job opportunities of course merely knowing a programming language does not land you a job you need to know a lot of other stuff too but we'll talk about that in another video now before we get started make sure to subscribe and enable notifications so you will get notified next time I upload a video I'm not Sharma Danny LM a software engineer with almost two decades of experience and I've taught over three million people how to code or how to become a professional software engineer so let's jump right in and talk about the top three programming languages to learn in 2020 Python is one of the most liked programming languages of all time here's a preview of my Python tutorial on YouTube this is my most popular tutorial and has been watched over 6 million times since last year if you want to learn Python I've put the link down below according to indeed.com the average salary of a Python developer in the US is about 120 thousand dollars a year and here is the result of stack overflows developer survey in 2019 as you can see Python ranks as the most wanted programming language of the year here are a few reasons why Python is the most popular programming language in the world Python is very beginner friendly and is particularly easy to learn for people who don't want to become professional software engineers a lot of accountants engineers and scientists use Python in their day to day work Python is extremely popular for machine learning AI projects and research anyone who wants to get into machine learning na I should definitely learn Python professional software engineers also use Python to build web mobile and desktop applications but quite frankly Python is not very reputable when it comes to building mobile and desktop applications with talk about the best languages for these kind of applications in a moment Python and a framework called Django are very popular amongst backend developers and on top of all this pythons code is very simple and free of clutter here's a snippet of Python code that asks the user to enter a number and then tells if the number is even or odd as you can see the syntax looks way different from other programming languages there are no curly braces no classes and no public or private modifiers it's extremely simple and free of clutter this is one of the reasons that Python is so appealing to a lot of people here's the bottom line if you're an absolute beginner or if you want to get into machine learning and AI Python is the best language to learn right now the second language on the top three programming languages list is Java why you might say seriously isn't Java dead what about coddling Tamwar friend Kotlin is a fairly new programming language with a small community and is often used for new development there are tens of thousands of projects already built with Java and these projects are not being migrated to coddling let's do some quick research on indeed.com I'm gonna search for Java developer in the US so as you can see there currently over 29,000 jobs for Java developers in the US now let's search for Cartland developer they're just over 1,000 jobs also according to a indeed.com the average salary of a Java developer in the US is 105 thousand dollars per year here are a few reasons why Java is one of the most popular programming languages Java is used in enterprise software applications it's used by plenty of tech companies around the world to build largescale applications huge companies like uber Airbnb Twitter and many others used Java in their tech stack and this means that finding a job as a Java developer is relatively easy and definitely easier than Cartland Java is also used in developing native Android apps if you're interested in becoming a mobile developer focusing on building native Android apps then learning Java makes a lot of also Java has been a popular programming language for almost two decades and there's a huge support community but you start learning Java you will encounter tons of resources forums and books to help you along the way and here's my personal opinion about Java even if you don't want to become a Java developer simply knowing Java and understanding its syntax would be very beneficial because there are tons of great books on courses on software engineering that are based on Java most books about data structures algorithms design patterns automatic testing and software architecture are based on Java that is why in my opinion knowing Java is like knowing English if you understand English and can speak it a bit you can travel around the world Java in the programming world is like the English language of our world now here's the Python code that I showed you earlier let's see what this code looks like in Java obviously the code is more verbose it's longer that's why learning Java could be slightly difficult for people who have never programmed before and here's the bottom line if you're serious about software development and building enterprise applications Java is the best language to learn the next top programming language to learn in 2020 is JavaScript for the seventh year in a row javascript has ranked as the most popular programming language in a survey conducted by Stack Overflow according to indeed.com the average salary of a JavaScript developer in the US is 114 thousand dollars per year just like Python and Java javascript is also a versatile language which means we can use it to build various types of web mobile and desktop applications but JavaScript really shines in web and mobile application development using javascript and react native you can build crossplatform mobile apps so instead of building a separate app for iOS or Android and maintaining two different code bases you write your application once in JavaScript and build it for different platforms you have a single codebase to maintain that's why a lot of companies these days prefer to build apps this way because of the reduced cost of course if you want to leverage the full our of a platform like iOS or Android you should build apps using the native language and frameworks with that platform for iOS that is Swift and for Android that is Java but again most companies prefer crossplatform solutions and that's why the more job opportunities for JavaScript and react native developer compared with Swift developer JavaScript also has a huge community and whenever you get stuck there plenty of people out there who could help you and here's the bottom line if you want to become a web developer or if you want to build crossplatform mobile apps you should learn JavaScript so let's quickly recap the top three programming languages to learn in 2020 are Python Java and JavaScript Python is best suited for machine learning and AI Java is best suited for building enterprise applications and javascript is the language of choice for building web or crossplatform mobile apps if you want to learn any of these languages I've put links down below I have tutorials for you here on my channel and if you want to learn more I have complete courses that go way beyond the tutorials on this channel all my courses come with a 30day moneyback guarantee and a certificate of completion that you can add your resume with all that what programming language do you want to learn in 2020 let me know in the comment section below if you enjoyed this video please like and share it with others thank you for watching and have a fantastic day or night
