so now you know the variables and functions we define in a module are scoped to that module they're private and not visible from the outside but you might be wondering how node does this so let me show you on the very first line of the logger jeaious module I'm going to create a syntactical error so define a variable X and set it to nothing like this so make sure to write this code on the very first line in other words if you have a line break here and do this on a second line you're not going to see what I'm gonna show you now so put this back on the first line here we have a syntactical error now back in the terminal let's run the application again okay we got unexpected token semicolon right but look above this line you see this function declaration so this function has a few parameters exports require module file name and surname so let me copy this code here now basically what happens under the hood is that note does not execute this code directly it wraps it inside of a function and that's the function you saw so at runtime our code is going to be converted to something like this so we have this function declaration here is the body of that function now for now I'm gonna remove this error here so this is our code and then we have the end of this function now the actual code is slightly more complicated than this but we don't want to get distracted with that complexity if you're a more advanced JavaScript developer you probably know this is an immediately invoked function expression or if you if you don't know that don't worry that's not really the scope of note what I want you to take away here is that note does not execute our code directly it always wraps the code inside each module and something like this inside of a function now look at these arguments to this function so you have seen the required function I told you that this required function appears to be global but actually it's not global in fact it's local to each module so in every module requiring is one of the arguments that is passed to this function we call this function the module wrapper function ok so you have seen the required function you have also seen module that is what we're using here so we have module that exports we also have exports which is a shortcut to module dot export so if you want to add a function to module that exports object you can either write module that exports dot log equals log or you can write exports that log equals log but you cannot reset this export like what we did earlier in other words you cannot write export equals block because this export is a reference to module and exports change that reference okay so these are the first three arguments we also have filename and Durning which represent the name of this file and the pass so let's have a quick look at this argument on the top I'm gonna do a console that log of underline underline file name and also underline underline Durning now you're not going to have this function this module wrapper function this was purely for demonstration so I'm gonna revert the code back to what we had before okay so now we don't have any errors in this module let's go back to the terminal and run this program so node app GS so here on the first line we have file name which is the complete path to that file that is larger than a s and on the second line we have the path to the directory that contains an module so now you have a basic idea about node modules and how they work you know how to create them how to load them but node itself comes with a bunch of useful modules that we can use in a lot of applications and that's what we're going to look at in the next lecture hi guys it's mash here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching is part of my complete note course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real world and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
