everybody is going crazy about Devon in case you haven't heard it claims to be the world's first AI software engineer right now it's still behind closed doors all we have seen is a polished demo but a lot of you are worried that you're going to lose your coding job to Devin some folks are ready to pack up their keyboards and learn Plumbing instead I made a video the other day and shared my thoughts and got a lot of comments in today's video we'll dive deeper and see if Devon will reduce software engineering jobs or is it all hype we'll talk about the reality the potential and most importantly what you can do to stay ahead of the curve all right first question will Devon even succeed startups have a high failure rate even with huge funding investors Chase Trends and AI is hot right now but that doesn't mean that we're going to see a Flawless product that delivers now let's assume for a second that it kicks butt and the official launch blows us away the next question is is it truly useful polish demos are great but really board software is messy it has old systems undocumented quirks tons of Integrations understanding how to work within that that's a kind of thing that AI struggles with and why we need human intelligence and wisdom will Devin work on those real complex Enterprise projects we haven't seen proof of that remember those no code tools that have been around forever all those promises of letting anyone build software with dragon drop magic they often overpromise and underd deliver you can't build anything serious with with these tools certainly not the kind of software that runs our hospitals Airlines or power grids the stuff Our Lives depend on it is our job to create Computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human everybody in the world is now a programmer okay hold on let's unpack this nonsense saying no one will need to code and everyone is suddenly a programmer is as ridiculous as claiming with AI every every one is instantly a doctor or a lawyer software engineering just like those fields requires years of specialized training and problem solving skills sure you might create a simple todo app with natural language but trying to build the software that runs hospitals Airlines or our cars that way it's a massive overpromise so why does he make that bold claim because his company is heavily invested in AI so hyping its power inflates N Video stock so don't fall for it look I respect this Coo's business success but he's not a software engineer keep that in mind he doesn't understand the complexities of real world software and playing around with C+ plus 20 years ago doesn't really count so let's assume that Devin version one or even version 10 can do everything does that mean software jobs suddenly disappear absolutely not take adoption takes time especially in big companies with Legacy systems remember how long it took for companies to fully switch to the cloud it'll be the same with widespread AI adoption this gives you time to learn and adapt let's also remember that take adoption isn't even across the board some companies especially those dealing with sensitive data like government or Healthcare have strict security policies they might even outright Block online AI tools due to security risks so don't assume every workplace will jump on the AI right away think about it digital locks have been around for decades but what happened to locksmiths did they go extend of course not in fact most houses still use traditional keys so just because there's new take out there doesn't mean everybody rushes to adopt it plus some real world systems are so complex and overengineered that they always need highly specialized Engineers to keep them running think of those banking systems some still rely on Cobalt code from decades ago but regardless of AI as a software engineer you should always be learning new things to stay relevant I remember when foxb was the hottest thing jobs everywhere everybody wanted to learn it and most of you watching this probably haven't even heard of it right then came across SQL Server Oracle different tools but the same concept data storage someone who understands those fundamentals could easily transition from Fox Pro to the next big thing because they grasp the underlying Concepts the fact is the tools we use and how we code will keep evolving that's the nature of tech AI will probably change how we code maybe we'll spend more time crafting prompts and less on coding but we'll still need those deep keep coding skills to refine ai's output and collaborate effectively we still have to understand how code Works how data flows and how to solve real world problems through software these are Timeless skills think of it like building a house you might start with a hammer and nails then learn how to use a power drill and next thing you know you've got fancy 3D modeling software but regardless of the tool you need those blueprints the understanding of structure material lengths and how it all comes together to create a livable space so yes AI will change how we code just like every new takech advancement has done throughout history let's look back for a minute the invention of the calculator didn't eliminate mathematicians it just changed what they spent time on design software didn't erase graphic designers but it certainly changed their workflows the same will happen with coding some very repetitive coding tasks might be automated but guess what happens next new roles emerge now let's address something I hear a lot some of you are worried that AI will make your jobs obsolete that one supercoder with their fancy AI tools will replace two or more Engineers but here's the thing just because we can potentially work faster doesn't mean there's suddenly a shortage of problems to solve think about it we as humans want new features and functionalities all the time every app you use is constantly getting updated why because that's how companies compete they need to offer the best most feature reach experience to stay ahead but it's not just about the the shiny new stuff a lot of existing projects are weighed down by Tech Deb that keeps piling up now imagine AI helping us not only roll out those new features faster but also tackle the messy code companies could finally fix those annoying bugs improve performance all while still delivering the cool stuff that keeps customers happy suddenly projects get done way faster new versions ship like clockwork that means more jobs in the long run not less it's like building a house with better tools and techniques we can build faster but that doesn't mean we suddenly stop needing houses right we just get to build more elaborate and Innovative ones let's not forget the big picture software is eating the world everything runs on some kind of code and that demand is only going to grow we'll always need skilled people to shape that software whether they write every line from scratch or collaborate with powerful AI tools and finally let's not get paralyzed by those clickbait headlines claiming AI is stealing your job those are designed to scare you to get views some are from folks who make money off of your fear others are just inexperienced maybe they know some coding but they don't understand the full complexities of building and maintaining large scale software don't let those voices Define your reality look if you're passionate about coding if the idea of building things with software lights you up then go for it think about it awesome salaries flexible schedules the freedom to work from anywhere these are the perks of being a soft software engineer don't let the fear mongering get to you some folks might get scared of AI and miss out on this amazing path well that's their loss and less competition for you right so instead of getting lost in the Panic focus on leveling up your skills build on those coding fundamentals explore new AI tools and stay hungry for knowledge that's how you thrive not by panicking about the future if you like this video please like and share it to spread the word and
