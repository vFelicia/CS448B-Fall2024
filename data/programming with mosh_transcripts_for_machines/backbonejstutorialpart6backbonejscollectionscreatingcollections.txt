Backbone collections are ordered set of models they're useful when you want to work with a group of models building collections is very easy and it's similar to building models we simply extend back bonded collection and specify the type of models that the collection can hold let's see this in action you we can put objects in a collection in two ways we can pass the initial array of models when creating the collection or we can call the add method on an instantiated collection you the add method is provided by underscore and is available in all background collections underscore provides many other methods that make working with collections really easy we'll cover them in a few minutes alright now let's go to chrome and inspect our collection no this property's here these are the ones that are collection inherited from the base backbone that collection object every backbone collection has lengths and models property the length property returns the number of models inside the collection and the models property gives us direct access to these models most often we use the add or get methods to access a model in the collection let's try them the add method returns a model at the given index here zero represents the first model in the collection also note that this model has the CID of c1 every backbone model has two IDs one is a persistent ID which is assigned by the server and another one is the client ID or CID which is assigned by backbone CID is a temporary identifier that backbone uses to keep track of objects we can get a model from a collection by its ID which is its persistent ID or CID which is the client ID so another way for us to get the same model here is like this we can also remove a model from a collection by calling the remove method the remove method expects a model so you need to get the model by either its index or its ID and then pass it to this method let's verify that the model is removed bangbang collections provide an easy way to work with a group of models we can create a collection type by extending back bonded collection we can add models to a collection but instantiate a collection or by calling the add method the length property returns the number of models inside the collection the add method returns the model at the specified index the get method returns the model specified by its ID or see ID we can remove a model from a collection by calling the remove method all the methods we've covered in this lecture are provided by underscore in the next lecture we'll cover more of underscore methods available in collections thank you for watching
