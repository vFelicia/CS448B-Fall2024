alright now let's add a new module to this application so I'm gonna add a new file logger dot J s let's imagine we're going to create a module for login messages and we're gonna reuse this module in various parts of this application or potentially in other applications so loggernet j s now in this module let's imagine that we're going to use one of those remote logging services for login our messages so there are websites out there there provide logging as a service they give us a URL and we can send an HTTP request to that URL to log messages in the cloud so here I'm gonna declare a variable like URL and set it to something like this HTTP my lager dot io / lock and of course I'm making this up it may not be a true service out there but let's imagine in this implementation we're going to send an HTTP request to this endpoint to this URL now we also need a function called log that takes a message and in this function we're going to send an HTTP request however to keep things simple here we just want to focus on the modularity we don't want to get distracted with all the details of sending HTTP requests so for now I just want to log this message on the console so console that log message okay now this variable and this log function they're both scoped to this module they're private they're not visible from the outside however in after j/s which is our main module we want to use this logger module so we should be able to access this log function we should be able to call it from the app module so we need to make this public we need to make it visible from the outside now in the last lecture you saw this module object one of the properties we have here is exports you can see this property is set to an empty object anything that we add to this object will be exported from this module and it will be available outside of this module so back in our lager module I'm gonna set module dot exports dot log so I'm adding a method called log to this exports object and simply setting it to this log function we have defined here okay in other words the object that we're exporting here has a single method called log now similarly if you want to export this URL we could do something like this so module that exports that URL we set it to URL and of course we could change the name that is exported to the outside for example internally we may call this variable URL but when we export it we may call it endpoint okay now in this case we don't need to export this URL variable because this is purely implementation detail so in real world applications every module might have several variables and functions we only want to export a subset of these members to the outside because we want to keep this module easy to use let me give you a metaphor think of a DVD player a DVD player has a few buttons on the outside and these are the buttons or objects that we interact with so these objects represent the public interface of a DVD player okay but inside the box there are lots of other objects or complex objects we don't need to know anything about these objects their implementation data and they can change significantly from one model to another but what we see on the outside is almost stable or static across different models so in our logger module this URL is implementation detail modules don't need to know anything about this they only need to call the log function so we export these make it public but keep the URL private so I'm gonna delete this last line okay so we're done with our logger module now we need to load this module and use it inside app j/s hi guys its mosh here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching is part of my complete note course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
