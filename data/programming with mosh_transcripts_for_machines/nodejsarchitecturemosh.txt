so in the last video you learned that note is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code but what is it runtime environment really well before node we use JavaScript only to build applications and run inside of a browser so every browser out there has what we call a JavaScript engine that takes our JavaScript code and converts it to code that a computer can understand for example Microsoft ed uses chakra Firefox uses spider monkey and chrome uses v8 and is because of these varieties of engines that sometimes JavaScript code can behave differently in one browser or another now a browser provides a runtime environment for JavaScript code for example you probably know that in browsers we have the window or the document object these objects allow us to work with the environment in which our code is running now up to 2009 the only way to execute JavaScript code was inside of a browser in 2009 Brian Dahl the creator of node came up with a brilliant idea he thought it would be great to execute JavaScript outside of a browser so he took Google's v8 engine which is the fastest JavaScript engine out there and embedded it inside a C++ program and called that program note so similar to a browser note is a runtime environment for JavaScript code it contains a JavaScript engine that can execute our JavaScript code but it also has certain objects that provide an environment for our JavaScript code but these objects are different from the environment objects we have in browsers for example we don't have the document object instead we have other objects that give us more interesting capabilities for example we can work with the file system listen for requests and a given port and so on we can't do stuff like that inside of a browser right so in essence node is a program that includes the v8 JavaScript engine plus some additional modules that give us capabilities not available inside browsers we can work with the file system or the network and so on both chrome and note share the same JavaScript engine but they provide different runtime environments for JavaScript now I've seen people conferring no to csharp or Ruby or some other programming languages but this comparisons are fundamentally wrong because node is not a programming language it's like comparing a car with an apple by the same token note should not be compared with frameworks such as a spool of meth or rails or Django and so on these are frameworks for building web applications note is not a framework it's a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code next we're going to look at how node works hi guys it's mush here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete node course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
