could a robot replace your job figure oan is a glimpse of a future where AI isn't just software anymore in this video we'll see this incredible robot in action explore how it could change the way we work and tackle some big questions about the Future Let's dive into this so what exactly is figure1 it's a humanid robot about 5' 6 in tall and weighing around 60 kg what sets it apart is its brain power by open ai's Cutting Edge technology this means it can hold full conversations understand your instructions and react instantly imagine it working in a warehouse assisting at home or performing all sorts of jobs we currently do ourselves this is groundbreaking territory for robotics let's see what it can do in their official demo hey figure one what do you see right now I see a red apple on a plate in the center of the table a drying rack with cups and a plate and you standing nearby with your hand on the table great can I have something to eat sure thing okay we have seen figure o1 in action that's definitely impressive but let's be real it's not the only player in this game companies like Tesla Amazon and others are all pushing robotics forward in their own way so what makes figure1 special well it seems really good at understanding normal language the way we talk every day that means it could be used for all sorts of things not just repeating the same task over and over like some other robots Okay but how does figure1 even understand what we're saying this is where things get really interesting it's all thanks to open AI the same company behind chat GPT they specialize in creating incredibly powerful AI systems focusing a lot on language understanding this means figure1 can sort through your instructions and respond like a human would but the real breakthrough is that open AI doesn't just give figure one those chatbot smarts they take it further by connecting the language understanding to the robot's body and his cameras so not only does figure1 get what you're saying it can actually carry out the task that's why it's so special and what's even cooler figure1 keeps learning every conversation everything it sees it uses that to get better at understanding our world think of it like a super smart roommate who gets a little bit smarter every day oh and by the way if this whole robot and AI field excites you if you're ever thinking about a career building these machines then you will definitely want to learn programming languages like Python and C++ these are like the building blocks that let us create the super smart brains behind robots like figure1 python helps the robot understand our language and C++ helps it control its movements okay figure1 is seriously cool no question that there but let's be honest a robot this smart makes people both excited and a little nervous right and that's where things get really interesting and maybe even a bit scary on the one hand think about all the good stuff robots like figure one could take care of boring or dangerous jobs keeping people safe but on the other hand it raises big questions about jobs if a robot can understand what we say and do the work too what happens to the people who do those jobs now figure's website talks about how there aren't enough workers in warehouses that's probably who they want to sell their robots to first but hold on let's think bigger any job where you do the same thing over and over and need to understand instructions those jobs could be in trouble talking to customers sorting stuff even putting things together this robot could change all of that speaking of jobs what about AI replacing software Engineers I mean if robots can write code does that mean software Engineers are next there is a lot of hype and fear around this and and I've actually made a few videos about this topic I highly recommend you to watch those videos to better understand the situation but the short answer is no AI is a powerful tool but it can't replace the creativity and problem solving skills of a human software engineer figure makes some bold claims about the problems they're trying to solve on their website they're saying there are 10 million unfilled jobs in the US 7 million of those are for essential roles in warehouses transportation and Retail there are only 6 million people available to fill those positions and key Warehouse suppliers predict that they will run out of people to hirer by 2024 and that leads to their big claim their goal is to deploy autonomous humanid workers to support us on a global scale so this isn't about a few robots in one warehouse but a large scale change but let's take a step back for a second I'm not an expert on job num so I can say how accurate all of this is but remember company sometimes make problems seem bigger than they are to make their Solutions look even more amazing but hey let's play along for a minute let's say those numbers are real and figure is genuinely trying to solve job shortages with their robots is that the whole story what if people don't want robot service think about it good robots really replace chefs servers or Baristas sure they might make the coffee but would you ditch your favorite local spot for a place run by robots that human connection the Barista who knows order the sushi chef with years of tradition behind their skill that's hard to replicate I actually asked all of you on YouTube if you would ditch your favorite Sushi Spot the one with the experienced Chef who knows exactly how you like your roles for a place where robots make everything and guess what 85% of you said no they would want the human chef with the skills and the passion imagine a restaurant that fired all its staff and replace them with robots it might seem like the future but it would feel cold and impersonal more like a factory than a restaurant would you really want to eat there right next door imagine a small cozy Italian restaurant run by a friendly family people crave that human connection the feeling of being welcome like a friend let's not forget that some of this isn't entirely new for example back in 2019 this hotel in Japan opened that was totally run by robots I mean robot dinosaurs greating you little robot guys taking your bags sounds wild right but it turned out to be more like a one time experience like a museum not the kind of place you want to keep coming back to McDonald's also tried something similar with an automated restaurant in Texas in 2022 customers ordered on touch screens and their food arrived on conveyor belts it seemed really hightech but in the end a lot of people still prefer to talk to a real person when they're ordering food so let's be real are these robot fears just overblown there's definitely a lot of hype these companies need funding and painting a picture of a world desperate for robot Solutions helps those Investments flow there's no denying that investment drives Innovation but let's take a breath what's the real story here here's what I think I think robots are amazing tools they can do dangerous jobs explore space all the amazing stuff but they are not a magic solution for everything they can fully replace the human touch the creativity and the connection that makes so much of our world meaningful so here's the big question what do you think about all this would you eat at a robot run restaurant is there a place for humanoids like figure 01 in the future or is the human touch Irreplaceable let's keep this conversation going share your opinions in the comments below and hey if
