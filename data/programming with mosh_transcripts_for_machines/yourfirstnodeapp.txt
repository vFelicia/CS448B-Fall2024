alright then we're ready to build our first node application so I'm gonna create a new folder call it first app let's go to this folder now I'm going to open this folder inside of Visual Studio code which is my preferred code editor so code period so this is Visual Studio code or vs code it's a free powerful editor but you can use any editors that you prefer you can use sublime you can use atom or any other editors so here in this folder I'm gonna add in your file app is in this file we can write regular JavaScript just like the JavaScript that we write for the browsers so I'm gonna define a function say hello that takes a parameter name and simply logs a message on the console so hello + name and then we can call this function like this Marsh now to execute this code we're going to go back to the terminal and run node and pass the name of the file as an argument so app the jas so node as I told you before is a C++ program it includes Chrome's v8 JavaScript engine so this app the J's file that we're gonna pass to node node is gonna give it to v8 for execution so you can see we got hello Marsh on the console now let me show you something so back in vs code I'm going to temporarily comment out this line and do it console that log of window let's see what happens so back in the terminal let's run node app ajs you got an exception window is not defined so as I told you before a node we don't have the window or document objects these are part of the runtime environment that we get with browsers in node we have other objects to work with files with the operating system with the network and so on and that's what you're gonna learn about in the next section I hope you enjoyed this section and thank you for watching hi guys it's mush here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete node course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
