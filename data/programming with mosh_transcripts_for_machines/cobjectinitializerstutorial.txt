Oh okay object initializers in the last lecture we learned about constructors you know that we use a constructor to initialize an object and put it in an early State in csharp there is also another way to initialize an object and that is using an object initializer an object initializer is simply as syntax or quickly initializing an object without the need to call one of its constructors what do you need that simply to avoid creating multiple constructors let me show you an example imagine we have this person class with a bunch of fields now this is a very simple example we only have four fields here in a real world application you might have a few more fields now with this class if you want to create constructors for initializing various fields we may end up with a class like this as you see here I have four constructors the first one takes only an ID the second one takes an ID and a first name the third one takes an ID with first name and last name and so on so you see there are so many different combinations and this is what we used to do in csharp before object initializers were introduced so as you see writing code like that is messy and easily becomes out of control so object initializer came to solve this problem with an object initializer we don't need any of these constructors we can simply initialize a person object like this no these curly braces here I'm not calling one of the constructors of the person class you see here is what we call object initialization syntax so basically you specify the name of properties and assign them some initial value note that behind a scene when you initialize an object like this the default or parameterless constructor is going to be called and then any properties you set here are going to be initialized so with this way we can reserve constructors for scenarios where we really need to use them as I explained in the last lecture so an object cannot behave without being passed some initial values that's pretty much what you need to know about object initialization syntax in the next lecture we'll take a closer look at our methods and their parameters I hope you enjoyed this lecture and thank you for watching hi guys ma chere I hope you're having a fantastic day or night wherever you are in the world this tutorial you have been watching is actually part of one of my C sharp courses where you will learn everything about classes interfaces and objectoriented programming in case you're interested to enroll in the full course I've put the link for you in the video description and if not that's perfectly fine have a great day
