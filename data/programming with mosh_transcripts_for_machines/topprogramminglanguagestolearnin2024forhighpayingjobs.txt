if you're new to coding and feeling overwhelmed by all those programming languages out there I totally get it it's easy to get stuck jumping from one language to another and feeling like you are getting nowhere in this video I'm going to give you a road map so you can decide which languages are the best fit for your dream Tech job and help you get there faster we'll explore different career paths and the languages that power them now before we get started I need to mention that some folks might be worried about about AI taking over software development jobs that's a whole other topic but let me just say this AI is going to be a powerful tool for developers not a replacement I cover this in detail in two other videos links are down below if you're curious also I need to tell you a fact simply learning a programming language isn't a golden ticket to a job right away so don't be fooled by YouTube videos giving you such promises Landing a tech job usually takes a combination of skills a programming language is one of them and it's the first step in this video our focus is only on languages and nothing else now to decide what language to learn first you have to figure out what kind of Tech Career you want so what makes you excited do you like building amazing websites mobile apps games or software that controls physical objects what do you want to do let's talk about each of these paths and the languages they use let's start with web development if you dream of building beautiful websites or even online games this is the path for you now when web development has two main sites frontend and backend development frontend development is all about what the user sees and interacts with your key tools will be HTML CSS and JavaScript with HTML we can structure our web pages and their content with CSS we can make them pretty and with JavaScript we can make them Dynamic so we can respond to user actions like clicks and drags and do cool things now backend development is the behindth scenes Magic databases servers and the logic that makes everything work now here we have a few options we can use JavaScript python Java PHP C and so on now as we can see if you learn JavaScript you can use it both for the front end and backend development so you don't need to learn one extra language for backend development and guess what if you can build both the front end and backend together you're essentially a full stack developer with a higher salary okay now let's talk about mobile development here we have two main paths native and crossplatform development native development means we build apps specifically for either Android or iOS for Android Java is a classic choice but cotlin is becoming the modern favorite for iOS your goto language will be swift but Objective C is still used for older projects now crossplatform development lets you use a single code base to create apps for both Android and iOS saving time and resources here we have two popular choices for building mobile apps react native and flutter these are not programming languages they tools or Frameworks they allow you to build user interfaces and access things like the camera GPS or motion sensors now depending on your location there might be slightly more job opportunities for one or the other so jump on popular job searching websites and do a bit of research on the job market now if you want to use flutter you have to learn Dart if you want to use react native you have to learn JavaScript so as you can see if you learn JavaScript you can use it for frontend development backend development and mobile development giving you plenty of opportunities now let's talk about game development to build games we have to use a game engine we have two popular game engines which are unity and Unreal Engine Unity is a bit more beginner friendly and is often used in small to mediumsized game studios onreal engine is a bit more advanced and is used in large scale games that are visually stunning for Unity you have to learn C for Unreal Engine you have to learn C++ all right now let's talk about embedded systems this field is all about building software that can control Real World objects like smart watches selfdriving cars medical robots appliances and so on here we have a few choices C and C++ which are the tried and true languages for embedded systems they let you talk directly to the hardware for Max maimum control but you can also learn rust which is a newer language that is all about safety and speed it's perfect for making sure your smart devices work perfectly without errors again before deciding which language to learn first do a bit of research and find out which language offers more job opportunities in your location all right the last career path we're going to talk about is AI and machine learning a field that is rapidly shaping how we interact with technology if that's something you're excited about High is the goto language for data science and machine learning we also have R Which is popular for statistical Computing and creating beautiful data visualizations now I'm super curious which language do you want to learn after this video let me know in the comments below and remember I'm here to help so if I missed anything or if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask let me know in the comments so I can create more helpful content for
