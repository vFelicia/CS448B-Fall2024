the seasons come and go my thoughts of you like a wave returns to the scene into the me change but in a cycle that I can look each painful but the bastard you came into my life just like got nothing long gesture time just see that the seasons turn and change just like your mind like the Sun gives into the morning to the night time continues marching it slowly crawls with each new one starting hi Rico you came my dress my goodness season just just goodness Jesus maybe they start next year where is she each time of year carries memories like never fading whisper in the Marines Oh we'll keep on changing yeah Oh earning the bridge that keeps ours I'm here and I'm exaggerated does what you story's over now I must come you Oh just in time
