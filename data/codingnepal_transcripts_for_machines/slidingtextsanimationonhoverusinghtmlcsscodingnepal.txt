the seasons come and go like thoughts of you like a wave returns to the scene into the bloom may change but in a cycle that I can look each painful but they light fall to Bannister you came into my life just like got nothing not for them I just maybe start anyway they see that the seasons turn and change just like your mine like the Sun gives into the morning to night time continues marching it slowly crawls with each new one started I recall you gave it just good enough season not for just just she's a this time next year Oh each time of year carries memories like never fading whisper in the Marines Oh we'll keep on changing yeah
