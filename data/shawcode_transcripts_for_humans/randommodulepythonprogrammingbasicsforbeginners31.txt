00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - in this video I'll be showing you how to
00:04 - use the random module in Python this
00:07 - module is built into Python so you won't
00:09 - have to install it pip veranda module is
00:11 - very useful because it allows us to
00:13 - generate random numbers and data so
00:16 - let's get right into it so first off
00:18 - let's import random so import random now
00:21 - let's generate a random floating-point
00:23 - number between 1 and 10
00:25 - for this we use random dot uniform let's
00:28 - just create a variable so x equals
00:30 - random dot uniform between 1 and 10
00:36 - print X and then we get a random
00:41 - floating-point number between 1 and 10
00:43 - and this first number is inclusive that
00:46 - the second number isn't inclusive this
00:50 - means we could get a 1 but we could
00:52 - never get a 10 so this generates a
00:54 - random floating point number 15 1 and 10
00:56 - now let's talk about generating a random
00:59 - integer so to do this with you random
01:01 - dot randint
01:02 - so random dot run and int and we'll get
01:07 - free and run it a few more times free to
01:10 - 8 6 1 what's it like so this time the
01:16 - first parameter is inclusive and so is
01:19 - the second parameter so for both
01:21 - inclusive what about if we want only the
01:24 - first one to be inclusive and the second
01:26 - one to be exclusive well we can use run
01:29 - range and this is literally the same as
01:32 - random done in apart from the second
01:35 - parameter is exclusive so he could never
01:37 - understand it would always be 1 2 3 4 5
01:41 - 6 7 8 or 9 if you're enjoying for video
01:44 - so far be sure to give it a like it
01:46 - really does help me out anyway we can
01:48 - also get a random item from a list so
01:51 - we'll just create a new list so I don't
01:53 - know x equals this it doesn't have to be
01:59 - numbers it can be strings whatever and
02:01 - then we'd use y equals random dot choice
02:07 - choice X which is the West and then
02:11 - prints y
02:15 - 23 so as you can see it's chosen this
02:18 - item chosen this item now we can do a
02:22 - random choice more than once in one line
02:25 - with random choices and the first
02:29 - parameter should be a list which in our
02:30 - case is X and the second parameter will
02:34 - be our key value which is how many times
02:36 - say wants to run for random choice so
02:39 - we'll set that to 10 and then we'll
02:42 - print it so run it and as you can see
02:44 - we've got a list of 10 values both being
02:46 - randomly chosen so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
02:51 - and these are all random items from the
02:53 - list and it returns a list and then we
02:56 - could also obviously just grab the index
03:00 - which is 2 3 4 5 we can also mix up the
03:04 - order of the list using random shuffle
03:06 - we don't need to say to a variable we
03:08 - can just do random dot shuffle X so this
03:12 - will mix up the list and then more just
03:13 - bring our X as you can see this right
03:17 - here is different to this right here
03:19 - because it's being shuffled ok that's
03:22 - pretty much it for the random module if
03:24 - you found this video useful please do
03:25 - drop a like it really does help me out
03:27 - also consider subscribing I post Python
03:30 - content almost every day that's it from
03:32 - me
03:33 - Cheers and goodbye
