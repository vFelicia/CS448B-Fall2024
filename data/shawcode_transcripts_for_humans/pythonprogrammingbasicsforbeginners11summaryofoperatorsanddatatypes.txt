00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today we'll be recapping all the
00:04 - datatypes and operators' we have learned
00:06 - so first off we have the arithmetic
00:08 - operators which are just operators to do
00:10 - math we have addition subtraction
00:13 - multiplication division modulus indices
00:16 - in for division you can't remember
00:19 - modulus returns a remainder after the
00:21 - first operand has been divided by V
00:23 - second operand floor division runs the
00:25 - value down if it's a decimal indices or
00:28 - exponents so powers for example two to
00:31 - the power of five is 2 times 2 times 2
00:34 - times 2 times 2 ok now this assignment
00:37 - operators the first and main one is just
00:40 - V equal sign it just assigns one value
00:43 - to a variable then Barelvi arithmetic
00:45 - operators combined with the equal sign
00:47 - to assign a value but has been returned
00:50 - from an arithmetic operator but might
00:52 - sound a bit confusing but for example X
00:55 - plus equals 5 is the same as x equals x
00:58 - plus 5 so x equals x which is the
01:02 - original value plus 5 so the new value
01:05 - equals original value plus 5 we cannot
01:09 - just write x plus 5 because that doesn't
01:12 - assign the new number to X then there's
01:14 - comparison operators as well they used
01:17 - to compare two values in an if statement
01:19 - where as follows equal not equal greater
01:22 - than less than greater than or equal to
01:24 - and less than or equal to finally we
01:27 - have logical operators these are used in
01:29 - if statements to combine two or more
01:31 - comparison operators they are and or and
01:34 - not and returns true if both operands
01:37 - are true or returns true if either
01:39 - operand is true nozzoli requires one
01:42 - operand and returns true if a operand is
01:44 - false okay that's all the operators now
01:48 - on to data types we have one text type
01:51 - which is a string just some text they
01:54 - are shown by being surrounded by speech
01:56 - marks or quote marks we have two numeric
01:58 - types integers and floating point
02:00 - numbers integers are just whole numbers
02:02 - floating point numbers are numbers that
02:04 - contain decimals version by just writing
02:08 - the number
02:09 - lastly we have boolean x' true or false
02:11 - they can only be one of the other
02:13 - Aaron with their first letters as a
02:16 - capital
02:16 - - won't recognize them otherwise okay
02:20 - that's the end of a summary I'm going to
02:21 - set you one big challenge and see if you
02:23 - can do it I'll be covering all the
02:25 - solutions to the challenges next year
02:27 - and the video after that will be the
02:29 - solution to this big challenge so what I
02:32 - want you to do is create a grams ounces
02:34 - converter
02:35 - you will need tough and important grams
02:38 - check if a value is greater than zero if
02:40 - it isn't leave an error message if it is
02:43 - continue with the program then print the
02:46 - output the formula is divide the amount
02:48 - of grams by twenty eight point three
02:51 - five so one gram equals zero point zero
02:54 - three five two seven four okay so that's
02:58 - all for today guys if you enjoy - make
03:00 - sure to leave a like subscribe hit the
03:02 - bell and share these videos it helps me
03:04 - out a lot if you have any questions
03:06 - about Python or any errors in your code
03:08 - make sure to leave them in the comment
03:10 - section below that's it from me thanks
03:13 - for watching
