00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to a fifth
00:02 - video of my Python basics tutorial
00:03 - series if you haven't seen a previous
00:06 - episodes then go and check them out the
00:08 - playlist link is in the description
00:09 - today we'll be learning about if
00:11 - statements in Python so an if statement
00:14 - is a conditional statement but does
00:17 - something if something proved true now
00:20 - what I mean by the prove true we will
00:22 - see when we go through some examples so
00:24 - let's get programming just open up by
00:27 - de'longhi go to file new file then to
00:30 - start off we'll just have a variable x
00:34 - equals five and another variable by
00:38 - equals five as well now for the if
00:41 - statement so if we go if X double equals
00:47 - y colon print x equals y so if we say
01:00 - that and then we run it x equals y
01:04 - because X is equal to Y because five is
01:08 - equal to five so then we go through and
01:11 - print x equals y so how do we actually
01:16 - sell this if statement so first off
01:19 - you'll obviously want to have this if
01:22 - and you see how it's highlighted in
01:25 - orange and then we want to have like a
01:28 - condition so for example X double equals
01:32 - y by the way this double equals means
01:34 - it's comparing X to Y and seeing if
01:38 - they're equal whereas where the single
01:40 - equals a single equals up here just
01:42 - means it's assigning five to X or as
01:46 - this is checking it's comparing X to Y
01:49 - and then after after the condition we
01:53 - want a colon and then underneath that we
01:56 - want to press tab if we hit tab and
02:00 - there we go and that that shows that
02:02 - this print statement is part of 'bf
02:04 - statement and then we have whatever we
02:07 - want to do and tabbing in python is
02:10 - really important if we did x equals y
02:12 - without the tab
02:15 - we did get an error because it's
02:18 - expecting it to be indented like that it
02:22 - should automatically indent for you as
02:24 - well so we could also do if we wanted we
02:27 - can do if x equals 5 and then also
02:32 - prints it because X is 5 and it's
02:34 - checking does it equal 5 yes 5 equals 5
02:38 - what about x equals 4 nothing happens
02:43 - because X doesn't equal 4 so it's not
02:47 - going to print this what we can do now
02:50 - though is we can add an else statement
02:53 - you can do print let's just change this
02:58 - to Y again X does not equal Y and then
03:09 - if we change Y to free or anything that
03:12 - isn't 5 we run it X does not equal Y
03:16 - because what it's doing is saying if x
03:19 - equals y let's do this does it equal y
03:21 - no it doesnt let's move on to the else
03:23 - statement and there we go X does not
03:27 - equal Y so we set our else statements in
03:32 - the same way as if statements B you
03:34 - don't need a condition here you just
03:37 - need to go on and then the content of it
03:40 - needs to be tabbed it comes underneath
03:42 - the if statement it just won't work if
03:45 - you have it yo you'll get an error if
03:47 - it's not underneath it if statement so
03:50 - an else statement is just a conditional
03:53 - statement but does something if a
03:54 - statement if the if statement above it
03:57 - proved false so now we also have an
04:00 - elephant and that goes in between the if
04:04 - and the else so LF x equals I don't know
04:09 - if it equals 5
04:14 - x equals 5 x equals 5
04:23 - because it's what what is doing here is
04:25 - saying if X equals y it doesn't so it's
04:29 - gonna skip for up L what Ella basically
04:32 - means it's else--if else--if x equals 5
04:37 - which it does print x equals 5 and it's
04:42 - just going to skip the else statement
04:44 - because it's already this is true so the
04:47 - else statement is just ignored the
04:49 - elephant is just sour and the exact same
04:52 - way as an if statement and an else
04:54 - statement if we bring it back there so
04:56 - basically an L LF statement is just a
04:59 - kind of a conditional statement but does
05:01 - something if the if statement above it
05:04 - proves false and it proves itself true
05:07 - so now for some challenges for you to do
05:10 - by yourself create free if statements
05:12 - that protrude depending on a variable
05:15 - being equal to a number create an if and
05:18 - else statement that proves true or false
05:20 - your choice and create an F LF an else
05:23 - statement that proves true or false so
05:25 - that's all for today guys make sure to
05:27 - stay tuned for the next tutorial by

05:33 - if this helped you out it helps me out a
05:34 - lot if you have any questions about
05:36 - Python or need some help with any errors

hello everyone and welcome to a fifth video of my Python basics tutorial series if you haven't seen a previous episodes then go and check them out the playlist link is in the description today we'll be learning about if statements in Python so an if statement is a conditional statement but does something if something proved true now what I mean by the prove true we will see when we go through some examples so let's get programming just open up by de'longhi go to file new file then to start off we'll just have a variable x equals five and another variable by equals five as well now for the if statement so if we go if X double equals y colon print x equals y so if we say that and then we run it x equals y because X is equal to Y because five is equal to five so then we go through and print x equals y so how do we actually sell this if statement so first off you'll obviously want to have this if and you see how it's highlighted in orange and then we want to have like a condition so for example X double equals y by the way this double equals means it's comparing X to Y and seeing if they're equal whereas where the single equals a single equals up here just means it's assigning five to X or as this is checking it's comparing X to Y and then after after the condition we want a colon and then underneath that we want to press tab if we hit tab and there we go and that that shows that this print statement is part of 'bf statement and then we have whatever we want to do and tabbing in python is really important if we did x equals y without the tab we did get an error because it's expecting it to be indented like that it should automatically indent for you as well so we could also do if we wanted we can do if x equals 5 and then also prints it because X is 5 and it's checking does it equal 5 yes 5 equals 5 what about x equals 4 nothing happens because X doesn't equal 4 so it's not going to print this what we can do now though is we can add an else statement you can do print let's just change this to Y again X does not equal Y and then if we change Y to free or anything that isn't 5 we run it X does not equal Y because what it's doing is saying if x equals y let's do this does it equal y no it doesnt let's move on to the else statement and there we go X does not equal Y so we set our else statements in the same way as if statements B you don't need a condition here you just need to go on and then the content of it needs to be tabbed it comes underneath the if statement it just won't work if you have it yo you'll get an error if it's not underneath it if statement so an else statement is just a conditional statement but does something if a statement if the if statement above it proved false so now we also have an elephant and that goes in between the if and the else so LF x equals I don't know if it equals 5 x equals 5 x equals 5 because it's what what is doing here is saying if X equals y it doesn't so it's gonna skip for up L what Ella basically means it's elseif elseif x equals 5 which it does print x equals 5 and it's just going to skip the else statement because it's already this is true so the else statement is just ignored the elephant is just sour and the exact same way as an if statement and an else statement if we bring it back there so basically an L LF statement is just a kind of a conditional statement but does something if the if statement above it proves false and it proves itself true so now for some challenges for you to do by yourself create free if statements that protrude depending on a variable being equal to a number create an if and else statement that proves true or false your choice and create an F LF an else statement that proves true or false so that's all for today guys make sure to stay tuned for the next tutorial by subscribing and hitting the bell so you miss the next episode also drop a like if this helped you out it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about Python or need some help with any errors be sure to leave it in the comment section below I'll be sure to help you out any suggestions or feedback would also be greatly appreciated thanks for watching
