00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today I'm going to be teaching you what
00:04 - functions of the uses and how to create
00:07 - them by the end of this video you will
00:09 - be able to incorporate functions into
00:10 - your Python projects and become much
00:12 - more efficient so a function is a block
00:14 - of code for only runs when it is called
00:16 - this means we can write code once and
00:18 - use it over and over again functions
00:21 - also take parameters which basically
00:23 - means you give the function some data to
00:25 - work with it can then return some data
00:27 - to you okay I've just got a python file
00:29 - open now let's make a function so what
00:32 - we want to do is type death and then
00:36 - your function name so I'm just gonna
00:37 - collect my func then two round brackets
00:41 - colon then print this is a function okay
00:51 - so this is a function so we start it off
00:55 - with this defined keyword which
00:57 - basically tells Python but hey we're
00:59 - gonna make a function now then we write
01:02 - our function name this can be whatever
01:03 - we want then we use a pair of round
01:05 - brackets in here you would put your
01:07 - parameters but we're not gonna deal with
01:09 - parameters this episode next episode we
01:12 - will be covering parameters then you
01:14 - have your go on and then underneath that
01:18 - you'll have your code block which will
01:20 - run when your function runs and make
01:23 - sure this is indented to show but it is
01:25 - part of the function anyway we have just
01:27 - made our function if we run it it
01:31 - doesn't actually do anything that's
01:33 - because we haven't actually called it
01:34 - we've created it and we haven't done
01:36 - anything with it it's sort of like
01:37 - creating a variable and then just
01:39 - leaving it so we have to call it so what
01:42 - we do is we type of function name so
01:44 - myfunc and then a pair of round brackets
01:48 - like that save it run it I'm going to
01:53 - get this is a function because it's gone
01:55 - alright okay my function so let's look
01:57 - up here my function what does my
02:00 - function want me to do print this is a
02:02 - function okay so let's print that so we
02:05 - could do more stuff we could have like a
02:07 - variable in here so x equals 5 print
02:10 - this is a function print
02:13 - Eck's the idea of functions is they can
02:16 - be called multiple times so you don't
02:18 - have to write the same block of code
02:19 - over and over again so if we just get
02:21 - rid of this and print we just print
02:25 - hello we can call my function as many
02:31 - times as we want as you can see it
02:34 - printed hello four times so it basically
02:37 - means we don't have to write the same
02:39 - code walk out over and over again it
02:41 - becomes a lot more efficient I would
02:44 - like to briefly talk about the path
02:45 - statement so functions can't be empty
02:48 - clear this then my phone we just can't
02:56 - get it get an error because it's
02:57 - expecting something to be expecting
03:01 - something to be here but if we just
03:02 - wanted to create the function but it not
03:05 - do anything we would use the path
03:06 - statement so that's basically just
03:08 - telling Python hey just ignore this
03:11 - could work just leave it for now I'm
03:12 - gonna come back to it later this can be
03:14 - used with other things as well that use
03:16 - code blocks so it's not just use of
03:18 - functions it could be used with if
03:20 - statements while loops okay I'm going to
03:22 - end of a video here next Junio we'll be
03:24 - learning more about functions especially
03:26 - parameters and returning data if you
03:29 - have any questions about Python or have
03:31 - any errors in your code leave it in the
03:32 - comment section I'll be sure to reply if
03:34 - you would like to support me all you
03:36 - have to do is give this video like it
03:38 - really has helped me out also consider
03:40 - subscribing I post Python content almost
03:43 - every day that's it from me Cheers and
03:46 - goodbye

hello everyone welcome back to show code today I'm going to be teaching you what functions of the uses and how to create them by the end of this video you will be able to incorporate functions into your Python projects and become much more efficient so a function is a block of code for only runs when it is called this means we can write code once and use it over and over again functions also take parameters which basically means you give the function some data to work with it can then return some data to you okay I've just got a python file open now let's make a function so what we want to do is type death and then your function name so I'm just gonna collect my func then two round brackets colon then print this is a function okay so this is a function so we start it off with this defined keyword which basically tells Python but hey we're gonna make a function now then we write our function name this can be whatever we want then we use a pair of round brackets in here you would put your parameters but we're not gonna deal with parameters this episode next episode we will be covering parameters then you have your go on and then underneath that you'll have your code block which will run when your function runs and make sure this is indented to show but it is part of the function anyway we have just made our function if we run it it doesn't actually do anything that's because we haven't actually called it we've created it and we haven't done anything with it it's sort of like creating a variable and then just leaving it so we have to call it so what we do is we type of function name so myfunc and then a pair of round brackets like that save it run it I'm going to get this is a function because it's gone alright okay my function so let's look up here my function what does my function want me to do print this is a function okay so let's print that so we could do more stuff we could have like a variable in here so x equals 5 print this is a function print Eck's the idea of functions is they can be called multiple times so you don't have to write the same block of code over and over again so if we just get rid of this and print we just print hello we can call my function as many times as we want as you can see it printed hello four times so it basically means we don't have to write the same code walk out over and over again it becomes a lot more efficient I would like to briefly talk about the path statement so functions can't be empty clear this then my phone we just can't get it get an error because it's expecting something to be expecting something to be here but if we just wanted to create the function but it not do anything we would use the path statement so that's basically just telling Python hey just ignore this could work just leave it for now I'm gonna come back to it later this can be used with other things as well that use code blocks so it's not just use of functions it could be used with if statements while loops okay I'm going to end of a video here next Junio we'll be learning more about functions especially parameters and returning data if you have any questions about Python or have any errors in your code leave it in the comment section I'll be sure to reply if you would like to support me all you have to do is give this video like it really has helped me out also consider subscribing I post Python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
