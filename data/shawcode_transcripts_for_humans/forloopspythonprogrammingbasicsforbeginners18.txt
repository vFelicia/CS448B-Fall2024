00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today I'm going to be teaching you how
00:04 - to create use under play for loops in
00:07 - Python I have lots of experience in
00:09 - Python and by the end of this video you
00:11 - are a really good understanding of what
00:13 - Felipe's are and how to use them for
00:16 - loops are used to iterate over a
00:18 - sequence vice i've released a tuple a
00:21 - set or a dictionary or a string we learn
00:24 - about all these in the past few videos
00:26 - if you haven't seen them make sure you
00:28 - go and check them out for playlist link
00:29 - is in the description a for loop allows
00:31 - us to repeat code for every item in the
00:33 - sequence
00:34 - okay let's start coding okay I've just
00:37 - got open a new Python file an idle so
00:40 - let's create a list we'll call it my
00:42 - list equals let's see let's just have
00:49 - apple banana and orange okay
00:58 - and then we'll write for I in my list
01:06 - print I if we run it we get apple banana
01:12 - and orange so this valve has iterated
01:15 - over this sequence my list for every
01:19 - item in this list it runs this block of
01:22 - code which is prints I this I write here
01:25 - is a new variable we've created and it's
01:28 - common practice to color I because it
01:30 - it's just shot for index but if you
01:32 - wanted you can call it like cheeseburger
01:34 - or something it really doesn't matter
01:36 - what you call it the value of I is for
01:38 - current item of the sequence we are on
01:40 - so when were you run it I is equal to
01:44 - Apple and then we'll print how Apple
01:47 - then it moves on to the next item which
01:50 - is banana I is equal to banana now
01:52 - Savannah print out banana and then
01:54 - finally the last item in the list is
01:57 - orange so I is equal to orange and then
02:02 - we'll print our orange let's loop for a
02:04 - string actually so let's just get rid of
02:08 - this my string equals how
02:13 - then for I in my strength and then we'll
02:19 - change I to whatever we want so we'll
02:21 - just change it to yes
02:24 - in my string so pretty yes we could
02:27 - change it to whatever we want
02:28 - I'm gonna call it car for character so
02:34 - for car in my string print car and then
02:38 - we get each individual character in that
02:40 - string if you are enjoying the video so
02:43 - far or if you are finding it useful be
02:45 - sure to give this video like it really
02:47 - does help me out anyways let's talk
02:49 - about range to loop for a code block a
02:52 - certain number of times we use the range
02:54 - function and the range function returns
02:57 - a sequence of numbers and it starts at
03:00 - zero and works its way up one by one
03:02 - every time until it reaches a specified
03:04 - number so let's do that right now so we
03:08 - can do for I in range six print I then
03:21 - I'll print 0 1 2 3 4 5 because range
03:24 - starts at 0 all the way up to 6 but it
03:28 - doesn't include number 6 so range is
03:30 - literally just a sequence so now we can
03:34 - specify the start number free and maybe
03:37 - change this to 9 and then it will
03:40 - include the start number but it will
03:43 - include for the ending number and it
03:46 - increments the sequence by 1 each time
03:48 - so it's going from free all the way to 8
03:51 - what we can do is change the increment
03:54 - value so if we change this to 2 3 5 7 so
03:59 - it's starting at free adding to getting
04:01 - to 5 adding to multi into 7 and adding
04:05 - to more it'll get to 9 but it never
04:07 - prints out line because it doesn't
04:09 - include the nth number we can also do
04:13 - nested loops so that is a loop inside of
04:17 - a loop will create a list so x equals
04:20 - big yellow and pc and then y equals
04:27 - and orange and then we'll do for for I
04:31 - in x4 and then we can't use I in this
04:38 - nested folio because we've already
04:40 - defined I up here so I'll just do like
04:42 - for a my print I a then we'll get Big
04:52 - Apple big banana big orange yellow Apple
04:55 - yellow banana yellow orange and tasty
04:58 - Apple tasty banana tasty orange Vienna
05:01 - loop which is this loop will be executed
05:04 - one time for each iteration of the outer
05:06 - loop so it starts off on nest the first
05:09 - time and then it goes into this it
05:11 - repeats this three times and then moves
05:14 - on to the second iteration of the outer
05:15 - loop does this another three times and
05:18 - then finally moves on to the third
05:20 - iteration of this loop and does this
05:22 - another three times which is why we get
05:24 - nine print statements as you can see
05:26 - here okay that's pretty much it for for
05:30 - loops they are probably more useful than
05:32 - while loops as you'll see when you start
05:34 - programming more what you should do now
05:36 - is create some of your own for loops and
05:38 - comment them below to give people some
05:40 - of her ideas on how they can be used
05:42 - okay so I'm going to end the video here
05:45 - if you have any questions or comments be
05:46 - sure to leave them down below I'll be
05:48 - sure to reply if you would like to
05:50 - support me and what I do all you have to
05:52 - do is give this video a like it really
05:54 - just helped me out also consider
05:56 - subscribing I post Python content almost
05:59 - every day that's it from me Cheers and
06:01 - goodbye
