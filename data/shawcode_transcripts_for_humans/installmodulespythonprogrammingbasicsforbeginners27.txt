00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today i'm going to be showing you how to
00:04 - install third-party modules in python
00:07 - third-party modules are really useful in
00:09 - python and almost all of your python
00:11 - projects will need a third-party module
00:14 - for example if you want to make games
00:15 - with python you will need another module
00:17 - by the way i am currently making a
00:19 - python games tutorial
00:21 - it should be out soon if you want to do
00:23 - machine learning you will also need to
00:25 - download another third-party module for
00:27 - that
00:28 - so this is a really key skill to learn
00:30 - so make sure you stick around to the end
00:32 - of the video
00:33 - so we are just on the desktop now open
00:36 - up
00:36 - command prompt so command prompt
00:39 - here you need to type in pip so just pip
00:43 - and you should get all of this output
00:46 - right here
00:47 - however if you do get an error saying
00:49 - pip is not recognized or some sort of
00:52 - error
00:52 - just follow along right now because
00:54 - we're going to fix it even though it's
00:56 - working right now
00:57 - you want to search up python and you can
01:00 - see
01:00 - python 3.7 you might have python 3.8
01:04 - you want to right click on it open file
01:06 - location
01:07 - and then right click open file location
01:10 - and then you want to go up to scripts in
01:13 - this python37 folder
01:16 - and then click on the um path ctrl c
01:19 - or copy it okay we can minimize this
01:22 - and then we want to type in environment
01:24 - variables
01:27 - and here we go then we want to press on
01:29 - environment variables
01:31 - under system variables move down press
01:34 - on
01:34 - path edit and then you'll want to press
01:37 - new
01:38 - copy and paste that path in that we have
01:41 - just copied
01:42 - then press ok and as you can see i've
01:44 - already got mine in here
01:46 - c colon slash program file slash python
01:48 - three seven slash scripts
01:50 - press okay okay okay now you should be
01:54 - good to go
01:55 - so when we go back into command prompt
01:57 - we should be able to type in
01:58 - i'm just going to clear it pip and valio
02:02 - so now to install some modules let's
02:05 - just
02:06 - test this out with a module that is used
02:08 - for making web applications which is
02:10 - called flask
02:11 - if you would like me to make a tutorial
02:14 - series on how to make websites for
02:15 - python drop a like on this video i'll
02:17 - leave a comment saying you want to see
02:18 - it
02:19 - okay so to install flask we'll do
02:22 - pip install flask
02:27 - and as you can see requirement already
02:29 - satisfied
02:30 - it's because i've already got a flask
02:32 - installed you should
02:34 - get like some texting installing and
02:36 - stuff okay
02:37 - so now to test that we have installed
02:39 - flask successfully or
02:41 - to test if you've installed any module
02:42 - correctly you'll want to go into idle
02:45 - into the python shell and then we'll do
02:48 - import flask
02:53 - and then you can see we don't get any
02:55 - errors so that means flask has been
02:57 - imported successfully
02:59 - if we were to import a random module
03:02 - no module named this because it hasn't
03:06 - been installed and it probably doesn't
03:07 - exist anyway
03:08 - and if you do get an error go back and
03:10 - run the pip command again
03:11 - pip install the module name and then it
03:13 - should work
03:14 - okay that's it for installing modules
03:16 - i'm going to end the video here
03:18 - drop a like in this video if it helps
03:20 - you out it really does help me out
03:22 - if you would like to see a flask
03:23 - tutorial where i teach you how to make a
03:25 - website make sure to drop a comment
03:26 - saying you want to see one
03:28 - also consider subscribing i post python
03:30 - content almost every day
03:32 - that's it from me cheers and goodbye
