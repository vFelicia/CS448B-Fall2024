00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to show
00:02 - code this is the eighth video on my
00:03 - Python basics tutorial series today we
00:06 - will be learning about casting what is
00:09 - casting casting is where you convert a
00:12 - variable from one data type to another
00:14 - for example if I had an integer and I
00:17 - wanted it to be a string I would cast it
00:19 - from an integer to a string okay let's
00:21 - get programming ok so first things first
00:24 - as you know we need to open up Idol then
00:29 - open up a new file ok so the start is
00:34 - let's just create a variable called my
00:37 - variable equals 5 ok and then we'll
00:45 - write my new variable equals STR my
00:52 - variable and what this does here is it
00:55 - converts it from an integer which we
00:58 - have made up here into a string so my
01:01 - new variable equal is a string and it's
01:05 - equal to my variable which is 5 but it's
01:08 - a string so if we print out print my new
01:16 - variable save it run it we get 5 I know
01:21 - you couldn't really tell that it was
01:23 - actually a string so we can prove it
01:25 - it's a string by adding an integer to it
01:28 - so we'll just do plus 4 save it and run
01:31 - it and we can get this error you can
01:34 - only concatenate a string to a string
01:37 - not an integer which is what we've done
01:39 - here so let's look at some of our
01:42 - examples like so let's just create my
01:46 - variable equals 1 2 3 and to convert
01:53 - that into an into an integer we do my my
02:01 - new variable equals int my variable but
02:08 - we can print out my new variable
02:15 - Plus and a number seven we'll run it oh
02:20 - hang on let's just get rid of this first
02:22 - so we don't get an error so you've let
02:25 - run it we get 130 and you can see but
02:29 - it's successfully added together two
02:32 - numbers which means that my very my new
02:34 - variable has to be an integer so we can
02:38 - also do some things with floats so let's
02:43 - just get rid of s my variable equals
02:53 - make a string 42.1 my new variable
02:59 - equals float my variable friends my new
03:10 - variable plus four point two four point
03:17 - two one save it run it oh yeah forty six
03:22 - point three one so it's got this string
03:24 - and converted it into a floating point
03:28 - number and we've added another floating
03:30 - point number four point two one to get
03:34 - forty six point three one so to recap to
03:39 - comfort something to a string its STR to
03:43 - comfort it into an integer it's int and
03:45 - to convert something to a floating point
03:47 - number you use float server syntax is
03:53 - happy variable surround the in these
03:56 - brackets and then put your conversion I
04:00 - guess you can call it your conversion
04:02 - keyword I guess before it for example
04:05 - int or float okay now for some
04:08 - challenges for you to do by yourself as
04:10 - you know I'm gonna be doing a video
04:11 - giving the solutions to B's so firstly
04:15 - create a string variable and cast it to
04:17 - an integer and prints out and a little
04:19 - hint the string must be numbers only
04:21 - otherwise you'll get an error
04:24 - an integer variable cast it to a string
04:26 - and concatenate it with another string
04:28 - and print it and create a float variable
04:30 - and cast it to an integer and print out
04:32 - that's all for today guys if you have
04:35 - any questions or errors leave them in
04:37 - the comment section below if you enjoyed
04:39 - be sure to give a video a like and
04:41 - subscribe to the channel turn on
04:43 - notifications as well so you never miss
04:45 - a video thanks for watching
