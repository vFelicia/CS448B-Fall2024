00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to the fourth
00:02 - video of my Python basics tutorial
00:04 - series if you haven't seen in the
00:06 - previous episodes then go and check them
00:08 - out the playlist link is in the
00:09 - description today we'll be learning
00:11 - about user input
00:13 - now user input allows a user of the
00:16 - program to type something in and then we
00:18 - can use the data that they typed in in
00:20 - the program so let's get programming so
00:24 - the first thing you want to do is open
00:26 - up idle but you want to go to file new
00:30 - file and here we go ok so now we can do
00:36 - type in in input what is your name and
00:48 - save it ok now I forget to run run
00:52 - module you can see what is your name my
00:54 - name is Caleb and there we go we've just
00:57 - got user input ok so how do we actually
00:59 - do input
01:00 - well we type in this input statement so
01:04 - we type in input then in bracket and
01:07 - then brackets right next to it then
01:09 - inside that we have speech marks and
01:12 - then what we want to ask us like the
01:14 - question now at the moment it's not very
01:18 - useful is it so what we can do is we can
01:21 - convert this into a variable by typing
01:24 - your name equals input so now we've just
01:27 - created a variable called name and
01:30 - inside this variable is this input
01:33 - statement when we can do print hello
01:40 - name and both we save it run it what is
01:45 - your name my name is Caleb hello Caleb
01:49 - now we can also do age equals input how
01:55 - old are you
01:58 - I just got the space in Vienna just so
02:03 - it looks nicer and we can do hello name
02:06 - comma . you you are age yes old closing
02:23 - speech marks now if we run it what is
02:28 - your name my name is Caleb how old are
02:31 - you I am 13 hello Caleb you are 13 years
02:36 - old and we've got bad formatting we can
02:41 - just get rid of this we can actually use
02:44 - A+ fair because we do not want a space
02:46 - in between the name and the . what is
02:50 - your name Caleb how old are you I am 13
02:53 - hello Caleb you are 13 years old
02:58 - so now for some challenges for you to do
03:00 - by yourself have two variables that come
03:04 - both contain inputs and we each get one
03:06 - number then using the skills we have
03:08 - learned in the last videos print out the
03:11 - variables added together secondly have
03:15 - two input variables ask for two words
03:17 - and then prints them out together in one
03:19 - print statement and thirdly have three
03:23 - input variables asking different
03:24 - questions and then print your answers
03:27 - were and then all the answers um put it
03:29 - in one print statement so that's all for
03:32 - today guys I know it was quite short and
03:34 - simple and make sure to stay tuned for
03:36 - the next tutorial by subscribing
03:38 - interesting feybelle so you won't miss
03:39 - the next episode also drop a like if
03:41 - this helped you out it helps me out a
03:43 - lot if you have any questions about
03:45 - Python or need some help with any errors
03:48 - be sure to leave it in the comment
03:49 - section below I'll be sure to help you
03:51 - out any suggestions or feedback would be
