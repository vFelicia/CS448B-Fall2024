00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to the second
00:01 - video of my Python basics tutorial
00:03 - series if you haven't seen my first
00:05 - video in the series then go and check
00:07 - out the playlist link is in the
00:09 - description today we'll be learning
00:11 - about variables in Python now what is a
00:14 - variable or you can think of variables
00:16 - as a container that holds different data
00:18 - values whether it might be a string
00:21 - which is text integers which is a whole
00:24 - number or floats which are numbers with
00:26 - a decimal what's the point of them well
00:29 - they can be used multiple times
00:31 - throughout a program instead of typing
00:33 - out the same value a ton of times in
00:34 - different parts of a program okay so
00:36 - let's get on to programming we want to
00:39 - do is open up idle I have my idle a bit
00:43 - bigger just so you can guys can see it
00:44 - easier you want to go to file new file I
00:47 - could just hit ctrl N and there we go so
00:53 - what do we want to do now can do x
00:56 - equals nice variable now this is a
01:03 - variable and then what we can do is y
01:08 - equals I don't know let's just say
01:11 - random number 21 so these here are
01:15 - variables and what we can do now is we
01:19 - can use what we learnt in the last
01:21 - tutorial printing so you can type print
01:23 - and let's print X notice how we do not
01:28 - have speech marks around the X as if we
01:31 - did have speech marks around the X this
01:33 - is what would happen if we save it just
01:35 - save it somewhere if we do have speech
01:41 - marks around the X if we go to run
01:43 - we're in module which runs the program
01:46 - we just get first it just prints out the
01:49 - letter X which we don't want so what we
01:52 - can do is we can remove these speech
01:54 - marks and then we get nice variable what
01:59 - it's doing here is it's saying print X
02:04 - and it's looking for X cuz it's not got
02:07 - the speech marks it's looking for the
02:09 - variable X which it is seen up here so
02:12 - it's like Oh
02:13 - is nice variable so let's print out nice
02:17 - variable as we can see here so how about
02:22 - now we do friends why say that
02:28 - run run module or just here five no
02:32 - choice we got nice variable and then 21
02:36 - because y equals 21 printing y and y is
02:41 - 21 so it prints out why so how about now
02:45 - we do print hello but we'll just print
02:51 - out the two variables and hello but what
02:57 - we can do is hello
02:58 - and then after after the speech marks
03:00 - comma x now let's see what this will do
03:08 - hello nice variable so what's it's doing
03:12 - here is it's printing out hello just as
03:15 - we learnt in last episode then it's
03:18 - saying let's also print out X which is
03:21 - nice variable run it hello nice variable
03:27 - cost of comma what it does is it sort of
03:30 - adds it together what we can also do
03:33 - instead of a comma we can do prints hey
03:38 - they can do plus X and then close off
03:42 - bring it hey nice variable as you can
03:46 - see there's actually no space advice
03:49 - because a comma produces a space in
03:53 - between whereas pause produces no space
03:55 - it just shoves it right together so if
03:57 - we did want to use a space what we could
03:59 - do is we could just put a space between
04:01 - hey and the closing speech marks and
04:05 - that would print out a space so how we
04:09 - actually write a variable is we write
04:11 - the name of the variable which is it in
04:13 - our case is X then we follow up with an
04:20 - equals which says like x equals the
04:23 - variable it assigns the data to the
04:27 - variable
04:27 - then after the equals we write what
04:31 - dates all you want whether that's a
04:33 - integer or a string and tougher
04:36 - variables are string you need to have
04:38 - speech marks around it which indicates
04:40 - where there is a string which is text a
04:42 - string is text so X is a string variable
04:48 - if we want an integer or a float
04:51 - we cannot just have the number itself
04:53 - without any speech marks so now for some
04:56 - challenges to do by yourself I will be
04:58 - giving the solutions in a later video
05:00 - make program footprints also variable
05:02 - whether it be a string an integer or a
05:05 - float and secondly make a program that
05:08 - prints out two variables or strings in
05:10 - the same print function and then make a
05:15 - program for adds together an integer and
05:18 - a variable that as an integer so that's
05:23 - all for today guys make sure to stay
05:25 - tuned for the next tutorial by
05:26 - subscribing and hitting the bell also
05:28 - drop a like if this helped you out and
05:30 - it helps me out a lot if you have any
05:32 - questions about with Python I'll need
05:33 - some help with any errors be sure to
05:35 - leave it in the comment section below
05:36 - I'll be sure to help you out any
05:38 - suggestions or feedback would also be
05:40 - greatly appreciated because this is my
05:42 - first few videos so I'm doing and thanks
05:45 - for watching
