00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show
00:02 - codes today we'll be learning about
00:03 - while loops in Python we will be now
00:07 - moving on to the next batch of videos I
00:10 - have decided that you guys will probably
00:12 - be somewhat comfortable with Python now
00:14 - and you should be able to pick up
00:16 - concepts easier so I have decided that I
00:18 - will be no longer be saying challenges
00:21 - at the end of videos but I'll be
00:22 - dedicating one video every so often
00:24 - setting one fairly big challenge
00:26 - incorporating things we have learned
00:28 - about so far and I will give you the
00:30 - solution to the challenge in the same
00:32 - video okay now onto the topic of this
00:35 - video while loops why are they they do
00:38 - something while something is true in
00:41 - other words it keeps on repeating itself
00:43 - forever until the condition is false
00:45 - it's like an if statement but instead of
00:48 - doing it once it does it over and over
00:50 - again so because it's like an if
00:53 - statement we can use conditional
00:54 - operators and logical operators if you
00:57 - have no idea what they are I recommend
00:59 - you go and watch those videos a card
01:01 - will appear on the top right linking you
01:03 - to them and will also be the playlist
01:06 - link in the description okay you know
01:08 - it's got on to some programming okay so
01:10 - first thing you want to do is open up
01:12 - idle get a new file let's just set up
01:17 - some variables first let's just have my
01:21 - variable equals 6
01:27 - while my there variable is less than 20
01:34 - print print my variable in fact I set my
01:39 - variable here to 0 my variable actually
01:45 - let's do print count is at
01:53 - my count is at my variable and then we
02:01 - can do my variable plus equals one so
02:08 - let's save this now okay
02:11 - we've saved it now we run it f5 as you
02:14 - can see we've got old piece counties up
02:16 - one two three four five six seven eight
02:18 - nine ten and so on until we hit nineteen
02:20 - let me just explain this for you
02:22 - so my variable equals zero while my
02:25 - variable is less than twenty which is
02:27 - let's move on to this code block right
02:30 - here print count is at my variable just
02:35 - concatenating it together my variable
02:38 - which is zero and though we're doing my
02:41 - variable plus equals one we're just
02:42 - adding on one to my variable so my
02:46 - variables now at one then we go back to
02:49 - the top because it's a while loop so we
02:51 - keep on doing it until something my
02:54 - variable is less than 20 it's at one now
02:56 - print count is a one my variable plus
03:00 - equals one we keep on doing this until
03:03 - we get to 19 so when we get to nineteen
03:06 - is still less than 20 print counters at
03:09 - nineteen my variable plus equals one is
03:12 - now at 20 while my variable is less than
03:16 - 20 but it's not Western 20 anymore it's
03:19 - equal to 20 so we miss all of this and
03:22 - then we move out of the loop so if we
03:24 - just print at the bottom we have
03:27 - finished when it's now equal or bigger
03:32 - than 20 it will now move out of this
03:35 - loop and continue with the code
03:37 - underneath that loop so if we just run
03:39 - it again you can see it says loop has
03:42 - finished because it's been out all the
03:44 - way through up until 20 it's broken the
03:47 - loop and it's moved on to this code
03:49 - underneath so so let's just move on to
03:53 - some of the syntax of a while loop so as
03:56 - you can see we start off with this
03:58 - keyword while keywords are highlighted
04:00 - in
04:02 - orange like this import don't worry what
04:05 - that means though we're focusing on this
04:07 - wild so it used wild to self as its
04:11 - saying that this is a while loop and
04:13 - then follow about with the condition my
04:17 - variable is less than twenty but it's a
04:19 - condition and then after that you have
04:22 - this : to declare the things that are
04:25 - indented underneath this are going to be
04:27 - part of the while loop so we can have
04:30 - this condition and logical operators
04:32 - this entire string here then : and then
04:36 - indented code underneath tissue but it's
04:38 - part of a while loop and this code can
04:40 - be anything you want as long as it's
04:42 - valid pipe and code it will keep on
04:45 - running this code block until this
04:47 - condition up here is false just like an
04:50 - if statement if you want it to run
04:52 - forever we can just replace all of this
04:54 - with true long true five and it will
05:00 - just go on forever because while true
05:04 - it's always going to be true it's never
05:05 - going to be false and it will just run
05:07 - infinitely and it's never going to get
05:10 - onto this loop has finished because it's
05:12 - as I said it's just going on forever
05:14 - okay guys thanks for watching the video
05:17 - if you have any questions or comments
05:18 - feel free to leave them in the comment

hello everyone welcome back to show codes today we'll be learning about while loops in Python we will be now moving on to the next batch of videos I have decided that you guys will probably be somewhat comfortable with Python now and you should be able to pick up concepts easier so I have decided that I will be no longer be saying challenges at the end of videos but I'll be dedicating one video every so often setting one fairly big challenge incorporating things we have learned about so far and I will give you the solution to the challenge in the same video okay now onto the topic of this video while loops why are they they do something while something is true in other words it keeps on repeating itself forever until the condition is false it's like an if statement but instead of doing it once it does it over and over again so because it's like an if statement we can use conditional operators and logical operators if you have no idea what they are I recommend you go and watch those videos a card will appear on the top right linking you to them and will also be the playlist link in the description okay you know it's got on to some programming okay so first thing you want to do is open up idle get a new file let's just set up some variables first let's just have my variable equals 6 while my there variable is less than 20 print print my variable in fact I set my variable here to 0 my variable actually let's do print count is at my count is at my variable and then we can do my variable plus equals one so let's save this now okay we've saved it now we run it f5 as you can see we've got old piece counties up one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and so on until we hit nineteen let me just explain this for you so my variable equals zero while my variable is less than twenty which is let's move on to this code block right here print count is at my variable just concatenating it together my variable which is zero and though we're doing my variable plus equals one we're just adding on one to my variable so my variables now at one then we go back to the top because it's a while loop so we keep on doing it until something my variable is less than 20 it's at one now print count is a one my variable plus equals one we keep on doing this until we get to 19 so when we get to nineteen is still less than 20 print counters at nineteen my variable plus equals one is now at 20 while my variable is less than 20 but it's not Western 20 anymore it's equal to 20 so we miss all of this and then we move out of the loop so if we just print at the bottom we have finished when it's now equal or bigger than 20 it will now move out of this loop and continue with the code underneath that loop so if we just run it again you can see it says loop has finished because it's been out all the way through up until 20 it's broken the loop and it's moved on to this code underneath so so let's just move on to some of the syntax of a while loop so as you can see we start off with this keyword while keywords are highlighted in orange like this import don't worry what that means though we're focusing on this wild so it used wild to self as its saying that this is a while loop and then follow about with the condition my variable is less than twenty but it's a condition and then after that you have this to declare the things that are indented underneath this are going to be part of the while loop so we can have this condition and logical operators this entire string here then and then indented code underneath tissue but it's part of a while loop and this code can be anything you want as long as it's valid pipe and code it will keep on running this code block until this condition up here is false just like an if statement if you want it to run forever we can just replace all of this with true long true five and it will just go on forever because while true it's always going to be true it's never going to be false and it will just run infinitely and it's never going to get onto this loop has finished because it's as I said it's just going on forever okay guys thanks for watching the video if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them in the comment section below I'll try to reply to them all if you haven't seen the other videos in this series and are interested varies a playlist link in the description also come please consider subscribing to my channel it's completely free drop a like if you enjoyed it helps me how up that's all from me Cheers and goodbye
