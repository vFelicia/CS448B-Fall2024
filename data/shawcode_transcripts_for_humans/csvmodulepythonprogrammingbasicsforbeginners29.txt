00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - today I'm going to be teaching you how
00:04 - to use CSV files in Python for this we
00:06 - will be using a built-in module the csv
00:09 - module the csv file as witchly just
00:12 - means comma separated variable okay so
00:14 - this is fairly similar to reading text
00:16 - files in this video we will be opening
00:19 - files a slightly different way and this
00:21 - way is a bit cleaner and you can also
00:23 - open text files this way as well as CSV
00:26 - files so I've just got a CSV file here
00:29 - with some variables that have been
00:31 - separated by commas the comma is what's
00:33 - known as a delimiter and you don't have
00:36 - to use the commercial delimiter but it's
00:38 - just common practice to use commas you
00:40 - could just use pythons split function
00:42 - but the csv module makes it a lot easier
00:44 - okay so the first thing we need to do is
00:46 - import the CSV module solely imports
00:50 - Lesley then use with open which is
00:53 - another way of opening text files or CSV
00:57 - files sorted with open csv file names so
01:01 - mines values dot CSV and then we'll want
01:05 - to open it in read mode as let's just do
01:08 - it as F which is short for file this F
01:11 - here is equal to V open of values CSV
01:15 - and then under that will create a
01:17 - variable called C CSV reso CSV read set
01:22 - for equal to CSV reader and the argument
01:27 - should be a file name which in our case
01:28 - is F and for delimiter which in our case
01:31 - is a comma this will read out all the
01:35 - CSV data
01:36 - now let's iterate through each line in
01:39 - the CSV file so for line in CSV read
01:44 - print line oh yeah accidentally spell
01:48 - CSV wrong CSV read and also you need to
01:51 - add delimiter equals there and then we
01:55 - get hello there general Kenobi you are a
02:01 - bold one dot dot these extra items in
02:05 - the list because I have got commerce on
02:08 - the end which I shouldn't have comments
02:12 - on the end of my file
02:13 - so if we save up and run and there we go
02:15 - we've got hello there general Kenobi you
02:17 - are a bold one nice a prequel mean
02:20 - reference and we don't have these empty
02:22 - strings anymore as you can see each line
02:25 - is a list and each comma separated
02:27 - variable is an item in the list and
02:29 - these are all strings so if you're going
02:32 - to be doing any math operations make
02:34 - sure to cast them to an integer before
02:36 - doing so so we've just got multiple
02:39 - lists and of course we can manipulate
02:41 - these lists append the items of lists to
02:44 - other lists we can do whatever we want
02:46 - with these so you might want to append
02:48 - the first item of each row to a separate
02:50 - list so what we'll do is create a new
02:53 - list just call it my less equals and
02:59 - then we'll do wine sorry my list my list
03:05 - dot append let's see what shall we
03:09 - append we'll do y in 0 and then
03:16 - underneath that print my list and we'll
03:24 - get hello general you are a 1 because if
03:27 - we look back into our file hello general
03:30 - you are a 1 okay so that's pretty much
03:33 - it for the CSV module I didn't cover
03:35 - much but that is really all you need to
03:37 - know while using the csv module once you
03:39 - have access to your data from your csv
03:41 - it's all about using lists or
03:43 - dictionaries and manipulating those and
03:45 - if you haven't seen those videos where I
03:47 - talk about weston dictionaries or as a
03:49 - playlist link in the description if you
03:51 - would like to support me all you have to
03:53 - do is drop a like on this video it
03:54 - really does help me out also consider
03:56 - subscribing I post Python content almost
03:59 - every day that's it from me Cheers and
04:01 - goodbye
