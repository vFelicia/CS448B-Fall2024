00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to show code
00:02 - in this video I'll be showing you how to
00:04 - use the built-in module OS which is
00:06 - short for operating system this module
00:09 - comes installed with - so there's no
00:11 - need to install it with pit so the OS
00:14 - module allows you to control and
00:15 - interacts with your operating system
00:17 - whether that be Windows Mac or Linux and
00:20 - we can do things like create directories
00:22 - move directories copy directories all
00:25 - that good stuff ok let's jump right into
00:27 - it
00:27 - so I have a new python file here and the
00:30 - first thing we need to do is import the
00:32 - module so we do import OS and then to
00:35 - get the current directory that we are in
00:37 - we use the function OS dot get CWD so
00:42 - print OS stop CWD oh sorry I missed get
00:48 - get here get CWD then we get the file
00:53 - puffier which is C uses Caleb desktop
00:57 - important files YouTube Shaco
00:59 - programming python basics what this CWD
01:01 - stands for is current working directory
01:03 - in other words it's basically just for
01:06 - folder this Python follows in right now
01:08 - we can make a new directory by using
01:11 - Oeste mkdir so Oeste mkdir and then the
01:17 - parameter you will want to use is the
01:19 - name of the new directory so I'm just
01:21 - gonna call it new dir then run it and we
01:26 - can see we've got new dir and now let's
01:29 - rename that new directory let's just
01:31 - actually comment this print out
01:32 - statement to rename that directory you
01:36 - use OS dot rename so OS stock rename the
01:41 - first parameter needs to be the current
01:43 - name of the directory so in our case
01:45 - it's going to be new de and then the new
01:48 - name the name but we're renaming it to
01:50 - will be you the renamed we need to
01:55 - comment this out as well and we don't
01:58 - get any output but if we go to there we
02:01 - get new de renamed and then finally to
02:04 - delete this directory we can use OS dot
02:09 - rmdir so OS da rmdir
02:12 - and then it's going to be new di re
02:17 - names but if we run it we no longer have
02:23 - that directory it's being removed okay
02:27 - that was just an overview of the OS
02:28 - module it is a great way to control the
02:30 - operating system with Python there are
02:33 - more functions to cover but nothing else
02:34 - a bit beyond this tutorial I will leave
02:37 - a link in the description to the OS
02:40 - documentation so you can learn a few
02:41 - more functions but this is just sort of
02:44 - the important stuff that's most commonly
02:46 - used with vos module if you found this
02:48 - video useful please do drop a like it
02:50 - really does help me out also consider
02:52 - subscribing I post - Compson almost
02:54 - every day that's it from me
02:56 - Cheers and goodbye
