00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to shore
00:02 - code today we'll be going back a bit and
00:04 - talking a little bit more about
00:06 - functions
00:07 - more specifically function parameter
00:09 - defaults so let's get right into it so
00:12 - usually when we are making a function we
00:15 - were just putting our parameters so if
00:16 - we do define test root out some promises
00:21 - earth straight string 1 3 to bring when
00:30 - let's do an a string print no it's not
00:34 - actually print string 1 string string -
00:40 - let me go test hello and then if we run
00:48 - it we get hello there so we are put our
00:51 - function parameters here which I like
00:53 - are placeholders and when we call it we
00:56 - pass the arguments now let's create a
00:58 - function and have two parameters so
01:01 - define test2 string 1 and the second
01:06 - parameter can be string 2 equals yes and
01:14 - now we print don't honestly come on
01:16 - print string 1 string - test - and now
01:25 - let's pass in string 1 so we'll do hello
01:29 - and then let's just ignore string 2 and
01:32 - see what happens
01:34 - hello yes we haven't even passed yes
01:38 - what is going on
01:39 - well we're passing string 1 here so
01:42 - that's going to there and then string 2
01:44 - has seen very it's not actually getting
01:47 - passed anything so it's defaulting to
01:49 - the string yes so this is a function
01:52 - parameter default when we call the
01:55 - function we don't have to pass two
01:56 - parameters if we don't want to we just
01:58 - pass the one that doesn't have a default
02:00 - value which in our case is the first
02:02 - argument so yes is our default value if
02:06 - we don't pass anything so if we go back
02:09 - to our call statement and right there
02:13 - let me just comment this out as well you
02:15 - don't need this anymore
02:18 - we'll get hello there so if there is a
02:21 - argument that's passed it will override
02:24 - the default but if there isn't one the
02:26 - default will kick in well you might be
02:28 - thinking what is the point of this well
02:31 - a good example is when you are creating
02:32 - a function but for example makes a house
02:35 - you will need some compulsory parameters
02:38 - like width length height etc that you
02:41 - will have some parameters that aren't
02:42 - compulsory and can be written as
02:44 - defaults for example a dining room not
02:46 - everyone would want a dining room and
02:48 - the default might be set to false but
02:50 - when you are calling your house to be
02:52 - built you might want to have a dining
02:53 - room and you want that to be true so you
02:55 - overwrite it and you also might be
02:57 - thinking what happens if we have
02:58 - multiple default parameters so if we are
03:01 - straying 3 equals there well what
03:08 - happens if I want to override if I want
03:11 - to override string 3 but I don't want to
03:14 - override string 2 if I just pass some
03:18 - random stuff it will overwrite string 2
03:21 - all we need to bring stream 3 as well it
03:24 - will overwrite string 2 but I didn't
03:26 - want it to do that so what we have to do
03:28 - is write string 3 equals some text hello
03:32 - yes al k yeah so what we're doing here
03:36 - is we're specifying which one we want to
03:38 - override because if we didn't specify it
03:41 - it would just assume that we're
03:43 - overriding string 2 which we're not we
03:45 - don't want to do this so it is doing 3
03:48 - equals that okay that's it for function
03:51 - parameters I forgot to cook of them
03:52 - while we were going over functions if
03:54 - you like to support me all you have to
03:56 - do is give this video like it really
03:58 - does help me out also consider
04:00 - subscribing I - content almost every day
04:02 - that's it from me
04:04 - Cheers and goodbye
