hello everyone welcome back to shore code today we'll be going back a bit and talking a little bit more about functions more specifically function parameter defaults so let's get right into it so usually when we are making a function we were just putting our parameters so if we do define test root out some promises earth straight string 1 3 to bring when let's do an a string print no it's not actually print string 1 string string let me go test hello and then if we run it we get hello there so we are put our function parameters here which I like are placeholders and when we call it we pass the arguments now let's create a function and have two parameters so define test2 string 1 and the second parameter can be string 2 equals yes and now we print don't honestly come on print string 1 string test and now let's pass in string 1 so we'll do hello and then let's just ignore string 2 and see what happens hello yes we haven't even passed yes what is going on well we're passing string 1 here so that's going to there and then string 2 has seen very it's not actually getting passed anything so it's defaulting to the string yes so this is a function parameter default when we call the function we don't have to pass two parameters if we don't want to we just pass the one that doesn't have a default value which in our case is the first argument so yes is our default value if we don't pass anything so if we go back to our call statement and right there let me just comment this out as well you don't need this anymore we'll get hello there so if there is a argument that's passed it will override the default but if there isn't one the default will kick in well you might be thinking what is the point of this well a good example is when you are creating a function but for example makes a house you will need some compulsory parameters like width length height etc that you will have some parameters that aren't compulsory and can be written as defaults for example a dining room not everyone would want a dining room and the default might be set to false but when you are calling your house to be built you might want to have a dining room and you want that to be true so you overwrite it and you also might be thinking what happens if we have multiple default parameters so if we are straying 3 equals there well what happens if I want to override if I want to override string 3 but I don't want to override string 2 if I just pass some random stuff it will overwrite string 2 all we need to bring stream 3 as well it will overwrite string 2 but I didn't want it to do that so what we have to do is write string 3 equals some text hello yes al k yeah so what we're doing here is we're specifying which one we want to override because if we didn't specify it it would just assume that we're overriding string 2 which we're not we don't want to do this so it is doing 3 equals that okay that's it for function parameters I forgot to cook of them while we were going over functions if you like to support me all you have to do is give this video like it really does help me out also consider subscribing I content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
