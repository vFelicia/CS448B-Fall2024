hello everyone welcome back to show code in this video I will be teaching you about scope I have lots of experience in Python and by the end of this video you'll know what scope is and how to use it properly so a variable is only available from inside the region is created this is called scope what I mean by this is for example if you have a variable inside a function you can only access that variable from inside the function and variable is local to that function so if we have a function just define my func X equals 5 print X my phone and run it you can see we get 5 but what happens if we were to move this print statement from inside the function to outside the function X is not defined because this X variable inside this function only exists inside of this function it's a local variable belonging to this function this is what we call a local scope if we wanted to get this value from the function we could just return it return X and then we could do x equals my phone which print X and there we go now let's make a nested function so define my night func yeah we can have functions inside of functions and we can print x y equals to print Y then let's call my phone then my funk run de and we get 5 and 2 so the inner function can access variables that belong to the outer function and it can also access its own variables but then if we were to print Y you can see Y is not defined this is because Y only exists in this function now let's talk about global scope if variable is created in the main part of the Python code it is called a global variable and belongs a global scope and visa available from within any scope global and local so if we just do X equals seven define my phone for its X my code we get seven because this function can access the global variable if you are enjoying the video or are finding it useful please do drop a like it really does help me out anyway naming variables alright let's just make a equal to seven then define my phone a equals to print a print a my what do you think's going to happen will get seven and two because we're printing out a appear which is seven and phone we're printing out a here so as far as this print statement is concerned a doesn't exist because this is part of the global scope and this is local scope but we can still print a here because a is defined inside this function so these just don't override each other cassettes in separate scopes alright let's now talk about a global keyword if you need to create a global variable but you're in the local scope you can use the global keyword and this makes the variable global so let's just get rid of this let's do define F equals 20 if we print F we get an error because F isn't defined if we do global F so we've made this global but now we need to call the function so it exists and then we get 20 because if we don't have a function it doesn't exist but if we do a function it does exist so you can also use a global keyword if you want to make a change to a global variable inside the function so if we have like F equals 30 print F we get 30 and then 20 this global keyword and this F equals 20 over our disk global variable here and then changes it to 20 however I wouldn't recommend using for global keyword if you just want to give a functional global variable you should just pass it in as an argument like this if we wanted to give it if we wanted to give it F we could just bunk F okay you know it's just a lot easier that way and if you wanted to get a local variable back from the function you should just return it so we could modify a key close equals 10 return yeah and then you could do far away we get 40 so this way using arguments and returning it doesn't get really confusing because when you start mixing up local and global variables it does get quite complicated so one recommend it ok that's pretty much it for scope if you have any questions or comments about this belief it in the comment section I'll be sure to apply if you would like to support me all you have to do is give this video I like it really does help me out also consider subscribing I'm a blood Python tehn almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
