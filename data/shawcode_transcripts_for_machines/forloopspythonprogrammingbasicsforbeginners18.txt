hello everyone welcome back to show code today I'm going to be teaching you how to create use under play for loops in Python I have lots of experience in Python and by the end of this video you are a really good understanding of what Felipe's are and how to use them for loops are used to iterate over a sequence vice i've released a tuple a set or a dictionary or a string we learn about all these in the past few videos if you haven't seen them make sure you go and check them out for playlist link is in the description a for loop allows us to repeat code for every item in the sequence okay let's start coding okay I've just got open a new Python file an idle so let's create a list we'll call it my list equals let's see let's just have apple banana and orange okay and then we'll write for I in my list print I if we run it we get apple banana and orange so this valve has iterated over this sequence my list for every item in this list it runs this block of code which is prints I this I write here is a new variable we've created and it's common practice to color I because it it's just shot for index but if you wanted you can call it like cheeseburger or something it really doesn't matter what you call it the value of I is for current item of the sequence we are on so when were you run it I is equal to Apple and then we'll print how Apple then it moves on to the next item which is banana I is equal to banana now Savannah print out banana and then finally the last item in the list is orange so I is equal to orange and then we'll print our orange let's loop for a string actually so let's just get rid of this my string equals how then for I in my strength and then we'll change I to whatever we want so we'll just change it to yes in my string so pretty yes we could change it to whatever we want I'm gonna call it car for character so for car in my string print car and then we get each individual character in that string if you are enjoying the video so far or if you are finding it useful be sure to give this video like it really does help me out anyways let's talk about range to loop for a code block a certain number of times we use the range function and the range function returns a sequence of numbers and it starts at zero and works its way up one by one every time until it reaches a specified number so let's do that right now so we can do for I in range six print I then I'll print 0 1 2 3 4 5 because range starts at 0 all the way up to 6 but it doesn't include number 6 so range is literally just a sequence so now we can specify the start number free and maybe change this to 9 and then it will include the start number but it will include for the ending number and it increments the sequence by 1 each time so it's going from free all the way to 8 what we can do is change the increment value so if we change this to 2 3 5 7 so it's starting at free adding to getting to 5 adding to multi into 7 and adding to more it'll get to 9 but it never prints out line because it doesn't include the nth number we can also do nested loops so that is a loop inside of a loop will create a list so x equals big yellow and pc and then y equals and orange and then we'll do for for I in x4 and then we can't use I in this nested folio because we've already defined I up here so I'll just do like for a my print I a then we'll get Big Apple big banana big orange yellow Apple yellow banana yellow orange and tasty Apple tasty banana tasty orange Vienna loop which is this loop will be executed one time for each iteration of the outer loop so it starts off on nest the first time and then it goes into this it repeats this three times and then moves on to the second iteration of the outer loop does this another three times and then finally moves on to the third iteration of this loop and does this another three times which is why we get nine print statements as you can see here okay that's pretty much it for for loops they are probably more useful than while loops as you'll see when you start programming more what you should do now is create some of your own for loops and comment them below to give people some of her ideas on how they can be used okay so I'm going to end the video here if you have any questions or comments be sure to leave them down below I'll be sure to reply if you would like to support me and what I do all you have to do is give this video a like it really just helped me out also consider subscribing I post Python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
