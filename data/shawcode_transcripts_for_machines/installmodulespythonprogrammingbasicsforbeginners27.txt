hello everyone welcome back to show code today i'm going to be showing you how to install thirdparty modules in python thirdparty modules are really useful in python and almost all of your python projects will need a thirdparty module for example if you want to make games with python you will need another module by the way i am currently making a python games tutorial it should be out soon if you want to do machine learning you will also need to download another thirdparty module for that so this is a really key skill to learn so make sure you stick around to the end of the video so we are just on the desktop now open up command prompt so command prompt here you need to type in pip so just pip and you should get all of this output right here however if you do get an error saying pip is not recognized or some sort of error just follow along right now because we're going to fix it even though it's working right now you want to search up python and you can see python 3.7 you might have python 3.8 you want to right click on it open file location and then right click open file location and then you want to go up to scripts in this python37 folder and then click on the um path ctrl c or copy it okay we can minimize this and then we want to type in environment variables and here we go then we want to press on environment variables under system variables move down press on path edit and then you'll want to press new copy and paste that path in that we have just copied then press ok and as you can see i've already got mine in here c colon slash program file slash python three seven slash scripts press okay okay okay now you should be good to go so when we go back into command prompt we should be able to type in i'm just going to clear it pip and valio so now to install some modules let's just test this out with a module that is used for making web applications which is called flask if you would like me to make a tutorial series on how to make websites for python drop a like on this video i'll leave a comment saying you want to see it okay so to install flask we'll do pip install flask and as you can see requirement already satisfied it's because i've already got a flask installed you should get like some texting installing and stuff okay so now to test that we have installed flask successfully or to test if you've installed any module correctly you'll want to go into idle into the python shell and then we'll do import flask and then you can see we don't get any errors so that means flask has been imported successfully if we were to import a random module no module named this because it hasn't been installed and it probably doesn't exist anyway and if you do get an error go back and run the pip command again pip install the module name and then it should work okay that's it for installing modules i'm going to end the video here drop a like in this video if it helps you out it really does help me out if you would like to see a flask tutorial where i teach you how to make a website make sure to drop a comment saying you want to see one also consider subscribing i post python content almost every day that's it from me cheers and goodbye
