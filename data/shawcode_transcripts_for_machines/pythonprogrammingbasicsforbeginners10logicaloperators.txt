hello everyone welcome back to short code this is the tenth video in my Python basics tutorial series today we will be learning about logical operators there are three different logical operators in Python and or and not very used with if statements so let's get into some examples of how to use them okay so open a file or whatever you used to and it your Python code you file how about we implement some input as well which we learn in the fourth episode sunny equals input is it certainly warm equals input is it warm if sunny equals y and warm Z we're using this and logical operator and 1 equals y print print I am happy because it is sunny and warm else print I am NOT happy because it is not sunny and and warm okay so as you can see we use anis and operator and it returns true if both operands are true so let's run it but first we need to say but is it sunny yes or no yes is it warm yes I am happy because it's sunny and warm so if you're running again why and I am NOT happy because it's not sunny and warm if we replace this with all I am I'm going change this I am happy because it is sunny and warm to sunny or warm when it is it sunny no but it is warm somehow I am happy because it is sunny or warm so with this or it returns true if either operand is true so this one could be true and this one could be false it still return true it's only returns false if both of them are not true so let's just see that no and no I'm not happy yes unless I am happy okay so that's the end and all logical operators now let's move on to a slightly different one which is not so I'll just comment this out with in idle you can hear alt and free and that'll comment out a section of code raining equals false if not raining print it is not raining save it and on it it is not raining so what this not does it returns true if the upper end is false so it's it's basically a short way of doing it raining there's not equal true it's just easier to write not raining like that and then if we changes to true we don't get anything in summary and returns true if both operands are true all our returns true if one operand is true and not returns true if the upper end is false now for some challenges for you to do by itself firstly create an if statement checking it for weather is cold and wet if so print out for weather isn't very nice create an if statement checking you if the time is midday or midnight if it is print out it is 12 o'clock create an if statement checking if it is not day if so print out it's nighttime so that's all for today guys if you have many questions or errors leave them in the comment section below if you enjoyed be sure to give a video a like and subscribe to the channel turn on notifications as well so you never miss a video thanks for watching
