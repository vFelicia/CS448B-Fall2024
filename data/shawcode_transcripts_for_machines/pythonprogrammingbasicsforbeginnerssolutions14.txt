hello everyone and welcome to Shah code today we will be going through all the solutions from the previous four episodes that we've done so in the first episode I set you free challenges and as you can see here these are all the solutions to our first video so the first challenge of the first video was to print outs I love programming in Python and as you can see here we just do print I love programming in Python now for the second challenge it won't you needed to make a program for outputs I will be the best programmer ever but each new word is under new line see you want to print out I will be the best program ever like this but make sure you use three lots of speech marks on the beginning and the end and then each word is on a new line which allows us to do the multiline print finally make a program for output so poem but each line in the poem is on a new line in the output window so it's literally just the same thing as a here it's just like this three parts of speech monks at the start and a bottom and each line in the poem has a new line in Python if we run it yeah we can see we get our programming in Python which is the first challenge I'll be the best program ever is the second and then finally the poem which is a wonder I wrote myself in its top quality so in the second video I set you free challenges to do the first challenge was to make a program that prints out a variable whether it be a string and integer or a float so here we have a variable called BA it's a string variable it just has a string right here which is high and prints who've R which prints up high secondly you needed to make a program that prints out two variables as strings so we have a variable called var to inside it's got high and var furry which is there I know you have to do is do print bar to bar furry a comma in between and the final challenge was to make a program but adds together an integer and the variable that it's an integer so we can just have var 4 equals 21 the name is boffo and the contents is the number 21 you just wanted to do print any number I chose 2 plus 4 so if we were in it we get high it relates to this then we also get high there which is the second challenge I've been finally 23 because 21 plus 2 is 23 now for the third a lot of challenges is at you so for the first one you needed to make a program for adds together to float variables so what you should have done is just created two variables my first one is just called V Bar and the second one is called far to and the contents of those are 2.5 and 5.3 then you just do print var plus Phi 2 or the names of your variable secondly make a program for us together to float variables and then ver and member results is to the 4th power I'm still using these two variables s up here so we just do ba + var which adds them together then we just use this operator which is for indices to the power of 4 and finally make a program but gets a remainder of 2 float variables then results is flawed divided by a number of your choice so we do ba modulus bar which gets remainder of 2 point 5 divided by 5 point 3 and then we divide that and round it down by 2 so if we run it we get 2.5 plus five point three is seven point eight and then five five point two plus five point three to the fourth power is this large number here then 2 point 5 divided by 5 point 3 4 remainder then divided by 2 and round it down is 1 as we can see here and then finally for the fourth video though are also free challenges the first one needed to have two variables that both contain inputs and then H get one number and print out the variables added together now this one is actually quite hard bearing in mind that this is a basic tutorial but I'll explain as best I can so we have two variables later on in the series I'll explain what I'll explain what I'm doing in more detail and we'll cover it and you can understand it more so we've just got two variables here bar and bar we both have inputs number 1 and number 2 and we want to print ba + VAR what I've got here is this int this in statement and it surrounds Vivar and Vivar to know what what would happen if we didn't use this int ba if we just did friend print BA plus ba what would happen is if we run it we're getting them born I don't know five number seven and here we get 57 because what it's doing here is it's got five and seven as strings and it's just shoved those two together to get 57 because in the input five is a string and seven is a string and we've just shoved it right together to get 57 if you don't understand this at the moment it doesn't matter we'll cover it in a later video so we've just come what we've done here is we've converted it into an integer and if we look back here converting it into an integer five plus seven as integers is 12 all right for the second challenge you need to have two input variables ask for two words and then prints them out together in one print statement so what we have here is I don't know var 3 equals input world 1 weÂ´d one that involve all equals input would and then we just print buffering bar for so if we go like this make sure Tavia commerce but in bar as well to separate them out word one hello there hello there and then finally the third challenge have three input variables asking different questions and then print your answers were and then all the answers um puts it in one print statement so we just have three lots of variables asking three different questions variable name q1 q2 and q3 we all hold input statements all asking different questions and then finally it does print your answers were and then separated by commas to give a little space q1 q2 q3 so if we were in it what is your name okay loud voice five time 315 what's your favorite programming language Python your answers were Caleb 15 and Python so that's all for today guys it was just the solutions for episodes one to four make sure to stay tuned by subscribing and hitting the bell so you won't miss any of the next ones also drop a like if this helped you out it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about Python or the solutions to any of these or need any help with any areas or anything be sure to leave it in the comment section below I'll be sure to help you out any suggestions or feedback would also be greatly appreciated thanks for watching
