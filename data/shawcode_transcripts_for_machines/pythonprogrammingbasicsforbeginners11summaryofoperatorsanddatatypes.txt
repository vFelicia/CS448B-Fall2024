hello everyone welcome back to show code today we'll be recapping all the datatypes and operators' we have learned so first off we have the arithmetic operators which are just operators to do math we have addition subtraction multiplication division modulus indices in for division you can't remember modulus returns a remainder after the first operand has been divided by V second operand floor division runs the value down if it's a decimal indices or exponents so powers for example two to the power of five is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 ok now this assignment operators the first and main one is just V equal sign it just assigns one value to a variable then Barelvi arithmetic operators combined with the equal sign to assign a value but has been returned from an arithmetic operator but might sound a bit confusing but for example X plus equals 5 is the same as x equals x plus 5 so x equals x which is the original value plus 5 so the new value equals original value plus 5 we cannot just write x plus 5 because that doesn't assign the new number to X then there's comparison operators as well they used to compare two values in an if statement where as follows equal not equal greater than less than greater than or equal to and less than or equal to finally we have logical operators these are used in if statements to combine two or more comparison operators they are and or and not and returns true if both operands are true or returns true if either operand is true nozzoli requires one operand and returns true if a operand is false okay that's all the operators now on to data types we have one text type which is a string just some text they are shown by being surrounded by speech marks or quote marks we have two numeric types integers and floating point numbers integers are just whole numbers floating point numbers are numbers that contain decimals version by just writing the number lastly we have boolean x' true or false they can only be one of the other Aaron with their first letters as a capital won't recognize them otherwise okay that's the end of a summary I'm going to set you one big challenge and see if you can do it I'll be covering all the solutions to the challenges next year and the video after that will be the solution to this big challenge so what I want you to do is create a grams ounces converter you will need tough and important grams check if a value is greater than zero if it isn't leave an error message if it is continue with the program then print the output the formula is divide the amount of grams by twenty eight point three five so one gram equals zero point zero three five two seven four okay so that's all for today guys if you enjoy make sure to leave a like subscribe hit the bell and share these videos it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about Python or any errors in your code make sure to leave them in the comment section below that's it from me thanks for watching
