hello everyone and welcome to the second video of my Python basics tutorial series if you haven't seen my first video in the series then go and check out the playlist link is in the description today we'll be learning about variables in Python now what is a variable or you can think of variables as a container that holds different data values whether it might be a string which is text integers which is a whole number or floats which are numbers with a decimal what's the point of them well they can be used multiple times throughout a program instead of typing out the same value a ton of times in different parts of a program okay so let's get on to programming we want to do is open up idle I have my idle a bit bigger just so you can guys can see it easier you want to go to file new file I could just hit ctrl N and there we go so what do we want to do now can do x equals nice variable now this is a variable and then what we can do is y equals I don't know let's just say random number 21 so these here are variables and what we can do now is we can use what we learnt in the last tutorial printing so you can type print and let's print X notice how we do not have speech marks around the X as if we did have speech marks around the X this is what would happen if we save it just save it somewhere if we do have speech marks around the X if we go to run we're in module which runs the program we just get first it just prints out the letter X which we don't want so what we can do is we can remove these speech marks and then we get nice variable what it's doing here is it's saying print X and it's looking for X cuz it's not got the speech marks it's looking for the variable X which it is seen up here so it's like Oh is nice variable so let's print out nice variable as we can see here so how about now we do friends why say that run run module or just here five no choice we got nice variable and then 21 because y equals 21 printing y and y is 21 so it prints out why so how about now we do print hello but we'll just print out the two variables and hello but what we can do is hello and then after after the speech marks comma x now let's see what this will do hello nice variable so what's it's doing here is it's printing out hello just as we learnt in last episode then it's saying let's also print out X which is nice variable run it hello nice variable cost of comma what it does is it sort of adds it together what we can also do instead of a comma we can do prints hey they can do plus X and then close off bring it hey nice variable as you can see there's actually no space advice because a comma produces a space in between whereas pause produces no space it just shoves it right together so if we did want to use a space what we could do is we could just put a space between hey and the closing speech marks and that would print out a space so how we actually write a variable is we write the name of the variable which is it in our case is X then we follow up with an equals which says like x equals the variable it assigns the data to the variable then after the equals we write what dates all you want whether that's a integer or a string and tougher variables are string you need to have speech marks around it which indicates where there is a string which is text a string is text so X is a string variable if we want an integer or a float we cannot just have the number itself without any speech marks so now for some challenges to do by yourself I will be giving the solutions in a later video make program footprints also variable whether it be a string an integer or a float and secondly make a program that prints out two variables or strings in the same print function and then make a program for adds together an integer and a variable that as an integer so that's all for today guys make sure to stay tuned for the next tutorial by subscribing and hitting the bell also drop a like if this helped you out and it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about with Python I'll need some help with any errors be sure to leave it in the comment section below I'll be sure to help you out any suggestions or feedback would also be greatly appreciated because this is my first few videos so I'm doing and thanks for watching
