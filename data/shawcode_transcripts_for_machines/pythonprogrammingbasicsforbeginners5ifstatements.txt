hello everyone and welcome to a fifth video of my Python basics tutorial series if you haven't seen a previous episodes then go and check them out the playlist link is in the description today we'll be learning about if statements in Python so an if statement is a conditional statement but does something if something proved true now what I mean by the prove true we will see when we go through some examples so let's get programming just open up by de'longhi go to file new file then to start off we'll just have a variable x equals five and another variable by equals five as well now for the if statement so if we go if X double equals y colon print x equals y so if we say that and then we run it x equals y because X is equal to Y because five is equal to five so then we go through and print x equals y so how do we actually sell this if statement so first off you'll obviously want to have this if and you see how it's highlighted in orange and then we want to have like a condition so for example X double equals y by the way this double equals means it's comparing X to Y and seeing if they're equal whereas where the single equals a single equals up here just means it's assigning five to X or as this is checking it's comparing X to Y and then after after the condition we want a colon and then underneath that we want to press tab if we hit tab and there we go and that that shows that this print statement is part of 'bf statement and then we have whatever we want to do and tabbing in python is really important if we did x equals y without the tab we did get an error because it's expecting it to be indented like that it should automatically indent for you as well so we could also do if we wanted we can do if x equals 5 and then also prints it because X is 5 and it's checking does it equal 5 yes 5 equals 5 what about x equals 4 nothing happens because X doesn't equal 4 so it's not going to print this what we can do now though is we can add an else statement you can do print let's just change this to Y again X does not equal Y and then if we change Y to free or anything that isn't 5 we run it X does not equal Y because what it's doing is saying if x equals y let's do this does it equal y no it doesnt let's move on to the else statement and there we go X does not equal Y so we set our else statements in the same way as if statements B you don't need a condition here you just need to go on and then the content of it needs to be tabbed it comes underneath the if statement it just won't work if you have it yo you'll get an error if it's not underneath it if statement so an else statement is just a conditional statement but does something if a statement if the if statement above it proved false so now we also have an elephant and that goes in between the if and the else so LF x equals I don't know if it equals 5 x equals 5 x equals 5 because it's what what is doing here is saying if X equals y it doesn't so it's gonna skip for up L what Ella basically means it's elseif elseif x equals 5 which it does print x equals 5 and it's just going to skip the else statement because it's already this is true so the else statement is just ignored the elephant is just sour and the exact same way as an if statement and an else statement if we bring it back there so basically an L LF statement is just a kind of a conditional statement but does something if the if statement above it proves false and it proves itself true so now for some challenges for you to do by yourself create free if statements that protrude depending on a variable being equal to a number create an if and else statement that proves true or false your choice and create an F LF an else statement that proves true or false so that's all for today guys make sure to stay tuned for the next tutorial by subscribing and hitting the bell so you miss the next episode also drop a like if this helped you out it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about Python or need some help with any errors be sure to leave it in the comment section below I'll be sure to help you out any suggestions or feedback would also be greatly appreciated thanks for watching
