hello everyone welcome back to show code today I'm going to be teaching you how to use CSV files in Python for this we will be using a builtin module the csv module the csv file as witchly just means comma separated variable okay so this is fairly similar to reading text files in this video we will be opening files a slightly different way and this way is a bit cleaner and you can also open text files this way as well as CSV files so I've just got a CSV file here with some variables that have been separated by commas the comma is what's known as a delimiter and you don't have to use the commercial delimiter but it's just common practice to use commas you could just use pythons split function but the csv module makes it a lot easier okay so the first thing we need to do is import the CSV module solely imports Lesley then use with open which is another way of opening text files or CSV files sorted with open csv file names so mines values dot CSV and then we'll want to open it in read mode as let's just do it as F which is short for file this F here is equal to V open of values CSV and then under that will create a variable called C CSV reso CSV read set for equal to CSV reader and the argument should be a file name which in our case is F and for delimiter which in our case is a comma this will read out all the CSV data now let's iterate through each line in the CSV file so for line in CSV read print line oh yeah accidentally spell CSV wrong CSV read and also you need to add delimiter equals there and then we get hello there general Kenobi you are a bold one dot dot these extra items in the list because I have got commerce on the end which I shouldn't have comments on the end of my file so if we save up and run and there we go we've got hello there general Kenobi you are a bold one nice a prequel mean reference and we don't have these empty strings anymore as you can see each line is a list and each comma separated variable is an item in the list and these are all strings so if you're going to be doing any math operations make sure to cast them to an integer before doing so so we've just got multiple lists and of course we can manipulate these lists append the items of lists to other lists we can do whatever we want with these so you might want to append the first item of each row to a separate list so what we'll do is create a new list just call it my less equals and then we'll do wine sorry my list my list dot append let's see what shall we append we'll do y in 0 and then underneath that print my list and we'll get hello general you are a 1 because if we look back into our file hello general you are a 1 okay so that's pretty much it for the CSV module I didn't cover much but that is really all you need to know while using the csv module once you have access to your data from your csv it's all about using lists or dictionaries and manipulating those and if you haven't seen those videos where I talk about weston dictionaries or as a playlist link in the description if you would like to support me all you have to do is drop a like on this video it really does help me out also consider subscribing I post Python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
