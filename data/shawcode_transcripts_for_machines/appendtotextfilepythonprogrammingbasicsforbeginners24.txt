hello everyone welcome back to show code in this video I'll be showing you how to append to a file in Python in the last video I showed you how to write to a file if you haven't seen that make sure you go and watch it the playlist link is in the description now the difference between writing and appending to a file is that writing completely wipes the file and then adds things to it whereas appending just adds content onto the texture is already there so if you don't want to completely get rid of everything in the file and you just want to add onto the file then you should use the append okay I've just got some dummy text here now let's go to idle okay from here let's create a sample string sample string equals newline hello new line there then we want to open it so file equals open text txt which is your file name then we'll open it in a pend mode which is a o then drop a line then we use the write functions so file dot write sample string and yeah we still do use the write function instead of an append function so it will just add on to the button instead of wiping the file and now we need to close the file then if we run it we won't get any output but if we head over to the text file we can see we get hello there on two new lines and it hasn't wiped the file at all it's just added on to the bottom of it okay that's all for today guys if you have any questions or comments leave them down below I'll be sure to reply if you'd like to pop me drop a like on this video it really does help me out also consider subscribing I post python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
