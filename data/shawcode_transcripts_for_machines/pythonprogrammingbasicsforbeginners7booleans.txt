hello everyone and welcome to show code this is the seventh video and my Python basics tutorial series if you haven't seen a previous episodes then go and check them out the playlist link is in the description today we'll be learning about boolean x' a boolean is a data type that can only hold two values true or false or also it can be written as 0 or 1 this links in with if statements and checking if something is true or false when you run a condition in an if statement returns true or false we can create a boolean and then in an if statement check if it is true or false so we write bullion in Python like this declare the variable name so I'll just call it my bull and then have its contents as true or false so it could be true or false and make sure that the T or bf is a capital otherwise it won't work so if we do false it doesn't work as you can see it doesn't go orange whereas this it goes orange true and false values are important in Python and when we cover other topics in later episodes you will see how BA use quite a lot and we can evaluate values and variables in Python and see if they are true or false by using the bull function most values are true for example a strain my string equals hello a string will return true for an integer so let's just print wool mice my string save it run it we can see we get true because it's true now if we change this so it's empty save it and run it we can see we get false if we can create an integer my in equals 1 we print my int and run it you can see we get true change it to zero you can see we get false the family can also evaluate bullying themselves so if we evaluate my bull save it run it it's obviously going to return false because the bullying itself is false so then we can also use s statements like I said earlier with boolean what we can do is we can write if my bull is equal to true print my bull e'en that value is true I can just do l else print my boolean value it is pumps so if we run it my boolean value is false because my bull is false if we change this to true save it and run it my boolean value is true so as you can see we're using a comparison operator here which checks if my bull is equal to true and if we get rid of the equals to true and just save it like that what do you think is going to happen let's run it we can see my boolean value is true because when it says if my bull that's just a short way of saying if my bull is true so now for some challenges for you to do by itself firstly create an if statement and check to see if a boolean value is true or false secondly create an F if an else statement uncheck to see if a boolean value is true or false if not run BL statement and finally create an integer and use the bull function to check if it is true on up so that's all for today guys make sure to stay tuned for the next tutorial by subscribing and hitting feybelle so you won't miss the next episodes also drop a like if this helped you out it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about Python or need some help any errors you got be sure to leave it in this comment section below I'll be sure to help you out any suggestions or feedback would also be greatly appreciated thanks for watching
