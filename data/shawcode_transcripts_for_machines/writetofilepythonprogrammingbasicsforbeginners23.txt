hello everyone welcome back to show code in this video I'll be teaching you how to write to a file in Python last video we covered how to read from a file if you haven't seen that make sure you go and watch it for playlist link is in the description okay so I've got a text file here it's just got some sample text in it but we're going to write too and now let's open a file it'll just create a new file let's create a string variable so just sample sample text equals new text and then don't forget your backslash n for a new line and then after that we can have some more dummy text here now let's open the file using the open function so file equals open text dot txt which is the name of your text file and then we're going to want to open it in write mode now what this does is it opens a file in write mode but with write mode it completely wipes the file clean before you add anything new to it if you want to learn how to just add some more text on to the end of the file that's appending to a file we're going to be learning about that in the next video so make sure you subscribe and stay tuned to that now let's write to the file with the write function so we'll do file dot write sample text a venerable file dot close and this is important as we learnt in the last video if you're enjoying the video so far please do drop a like it really does help me out let's run it and we don't get any output but if we open up our text file again we can see we got new text and then on a new line these muddled up letters because our dummy text up here was new test and been on a new line this text here ok that's writing to a file I'm going to end the video here if you have any questions or comments leave them down below I'll be sure to help you out if you want to support me well you have to do it's like this video it really does help me out also consider subscribing I post python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
