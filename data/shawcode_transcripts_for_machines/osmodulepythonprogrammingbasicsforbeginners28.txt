hello everyone welcome back to show code in this video I'll be showing you how to use the builtin module OS which is short for operating system this module comes installed with so there's no need to install it with pit so the OS module allows you to control and interacts with your operating system whether that be Windows Mac or Linux and we can do things like create directories move directories copy directories all that good stuff ok let's jump right into it so I have a new python file here and the first thing we need to do is import the module so we do import OS and then to get the current directory that we are in we use the function OS dot get CWD so print OS stop CWD oh sorry I missed get get here get CWD then we get the file puffier which is C uses Caleb desktop important files YouTube Shaco programming python basics what this CWD stands for is current working directory in other words it's basically just for folder this Python follows in right now we can make a new directory by using Oeste mkdir so Oeste mkdir and then the parameter you will want to use is the name of the new directory so I'm just gonna call it new dir then run it and we can see we've got new dir and now let's rename that new directory let's just actually comment this print out statement to rename that directory you use OS dot rename so OS stock rename the first parameter needs to be the current name of the directory so in our case it's going to be new de and then the new name the name but we're renaming it to will be you the renamed we need to comment this out as well and we don't get any output but if we go to there we get new de renamed and then finally to delete this directory we can use OS dot rmdir so OS da rmdir and then it's going to be new di re names but if we run it we no longer have that directory it's being removed okay that was just an overview of the OS module it is a great way to control the operating system with Python there are more functions to cover but nothing else a bit beyond this tutorial I will leave a link in the description to the OS documentation so you can learn a few more functions but this is just sort of the important stuff that's most commonly used with vos module if you found this video useful please do drop a like it really does help me out also consider subscribing I post Compson almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
