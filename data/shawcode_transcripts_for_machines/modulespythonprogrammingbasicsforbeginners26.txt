hello everyone welcome back to show code today I'm going to be teaching you how to create import and use modules in Python I have lots of experience in Python and by the end of this video you'll have a great knowledge of modules so what are modules they're like codes libraries you can import these into your Python projects for you to use it's basically a premade Python file containing a set of variables and functions that you want to use in your program so let's start by creating a module so as you can see here I have two Python files open this is going to be our main file and this is going to be our module and they can be called whatever you want and you need them to be in the same directory as each other okay so let's go into our module file and create a new variable and a function x equals 3 define module func print a nice module and by the way you could call this way via one it doesn't have to be module funk it could be like cheeseburger or something but I'm just gonna keep it as module func now let's go into our main Python file and type import and then the name of your module file so mine is 26.2 then we'll create a new variable called Y and say it to 26.2 dot X and then we'll print Y I'm gonna run it oh yeah and by the way you can't have your module names having numbers in them so I'll have to change mine I'll just call it module import module and then module so X then we'll get free because what we're doing is for importing this file here and then we're referring to module this file this variable here is module 2 X so we have to refer to the module name and then the variable to access it and then we're just printing it oh then we can also call the function so module top module and then we'll get free and nice module if you're enjoying the video so far be sure to drop a like it really does help me out anyway notice that we have put our module name before each function or variable you know main file well instead of frying import module week what we can do is you can do from module imports asterisk and what this means is all so from the from this file import everything so now we don't have to use this module dot we can just refer to it directly and there we go we can also import individual variables and functions from the module from module import X and then get rid of this when we get free what we're doing here is we're only imparting this x value and then we won't be importing anything else so if we do module phone we're going to get an error because module func it's not defined because we have an imported it we've only imported to X and we can also rename modules and it's basically a short way of saying it so we can do much import module as MD so now instead of having to write module doc module func we can just write MD don't match your funk and then we'll get nice module so this won't renamed the actual module file I'll just rename it in your Python code right here very also various built in modules are part of Python and we will be covering some common ones in the next few videos you're also able to download someone else's modules for aren't built in and I'll show you how to do this in an upcoming video okay about software today guys if you have any questions or comments be sure to leave them down below I'll be sure to reply if you would like to support me all you have to do is give this video like it really does help me out I also consider subscribing I post python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
