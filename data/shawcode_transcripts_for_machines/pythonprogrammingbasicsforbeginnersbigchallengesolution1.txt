hello everyone welcome back to show code today we will be doing the solution to the big challenge I sent you two videos ago which was to create a grams 2 ounces converter if you miss that video check the playlist link in the description all the videos from this Python basics series will be there ok so that's just open up Idol that's new file ok so first thing we're going to one is grams equals input so we're going to want to get an input from the user so let's just type grab grams so now we've got the grams variable now what we want to do here is convert this to an to a vote so when they type in it's a number and then we'll be able to modify that number convert it into 4 ounces and stuff but the only problem with this is if they do type in a string ill give an error we could try something but we haven't covered it yeah and I don't want to confuse you guys alright so the next thing was to check if it was a positive number if it's anything else just give an arrow so if grams is less than 0 print error okay else ounces equals so what this does is it just tests to see if the gram the input Ingram's was positive if it wasn't if it was less than zero so it's a negative it's going to just print error and the program there if it doesn't do that it's going to move on to else and it's going to calculate the ounces so ances equals grams the formula was grams divided by twenty eight point three five then what we can do from here is print ounces on the wick , ounces this just concatenates it it puts the other string so if save this and run it grams let's just type in 50 grams ounces is one point seven six three big long number I'm not gonna read now to recap let's go through the program again just explain again so first thing we need to do is get input which we're doing here we're setting that input to a variable so when they type in a number it'll save it to grams variable and we're casting for input from a string into a float which allows them to write in like six point six or something rather than just an integer with no decimals the only from all of this is L spit out an error because you can't really convert letters to numbers we could have done a more advanced thing but we're not going to cover that in today's video just because I don't want to confuse you guys so then if grams is less than zero print error so it makes it so that they can't type in minus one because you can't really get minus grams and needs to be positive so if it is positive if this proves false let's move on to the else statement so ances equals grams which is what we've typed in up here it's a user input divided by twenty eight point three five which is just the formula to convert grams to ounces and then what we do here is print ounces and then ounces number which has been calculated here you could also use a plus what we actually want to do when we're using a comma is get rid of that and run it so we only get one space because a comma separates it with a space so if we if we decided to use a plus we would have to convert this to a string again because with the plus you have to have the same data type so you can't concatenate a float and a string but with the comi you can but also if we run it as you can see it doesn't provide a space oh it's right next to each other whereas with a comma it provides a space or if you wanted to use a boss you're put a space where I've highlighted so if we run it again as you can see we've got space so it's nice and formatted okay so that will see challenge I set you if you have any questions about this code right here any questions about Python any errors you've got be sure to leave them in the comment section below I will help you out please also consider subscribing it doesn't cost anything it's free feel free to drop a like as well it helps me out a lot that's all from me thanks for watching
