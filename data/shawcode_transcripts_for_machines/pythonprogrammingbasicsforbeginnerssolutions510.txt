hello everyone welcome back to show code today we'll be going through all the solutions for videos 5 to 10 I will be giving away the solution to a big challenge set last video in the next video if you haven't seen my video I will link a playlist in the description okay let's get programming okay so hey we can see all the solutions so first let's go through the episode five solutions so the first challenge was create free if statements that proved true depending on a variable being equal to a number variable one equals three we're just setting up some variables here if var one equals free print var one equals three if bar two equals five print var two equals five if bar 4 equals seven print part 4 equals seven as you can see var 1 is equal to free so whenever you run it it will print out just ignore all this stuff visa for challenges later it does print var one oh it does print var 1 equals free bar 2 equals 5 because bar 2 equals 5 appear and then var 4 equals 7 a prince var 4 equals 7 because var free is set to 7 up here okay on to a second challenge create an if and else statement that proves true or false so as you can see let's just close this so if V 1 plus V 2 equals a print true else print false so 3 plus 5 equals 8 so it should print true yeah as you can see true and then finally 5 3 create an if Elif and else statement but proves true or false if bar 2 plus 4 equals 15 print 15 bar 2 so 5 plus 7 that's not 15 so it will just skip over this LF bar 2 plus bar 3 equals 12 print 12 else print nan so bar 2 5 plus 7 equals 12 so it will print 12 1 or you run it as you can see 12 so it is skipped this first if statement because it's not true and it moves on to this LF statement it sees that this statement is true so it prints 12 and it never even touches yourself statement because it's already detected that our statement above it is true so it just ignores the else statement okay so episode six challenges the first one was create an if statement comparing two variables to see a fair not equal so if bar 1 does not equal var to print and file 1 does not equal bar so if bar 1 does not equal var if free does not equal 5 print 3 does not equal 5 right that's a new pup yeah sick free does not equal 5 number to create an if and else statement comparing two variables to see if one is greater than the other so if bar 2 is greater than bar free print var 2 is greater than bar free else print var 2 is isn't greater than the bar free so if 5 is greater than 7 print 5 is greater than 7 if it isn't print 5 isn't greater than 7 so let's run it as you can see here 5 is in greater than 7 so challenge free on episode 6 was create an F Elif and else statement comparing two variables to see if 1 is greater than another the Elif statement should check if one is less than the other as you can see have made a typo let's just turn that back so it's actually less than so if var 1 is greater than bar so if a is greater than 5 print 3 is greater than 5 if var 3 is less than by 1 so if 7 is less than 3 print ba 3 is less than bar 1 print 7 is less than free if the if statement is false in VLF statement is false let's just move on to this else statement and print nan so anyway run it it prints out nonvideo 7 challenges so the first one was create an if statement to check if a boolean value is truffles so boolean 1 equals true if bull one print true what this if ball 1 is doing if just to show way of saying if bull one is true but what we can do is just change it shorten it to just a full one you can see it's true so challenge to create an if an else statement to check if a boolean value is true or false if not run VL statement so bull 2 equals false if bull to print true else print false you can see it prints false because bull 2 is not true so a leg novice top one and just move around to the else statement and then the third one create an integer and use the bull function to check if it's true or not so in one equals four it's just an integer variable and then print bull in one it prints true because as long as a value isn't zero it'll always prove true as long as an integer isn't zero it'll always prove true so in one equals four 73 you can see it's true but if we change it to zero its false episode eight create a string variable and cast it to an integer and print out a little hint the string must be numbers only string one equals five and then print string one but as an integer so if you run it you get five you would get an error if you just had some text and tried to convert it to an integer as you can see invalid literal for int with base 10 which basically saying you can't convert text to an integer you can only convert a string when it's a number inside the string so let's just change our back to by the challenge to create an integer variable cast it to a string and concatenate it with another string and print it in one equal seven print string the string version event 1 plus hello so what this does is it just says 7 hello because it's converted it into a string so or string in one is to CMOS seven and hello so if we put it back to what it was it's just the same as up so it's just concatenating the strings together so yeah seven hello and then challenge Shree create a float variable and cast it to an integer and print it out so float one is equal six point three print out the integer version of that and as you can see it's just six because it just rounds it down from six point three to six because it can't deal with decimals okay episode nine have a variable equals four venues a modulus assignment operator with a number of your choice and then print out so my vehicles for my VAR modulus equals to bring my god so let's write it equals zero because 4 divided by 2 leaves no remainder which is 0 and then we're assigning a row number to my bar and then printing my bar which is 0 okay challenge to have a variable of your choice and use the in the season for division I up with numbers of your choice so my VAR equals 7 my bar star star equals to 7 times 7 equals 49 and then my var equals 49 and then 49 divided by 6 rounded down is 8 and then we're assigning 8 to my bar then on 9.2 we're printing 8 ok challenge free so have a variable go through each assignment operator with the first operand being the variable and the second operand being free see what happens so we're just going through all of the assignment operators starting off with 5 adding 3 minus thing free timesing it by 3 divided it dividing it by 3 getting the remainder performing indices on it while dividing it and then you can see the answer is 2.0 finally episode 10 create an if statement checking if a Weber is cold and wet if so print out for weather isn't very nice so I've just got a variable called temperature or temp equals cold humidity I don't even know if that's the right word or not but it's wet if temple's cold and humidity equals what print the weather isn't very nice challenge to create an if statement checking it for the time is midday or midnight if it is print hour is twelve o'clock time equals midday if it is if time equals midday all time equals midnight pronounced twelve o'clock so it could be either midday or midnight if we just run it you can see we get it's twelve o'clock if we change this to midnight it will still print out it's twelve o'clock because it can be either midday or midnight it doesn't matter which whereas from this one it needs to be both cold and wet it can't be cold or wet so if you change this to dry we're just not going to get anything so it needs to be wet it needs to be cold and wet for it to print out this so finally challenge free create an if statement checking if it is not day if so print out is nighttime so day equals false if not day print it's night so what it's doing is it's just reversing the day boolean value which is false so it reverses it equals true if true print it is night run it I know let me just bring this down a bit it's it's night so if we change this to true we don't get anything because if not day it's actually day so it won't print out anything so this is just this if not day it's basically just saying if day equals false change it's false it's his night okay but solver challenges from videos five to ten it was quite a lot of challenges next video will be the solution to the big challenge so that's all for today guys if you have any questions or errors about the solutions in this video make sure to leave them in the comments below I'll be sure to help you out if you
