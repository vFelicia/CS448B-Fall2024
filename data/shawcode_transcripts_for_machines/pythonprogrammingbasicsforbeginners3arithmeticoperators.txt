hello everyone and welcome to the third video of my Python basics tutorial series if you haven't seen in the previous episodes fan go and check them out the playlist link is in the description today we will be learning about arithmetic operators now what are arithmetic operators well they are used with numbers to do math operations okay let's go through four different operations you can do so first thing you want to do is open up idle what you want to do is go to file new file or hit ctrl n it's the same thing so first off there is addition so we do this using a plus sign so let's make two variables like we learned in the last episode let's just call on x equals I don't know 21 y equals 5 and then we can do print X plus y save it and if we go to run run module we get 26 because 21 plus 5 is 26 now this subtraction we can do it exactly the same it's how we did addition apart from we can use a minus sign so we can save it run run module 16 because 21 minus 5 is 16 multiplication and division of the same as well so we can just use an asterisk with instead of a minus sign run it 21 times 5 is 105 now if we divide we can use the slash for the division symbol run run module 4.2 cost 21 divided by 5 its 4.2 there's also modulus this is less common but is useful in some situations modulus is used to find the remainder of division it's done with a percentage sign so if we do I don't know let's change X to 20 and why to six we can do X modulus using a percentage sign Y and we all get to because 20 divided by 6 is free and we get a remainder 2 we also have indices also known as powers misses done by two asterisks in succession so we can do let's just change this to two three so we can this is how do how we do powers so two to the power of 3 2 cubed run it we get eight because two times two times two is eight and finally we have floor Division floor division is just division but it rounds the result down to the nearest whole number so if we do change X to 15 + y 2 we do we do floor division with two slashes save it run it you can see we get 7 because 15 divided by 2 is 7.5 and we get 7 because it rounds it down now for some challenges for you to do by yourself as you know I will be giving the solutions in a later video so firstly make a program for adds together two floats variables not integers floats which are decimal all numbers make a program for adds together to float variables and then Versalles is to the 4th power make a program that gets a remainder of 2 float variables member as OSes flow divided by a number of your choice so that's all for today guys make sure to stay tuned for the next tutorial by subscribing and hitting the belt so you won't miss the next episode also drop a like if this helped you out it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about Python or need some help with any errors be sure to leave it in the comment section below I'll be sure to help you out any suggestions or feedback will be greatly appreciated as well thanks for watching
