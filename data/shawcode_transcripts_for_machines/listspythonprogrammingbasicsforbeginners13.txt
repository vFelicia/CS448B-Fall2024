hello everyone welcome back to show code today I'm going to be teaching you how to create hues and manipulate lists in Python I have lots of experience in Python and by the end of this video you will have a great understanding about less sympathy and how to use them okay now let's learn about lists lists are one of four different collection data types they are lists tuples sets and dictionaries they're just collections of data types basically so for example they can hold strings integers and even other collections all of these are useful in different situations and it is key that you learn about all of their properties so you know which one to use for your program to make as effective as possible so a list is a collection which is ordered and changeable this means that the items in the list will stay and beyond of it you put them in and you are able to change the list items partway through your program let's get on to some examples of lists now okay so as you know the first thing we want to do is open up idle just create a new file ok so let's create our first list so I'll just call mine fruit equals square bracket and then you can fill this with whatever you want as long it's like a valid data type so I'm just going to have some strings in here so apples comma bananas comma what else is our oranges and one more Kiwis and then close off with the square bracket and then we can print fruit fruit and save that and now if we run it we can see we get apples bananas oranges and Kiwis so you can just print them out as usual as you would with any other variable and notice how they're in the exact same order as when you wrote out so apples is first then bananas is second oranges are third and Kiwis are four this is a key property to lists they are ordered so as you can see to make a list he surrounds your data in square brackets and you separate your data with these commas here to show that there different items and we can just print a list like any other variable okay now let's talk about accessing the items in a list we can access them by referring to their index number what I mean by this is each item is numbered and the first item has an index of zero and the second one has an index of one and so on and indexes start at zero so if I just make a comment up here for you guys Oh didn't mean to do that up here so if we do by just top over so this is index 0 1 2 3 we can access them by writing the list name so let's just print route and then in square brackets right next to it will print one run it as you can see we get bananas because we're accessing the first index which is bananas because one is right here so if we change this to 0 save it and run it we get apples because index 0 0 2 apples we also have negative indexing so you just do it exactly the same as you would leave just normal indexing apart from it's like almost reversed so this last item over here is index minus 1 this one's minus 2 it's vital so it's basically just reversed and we can do exactly the same thing we can print fruit minus 1 there we go we got the last item in the list in negative indexing minus 1 is the last item by the way if you are enjoying the video at the moment or are finding it useful make sure to give a video I like it really does help me out we can specify a range of indexes with a start number and an end number we use for start index followed by a colon and the end index so if we just do it like this print route 1 4 even though we don't actually have the 4th index it's still going to print out and I'll explain why we get bananas oranges and Kiwis it started at 1 printed out the first index second index and third index and you might think but what about the fourth index what never actually goes to the fourth index the fourth index is not included if we change this to free it just prints out bananas and oranges and it never goes to number 3 so number 3 isn't included I'm going to show you a common error you find with list indexing so if you print fruit sex we're going to get an error because 6 doesn't exist so if we were in it we get list index out of range but index 6 it's not part of this list it doesn't exist back to you index ranges if we leave out the first value when we're doing index ranges so if we just print fruit and then go on free it will just stop oh forgot to close the brackets so we need to get rid of this there we go it'll just start at 0 and then go up to free but it doesn't print out free so missing up a start value is literally just a short way of saying 0 2 3 and we can also miss out the last value so we can print fruit to go on and that'll print out everything from 2 to the end which is only Kiwis and oranges let's now move on to modifying lists which is another key property they're not static and are not set in stone you can modify them partway through the program so to change the value of an item we could just go like this fruit and then get the index so let's change oranges so fruit 2 because 2 here two equals satsumas so fruit 2 equals Satsuma and now we print fruit run it and you can see we now get apples bananas and oranges has been replaced with Satsuma and we still get Kiwis to modify something get the West index and Venu just assign a different value to ballast index the original item is now overwritten by the new value we can also check if an item is part of a list by using the in operator so we can do if Satsuma in fruit print Satsuma is in fruit fruit there we go and then we get Satsuma is in fruit because Satsuma has been modified into this fruit list its replaced oranges it's checking if Satsuma is in fruit which is so let's print Satsuma is in fruit let's also do another one if oranges in root print oranges is in fruit run it and as you can see we don't get anything because oranges is no longer and through it was changed up here and then if oranges is in fruit which isn't so let's just miss out this and ignore it let's now talk about list functions for a choir for you we're not going to cover them all in this video but we are going to go through some of the important ones so we have the append function which just adds one item onto the end of a list so we could do fruit dots append another value print route and as you can see it's printed up a list and then it's added on another value now to keep this clean I'm just going to comment all this out if you're wondering how to do that like something press alt and then press free and to get rid of it press alt sand for I accidently commented this out which we don't want to add an item in place or a certain index you use the insert function so root dot insert so we need to be indexed so I want to insert a let's say 1 and let's put in there the object which is going to be new value and then let's print fruit I'm going to actually get rid of this print statement right here just to keep it clean as you can see a new value has been inserted at index 1 but bananas is still there it's just been shifted up to the next index for a move function removes an item so if we do a fruit dot remove which is we need for value so let's remove Kiwis print route as you can see we no longer have Kiwis because it's searched for the value Kiwis it's found it and it's removed it we've got the pop function which is very similar to remove but instead of searching for an item itself it searches for the index so I'm going to remove the last item no in fact I'm going to remove the first item so fruit pops 0 and then we print release and run it and as you can see we no longer have apples because index 0 has been popped which was apples so it's basically just removed the first value and that's how you remove a value through indexes rather than the actual name it's useful for when you don't know the actual contents of the list but you just want to get rid of the first item we can also completely get rid of all the contents of the list using the clear function so we can do fruit dot clear print fruit and as you can see we've now got an empty list because every single item in the list has been completely removed we have the copy function for the copy function you would usually assign it to a variable so my so that's just call it copy fruit equals fruit fruits dots copy and then if we print out fruit and print out coffee fruit run it and as you can see we've now got two different lists that have the exact same values because one has been copied we can also reverse the order of a list so we can do fruit dr reverse we're going to also get rid of east print statements and then as you can see the entire contents of the list have been completely just flipped around and finally we have the sort function so we do fruit dot sort and it actually takes two parameters which is reverse and key we're not going to talk about key today but we are going to talk about reverse so if you just leave key blank what salt will do is they'll sort it alphabetically so if we run it as you can see a B N oh it's alphabetical but what I can do is write reverse equals true and that'll reverse it all so it starts with the last letter O and B a there are a few more list methods that we could talk about now but they aren't really necessary and some of them are quite advanced so I recommend you play around with these functions that we have learned yourself to get a bit more practice once you have done that come back to the video and leave a comment saying what you think is the most useful list function okay that's everything to do with lists next video we will go over a different collection type which is called a tuple make sure you subscribe in here for bail so you don't miss out on that do you have any questions or comments make sure to leave them down below
