hello everyone welcome back to show code today I'm going to be teaching you how to make use and alter sets in Python I have lots of experience in Python and by the end of this video you will have a really good understanding of what sets are and how to use them okay so a set is another collection type in the previous few videos we covered lists tuples and strings lists and tuples a collection types and so assess a set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed and contains unique items if you don't care about it being ordered then you shouldn't use a list or a tuple sets there allow for duplicates because all of the items are unique you usually use sets when you are working with large databases because they are changeable and unordered and they are also optimized to checking whether a specific item is in the set we don't have duplicates so we're faster okay I've just got open a new file in idle so let's create a set so my set equals to curly brackets hello there yes and then you can print out by set say that and then if we were in it as you can see it's not printed out in the order that we set it in and also if we wrote yes once more and printed it we'd still get the same thing because they only have unique items so you cannot have two of the exact same thing so it's only printed out one yes here so what we can learn from this is that they are unordered and each item is unique now let's talk about accessing items because sets are unordered there's no way like lists or tuples to access them through their indexes because sets don't have indexes so we can use it in operator to check if an item is in the set so if we do if hello inset in my set print hello is in my set and then obviously as you probably guessed it printed out hello is in my set because hello hello is in my set let's change this to something random it's not gonna print out because this random string isn't in there okay now onto modifying sets because they are unordered there is no way to change the items with their index that you can add or remove items so to add items we used to add method like this my set dot add one two three print my set and we get one two three to add more than one item at once we need to use the update method so update and then we need to use some square brackets though we do one two three four five six hello four five six one two three to remove items we can either use the remove method like this we could use a remove method or you can use something called the discard method and varies a difference between the two but I will show you so if we run repeller as you can see there is no longer hello in beset if we decide to do that it will give us an error because it can't find this string of text but if we use discard with a random string of text we don't get an error because what discard does is discarded doesn't raise an error if it can't find it item where as removed rate gives us an error if it can't find V item so you should only use the remove method if you are sure that the item is in sir we could also use the pop method if you remember back in the West video we learned about the pop method and that usually removes an item depending on its index but we do not actually have indexes of sets so what we have to do is leave it blank my set that pop and just leave it blank and what this does is it will just remove the final item of the set so as you can see it's removed yes so it's a short way of removing vast buyin from beset then we can use the clear method completely empty set and then what we can we could even do Dell my set and then as as you can see we get an error because my set doesn't exist anymore it's being deleted by this Dell keyword right here as you probably guessed we can also get the length of a set using the length function so if we just do print Len my set it's gonna print out free because one two three it doesn't say four because yes and yes very exactly the same thing it just removes one of them because every item has to be unique as a quick side note make sure you give this video a like if you are enjoying it so far it really does help me out it only takes two seconds and it doesn't cost anything so to merge multiple sets together we should use a union method which returns a new set from the original two sets so if we just make another set called set to calls one two three four or five six and then we do a new set equals my set Union set two and then if we print a new set my certain set to have been mixed together all into one set another way of doing this is for update method so we could just do my set update my set to update set to and then we need to print this out so print my set one single set with both the original set and Ben and the second set mixed together okay to recap on on all the set methods we have add adds an element of a set clay removes all the elements of the set discard removes a specified element with no error remove removes a specified element and will raise in error fee the element doesn't exist pop removes the last element from the set Union returns new set containing four values from two of the sets update as the content of one set to another set and these aren't all the set methods and there are too many to cover in this video so you should look up a list of set methods on the internet make sure you leave a comment with the set method you found elsewhere but we didn't cover in this video but where you are helping other people to learn okay that's all for today guys next video we will be learning about dictionaries they are the last cochin type to cover and they are quite complex but you should be able to pick them up pretty easily if you have any questions or comments make sure to leave them down below also give the video a thumbs up if you found it useful it would really make my day also consider subscribing I post quality Python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
