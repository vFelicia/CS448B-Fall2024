hello everyone welcome back to short code uh in this video i'm going to be teaching you python in 10 minutes so i'll try and teach you everything there is to know in python within 10 minutes it might be a bit under 10 minutes might be a bit over let's just see how it goes but anyway the first thing you want to do is just open up a web browser and go to python.org and then if you come into downloads and just hit downloads uh then you can download the latest version of python once you've got that installed you should be able to just type in idle down here now idle is the way you can write python code basically so basically to make a new python file just like a new word document or whatever just hit new file and this is where we'll write all our code now this is the shell which is where the code actually runs and this is where we write our code so first things first let's just get some output so to do output in python what you want to do is you want to type in print and then a bracket and then um and then speech marks and then type in anything you want so i'll just type in hello and then another set of speech marks and close the bracket and then if you save it then we can go to run run module and then we can see we get the output of hello so you could change this to whatever you want it might be like if i just type in some random stuff there you can hit run and then run module then you see we get the output that we put in here okay now moving on to what are called variables now variables are like a container or a box that you can store things in basically so we might have a variable called my variable and we set it equal to what we want it to store so i wanted to store hello like a box it's storing the word hello so if you print out my variable and if we run it hitting f5 we can see we get hello outputted now this is different if we use speech marks here if we put in speech marks there we would get my variable which we don't want so if you remove the speech marks you'll end up printing out a variable um now let's learn about input so input is obviously a way of getting input from the user so i might say i don't know name equals input and then here we say how what is your name and then here we can just print out name so we're printing out a variable so we've got a variable here which is equal to the input that the user will type in and then we'll just print out the name so it what is your name my name is caleb and if we run that we get our name printed out which is caleb so next let's learn about changing variables say we've just got a name here then let's set name equal to i don't know jeff and then if we print name again and we run it we can see we get it's a just let me expand it here what's your name uh caleb so we get caleb printed out but we also get jeff printed out even though we're just printing name again um so basically we can change variables that's why they're called variables because they can be changed some of the ways you can change variables is if they're a number you can add and subtract from them or multiply or whatever so if we just have a num here and set it to 5 then we can do num plus equals five so basically what this plus equals we'll do is it'll add five onto it so if we print out num here so printing out num before we add five and print num after we've added five we'll get five and then we'll get ten so this plus equals we'll add a number in the same way minus equals will take away a number so we get zero there we can also do multiplication so if we had a star in there that time does it so we'll get 25 and uh we can also divide with a slash and we'll get one num equals input so we're getting some input and we type in enter a number and then we have um num plus equals five or four whatever and then we print out num so if we run it now and we'll enter a number i don't know let's enter seven we'll get an error can only concatenate str not int to str so what that means is um it's to do with data types so that so the data type of this variable num here is a string now a string is basically just a word or a phrase now an integer is a number it's a whole number basically we also have um floating point numbers which is basically just a number with a decimal uh and the thing is in python you can't add together a string or an integer even though we inputted a a number here the reason it's a string is because all input in python is a string to convert something from a data type to another data type we can use casting so to cast this input to an integer you can just surround it with brackets and type in int before it so this will convert a string to an integer now if we run it enter a number if we type in two we'll get six now the thing to remember is you can't convert a string to an integer if the string itself contains anything but numbers so if we typed in like some letters here then we'll get an error because we can't convert this right here into an integer it just doesn't make sense now let's talk about booleans there's another data type in python it's called a boolean and it's basically just a true or false value so we might have um boolean equals true so and let's just print out boolean and we get a true then we can change it to false and then we'll get out false um now it's basically just a true or false true or false value and the main reason why we use booleans is in if statements so to compare things now let's learn about if statements so we might have um let's have uh i don't know uh boolean equals true if boolean equals true print boolean print boolean is true else print not true so if we run it we'll get boolean is true and then we'll change it to false will get not true now this is what we call an if statement it takes some data and it compares it against something so here we're comparing it to check if it's true or not now the double equals we have to use double equals here because that's comparing it rather than setting it equal to something so when we use a single equals we're setting it to a value but when we use double equals we're comparing it so if we change this up here to say like a string so just to hello and then we'll change this to string if string equals hello print let's just print yes and no so if it's equal to hello then we'll output yes and if it's not we'll output no so we get yes and then and then if we change it to uh something else and we run it we'll get no so we can also use um the different kinds of comparison operators here so you might have a greater than or equals less than or equals um there's loads of different ones you can use those are just some examples now moving on to lists and tuples now a list uh is basically just a very it's a data type and it's basically just a list of items so we might have um i don't know my variable and this is how you create a list with two square brackets and then the list might be filled with strings so we could have hello this is a list now we separate items in a list with commas if we just print out uh myvariable uh we just get the list printed out right here and then to get a particular item out of the list we can just uh index we can use these square brackets here and then to get the first item of the list we have to type in zero so if we run it we get uh hello outputted down here so that's the first item now to get the second item we have to use one third item we have to use two to get an item of a list you always have to start at zero basically so if we have two here and we run it we'll get is outputted because this is item zero this is item one and this is item two and to add an item to the list you can just do my variable dot append uh another item and then if we print out my variable and run it we'll get a list and you can see at the end we've got another item added so let's talk about while loops now so i'll just make a quick example so so we've just got this example here so we've got num equals 0 while num is less than 10 print num is less than 10 and then we add one to num so this should loop over 10 times we're starting at zero every loop we're going to add one so we get it printed out 10 times right here a while loop basically continues forever unless the condition here is not true and this is true because num is less than 10 so when num gets to 10 then this loop will stop so that's while loops now let's talk about four loops they're a bit more complicated but they're pretty easy i guess we just have a list with some items in it now we can do four item in my list and then we print item and we run it we'll run through each item in the list and we'll print it out so a for loop basically just runs through a variable and then it'll do something based on that variable so for every item in the list we're going to print out the item now this here it doesn't have to be called item we could call it whatever we wanted so we might have just 4e in my list let's print out e then we get the exact same output now let's quickly talk about functions it's a section of code that can be used over and over again right here this is a function it's called myfunk and to create a function you need to write define and then followed by the name of a function then two circular brackets followed by a colon and then everything in the function needs to be tabbed over so if we run this now uh you can see that nothing actually happens and this is because the function has been defined but it's not actually run so to run a function or to call a function we just need to type in the name of it with some brackets on the end so if we save it and we run it we can see we get the function run and we can run a function as many times as we want so if i just copy this right here do it three times and we get hello this is a function three times over so that was a very brief introduction to python um i didn't really go into much explanation or detail because there's quite a lot of stuff to cover in 10 minutes um but hopefully that just gave you a little idea of what python's about and some of the things in python if you want to go into more detail you can check out my beginners playlist for python up here somewhere around here i don't know or if you want to go a little bit more advanced you can check out my intermediate playlist somewhere around here as well if you found this video useful then a like would be appreciated it really does help me out if you have any questions about python then just leave them in the comments below i will get back to you um otherwise that's it from me cheers and goodbye
