hello everyone and welcome back to short code this is a night video in my Python basics series today we will be learning about assignment operators we have already covered one assignment operator and you may have not even realized but we learn it in the second video when we learn about variables you okay so as you know we need to idle file new file okay so we'll just create a variable this so variable equals five now this right here that's an assignment operator so the next assignment operator we can also do is variable plus equals five which is the same as variable equals variable plus five it's just a short way of saying it it's sort of to mix an arithmetic operator with an equal sign in fact we need to print something first print very variable save it and run it we get 10 because what it's doing is variable equals 5 variable plus equals 5 so that's adding on 5 to 5 and assigning that new variable which is 5 plus 5 to variable which is 10 so if we got rid of this and run it we'd still that 5 because this isn't assigning it it's just doing an arithmetic operator so we need to make variable 10 we need to use the assignment operator now we've also got plenty of other ones oh by the way this is what's called a comment it's like just signal is so you can make some notes on what your code is actually doing so we can also do some of our assignment operators so very variable equals 5 for in variable variable we get 0 because 5 minus 5 is 0 and then variable equals 0 print variable it's 0 3 times it by 5 you get 25 again if you removed it it's not it's not signing it so it'll just stay 5 we've also got division it's basically just all the arithmetic operators with an equal sign to make an assignment operator so you get 1 because 5 divided by 5 is 1 again indices 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 is 3125 if we do for division which is rounding down to the nearest whole number we get one maybe if we change it to 6 actually that will be better yeah we still got one we can also use modulus which gets the remainder so yeah but those are obvious I mean operators so it will just make a little comment here which is just a piece of text that ignores when it's run so we have plus equals minus equals x equals God equals indices equals and blah division sorry for division equals so there we go so now for some challenges for you to do by yourself have a variable equals four then use some modulus assignment operator with the second operand which is like this which is a number on the righthand side of the arithmetic of the assignment operator there's a number of your choice then print out the variable have a variable of your choice and venues Enders indices and floor division on it with the second operand being a number of your choice or numbers of your choice and finally have a variable and go through each assignment operator with the first up around being the variable and the second operand being free and see what happens that's all for today guys if you have any questions or errors leave them in the comment section below if you enjoyed be sure to give a video a like and subscribe to our Channel turn on notifications as well so you never miss a video thanks for watching
