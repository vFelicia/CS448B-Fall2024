hello everyone and welcome back to show code this is the eighth video on my Python basics tutorial series today we will be learning about casting what is casting casting is where you convert a variable from one data type to another for example if I had an integer and I wanted it to be a string I would cast it from an integer to a string okay let's get programming ok so first things first as you know we need to open up Idol then open up a new file ok so the start is let's just create a variable called my variable equals 5 ok and then we'll write my new variable equals STR my variable and what this does here is it converts it from an integer which we have made up here into a string so my new variable equal is a string and it's equal to my variable which is 5 but it's a string so if we print out print my new variable save it run it we get 5 I know you couldn't really tell that it was actually a string so we can prove it it's a string by adding an integer to it so we'll just do plus 4 save it and run it and we can get this error you can only concatenate a string to a string not an integer which is what we've done here so let's look at some of our examples like so let's just create my variable equals 1 2 3 and to convert that into an into an integer we do my my new variable equals int my variable but we can print out my new variable Plus and a number seven we'll run it oh hang on let's just get rid of this first so we don't get an error so you've let run it we get 130 and you can see but it's successfully added together two numbers which means that my very my new variable has to be an integer so we can also do some things with floats so let's just get rid of s my variable equals make a string 42.1 my new variable equals float my variable friends my new variable plus four point two four point two one save it run it oh yeah forty six point three one so it's got this string and converted it into a floating point number and we've added another floating point number four point two one to get forty six point three one so to recap to comfort something to a string its STR to comfort it into an integer it's int and to convert something to a floating point number you use float server syntax is happy variable surround the in these brackets and then put your conversion I guess you can call it your conversion keyword I guess before it for example int or float okay now for some challenges for you to do by yourself as you know I'm gonna be doing a video giving the solutions to B's so firstly create a string variable and cast it to an integer and prints out and a little hint the string must be numbers only otherwise you'll get an error an integer variable cast it to a string and concatenate it with another string and print it and create a float variable and cast it to an integer and print out that's all for today guys if you have any questions or errors leave them in the comment section below if you enjoyed be sure to give a video a like and subscribe to the channel turn on notifications as well so you never miss a video thanks for watching
