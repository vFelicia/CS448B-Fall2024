hello everyone welcome back to show code in this video I'll be showing you how to use the random module in Python this module is built into Python so you won't have to install it pip veranda module is very useful because it allows us to generate random numbers and data so let's get right into it so first off let's import random so import random now let's generate a random floatingpoint number between 1 and 10 for this we use random dot uniform let's just create a variable so x equals random dot uniform between 1 and 10 print X and then we get a random floatingpoint number between 1 and 10 and this first number is inclusive that the second number isn't inclusive this means we could get a 1 but we could never get a 10 so this generates a random floating point number 15 1 and 10 now let's talk about generating a random integer so to do this with you random dot randint so random dot run and int and we'll get free and run it a few more times free to 8 6 1 what's it like so this time the first parameter is inclusive and so is the second parameter so for both inclusive what about if we want only the first one to be inclusive and the second one to be exclusive well we can use run range and this is literally the same as random done in apart from the second parameter is exclusive so he could never understand it would always be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 9 if you're enjoying for video so far be sure to give it a like it really does help me out anyway we can also get a random item from a list so we'll just create a new list so I don't know x equals this it doesn't have to be numbers it can be strings whatever and then we'd use y equals random dot choice choice X which is the West and then prints y 23 so as you can see it's chosen this item chosen this item now we can do a random choice more than once in one line with random choices and the first parameter should be a list which in our case is X and the second parameter will be our key value which is how many times say wants to run for random choice so we'll set that to 10 and then we'll print it so run it and as you can see we've got a list of 10 values both being randomly chosen so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and these are all random items from the list and it returns a list and then we could also obviously just grab the index which is 2 3 4 5 we can also mix up the order of the list using random shuffle we don't need to say to a variable we can just do random dot shuffle X so this will mix up the list and then more just bring our X as you can see this right here is different to this right here because it's being shuffled ok that's pretty much it for the random module if you found this video useful please do drop a like it really does help me out also consider subscribing I post Python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
