hello everyone and welcome to the fourth video of my Python basics tutorial series if you haven't seen in the previous episodes then go and check them out the playlist link is in the description today we'll be learning about user input now user input allows a user of the program to type something in and then we can use the data that they typed in in the program so let's get programming so the first thing you want to do is open up idle but you want to go to file new file and here we go ok so now we can do type in in input what is your name and save it ok now I forget to run run module you can see what is your name my name is Caleb and there we go we've just got user input ok so how do we actually do input well we type in this input statement so we type in input then in bracket and then brackets right next to it then inside that we have speech marks and then what we want to ask us like the question now at the moment it's not very useful is it so what we can do is we can convert this into a variable by typing your name equals input so now we've just created a variable called name and inside this variable is this input statement when we can do print hello name and both we save it run it what is your name my name is Caleb hello Caleb now we can also do age equals input how old are you I just got the space in Vienna just so it looks nicer and we can do hello name comma . you you are age yes old closing speech marks now if we run it what is your name my name is Caleb how old are you I am 13 hello Caleb you are 13 years old and we've got bad formatting we can just get rid of this we can actually use A+ fair because we do not want a space in between the name and the . what is your name Caleb how old are you I am 13 hello Caleb you are 13 years old so now for some challenges for you to do by yourself have two variables that come both contain inputs and we each get one number then using the skills we have learned in the last videos print out the variables added together secondly have two input variables ask for two words and then prints them out together in one print statement and thirdly have three input variables asking different questions and then print your answers were and then all the answers um put it in one print statement so that's all for today guys I know it was quite short and simple and make sure to stay tuned for the next tutorial by subscribing interesting feybelle so you won't miss the next episode also drop a like if this helped you out it helps me out a lot if you have any questions about Python or need some help with any errors be sure to leave it in the comment section below I'll be sure to help you out any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated as well thanks for watching
