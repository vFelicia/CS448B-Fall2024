hello everyone welcome back to short code in this video I'll be teaching you what ever handling is and how to implement it into your Python code I've lots of experience in Python and by the end of this video you'll have a clear understanding of what error handling is anyway we have three different key words in error handling we have try accept and finally try let's you testing block of code for errors except lets you handle the error and finally lets you execute code regardless if a result of the try and except walks so I have a new python file open and let's use try and accept so try print X except print there was an error then if we were in it we get there was an error because try is going to try and run this block of code and then if it finds an error l move on to this except so if we get rid of this if we just comment out except comment out try and tug this back we get an error because X isn't defined and then this try could walk here we'll try and run this and if it finds an error LLL pass it on to the accept walk we can have as many accepts as we would like so you could do accepts here print there was a different era and then accept name error so you can combine it with different types of arists if there was a name error there was a name error because printing x versa name error because X isn't exist so I'll throw in what's called a name error and then when it finds an area which is a name error they'll do print there was a name error if you're enjoying the videos so far be sure to drop a like it really does help me out anyway the finally block will run the code regardless of whether there was an error or not so you can do finally print cleaning up that was a name era cleaning up so this would usually be used to like glass stuff up like delete some variables so we don't want get rid of any errors now let's talk about raising exceptions and you confirm an exception if the condition occurs so to raise an exception we use the rate raise keywords so what's 2x equals 10 if X is greater than 5 and we'll do raise exception here only values 5 and a little loud and then we'll get an error here only values 5 and below are allowed so I'll just create an era for us and I'll say only values 5 and below are allowed because we've told it to raise an exception here okay that's it forever handling if you have any questions or comments leave them down below I'll be sure to reply if you would like to support me be sure to give this video a like it really does help me out also consider subscribing I'm post Python content almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
