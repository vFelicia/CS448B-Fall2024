hello everyone welcome back to short code today I'm going to be teaching you what function parameters are how to use them and I will also be showing you how to at use return statements by the end of this video you will be able to make your functions a lot more useful so last video we learnt about functions in this video we will be learning about parameters so premises allow us to give information to the function from other parts of our program ok so let's get into some programming okay so let's just create a new function let's do define multiplication then two brackets but then we want to put in here num number one and number two okay so now we've got that let's do print print number one is number one print number two is number two and then if we just call the function let's do five more then we were in it and we get number one is five and number two is four so let's add a little bit more to this and I will explain it once we've finished so we'll do product equals number one times number two print the product is product okay and then we were in that number one is five number two is four for product is 20 because 5 times 4 is 20 basically this is our placeholder and then when we call it these placeholders get replaced by the numbers five and four five four and then print number one is five print number two is four products equals five times four print four products is 20 so we could change these to let's say eight and two number one is eight number two is two the product is 16 now let's talk about getting data back from a function we have given our function some data and now let's get the function to give us some so to do this we use our turn statement and this allows the function to return data back to us so instead of printing this how about we return product and then we do x equals multiplication and then we'll do print X and then we get 16 so what it's doing is it's calculating the products and then it's returning products so the value of this function is now products so we're assigning that value of multiplication to X which is 16 and then we're printing X which is 16 okay so that's return statement I'm going to end the video here guys if you have any questions about what we have covered in this video or if you have any errors in your code be sure to leave a comment down below if you'd like to support me all you have to do is give this video I like it really does help me out also consider subscribing I perspire and come to an almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
