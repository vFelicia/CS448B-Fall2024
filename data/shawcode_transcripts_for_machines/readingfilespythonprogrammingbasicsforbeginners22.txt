hello everyone welcome back to short code today I'm going to be showing you how to read from a file in Python okay so first off I've just got this sample text file with some text in it now let's open a file create a new file and then we'll do file equals open text txt which is the file name make sure you're in the same directory as your text file with this Python file and then we're going to type our and then read file equals file dot read print read read file then file dot close and then if we run it we get hello there and AAA and if we look in our text file hello there AAA so I'll explain what we're doing here so first off we're creating a variable and this is set to open text exe in read mode this is what this R stands for we're reading it so this means we can't modify it we're just opening air in read mode this open statement is just bell into python and it allows us to open files and then we're creating another variable which is read file and we're doing it file dot read which is just a method which allows us to read for contents of the file and then we're printing read file and then we're doing file dot close followed up close is important if you don't close the file you'll run into some trouble a bit later on so make sure you close the file so that's basic file reading if you're enjoying for video so far please do drop a like it really does help me out now let's go on to reading each individual line so we could do this by using a read lines instead of read so read lines and then if we run it we can see we get this list so read lines returns a list and each item in the list is a new line first line is hello there and the first item is cell over and this /n is just the Enter key or a new line and then on the second line there's a a so that's all for 2 the guys in the next video we will be covering how to write text to a file if you have any questions or comments leave them down below I'll be shelter apply if you would like to support me give this video a like it really does help me out also consider subscribing I post Python content almost every day that's it from me Jess and good bye
