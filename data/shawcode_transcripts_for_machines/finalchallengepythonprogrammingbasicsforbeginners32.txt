hello everyone welcome back to show code today we are going to be doing one final challenge and we have covered all of the Python basics so this will be the last video in this series this challenge will incorporate as much of the basics as possible I will be giving the solution in this video as well so make sure you stick around for that anyway let's get right into it so the challenge is to make her NASA control system it needs to have a login system that uses a text file a main control center with various options a launch option but launches to a planet that the user inputs and Valencia should toss a coin and decide whether the mission was successful or not it needs to write all the successes with the planet name to a text file and the second option on the control center should be to view the success text file and finally the third option should just quit the program okay a little tip here I haven't actually told you how you can quit a program yet and you do this using the quit function okay that's all you need to know start coding now I know I'll give the solution once you are finished so pause the video now ok did you manage to do it if you didn't don't worry I'll go over the solution now ok so the first thing we'll want to do is create this login system so let's define login as a function then we'll want to get some user input so what do you ask user equals input user name and then ask password Oh password equals input password type go go and then we'll do what with open this is a different way to open a file so with open users dot txt I've just got a text file here which has user 1 hello with a comma at the end and use it to hello with the comma at the end make sure you have these commas at the end it will make life a lot easier we could also use the CSV module here I decided not to that you could have done if you wanted and then we'll want to open it in as and then four line in F will want to create fields equals line got split and if you remember this is just this fields is equal to a list of each individual item but as being split by a list so in this text file user one will be F the first item in the fields list second and then what we want to do now is go up here create a new list users equals just the list and then password passwords equals another list and then we'll want to do users dependent fields zero because what's this doing the zero item if that's a word is user one so once it append to user 1 the users list and then once you do passwords that append fields one which will append the password which is hello okay and then now if we just do print users and print passwords and then let's just call the login username hello this isn't master of them you can see we've got a user's list and a password list let's get rid of this now and then let's do for user and users so this is iterating over the users list if asked user which is the user input equals a the user which is just an item in the user list let's let's run the main function and let's also set lesson to be true which will come in handy soon letting people's true and then outside of this if not lesson so if this is false it will ignore this it will move on to if not less in print username / password incorrect and then it'll just go back to the top of the login function again so I'll go over way back up here so now ice make our main function so by name and then let's use a multiline print so print just some fancy text welcome to the Plaza I got these on one principle like what would you like to do what do you successors and three okay cool and then ask equals imports if asked equals one let's run launch a la ask equals o and I've missed out my double equals there if ask it was two successes la asked equals three print both in now what we're going to do is do time dot sleep and then we'll do is time not sleep one and quit now we're going to import the time module I never actually covered this before I've never done a specific video on it just because there's literally no of ease for it apart from time dot sleep so time not sleep just pause this a program for one second and then we'll do else let's print invalid and then let's just go back to the top of main and now let's do our launch function that's just right past here at the moment but let's do we define successes pass now it's gone to our launch so ask equals inputs what planet would you like to go now let's move on to the toss the coin section so we'll just do find out sleep too as well select two seconds and then chance equals random dot random one or two misses are going to be one or two and then if chance equals one print let's do an app string one did on ask which is their plan if they wanted to go to success Oh will do else print own success Oh abort mission and there is virtually no reason to use that right there so it's got a 5050 chance of being successful and not being successful in it if it's unsuccessful it's just going to go back to the main function down here but if it is successful we'll run the function right success and then we'll also pass ask now we need to define write success so define write success and with parameter will be planets which is why we've passed in ask right here with open success txt in append mode as F F dot right let's use an app string let's just write planet /n so it goes on to a new line once we've written the planet then underneath ear will do print success recorded time dots sleep or we can just pop it in pieces up there then let's go back to the main function now it's time for to do the successes function so we'll also do with open so processes that's yep ste in arm out in read mode so as F for line and F so this is going to iterate through each line in F let's print line and then we'll sleep one and we'll go back to the main okay I think that's pretty much it guys so yeah I'll just scroll through the Co if you miss any of it okay let's run it now username user one in the password it was hello welcome to Vanessa control desk what would you like to do well that's lunch first what planet would you like to go to let's go to Pluto even though it's not a planet throwing for left off tminus three two one liftoff and then we'll wait Oh random is not defined why is that the case we forgot to import random because I'm a sillybilly using let's make it a bit bigger username lets you log in with user this time hello what would you like to do I would like to lunch and hopefully without any bugs this time what planet would you like to go take Bluto again please preparing for liftoff three two one liftoff oh no it was unsuccessful well shame let's just keep on doing it until we do get success read it one no as few successes oh that's because in here it is called success not successes there we go you'll need to have the right these have the right text file we need successes there as well so username use a word but it's and then view successes sleep is not defined we need time doc sleep your success Pluto and we've had one success and now let's try the quit function so free quitting and we'll get this pop up your program is still running do you want to kill it yes we do and there we go that's the final challenge completed and it is also the end of a Python basic series why I am thinking of doing next is in intermediate series where we learn about objectoriented programming objectoriented programming is very useful and is the best way to code in Python so make sure you subscribe that it will be coming soon also make sure you comment any tutorials you would like to see on the channel I am open to your suggestions if you'd like to support me all you have to do is give this video like Chevis series with someone who you think will find it useful and subscribe to the channel because I post Python videos almost every day that's it from me Cheers and goodbye
