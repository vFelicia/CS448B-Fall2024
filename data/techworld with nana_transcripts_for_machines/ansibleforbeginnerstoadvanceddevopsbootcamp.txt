welcome to the ansible module till now you have already gained massive knowledge and skills in different devops technologies and concepts as a continuation of the projects in all the previous modules we will use ansible to further automate and optimize devops processes so learning ansible will take you another level up in your devops expertise and help you really stand out with your skills ansible nexu terraform is one of the most popular infrastructures code and configuration management tools currently used in it projects and while you've already learned terraform to automate provisioning servers in nsbl module you will learn how to automate configuring these servers installing different tools on them configuring operating system and deploying applications so in this module you will learn all the important concepts of insable with best practices and specific examples and you will learn all these with handson demo projects so by the end of the module you will know exactly how to use ansible in your own projects to automate any type of infrastructure automation and configuration tasks so let's see what you will actually learn in this section of the bootcamp during an almost eight hour insible module we will start with the core concepts of insable such as ansible inventory ansible ad hoc commands and the basic syntax of an instable playbook as well as how to use insible configuration file to change the default insight behavior after that we will learn some of the most common insible modules for installing tools on a server configuring applications working with a file system moving static files between machines etc and essentially you will learn how to map and translate shell scripts and commands into ansible playbooks to automate various common devops tasks and for comparison we will configure servers with different linux distributions on aws and digitalocean platforms you will also learn about ansible collections and ansible galaxy as a next step you will learn how to use ansible variables to make your playbooks customizable and also see all the different ways of setting the variable values in nzibal while writing these playbooks we'll also see how to troubleshoot the results and how to use conditionals and privilege escalation when needed after that we will dive into more advanced topics we will configure dynamic inventory for dynamically getting the ec2 server addresses from aws instead of statically hard coding them this is a very useful concept when working with modern dynamic infrastructure you will also learn how to execute ansible playbooks from a terraform script directly after provisioning a new infrastructure to completely automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration steps in addition to that we will use various docker modules in ansible to work with docker images and containers as well as learn about kubernetes module to automate configuring kubernetes cluster and deploying components in it in another demo project we will integrate ansible in the jenkins cicd pipeline to automate application deployment with a production grade setup in the final demo project you will learn how to make your ansible content more reusable and modular with ansible rows so you know how to write more maintainable instable code for more complex projects of course as part of the configuration is called concept we will host our instable project in a git repository and add playbooks from all the demo projects there so by the end of the module you will end up with a nice insible project portfolio as you see you don't learn ansible just as a standalone tool in the bootcamp but rather integrated in different technologies like docker kubernetes terraform jenkins aws and so on in various real world use cases as it builds on the previous modules in the bootcamp i'm already excited to teach you all of this so let's get started
