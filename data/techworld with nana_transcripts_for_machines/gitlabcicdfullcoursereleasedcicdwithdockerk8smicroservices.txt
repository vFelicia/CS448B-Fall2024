hi there i am super excited to welcome you to the gitlab ci city course getlab csd has become a very popular platform for creating release pipelines for your application so i created this course to teach you all the concepts and features to build reallife and modern cicd pipelines on gitlab so by the end of this course you'll be able to confidently use gitlab to build real devops pipelines in your projects since it's a cicd platform naturally it means that you need to know how to integrate it with other technologies so in this course i teach you how to use gitlab ci with technologies like docker docker compose kubernetes aws and so on because as an engineer if you get into a project where gitlab ci is used and you need to work with it you need a course where you can learn not only the basics and fundamentals of gitlab cicd itself like in most other courses but you need to know how to actually do real tasks of integrating it with deployment environments container registries using secret data et cetera and building pipelines not only for a simple application but for microservices applications which has its own specifics and challenges but you don't want to just learn to do it in any possible way like an inexperienced engineer just googling things and putting together something that just works instead you want to learn how to do things in the correct way with actual best practices like properly handling the sensitive data reusing pipeline configuration to avoid code duplication using a dedicated user to deploy to kubernetes environment parameterizing and using dynamic values in the pipeline to make them more flexible and reusable and so on if you have taken any of my other courses you know that you always get the best combination of theory and practice you learn every single concept and feature with engaging easy to follow demo projects but before each demo i explain the concept so you really understand exactly why a certain feature or concept is important and what purpose it has and again you learn not only gitlab specific things but also a lot of additional valuable information about docker docker compose kubernetes microservices etc so it's a wellrounded course with a lot of valuable knowledge for you as an engineer throughout the course i make sure to explain and highlight best practices and industry insights were relevant and this is an essential addition to teach you not only how to do stuff in any way but in the correct way making your knowledge even more valuable so equipped with this knowledge by the end of this course you will be absolutely confident that you really understand how gitlab cia city works and know exactly how to apply it in your real projects no knowledge gaps no insecurities so let's dive into the course curriculum to see what you will learn exactly we'll start with the basics of what ci cd is in general and comparison of git lapsity with other cicd tools then we'll go on to learn a very interesting topic of gitlab architecture and how it all works we'll learn about runners and executors and we will actually create and configure our own runners for the gitlab instance we will look at different ways of operating gitlab and see managed versus selfmanaged gitlab platform once we have the infrastructure set up we will move on to learn the core concepts of gitlab cicd like jobs stages the pipeline syntax in general how to use conditionals regular and secret variables and reusing configuration code to avoid duplication we will learn the concept of artifacts and how to generate test reports as well as share data within the pipeline using the artifacts we will see how workflow rules can be used to define when the pipelines should be triggered and we will also learn about gitlab's builtin docker registry and how to use it in the pipeline after that we'll move on to more advanced topics and learn how to speed up the pipeline using cache how to use the include feature and use gitlab's job templates in your pipeline and how to extract common pipeline code and build a job hierarchy with extends feature to make your pipeline configuration more maintainable and you will learn all these while building complete ci cd pipelines for demo applications in the first demo project we will build a reallife pipeline deploying a node.js application testing the application with simple unit tests and security tests incrementing and dynamically setting version for the docker image building and pushing image to gitlab's docker registry doing a multistage deployment to a deployment server with docker compose and promoting from development staging and production environments after that you will work through a demo of building a csd pipeline for a micro services application in a monorepo and then do a demo and compare building cicd pipeline for a polyrepo so you learn how to do both and throughout these demos we will use best practices of extracting and reusing configuration code for multiple services by creating a gitlab ci templates library here we use docker compose to deploy the services but in the final demo we will take this one step further and configure continuous deployment of microservices to a kubernetes cluster so with all this knowledge and practice you will be ready to implement real ci cd pipelines on gitlab at your work we took time and put a lot of effort in making this course as high quality as possible making all the concepts easy to understand and all the demos easy to follow as well as structure the course in a way that it stays engaging and interesting till the end so i really hope you enjoy it so if you want to learn all these check the video description for the link to the course where you get more information and you can get enrolled i'm very excited to welcome you there
