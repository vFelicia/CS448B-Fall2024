kubernetes is one of the most popular tools in cloud computing and is becoming more and more popular every day all the projects are migrating to kubernetes and it's already becoming the standard in most companies as a result of course the need for it professionals who know kubernetes is higher than ever and is increasing every year but the demand for kubernetes professionals is way higher than the number of people who actually know kubernetes this means if you invest time in learning kubernetes and getting certified as a kubernetes administrator you'll have an incredible advantage and a head start in your it career now kubernetes is not the easiest tool to learn set up and manage so if you want to become a kubernetes administrator you will need to learn a bunch of stuff i have taught hundreds of thousands of people kubernetes through my videos and now i have created this full course to teach you everything necessary to get started with kubernetes from xero and become an expert in it you will be prepared to handle any issues in the cluster you will know exactly how kubernetes works and be able to support teams in your company to use kubernetes properly after completing this course this course is mostly demo led projects where you work handson along with me to practically apply all the concepts you learn but also understand the use cases of each concept and really know why and how to use it and to make understanding the theoretical concepts easier we have animated videos and real world examples to understand how it all applies in the real world projects now you also know how important it is to prove your knowledge in the i.t world and a certification is a great way to show your skills and this course prepares you completely for the cka exam so that you can become a certified kubernetes administrator so let's go through the course contents and see what you will learn from our kubernetes administrator course we will start with the main kubernetes concept and understand how kubernetes architecture works what communities resources are learn about kubernetes configuration files and generally how to work with kubernetes we will then install a kubernetes cluster from scratch on virtual machines for that we will use a cube adm tool and learn and understand all the concepts about control plane processes how they work how they get configured and so on you will also learn about container runtime interface in kubernetes and how is it possible to use different container runtime technologies with kubernetes we will also look at a very interesting topic which is networking in kubernetes and container networking interface we will learn about how pod networking works and how it is configured as well as install a networking plugin to create a networking layer in our kubernetes cluster we will also learn how dns works in kubernetes and learn about core dns which is the dns service in kubernetes we will also take a look at how certificates work in kubernetes what certificates get automatically created and how you as a kubernetes administrator can manage that in the same section we will also learn about very important kubernetes concepts like namespaces how to work with cubectl which is a kubernetes command line tool you will learn about cubeconfig file and how to use that to connect to the cluster as well as how to configure and modify that and also using cube adm tool you will learn how to join any worker nodes to the cluster once you have installed and configured the cluster of course you want to start deploying your applications in it and make it accessible externally so we will learn how to deploy applications inside the cluster using deployments and how to make them accessible with services you will also learn about different types of services in kubernetes how to use each one and more importantly how they compare to each other one of the common ways of configuring external access to our applications running in kubernetes is ingress so you will learn what ingress controller is and how to create ingress resources to configure routing in a cluster and since we will be installing the ingress controller application using helm you will also learn what helm is how it works and how to use it to easily install different applications in kubernetes now of course you won't be the only one working with the cluster because developer teams and other people will also need access but you can't just give everyone admin access to the cluster so we will learn about the concept of users and permissions in kubernetes we will learn about our back or role based access control we will also learn how client certificates work in kubernetes and will create a client certificate for a new cluster user since devops is all about automation you will have to automate processes like deploying applications from the cicd pipeline to kubernetes for such integrations you also need users and permissions so we will learn how to create nonhuman users for different tools that interact with kubernetes when working with kubernetes things will go wrong so everyone using kubernetes should learn how to properly debug and troubleshoot the cluster so you will learn about different ways of troubleshooting and debugging in kubernetes using temporary pods cube ctl formatting and also how to debug and fix cubelet service issues etc a very common use case is running multiple containers in a kubernetes pod so you will learn about such use cases and how to implement that using init containers and multicontainer pots when deploying databases or other stateful applications in kubernetes you need to take care of persisting the data for that we will learn about volumes what different types of volumes are available for different use cases and how to configure each one of them we will also see how to create external configuration for our applications with config map and secret components now when you have hundreds or thousands of pods running in your cluster you want to make sure each pod has enough resources to run and also that one pod doesn't take up all the resources on the server for that we will learn how to configure resource requests and limits in pods next we will learn about concepts of taints and tolerations as well as node selectors node affinity and interpod affinity in kubernetes and what role they play in scheduling pods in the cluster you will also learn how to configure health status checks for containers inside the pods using liveness and readiness probes when deploying new application releases in a cluster it's important to understand how the pods get upgraded to the new application version so for that we will learn about deployment strategies in kubernetes such as rolling updates and how all this works one of the important tasks of the kubernetes administrator is to prepare for any disaster scenarios and make it possible to easily recover cluster in such cases for that we will learn how to backup and restore ecd data and also learn the theoretical concepts behind in many cases you may need to automate your tasks with kubernetes and for that it's important to learn how kubernetes rest api works and how to use it to get information from the cluster as well as make changes to it another very common task for a kubernetes administrator is making sure the cluster is always up to date using the latest kubernetes version so you will learn step by step how to upgrade kubernetes cluster on control plane nodes as well as worker nodes as a cluster admin you will often have to manage multiple kubernetes clusters and for that it's important to know the concept of context and how to use contexts to switch between clusters when administering them as part of the kubernetes administrator job you will also learn how to check expiration of kubernetes certificates and how to renew them when configuring kubernetes clusters you will have to also take care of securing your cluster in different ways one of the ways of securing the cluster is by restricting the communication between the applications within the cluster to minimize the attack surface and for that we will learn about the network policies and how to configure them in kubernetes and finally if you want to take the cka exam i prepared some useful tips that will help you totally ace the exam now equipped with all this knowledge you'll be prepared to pass the kubernetes administrator exam but more importantly be able to actually set up and administer kubernetes clusters in your projects the course is accompanied with a git repository including all the relevant links commands and examples i'm using in the demos so you can easily work along i am super excited to teach you all this so let's get started
