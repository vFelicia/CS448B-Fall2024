hello and welcome to the complete terraform course in which you will master the most popular infrastructure provisioning tool by the end of this course you will have a great understanding of terraform concepts as well as handson experience to be able to use terraform with confidence in your projects you will learn all the core concepts with several practical demos in which we will automate aws infrastructure aws is the most popular cloud provider nowadays which makes the combination of terraform and aws a very powerful and demanded skill so knowing how to manage aws infrastructure with terraform will definitely give you an advantage in the devops job market but of course you will be able to apply this knowledge for any other cloud provider or platform out there because most of the concepts in terraform are still the same i will give you an overview of what you'll learn step by step in the first part you will learn the core concepts of terraform where i will also explain how terraform differs from other automation tools and what are the best practices and use cases of terraform in real projects after that we will go through all the main terraform concepts that you will need in any terraform project like how to connect to a platform we want to automate with terraform or how to create and fetch resources on that platform you'll also learn a very important concept of terraform state as well as how to make the same terraform configuration reusable for different environments and different use cases using variables and output values and we'll also look at how to use environmental variables in terraform and of course we will learn all the relevant terraform commands you will learn all of these using handson demos so each video will be a combination of understanding the concepts and seeing it in action immediately in the second part we work on a reallife demo project we will automate creating a virtual server on aws in its own private network with all the needed configuration first we will create the main aws network resources like vpc subnet route table internet gateway and security group and configure all of them correctly to deploy our virtual server instance on aws now if you don't have any preexisting knowledge of aws and its components and services you don't need to worry because i will explain every aws service or concept that we will use in this course so that you can easily follow along after that we will deploy an ec2 server instance on our configured infrastructure we will also automate installing docker and starting a docker container on this newly created aws ec2 server instance in addition we will also automate creating ssh key pair on aws so that we can ssh into our ec2 instance as well as configure firewall rule to access the deployed container application from the browser and finally throughout the course we will use git to manage our configuration code which is a best practice in infrastructure as code so you will see some of the tips for managing terraform codes specifically in git in the last section you will learn additional concepts of terraform and we will improve our configuration of the demo project with some best practices first of all you will learn how to modularize your terraform project and how to make use of existing modules from the terraform registry to simplify your own configurations we'll also configure our terraform project to use a remote state with aws s3 bucket storage and you will learn why using remote storage is so important and useful in terraform projects and finally you will learn the concept of provisioners and how and for what use cases provisioners should be used in real projects so all of these will be fully automated and parameterized with variables so we can replicate it on any environment with different configurations as it is done with best practices so to summarize this course is perfect for people who are completely new to terraform and infrastructure is code concept generally and would like to learn it in an easy and efficient way through handson demos and examples but also want to understand the concepts behind again after that course you will be ready to use terraform with confidence at your work or in any of your projects and as i mentioned no need for previous aws knowledge as the resources that we're going to create on aws are also explained in detail in the course you can find this course on udemy so check out the description for more information hope to see you there
