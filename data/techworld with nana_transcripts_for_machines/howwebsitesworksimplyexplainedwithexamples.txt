if you want to finally understand how the seemingly mysterious thing called web development works and get an insight into the IT world without being overwhelmed by all these technical Woodward's then this is the perfect video for you in this video I'm gonna explain to you in a very simple language how web and web applications work and how all these technologies that you've heard about like JavaScript Java databases etc fit in the whole picture imagine this scenario you wake up in the morning get your coffee open your laptop and open Facebook in your browser so let's pause there what happened when you typed in Facebook in your browser and you saw a fresh new feed with all the new stuff that has happened while you were asleep what happened there in the background technologically so Facebook is an application that some developers sitting mostly in California are developing and these guys and gals are writing a bunch of code and all the code that makes up Facebook leaves in California so what happens when you open facebook on your laptop is that part of that code that lives in California travels all the way to your laptop to your location and ends up temporarily living on your laptop that's why sometimes when you refresh and see a blank page or loading and you become annoyed because you can't see your feed within three seconds that's when all the data is coming or traveling from somewhere to your laptop so it may meet some time so how does that travel there are internet cables everywhere in the world actual physical cables that let electricity travel through from one place in the world to another and so everything is connected everywhere so that's why some remote places in Africa or Asia where there's no internet and you're wondering wow like how is this possible now internet that's super crazy but that's pretty simple because nobody built those internal cables near those areas because it wasn't worth it so no internet now if you think about it it would be super inefficient if every time in Europe opened Facebook and all the data needed to travel to these places all the way from California so Facebook has built locations evenly distributed all around the world that store part of the code and data that doesn't change much so it can get to you much faster back to that part of code that just traveled to you that's HTML CSS in JavaScript so what are these when you see a website that just looks ugly so we just text no fun colors no styling that's a naked HTML it's necessary but no one wants to see some plain ugly text without any styling so what makes the text pretty and it colors and some fun to it is CSS it's like flesh on a skeleton now you have a flesh that looks good but it doesn't do anything it doesn't move it doesn't talk doesn't respond you can interact with it and it's the same way with HTML plus CSS page typical use cases are visit card websites where you can read text displayed in nice style but you can't leave a comment you can send a message you can do anything with the website so all that action comes purely from JavaScript so you want to upload a photo on Facebook that's JavaScript you want to send a message through messenger that's JavaScript you want to like your friends picture or leave a comment all JavaScript so everything that you interact with in the UI which stands for user interface is through JavaScript and the combination of these three HTML CSS and JavaScript is called frontend it's the Facebook code that everyone sees so it's in the front and as I said all these three files leave on your laptop when you open facebook so you can see and even edit them so I could go and change Facebook style like this and this won't affect anyone else in the world since everyone has their own copy of these files on their laptops but there is another part of the code that doesn't travel to you the back end code that is in the back and no one can see so you may be now wondering if I can do anything in front end like upload images message someone leave a comment like what's the backandforth what does it do well when you upload a picture on Facebook you surely want your friends to see that too or when you message someone you want to keep a history of these messages that means you want all these data to persist in other words the data to be saved over time now if javascript only lives on your laptop it wouldn't make sense to just have that photo only locally on your computer that's where the beckon comes in so what happens is that javascript takes that image that you uploaded puts it in an envelope and hands it over to internet saying hey can you deliver this to backend at this specific location so now we can follow this delivery all the way to the backend and see what happens there or what what does back and do when it gets that image now back in code can be written in Java Python PHP or even Java Script so there are different technologies that you can use to write all that back in part of the code so let's say in our example it's Java so what does Java do it checks and examines the photo it sees is it a valid delivery there's no threat no danger I know the sender I trusted so I'll open the envelope since everything is fine and hands it over to database to save it for later so database is like a warehouse it's a big space where you can keep all the images messages likes comments that different users are producing it's all in there so to have a more specific understanding let's actually see how the location where backend code and database leave quoteunquote actually look like so as I mentioned before Facebook has all these buildings distributed all around the world actual physical buildings with servers inside and I don't know what you imagine when you think about servers but whatever it is it's probably not very close to reality so let me show an example of a server building of a typical big company like Facebook so it's a location where machines they're interconnected with each other are running 24/7 in order to make sure that Facebook or this application is available for everybody in the world all the time and that's where beckon code and database actually leave so that's where all the magic happens so when that envelope gets delivered to your backend that's where it ends up so the address that it sent to is one of those machines in among these hundreds or thousands of machines that will take your image validated and then save it into a database so it happens all inside there so now consider your friend logs into Facebook on our computer same way frontend code travels to her laptop along with new data like images messages from friends etc all coming from this servers so how does Facebook know what data you should see on your newsfeed now in the database warehouse Facebook creates isolated spaces for each user with their personal data images etc and obviously on Facebook you want to have some privacy meaning you want only a friends to see your posts so Facebook creates connections in the database between users that are friends and that's how Facebook decides what information to send to a user when they log into the application along with new data like images and messages from friends including the image that you just uploaded all coming from the servers so to summarize a web application is always made up of three components you have a frontend code backend and database frontend is what you see and interact with in your browser in the user interface of the application backend is the code that waits for new messages from frontend about the changes you make like new uploads new messages likes and handles them and database is where all these changes are stored for future usage like when you come back the next stage to use the application or when your friend opens the application most of the applications are written by teams of developers and not just a single developer and there are a lot of developers that are full stick meaning they know all three they can work with frontend backend and database however each of these three areas alone is its own IT field so some developers actually choose to specialize in just one area and become for example a frontend developer so in big companies like Facebook you would have teams with specialized frontend developers backend developers and database developers so what this means for you is that if you're just starting off as a web developer or you are thinking about becoming a web developer you should choose just one of these three areas as a starting point learn it well and then move on to other technologies and a good starting point is usually frontend because it's more visual and you can see the results
