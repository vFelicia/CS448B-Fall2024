so in this video I will show you how to install darker on different operating systems the installation will differ not only based on the operating system but also the version of the operating system so you can actually watch this video selectively depending on which OS and the version of that OS you have I will show you how to find out which installation step applies to you in the before installing section which is the first one so once you find that out you can actually directly skip to that part of the video where I explain that into details I will put the mini locations of each part in the description part of the video and also I will put all the links that I use in the video in the description so that you can easily access them also if you have any questions during the video or if you get stuck installing the docker on your system please post your question or problem in the comment section so that I can get back to you and help you proceed or maybe someone from the community will so with that said let's dive right into it so if you want to install docker you can actually google it and you get an official documentation of docker it's important to note there are two editions of docker there is a community and Enterprise editions for us to begin with Community Edition will be just fine in the docker Community Edition tab there there is a list of operating systems and distributions in order to install docker so for example if we start with Mac we can click in here and we see the documentation of how to install it on Mac which is actually one of the easiest but we'll see some some other ones as well so before you install darker on your Mac or Windows computer there are prerequisites to be considered so for Mac and Windows there has to be some criteria of the operating system and the hardware met in order to support running if you have make go through the system requirements to see if your make version is actually supporting docker if you have windows then you can go to the Windows tab and look at the system requirements there or what to know before you install for example one thing to note is that docker natively runs only on Windows 10 so if you have a Windows version which is less than 10 then we docker cannot run natively on your computer so if your computer doesn't meet the requirements to run docker there is a workaround for that which is called docker toolbox that of docker you basically just have to install a docker toolbox that will become a sort of a bridge between your operating system and the docker and that will enable you to run docker on your legacy computer so if that applies to you then skip ahead in this video to the part where I explain how to install docker toolbox on Mac and on windows so let's install docker for Mac as we see here there are two channels that you can download the binaries from or the application from will go with a stable channel and other things you consider if you have an older version of Mac the software or the hardware please go through the system requirements to see if you can actually install docker so here there is a detailed description of what make version you need to be able to run docker and also you need at least 4 gigabytes of RAM and by installing darker you will actually have the whole package of it which is a darker engine which is important or which is necessary to run the docker containers on your laptop the docker commandline client which will enable you to execute some token commands docker compose if you don't know it yet don't worry about it but it's just technology to orchestrate if you have multiple containers and some other stuff that we're not gonna need in this tutorial but you will have everything in a package installed so go ahead and download the stable version well I already have darker installed from the edge channel so I won't be stalling it again but it shouldn't matter because the steps of installation are the same for both so once the docker dmg file is downloaded you just double click on it and it will pop up this window just drag the docker well up into the applications and will be installed on your Mac as the next step you will see docker installed in your applications so you can just go ahead and start it so as you see the docker sign or icon is starting here if you click on it you see the status that docker is running and you can configure some preferences and check the docker version and so on and if you want to stop talker or quited on your Mac you can just do it from here and importance may be interesting note here is that if let's say you download or install docker and if you have more than one accounts on your laptop you will actually get some errors or conflicts if you run docker at the same time or multiple accounts so what I do for example is that if I switch to another account where I'm also gonna need docker I quit it from here and then I started from from the other account so that I don't get any errors so that might be something you need to consider if you use multiple accounts so let's see how to install Tucker for Windows the first step as I mentioned before is to go to the before you install section and to see that your operating system and your computer meets all the criteria to run docker natively so if you are installing dog for the first time don't worry about most of these parts like doctor toolbox and doctor machine there are two things that are important one is to double check that your Windows version is compatible for docker and the second one is to have virtualization enabled virtualization is by default always enabled other than you manually disabled it so if you're unsure then you can check it by going to the task manager performance CPU tab and here you can see the status of the virtualization so once you have checked that and made sure this that these two prerequisites are met then actually you can scroll up and download the windows installer for from the stable channel once the Installer is downloaded you can just click on it and follow the installation wizard to install docker for Windows once the installation is completed you have to explicitly start docker because it's not going to start automatically so for that you can just go and search for the docker for Windows app on your Windows and just click on it and you will see the darker whale icon starting and if you click on that icon you can actually see the status that says Stoker is now up and running so this is basically it for the installation now let's see how to install Tucker on different Linux distributions and this is where things get a little bit more complicated so first of all you see that in this menu on the on the left you see that for four different Linux distributions the installation steps will differ but also for example if we just click on one two for the guide you can see that in the prerequisites section there is also differentiation between the versions of the same Linux distribution and there may be some even more complicated scenarios where the combination of the version of the distribution and the architecture it's running in also makes some difference in to how to setup docker on that specific environment because of that I can't go through a docker installation process of every Linux environment because they're just too many combinations so instead what we'll do is just go through a general overview of the steps and configuration process to get darker running on your Linux environment and you can just adjust it then for your specific setup so these are some general steps to follow in order to install docker on your Linux Linux environment first of all you have to go through the operating system requirements part on your on the relevant Linux distribution that applies for you a second step in the documentation to is to any sell old versions however if it's the first time you installing darker then you know I have to worry about that you also don't have to worry about the support its storage drivers and you can skip ahead to the part of installing darker Community Edition so for any Linux distribution here the steps will be or the options for installing docker will be the same so first option is basically to set up a repository and download the docker from install it from the dock repository the second option is to install the packages manually however I wouldn't recommend it and I think the documentation doesn't recommend it either because then you will have to do a lot of steps of the installation in the maintenance of the versions manually so I wouldn't do that the third one is just with the testing purposes it may be enough for the development purposes as well but I would still not do it which is basically just download downloading some automated scripts that will install and setup docker on your Linux environment however again I wouldn't go with it I would actually just do the first option which is just downloading the darker from the repository so in order to install darker using the first option which is downloading it from the Dockers repositories you have two main steps so the first one is to set up the repository which differs a little bit depending on which distribution you have and then install the docker seee from the repository so from Ubuntu and Debian the steps for setting up the repository are generally just updating your package and then setting up an HTTP connection with the repository and adding the Dockers official jpg key which only Ubuntu and Debian need you don't have to do this steps for CentOS and fedora there just have to install the required packages in the last step for setting up the repository is basically setting up the stable repository of docker which we saw previously on the overview that there are two channels which is a stable and edge here you always have to set up the stable repository optionally you can also set up the edge repository but I'll just do stable this time and here also something to notice depending on architecture you have to actually set it or you have to set that as a parameter when you setup the repository so if you have for example a different architecture you can use those steps to display the correct command for it and I guess that applies to other Linux distributions as well like for example here you also have the second tab where you see a separate comment for it so this steps should actually set up the repository so that as a next step you can then install the docker C from those repositories so installing docker from the setup repository is actually pretty straightforward the steps are same for or similar to all the distributions basically just update the app package and then you just say install docker seee so this command will just download the latest stock version if you want to install a specific one which you will need to do in a production environment then you can just provide a version like this you just say docker EE equals some specific versions and using this command you can actually look up what versions are available in that repository that you just and with this command actually docker will be installed on your Linux environment and then you can just verify using sudo docker run hello world which is this demo image of docker you can verify that docker is running and this will start hello world docker container on your environment so as I mentioned previously for environments that do not support running docker natively there is an workaround which is called docker toolbox so darker Tool Works is basically an installer for darker environment set up on those systems so this is how to install darker toolbox on your Mac this is the whole package that comes with the installation of tako toolbox which is basically the darker commandline doctor machine docker compose basically all the packages that we saw in the native installation and in on top of that you also get the Oracle VM VirtualBox so in order to install the darker toolbox it's actually pretty straightforward on your on this website you can go to the toolbox releases we have all the list of latest releases you just take the latest release and here you see two assets this one is for Windows obviously and you just download the package for Mac and once it's downloaded you just click on it and go through the installation wizard leave all the options by defaults as they are do not change anything and after the installation we can just validate the the installation is successful and you can actually run docker so after seeing the installation was successful screen just go and look up in your Launchpad talk a QuickStart terminal and once you open it you should be able to run docker commenced and you can just try docker run hello world which should just start up or bring up this hello world docker container on your environment so now let's see how to install dr. toolbox on windows here is you that you get the whole package of docker technologies with the toolbox which are basically the same package which you get on the native docker installation and on top of that you get Oracle VM VirtualBox which is the tool that enables docker to run on an older system so before you install dr toolbox you have to make sure that you meet some of the preconditions number one you have to make sure your windows system supports virtualization and that virtualization must be enabled otherwise docker docker won't start so depending on which we version you have looking up or checking the virtualization status will be different so I just suggest you google it and look it up of how to find the virtualization status to see that it's enabled once you have that checked also make sure that your windows operating system is 64 bits so if those two criteria are met then you can go ahead and install the docker toolbox the place where you see the releases or the release artifacts is toolbox releases link here which I have opened so it's basically a list of the releases you just take the latest one which has two artifacts this is the one for Windows you just download this executable file click on it and go through the installation wizard once the installation is completed there just couple of steps here you can verify that docker was installed or the toolbox was installed by just looking up the docker a QuickStart terminal on your windows that it must be installed and once you click on it and open it you should be able to run docker commands in the terminal so the basic docker command that you can test will be docker run hello world which will just fetch this basic docker container from the public registry and run it on your computer if that command is successful it means that docker was successfully installed on your computer and now you can proceed with the tutorial thanks for watching the video I hope it was
