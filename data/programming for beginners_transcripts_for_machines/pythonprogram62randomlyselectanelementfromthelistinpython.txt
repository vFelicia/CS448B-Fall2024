hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to randomly select an element from the list so guys we can randomly select any element from the list in two ways so basically the first way is by using the random module and then the second way is by using the secret module over here so guys let us check this with the help of examples as well in the PS code so guys the very first thing that we will be doing is we will Define the list so let's say we have list one over here and then the elements that are present in the list is the combination of the numbers and the characters as well so let's say we have one and then followed by we have a and then let's say we have three and then let's say we have C as the character and then let's say we have two and then we have DSD character and then let's say we have the number 10 over here so Guys these are certain elements inside the list it is consisting of numbers as well as characters as well now let's say there is a requirement that you want to select one of the element from this list randomly so what we can do is the very first way is by using the random module so we need to import the random module in order to use it so basically the import statement is the very first statement in our Python program so we say import keyword followed by space and then we have the right now module over here so as you can see vs code is suggesting as this random module in this case so we are going to select this random module now guys simply we can use this random module so inside this random module there are multiple methods that you can use out of which one of the methods is the choice method so over here random followed by Dot and then we have something called as Choice method as you can see choose a random element from a non empty sequence basically this method will help us in order to select one of the elements from this list randomly so we are going to use this Choice method and then we are going to pass this list to this Choice method so we have list 1 here so guys basically this Choice method is expecting the parameter that is the sequence which is the list one that we have passed over here and then guys this entire statement can be present inside the print statement because this Choice method is going to return one of the elements from the list one randomly so guys we are using the print method in order to print that item that is being selected by this Choice method so guys this is the way that we can use the choice method inside the random module let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got a that is one of the elements that is present inside this list as the random element let us run this code once again to see which is the next element that we get so as you can see after running this code once again we get another element over here that is two so guys randomly the choice method will help us in order to select one of the elements from this list guys it can be used in order to randomly select one of the cards from the deck of cards as well if you are dealing with an application which involves the deck of cards as one of the applications now guys let us see another method we can also use the secrets module in the same way in order to randomly choose one of the elements inside the list so guys what we will do is I'll just remove this line of code now and instead of random we will have the secrets module over here so we type Secrets module and then in the same way we can use the choice method inside the secrets module in order to randomly select one of the elements from the list so over here we use the secrets module followed by Dot and then we have the choice method once again inside this module and then again we are going to provide the list one as the parameter so this will help us in order to select one of the elements from the list now guys we are going to enclose this entire line of code inside the print statement so that the element is printed on the console over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see this time we are are getting 3 as the randomly selected element from this list let me just run this code once again over here again we are getting 3 I'll find this code once again this time we are getting a over here and then we are getting 10 now and then we are getting d as well so guys randomly one of the elements is getting selected over here from the list by using the secrets module as well guys comment in the comment section below whether you will be able to predict what will be the next element that is chosen by Secrets or the random when you are using this Choice method let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the
