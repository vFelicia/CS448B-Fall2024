so now we will create a button animation and this is the button that is getting displayed over here and when we get the mouse cursor on this button as you can see this is the animation that we are going to create just with the help of plain HTML and the CSS properties so guys let us move to the vs code so let us create a new folder inside the HTML CSS projects so over here we will create the folder and we will name it as 07 and then we will say button animation in this case so guys basically this is the new folder that we have created inside this we will create our HTML and the CSS files so we have index.html file and the style. CSS file as well guys basically we have both these files over here now inside the index.html file we will make use of this Mt abbreviation that is exclamation mark and when we press enter as you can see we have this HTML template that is getting generated so over here for the title part simply we will say button animation this time and then after the title we will link the style. Cs file that we have created using this link colon CSS M abbreviation so guys basically we have to set the HF it is equal to the name of the file that is style. CSS file over here now guys inside the body tag what we have to do is we will make use of the a tag that is the anchor tag over here and we will have the class name that is button in this case so guys basically we are going to convert this a tag into a button and we will have the animation inside the button over here so guys we have set the text as whole over me in this case so guys let me just save this file now and let us start the live server over here from the bottom right so as you can see this is the link that is getting displayed that is having the text over me in this case now guys let us provide certain CSS properties to this a tag so that we can convert this link into a button so guys over here inside the style. CSS file first of all we will have the body tag over here so that we can have the button tag at the center of the screen so that we can get this a tag at the center of the screen in this case so let me just provide the display it is equal to flex and then simply we will say justify content it is equal to Center let me just save this file now so as you can see we are getting the link at the center of the screen over here apart from this we will also provide align items it is equal to Center in this case so as you can see we are getting the link at the center of the page as far as the horizontal alignment is concerned now guys what we will do is simply we will provide certain CSS properties to this button class over here let me just rename this class name to BTN because the button keyword is also reserved for the button tag in this case let me just rename this class name to BTN so that we don't get confused with the button tag inside HTML so guys over here we are going to make use of this class that is BTN so inside the style. CSS file we have the dot character followed by the BTN now guys over here first of all let us provide the padding of 10 pixels from top and bottom and 20 pixels from left and right in this case also we will have certain border over here so let's say we have two pixels of border which is of the type solid this time and then we will have the color that is 764 ABC as far as the hex color is concerned so guys this is the color that we are going to use in order to have the Border color and also the text color must be the same color so guys it is a best practice in order to copy this value of the hex color and save it inside a variable so guys over here inside the body tag we will create a variable that is button color over here so basically we have this button color variable and let us provide this hex color this time so basically this is the variable that we can use anywhere we want to make use of this color inside the body tag so guys over here simply we have to make use of the wear function and inside the wear function we will make use of this variable that we have defined that is button color over here remember that we have to provide two times Hyun while using the variable and also while declaring the variable over here either inside the root select or the body selector so let me just save this file now and let us see the Border over here so as you can see we are getting the border that is of the two pixels solid type this time now guys this text color should also have the same border color over here so what we will do is simply we will say color it is equal to where function and then we will make use of this variable so let me just save this file now so as you can see both the colors are same now and then apart from this what we will do is simply we will remove the underline by using the text decoration ation it is equal to none and also we will provide certain border radius so that we get a good corners for this particular button so simply we will have the Border radius of 20 pixels let me just save this file now so as you can see the link is now converted to a button that is getting displayed over here apart from this let us also provide certain margin from top so that we have certain spacing from top so we have provided the 50 pixels margin from top of this button now guys let us create the animation inside this button over here and before that simply if you want to change the color of the button you can simply come over here and make changes to this color so let's say we want to change it to some green color over here so when we change this color to Green let's say we are using this particular color let me just save this file now so as you can see the button border is now converted to green color along with it the text is also changed to green color over here so guys this is the way that you can make use of the variables and simply you can make the changes at one location so that the changes are applied at all the locations wherever you have used that particular variable so as you can see this is the color that we are using now guys apart from this what we have to do is we have to create a rectangular shape element on this web page so that we can create the animation for this button when we get the mouse cursor on this particular button so simply we will make use of this button class over here and we can make use of the seudo element that is before so guys basically this before and after seudo elements will help us in order to create new HTML elements without having to provide those HTML elements inside the HTML page so guys let us check that how we can do it with the help of the before pseudo element so over here we have made use of this button class which is representing this a tag over here always remember that if you want to create the new HTML Elements by using the before or the after sudo element you can do so only for the container tags you cannot do it for the tags which are not containers so let's say if you have the input tag which is not a container tag you cannot make use of the before and after sudo elements in order to add new HTML elements so guys inside the gurly braces first of all we have to make use of the content CSS property and simply we will keep it as blank over here that is double quotes in this case now guys apart from this we also have to make use of the position CSS property it must be absolute so guys whenever we are making use of this position equal to Absolute CSS property we need to have the container So currently the container is button class over here and we have to make the position as relative for this parent container this time so over here we set the position as relative and then for the position equal to Absolute we can provide the top left bottom or right CSS properties so where do we want this box to occur exactly over here at the top left corner of the button so simply we will say top it is equal to zero and also left it is equal to zero so that the top left corner of this particular new element is aligned over here at the top left of the button now guys apart from this we also want this element to have the width equal to 100% which should cover the entire button and also the height of 100% over here so simply we will say width it is equal to 100% And also the height CSS property is 100% this time and then apart from this let us also have certain background color so simply we will make use of the same color by using the wear function and then we will use this button color over here let me just say this file now and now if you see on the web page there is a square box that is covering the entire button over here now guys this particular square box is present on top of the button that we had already created so basically if we don't provide the top and left CSS property over here let us see what happens so we have commented out these lines of code let me just save this file now as you can see it is getting placed somewhere over here and not exactly at top of the button which is behind this particular rectangular box and then guys we also want this rectangular box to be present behind the button so what we can do is simply we will set the Z index CS property to minus one over here so that it goes behind the current button that is already present on the web page so when we save this file now it has gone behind the button over here and since the text color is also having that variable we are not able to make it out because the text color of the hover me text is also having the same color over here what we will do is instead of having this color simply we will set the color as white this time so when we say color it is equal to White you will be able to see the hover me text which means the button is now at the top of the rectangular box and when we remove the Zed index over here which is minus one now the rectangle shape is on the top of the button so guys this is the way that you can make the rectangular box that you have created by using this before sudo element go behind the button this time so guys when we save this file now so basically this particular rectangular box is present behind the button right now and then guys what we will do is simply I'll remove this color over here and UNC commmand this line of code and also we want the top and left to be zero so that the Box comes exactly on top of the button so let us remove these commands over here and then let me just save this file now so as you can see the box is exactly at the top of the button now guys we want to move this box on the left hand side and when we get the mouse cursor on this button over here the Box should come behind the button so that we can see the cool animation so what we will do is we will make use of the transform CSS property and then we will say translate X this time so guys basically this will help us in order to move the box and we will say 100% this time so let me just save this file now so as you can see the box has moved to the left right now and when we get the mouse cursor over here the Box should come behind this particular button so simply what we can do is we can make use of the hover Udo class over here so guys basically we will make use of this button class over here and on Hover event which means we make use of this hover class we want this portion that is before portion over here to come on the right hand side so simply after the hover Pudo class we will make use of the before pseudo element over here in this way and then after this what we have to do is the before element should move on the right so simply we will say transform and then we will say translate X it should go to the original position which is zero position over here for the x coordinate so when we say zero let me just save this file now and when we get the mouse cursor now on the button as you can see the rectangular shape element is now coming behind the button over here now guys we want the smooth transition this time so simply what we will do is we will say transition CSS property over here for the button class we will say all and then we will say 1 second as the timing and the same line of code should be present for the before element as well for the button class so over here we have provided the transition all it is equal to 1 second now guys whatever changes happen to the button or the rectangular element over here it will happen with a transition of 1 second so when we save this file now and now when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see there's a transition of 1 second that we can see now guys we also want to hide this rectangular element before we get the mouse cursor over here on the button so what we can do is simply inside the button class we will say overflow CSS property it must be hidden so guys whatever elements are present outside of the border of this particular button class will be hidden by default so let me just save this file now so as you can see there is no element that can be seen and when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see this is the way that the animation is happening now guys when the element covers the button we want to change the text of the hover me that is present over here to white color so what we can do is simply we will say button class and then we will have the hover pseudo class over here and then we will have the color it is equal to white color let me just save this file now and now when we get the mouse C over here as you can see there is a smooth transition that is happening and the color of the overover me text is also getting converted to white color in this case so guys in this way you can create a cool animation over here with the help of the HTML and the CSS properties now guys if you want to change the color of the button simply as I have told you you can come to this variable and then change the color so let's say we want some version of the green color over here so let's set the color to green color this time and when we save this file now as you can see this is the button that is setting displayed on the web page and when we get the mouse cursor over here you can see the cool button animation that is happening so guys in this way you can set the required color based on your requirements as per the project so guys
