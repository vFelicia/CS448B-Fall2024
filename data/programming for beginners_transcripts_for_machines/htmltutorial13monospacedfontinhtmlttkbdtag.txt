welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about monospaced font in HTML so guys the content that is within the TT tag that is the starting tag and the ending tag over here is written in a mono spaced font now what is a mono spaced font so most of the fonts are known as variable with fonts because different letters are of different width for example the letter M over here is wider than the letter I so you can see the width of the letter M it is more compared to the width of the letter I over here now in a mono spaced font however each letter has the same width so this we are going to check with the help of examples now now guys remember that the TT tag that is used for the mono spaced font in HTML is being deprecated and we must use the kbd tag if we are using the HTML5 version so let us check this with the help of examples now in the vs code so what we will do is we will have a paragraph with a P tag over here and we will say this text is mono space so over here we have this text is mono spaced in this paragraph So this is one statement inside the paragraph that this text is mono's based in this paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we are getting a simple paragraph over here now guys what we need to do is these three words that is text is mono space we want to display it in the mono spaced font so what we will do is inside the source code we need to enclose these three words within the TT tag so over here we will simply have the lesson symbol and then we will say TT over here and then greater than symbol so let me just cut this ending tag and paste it after this monus based word so we have enclosed this text is mono spaced within this TT tag that is the star tag and the end tag as you can see it is being displayed in the red color that's because this tag is deprecated in the latest version of the HTML let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the appearance of this text is monospaced is different compared to the other words in the same paragraph over here all the characters of this text is having the same with noun so guys basically even though this tag is deprecated but still it is being supported in some of the latest versions it is better to use the latest tags over here and that is what we have the KVD tag for so basically this is another tag in the HTML5 that we can use in order to have the same functionality similar to this DT tag so I'll just remove the TT tag over here and we will see KBT in this case so when we type kbd so as you can see kvt is being suggested by the vs code I'll end it using the greater than symbol and then cut this ending tag and replace this TT tag with the ending tag of the kvt let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again no change will be noticed as you can see since the text is mono spaced is being displayed over here using the kbd tag as well so guys this this is the way that we can have the mono spaced font for some of the text or all of the text inside the paragraph or any other tags that you are using based on your requirements comment in the comment section below if you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is making text superscript in HTML using the sup tag so stay tuned
