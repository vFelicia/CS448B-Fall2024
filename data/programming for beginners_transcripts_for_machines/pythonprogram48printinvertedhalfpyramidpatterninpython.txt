hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to print inverted half pyramid pattern so guys this is the inverted half pyramid pattern as you can see there are five number of rows over here and the first row it is having five stars and Then followed by we have four stars and then we have three and then two and then in the end we have one star over here so guys this is the inverted half pyramid pattern that we are going to print using the Python program now guys what is the algorithm for pattern programs basically each pattern program has two or more than two Loops the number of the loop depends on the complexity of the pattern or the logic so this we are going to check with the help of examples as well the first for Loop works for the row and the second for Loop works for the column so guys this is very important and this we are going to implement using the Python program in vs code so guys over here what we will be doing is first of all we will take the number of rows from the user so we will name the variable as rows it is equal to n and then inside this we will be using the input function so basically we will provide the label as enter number of rows over here so guys whatever input user is providing it will be of the string data type we are converting the string data type to the integer by using this into function over here and it will be stored in this rows variable now guys what we have to do is simply we can use the for Loops in order to print the inverted half pyramid pattern so over here we will be using the for I in range now this range it will go from 0 up to rows so over here we say 0 comma rows because that many number of rows we need to print and then after this we have colon and then we can have the nested for Loop over here this time so for J in range so guys the very first row is having five number of rows over here as you can see so 5 times we need to print the star characters over here so what will be the value 5 initially basically the rows is having the number that is 5 initially so again it will go from 0 up to row minus I this time so guys what we are doing exactly is initially the value of I is 0 so what will be the value of J it will be in the range from 0 up to rows minus I so rows is 5 minus I which is 0 so 5 minus 0 is 5 in this case so it will go from 0 up to 4 so basically initially only 5 Star characters will be printed when we provide the rows number as 5 in this case then next time the value of I will increment so basically our number of characters should decrease in this case because on the next line we have four number of characters and then next time we have three number of star characters and so on so similarly what we have done is we have done rows minus I so with the increase in the value of I the the second parameter over here will decrease and the number of star characters that are printed will also decrease over here so guys after this colon we can simply provide the print statement and inside this we can say star followed by a space character because all the star characters are separated by these base characters over here and then guys we don't want to go to the next line until we finish the entire row so over here we provide comma and the end parameter will have a blank character over here so that the control flow doesn't go to the next line when the control flow is within this inner for Loop now guys what we have to do is once the control flow comes out of this nested for Loop we have to provide a print statement so that the control flow goes to the next line in order to print the remaining four star characters and then next time it will also come to the new line again and it will print the three star characters and so on so guys basically this is the print function that we have provided over here just to do that that is in order to come to the next line okay this is the program that will help us in order to print the inverted half pyramid star pattern let me just save this file now and try running this code so it is asking to enter the number of rows let us provide 5 as the number of rows over here when we press enter as you can see this is the inverted half pyramid star pattern that we have got the first row is having five number of star characters then there are four star characters then we have three and then two and then one guys let us run this code once again this time we will provide the number of rows as 10 so when we press enter as you can see we have got another inverted half pyramid star pattern over here which is having 10 number of rows the first row is having 10 stars and then the second row is having Nine Stars and then so on the number of star characters are decreasing with the increase in the number of rows so guys this is the way that we can easily print the inverted half pyramid star pattern over here please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different and outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the
