so now we will see Arrow functions in JavaScript so guys basically these Arrow functions allow us to write the shorter function syntax so previously we had seen how we can write the functions and reuse functions in JavaScript but we can write shorter functions as well with the help of the arrow functions over here so as you can see this is the syntax and the example we have the let keyword and Then followed by the variable name that is function every time we will be using the my function that is the variable name in order to call call the function so previously in the regular functions we had the function name that we can use in order to call that function but over here we will be using the my function or any other name that we provide to that particular function followed by the equal to operator and then we have the open and close parenthesis over here now these parameters are optional if you want to provide the parameters you can provide them and you can use the variable names over here as you can see this particular Arrow function is using the parameters in this case followed by the equal to operator and then greater than symbol so guys this particular expression is important in order to understand how Arrow function works so basically we have the open and close parenthesis and then we have the combination of equal to and then greater than symbol and then after this we can have the lines of code over here so guys let us check the examples of Arrow function in vs code in this case so first of all we will understand the regular functions so we can provide the function keyword followed by let's say we want to multiply two numbers over here so simply we provide the function name that is multiply and Then followed by the open and close parenthesis over here and simply what we can do is we had seen the return statement and we can return the multiplication of the two variables that are being passed so over here we can take the two variables as parameters A and B so over here we will return a multiplied by B in this case now guys what we can do is simply we can provide the variable that is result over here and then we can call this regular function by using the function name that is multiply and then inside the open and close parenthesis simply we can provide the two values let's say we provide the first value as 10 followed by comma and then we have another value that is two in this case so a will be equal to 10 over here and this B will be equal to 2 in this case that is getting passed over here to the function and a multili by B will be returned and it will be stored inside this particular result and simply we can have the console. log statement over here and then we can say the multiplication result is and then over here we will provide dollar symbol followed by open and close curly Braes and simply we will provide result over here which is the variable name so guys the multiplication result is result in this case which will be displayed based on the multiplication of these two numbers let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here by using the node command in this case so as as you can see the multiplication result is 20 that's because 10 * 2 is equal to 20 in this case let us change the number to 10A 7 in this case so probably the result will be 10 * 7 which is equal to 70 over here so as you can see the multiplication result is 70 so guys in this way the regular functions work now guys how do we convert this into an arrow function over here so simply we have to remove this function keyword and we will provide the let keyword over here and then we are using this particular variable name that is multiply and Then followed by equal to operator in this case and then we will keep this open and close parenthesis which is helping us in order to pass the parameters over here and in between the parenthesis and the curly braces over here simply we will use the combination of equal to operator and the greater than symbol in this case so guys basically we have equal to operator and then greater than symbol so as you can see we have just converted the regular function to an arrow function over here so simply we have to use the multiply function name and then provide the parameters as it is expected by the arrow function over here that is a and b after which we have the equal to and the greater than symbol over here and then we have the lines of code in this case now guys it is very important to note that if you are just having one line of code over here within the arrow function then this particular return statement is not required so first of all we will check it with the return statement and then we will test it without the return statement as well so let me just save this file now let me just change these numbers to 5 and seven in this case so basically 5 * 7 it is equal to 35 should be returned and printed over here on the console so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see the multiplication result is 35 so in this way we can use the arrow functions which you are going to use a lot of times when you are going to work with the complex projects as well as when you are going to use the other JavaScript libraries including react and react native so guys over here since we have only one statement to be executed that is a multiplied by B the return statement is not required so simply what we will do is I'll get this particular statement on one line over here so as you can see this is the shorter format of this particular function that is the arrow function over here and simply we can remove the return statement as well so since we are only having a multili by B to be returned so when you're using Arrow function with a single statement the return statement is not required so let us verify that as well simply I'm going to change the numbers now to 12 and let's say three in this case so 12 * 3 must be 36 over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see the multiplication result is undefined so we are not getting any results maybe it is because we are using the open and close CL curly braces over here so simply I can remove these curly braces as well let us see whether now we get any results on the console code once again over here as you can see the multiplication result is 36 this time so guys basically this is more shorter format of the regular function that we had seen previously which was taking around three to four lines of code over here but simply we have reduced it to just one line of code without any return statement and without any curly braces as well so in this way the arrow function helps us in order to write the shorter format of any of the functions that we want to write so to summarize we have the let keyword followed by the name of the function that we can use based on our project requirements followed by the equal to operator and then we have the open and close parenthesis over here these parameters are optional if you're not using any of the parameters over here then either you have to return certain string or use the fixed values if you want to use any of the values in this case but if you're using the parameter over here those parameters can be used after this particular combination of the special characters that is equal to and the greater than symbol and then you can return certain statement over here it is important to note that if you are just having one statement in this case simply you can write that statement in this way without any return function but you can also have statements inside the body of the arrow function over here in which case you have to use the open and close curly braces in this case so basically we can also so do it in this way we provide a MTI B over here and then simply we provide another variable name so let's say we provide the variable name as a result in this case remember that this particular variable name that is a result it is having the local scope and it is within the function that is multiply over here it will not conflict with the result that we are using outside of this particular function and then guys what we will do is after storing the result in this result variable we can simply have the return statement and then we can say the result variable that is getting returned which will be printed over here let me just change these numbers to 12 and 5 and let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see the multiplication result is 60 so in case if you are having multiple lines of code then you must Define it within the open and close curly braces and if you are having just single line of code to be executed within the arrow function then simply you can provide that particular expression without the return statement so guys what will be the output when we provide the numbers that is four and five comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this
