so now we are going to complete this exercise in JavaScript in order to find the sum of numbers that is entered by the user so guys you need to follow these below steps to complete this particular exercise so first of all we will ask the user to enter two numbers using the input fields in HTML so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply we are going to remove the previous lines of code inside the HTML and the JavaScript files over here that we had written now guys inside the HTML file under the body tag we are going to have two input fields in this case so first of all we will say input followed by colon and this time we are going to have the type attribute as number over here and simply we will provide the value as first number for the name attribute and also we will provide the IDS first number over here apart from this we will provide the line break after the first input and similarly we will have the second input as well this time we will say second number as the name so guys over here we have the value as the second number for the name attribute and for the ID attribute as well we will have the value as second number over here and then guys apart from this we are going to have the button tag in this case so simply we are going to say add as the text of this button and we are also going to have the ID so simply we will say BTN followed by add over here so this button is responsible in order to add the two numbers that will be provided by the user inside these two input fields and then guys apart from this we are going to have the paragraph tag with the ID result over here so that the result of the addition of these two numbers will appear so guys we will simply say sum will appear here so as you can see this is a statement that we have provided inside the paragraph tag let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have these two input Fields followed by the add button and then we have some will appear here now guys what we can do is simply we can provide another line break so that there is certain spacing in between the input fields and the button in this case when we reload this page as you can see we have more spacing in between the HTML elements apart from this we can also provide the placeholder over here so simply we will say first number in this case and we will instruct the user to enter first number as a part of placeholder and again for the second input tag we will have the enter second number as the value for the placeholder let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have the placeholders over here so when we click on this particular add button both the numbers that are provided by the user should be added and the result should be displayed over here inside the paragraph tag so guys currently we have not added any JavaScript code so that is the reason why when we click on this particular button nothing is happening over here what we can do is let us provide a certain JavaScript code over here before which we are going going to link the JavaScript file with the help of the script tag in this case so we have the SRC attribute as test.js over here now guys what we have to do is inside the Javascript file we need to extract the values of these two input Fields so the first field is having the ID that is first number over here let me just use that ID inside the document followed by Dot and then we will use the query selector in order to find that HTML element so we have the hash character followed by the ID that is first number over here let us verify whether we have got the correct input field so simply we are going to print this input field on the console so we have provided the console. log statement and enclosed this query selector inside the log statement over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we are getting input type number and the name is first number which means we are able to identify the first input field over here similarly we are going to identify the second input field as well now guys it is very important to note that when we are using this particular query selector we can assign it to a particular variable so simply we make use of the const keyword over here and let's say we provide the variable name as X in this case so guys basically what we are trying to do is we are storing this particular HTML element inside the variable X and in future we can make use of this x variable over here so let's say we want to print this particular HTML element that is X so simply we can make use of the console. log statement and then we can say X in this case when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser you can notice that now we are able to print the HTML element that is stored inside this particular variable that is x in this case so guys we are going to learn more about variables in the upcoming videos as well so we can make use of the war keyword or let keyword or the const keyword over here when we use the const keyword basically whatever value is assigned to this particular variable will not be updated in the upcoming line of code that we are going to write so guys for now you only have to understand that when we are writing this particular statement the return value is getting assigned to this particular variable which we can use in future now guys this particular X variable is currently having the entire HTML element over here but we only want the number that will be provided by the user inside the input field so what we can do is simply we can provide X followed by Dot and then we will provide value property in order to get the value inside this particular input field so guys we will check that as well how we can use it so before that we are also going to identify the second number as well so over here we have the second statement and this time we will make use of the ID that is second number over here and we will store this particular HTML element inside another variable that is y so guys basically we have X and Y values that are representing these two input fields that is the first number and the second number this time now guys what we have to do is since we are having the button over here we also have to identify the button in this case so again we are going to make use of this ID attribute of this button tag and then again we will use the query selector over here this time we will make use of the button add as the ID of the button and then simply we are going to store it inside the button VAR able so guys basically we have identified all the required HTML elements that are present on the web page over here except the final one which is result in this case so let us provide another statement in order to identify this particular result ID as well so over here we have provided the result ID and also we will provide the variable name that is result in this case now guys very important thing when the user clicks on this particular add button the numbers from both these HTML elements that is X and Y Must Be read by this JavaScript code and both the numbers must be added and it must be displayed inside this particular result HTML element now guys how do we add both these numbers in this case so simply we are going to create a function that will help us in order to add these two numbers so over here let us provide the function and then let us give the function name as add in this case guys don't worry about the snx of this particular function since we are going to cover it with the help of the examples in the upcoming videos as well so for now you only need to understand that this particular function is nothing but a section inside the JavaScript code which we can call single or multiple number of times so guys over here what this add function will do is simply it will extract the value of numbers from X and Y and add those two numbers so let's say we have the element that is X over here followed by Dot and then we have to make use of the property that is value in order to get the value of the first number similarly we will will get the value of the second number as well so in this case we will provide plus operator followed by Y which is the second element in this case and Then followed by Dot and then we have the value attribute so guys over here we have the first number and we also have the second number in this case so guys what we will do is we will assign it to another variable over here so we will say const in this case and then we will provide the variable name as sum and then we will assign it using the equal to operator so basically this is a simple mathematics we are getting the value of x and also we are getting the value of y from these two input Fields over here inside the HTML and adding both the values and providing the value inside another variable that is sum in this case and then guys what we have to do simply we have to call the inner HTML property that we have seen previously so that we can print the sum inside the result variable over here so result variable is currently having the parag graph tag this time which is having this particular statement that is sum will appear here so we will have result followed by Dot and this time we will say inner HTML it is equal to and simply we will say the sum of numbers is followed by colon and then we need to provide the sum variable so how do we do that simply we can make use of the string concatenation over here so we provide the plus operator and then the name of the variable that is sum in this case so guys in this way we can provide the inner HTML attribute we have provided the statement that is the sum of numbers is followed by colon and then the sum that is the number after the addition of both these numbers will be printed inside this result HTML element so let me just save this file now the only thing that is remaining is we need to call this function that is ADD over here when we click on this particular button so guys what we will do is inside the HTML web page over here simply for the button tag we are going to have the onclick attribute and for this attribute we can provide the name of the function that is ADD over here and then followed by the open and close parenthesis so guys basically this is the way we call the function inside the JavaScript that is going to execute certain lines of code that we have written inside this particular function so guys let me save both these files now and when we reload this page once again over here so now when we provide the first number so let's say we provide the number as 10 and the second number as 20 and when we click on this particular add button over here you will be able to see the sum of both these numbers that will replace this particular statement so let me just click on this add button over here as you can see the sum of numbers is one20 so guys over here there's a mistake that we have done so guys this particular result is unexpected and why it has occurred that's because by default the input field take the values as string over here so basically it has taken the string as 10 and another string as 20 and simply it has concatenated both the strings in this case so what we have to do is simply we need to convert both these strings into integers over here so we have something called as pars int function that will help us in order to convert the string to the integer so simply we make use of the parcent function and then enclose the string value inside the parenthesis so we have converted the x value to integer over here and similarly we will convert the string that is represented by the Y value over here to integer in this case so guys basically we have converted X and Y to the integers over here so now both these numbers will be added with the help of this plus operator it is important to note over here that this plus operator can be used in order to add the two numbers or it can also be used in order to concatenate that is join two strings over here that we have just seen so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now we will provide the same numbers that is 10 and 20 and instead of having 1,20 over here we should have the result 1 in this case which is the sum of these two numbers so when we click on this add button over here as you can see the sum of numbers is 30 this time so guys in this way it is very important to note that whenever you are retriving the values of these input Fields you need to convert it into integers or the float numbers as well if you want to add those numbers so guys this is a very simple code in order to take two numbers as the input from the user and add them to find the sum of these two numbers and display them on the web page over here so guys
