hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to find square root of a number so guys we find the square root using the exponent operator so as you can see this two times multiplication symbol means exponent operator in Python Programming so over here for example let's say the number that you enter is 8 so we have to find the square root by using this exponent symbol over here so we have on left hand side the number that is entered by the user or the variable to which the value is assigned and then on the right hand side we have 0.5 so guys this expression is going to help us in order to find the square root of a number in Python program so guys let us check this with the help of example over here so in the vs code what we are going to do is we are going to ask the user in order to enter the number so let's say we provide the number variable it is equal to we are going to convert that number to the integer since the input that will be provided by the user will be the string data type so over here we provide the input function and then what we can do is we can provide the label that is enter number to find square root so we say square root over here so guys basically the number that will be entered by the user in this case it will be of the data type string and we are going to convert it by using this int function over here now we are going to have a value inside the number and simply we can provide the square root by having the exponent symbol so over here we will provide number followed by the exponent symbol and Then followed by 0.5 on the left hand side now guys we can simply store the result here so we can say square root as the variable name in order to make it more clear that we have square root of this number inside the square root variable now guys we can simply print the square root variable so we can say friend and then followed by square root of this number so over here we have open and close curly braces because we are going to use the dot format function after the string so square root of this number yes and then again we have open and close parenthesis so guys over here we have to provide two parameters the first one will be the number and then the second one will be the square root so over here we provide dot format followed by the parameters which will be number over here followed by comma and then square root so guys in this way we can find the square root of the number by using the exponent symbol so let me just save this file now and try running this code so guys the program is asking us enter the number to find square root so we know that the square root of the number 4 is 2 so let me provide 4 over here so when we provide 4 we press enter as you can see square root of 4 is 2 in this case since the square of this number that is 2 it is equal to 4 so basically the square root of this number that is 4 it will be 2 in this case now guys let me run this code once again and let me put another number so let's say when we provide 8 as the number and when we press enter as you can see this is the number that is a square root of 8 so basically it is the floating number that we are getting the result as when we provide the number as 8 and when we find the square root of 8 over here so guys when we provide the number 16 what will be the output so over here when we provide the number 16 you can check what will be the square root of 16 and you can comment the answer in the comment section below so guys this is the easy way in order to find the square root of the number using the Python program please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to swap to variables so stay tuned
