so now we will see responsive web design in HTML so guys basically responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices so whether you view the web pages on the computer or desktop or your laptop or tablets or even your mobile phones so basically whatever web pages that we design using the HTML code it should be looking good on all the devices irrespective from where the viewer is viewing your web page now guys this design is called the responsive web design that means the HTML web page will adapt itself in order to look good on all the devices now a responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and the view ports responsive web design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize hide shrink or enlarge a website to make it look good on all the devices such as desktops tablets and phones so guys as I've told you responsive web design is nothing but it is the attempt in order to make the HTML and CSS in such a way that it should resize hide and Shrink or enlarge the existing HTML elements to different devices such as desktops tablets and mobile phones as well now in order to create the responsive website we add the meta tag over here so as you can see this is the meta tag with the name that is viewport and the content as the width is equal to device width and the initial scale is is equal to 1 so guys this we are going to check with the help of example as well we need to mention this meta tag inside the head tag of the HTML document so guys let us move to the vs code over here I'll clear all the lines of code for now so basically whenever we are going to create the new HTML code what we do is we first type HTML and as you can see HTML colon file this is the option that we will select so that we get the boiler plate code in the VSS code so guys this is one of the important feature features of the vs code it helps us in order to create the boiler plate code that is ready for use so that we can focus on our functionality of the web page now guys over here by default as you can see this is the meta tag over here with the name that is viewport which is responsible in order to create this web page as a responsive web page so what we will do is first of all we will comment out this line over here so that we don't see a responsive web page that we are going to Define and then guys the title of the this document we are going to Define it as responsive web page over here and now guys what we will be doing is first of all we will have the image so I'm going to define the image over here in which case we are going to display this image which is the thumbnail of one of the videos that we have already created so guys the directory path we are going to provide in the base tag over here so that we can refer to that particular path as the parent path so over here we provide the base tag and to the hrf we Prov provide this directory path over here followed by the back slash in this case now guys since we have to use the horizontal scroll bar over here what we can do is we can use the word rap functionality of vs code so we have to come to this view menu over here and then you can see word rrap in this case so basically we are using the word r so that we can see the entire content on one screen without using the horizontal scroll bar over here guys this becomes important when we are having the text that is long enough that goes out side the screen width on this vs code now guys what we have to do is we need to provide the source of this image and then this is nothing but it is going to be the name of the file so let's say we want to provide this file that is the image to be displayed on the web page so we provide the name of this file and the prefix that is the entire directory path is being provided in the base tag over here so we just have to provide the name of the file followed by PNG that is the extension in this case and then let's say we provide the alt attribute as test image over here which is the value so in case the image is not found over here then this test image will be displayed so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see the image is being displayed over here but guys the image is right now enlarged in this case so what we can do is let's say we only want to display the 50% of the image as the width so we provide the width as the 50% so so guys this will be the 50% of the screen that will be occupied by the image over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see only 50% of the width is being taken by the image right now over here guys what if we don't provide the extension so when we don't provide the extension so basically whatever text is being provided inside the alt attribute that text will be displayed that's because the HTML code will not be able to find this particular file because we have not provided the extension let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see test image that is the text inside the alt attribute is being displayed right now guys that is why it becomes very important that we provide the alt attribute over here so in case there are certain issues in order to find the files on the server then we can at least have the text being displayed to the user now guys what we are going to do is after this we are going to have the heading that is H1 over here and then we will say this is heading one in this case and then guys again we are going to have the paragraph and we will be having a long paragraph over here so guys for test content we are going to provide the lauram Epsom text so guys this is a long text and this is what we are going to select on the vs code so guys this is another important functionality of vs code it provides a certain test data as well in order to test our web pages now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you you can see we are having the 50% width of the image that is being displayed and then we are having this is heading one that is being displayed using the hed1 tag and then we also have the P tag which is having certain content over here now guys how do we know whether this page is responsive or not so what we can do is we can press the F12 button on the keyboard so as you can see this is the Dave tools that is being opened right now over here and then on the left the second icon you can see toggle device toolbar so guys basically we are going to select this option so that we can see how this web page looks on different devices with different screen sizes so guys we just need to click over here on this particular icon so as you can see we have selected the responsive option over here we can select a different options that is iPhone SE and then there are different options for the mobile phones and the tablets as well but currently we are going to see the responsive option and this is how it is being displayed right now I'll just decrease the size of this Dave console and then when we increase the size you can see that this is the perfect web page that is being displayed that is 50% of the width is being occupied by this image and then we have the heading and then we have the paragraph as well now guys when we decrease the screen size as you can see the size of the image heading and paragraph is also decreasing up to this point and then guys what is happening is when we decrease the size more you can see that the paragraph is getting truncated now and then the heading is also getting truncated so guys this is the main issue when we are not making our web pages responsive over here when you decrease the width of the screen more as you can see now the image is getting truncated and not the entire image is being displayed right now so guys currently as you can see even the heading and the paragraph is not getting displayed properly right now not all the text is getting displayed currently so you can see this is the horizontal scroll bar that is present right now on this particular screen with very small width so guys what we can do is we can use the meta tag over here that we had just commented during the start of this video so we'll just remove the comment from here and then we are going to set the viewport property that is under the meta tag in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page with the same width of the responsive device over here so when we reload this page as you can see the image is now set to the 50% of this particular current withd right now and then the end entire heading is being displayed this is heading one and then this paragraph is also being displayed right now and there is no horizontal scroll bar right now that you can see and if I moving left and right it is not moving so guys basically this is a complete responsive page right now just by using this viewport we are making the web page responsive which will adapt itself based on the width of the screen so as you can see the image is being displayed completely even though it is very small but it is is not truncating the image or the text from the right hand side so guys in this way we can easily make our web pages responsive over here and test it by using the Dave tools under which we have the responsive option over here now guys we can make the width of the image as 100% as well so let me just do that quickly so when we do it 100% that is the width of the image let me just refresh this page once again so as you can see the entire width of the device is being taken by this particular image and when we decrease the width of this screen you can see that the image is even scaling down its width automatically so guys this is the main functionality of having the responsive page over here it automatically shrinks or enlarges the content that is present inside the web page which is responsive and then to disable this view we can again click on this particular icon over here so that it can be displayed on the normal web page so guys it becomes very important to include this particular line of code that is the meta teag along with the name attribute that is viewport and then this content attribute over here which gets automatically applied when you are writing the HTML code in the vs code so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and
