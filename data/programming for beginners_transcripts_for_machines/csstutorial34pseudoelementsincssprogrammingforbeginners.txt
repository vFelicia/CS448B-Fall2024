so now we will see pseudo elements in CSS so guys basically a CSS Pudo element is used to style specified parts of an element and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so for example the seudo elements can be used to style the first letter or the first line of an HTML element or also it can be used in order to insert the content before or after the content of an element so guys some of the example include we have something called as first line over here which is one of the pseudo elements now guys it is very important to note that whenever you are using the pseudo elements in the style. CSS file we need to have two times colon over here followed by the Pudo element that we are going to use so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys we are going to have a diff tag in this case so simply we are going to have the div tag and we are going to Define some random text over here so simply we are going to have the lurm M abbreviation over here that can help us in order to generate the random text in this case now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have certain random text that is getting generated on the web browser now guys let us say we want this particular first line of this diff tag to be colored as red color over here so how do we do that so basically we can simply use the sudo element that is the first line in this case inside the CSS file in order to have the text color as red so guys let us move to the CSS file over here and inside the CSS file simply we are going to define the div tag in this case and then as I have told you we have to use two times colon over here and then followed by the sudo element that is first line in this case so guys basically we are going to use the first line Pudo element and then we need to have the open and close curly braces inside which we are going to define the CSS properties so guys in this case simply we are going to use the color CSS property and simply we are going to set the text color as red color over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the first line of this particular diff tag which is having four lines over here is now having the text color as red color in this case guys we can have other CSS properties as well being defined over here so let's say we want the text size to be larger so in this case simply we are going to use the font size CSS property and simply we will say large value in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the font size is increased to some extent now let us use some other value that is larger in this case so that we can see the font size of the first line clearly larger compared to the other lines of this particular diff tag over here so guys let me just reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see the font size is larger now compared to the font size of the other lines of the same diff tag in this case now guys apart from this we can also use the first letter Udo element so let's say instead of having the red color for this first letter we want this first first letter to be displayed in some other color so guys what we can do is simply inside the style. CSS file over here again we are going to define the diff tag and then after this we are going to provide two times colon and then simply we can say first letter Pudo element so guys basically we use the first letter sudo element in order to define the CSS property for the first letter of this particular HTML element over here so guys inside this what we are going to do is let's say we want a different color so the color that we are going to use is blue in this case so guys we have set the color as blue and let's say we want the font size to be larger over here so simply we are going to define the font size as 32 pixels in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the color of the first letter of this particular diff tag has been updated to the blue color now and also the font size of this first letter is 32 pixel in this case just like how we have defined over here inside the style. CSS file so guys basically this first letters Udo element can help you in order to provide certain CSS properties to this particular first letter of this HTML element based on your project requirements now guys apart from this we also have something called as before pseudo element so guys let us check this as well so what we are going to do is before this diff tag we are going to have a heading over here which is going to be the H1 heading so we will say this is heading one in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the heading and it is having its default font size over here now guys let us say we want some icon to be displayed before this particular heading so what we can do is simply we can use the before sudo element in order to display a particular icon or Emoji before the HTML element so guys let us check that as well how it can be done so basically inside the style. CSS file over here simply we are going to define the H1 tag in this case and Then followed by two * colon and then we have something called as before so as you can see this is the sudo element that we will be using and then guys inside this what we can do is simply we are going to have the content CSS property and we are going to say URL and inside this URL we are going to provide the name of of the Emoji that we want to display before the heading so guys over here I have downloaded a smiley emoji over here so we are going to use the same smiley emoji in this case so basically we are going to provide the name of this PNG file that is smiley. PNG so guys since we are using the before pseudo element the smiley emoji will be displayed before the heading over here so guys let me just save this file now that is the style. CSS file and let me just reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the smiley emoji that is getting displayed just before the heading that we have defined over here now guys in order to display this Emoji after the heading over here that is this is heading one so what we can do is simply instead of using the before pseudo element we can use the after Pudo element so guys what we can do is simply inside the style. CSS file over here instead of having before we will have after in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the Emoji is getting displayed after the heading over here just by using the after Pudo element in this case so guys in this way we can use the different Pudo elements based on our requirements now guys apart from this we have something called as marker pseudo element as well which is used in order to define the CSS properties for the unordered list or the ordered list markers that are the number or the bullet points so guys this marker Pudo element I'll leave up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own as far as the list items are concerned so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is opacity or transparency in CSS so stay tuned
