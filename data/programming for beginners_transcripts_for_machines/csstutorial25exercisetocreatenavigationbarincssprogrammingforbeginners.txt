so now we will work on an exercise to create the navigation bar in CSS so basically we are going to follow the below steps in order to complete this practice exercise on creating the navigation bar in CSS so guys you can pause this video and practice on your own using the CSS properties that you have learned so far so first of all we are going to create the unordered list and have the four items as links that is home blog languages and contact so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written inside the body tag of the HTML file and also we will remove the content of the CSS file over here and then inside the HTML file we are going to have the unordered list with the list item so guys over here as a shortcut you can also use the unordered list that is the UL tag followed by the greater than symbol and Then followed by the lii tag over here guys as you can you can see this is the event abbreviation and when you press enter as you can see you have the starting and the ending unordered list that is the U tag and also the first list item over here with the help of the LI tag and inside this we can Define our list items as well but these list items are going to be links in this case so guys basically we are going to use the a tag over here and for the HF attribute we are going to provide the hash character and inside the aex it is going to be the home tag over here followed by blog languages and contact so guys let us Define that as well simply I'm going to paste this line of code and then over here we will say blog followed by languages and then in the end we we have the contact list item in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have all the list items in this case and since it is the unordered list we have the bullet over here now guys let us move to another task we need to remove the bullets and the underline from the unordered list item so what we can do is simply we have to provide the CSS properties inside the style. CSS so guys in order to remove the bullets from this unordered list over here you can see these bullets what we can do is we can use the list style type property for the unordered list tag so in this case we say the UL tag over here and simply we are going to provide the list type CSS property and we will say none in this case so guys in order to remove the bullets from the unordered list or the numbers from the ordered list we can Define the list style type equal to none so that there are no bullets or the numbers getting displayed for the list items let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there are no bullets right now that are getting displayed now guys what we can do is simply we can remove the underline from these links as well so we will move to style. CSS property and what we can do is we can use the UL tag as the parent tag followed by the space character and then we have the lii tag that is the anchor tag so guys simply we can also use the a tag over here but as your application grows into the complex application we need to be more specific as far as the CSS selectors are concerned so guys over here we are going to use the text decoration property in order to remove the underline from the anchor tags so in this case we are going to use the text decoration property and in this case we are going to use the value as none so guys basically by default we have the underlines for this anchor tag but we can use the text decoration property in order to remove the underline by using the none value for the CSS property so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there is no underline now and we are seeing the pure anchor tags over here without the underline and also it doesn't look like this is the list items inside the unordered list now guys we need to convert this list into the navigation bar over here which is going to have certain background color in this case so guys let us move to another task so as you can see make the items look in line with a black background color so guys what we can do is we need to make these list items look in line over here so simply we are going to inside the style. CSS file and for the list items we are going to have the display property as inline block so guys let us do that as well so inside the unordered list we are going to have the LI tag over here and for this particular CSS selector we are going to say display CSS property and simply we are going to use the inline CSS property so guys basically this is the property that we are going to use in order to make all these list items look in line so that they are displayed on the same line over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the list items are getting displayed on the same line now and guys we will also have the background color so for the UL that is the unordered list we are going to have the background color over here so guys for the unordered list that is the UL tag we will have the backer so let's say we have the background color and we Define the background color as black in this case and apart from this for the black background color we would want the text color of these links to be displayed as white color so for the a tag for which we have the text decoration as none we will simply say color and this text color we need to set it as white so that it looks more decent on the black color background so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the black background in this case and then we have the white text color as well now guys we can also have certain padding over here for all the links so that it becomes more readable and also it looks like it is a navigation bar so what we can do is again inside the a tag we are going to have the padding of five pixels so let's say we have the padding of 5 pixels in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the padding as well as 5 pixels in this case now guys apart from this you can see there is certain spacing on the left of the home over here and also above the navigation bar and to the left of the navigation bar so guys let us check the main reason behind this spacing and the margins so let us go to the inspect option over here after right clicking and let us check one at a time all the HTML elements so as you can see for the UL tag over here we are getting the margin so the orange color region over here above and below the black color background is displaying the margin of this UL tag so guys if you come over here you can see that we have the margins that are getting displayed by default for this Block Level element so what we can do is for the UL tag simply we are going to set the margin as 0 pixels so in this case we are going to say margin is equal to 0 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see there is no margin right now when we hover over this UL tag in this case but guys again we have certain marging over here for the body tag so as you can see on the body tag we are getting the orange color that is getting highlighted which is the margin by default for the body tag that is getting displayed over here you can see that it is the 8 pixels margin so let us remove that as well so before the UL tag it is one of the best practices that you provide the body tag and then you provide the values of margin as 0 pixels and padding as well as 0 pixels over here so guys this is done as one of the best practices in order to remove the default margin and paddings from the body tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see we don't have any spacing for the body tag over here as well now guys we can also increase the spacing for the list items over here as far as the top and the bottom spacing is concerned for all these list items so what we can do is inside the LI tag over here for which we have displayed as inline block we can provide the padding tag in this case and let's say we want five pixels of padding over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now as you can see we have the padding that is getting defined for these list items on the top and the bottom as well and guys apart from this let's say we want to come on these particular links that is the home and the blog link and we want certain background color so that the user gets the confirmation that yes this is the link that he or she wants to select so what we can do is specifically for this lii elements over here that is the list items we want to provide the background color but guys it should be on the hover state which means when we get the cursor on that particular list item then the background color should be updated so simply we are going to define the UL tag over here followed by the lii tag and this time we want to use the hover state so in this case we are going to use the colon followed by over state in this case so guys let me use this particular option guys for this state we are going to provide the background color CSS property so let us provide the CSS property and let's say we want the background color to be read when we get the mouse cursor on this particular list item inside the unordered list so guys let me just save this file num and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if you see when we get the cursor over here the items are getting displayed with the red color background and this is one of the good practices that you can follow based on your requirements whenever you are creating project so guys in this way out of a very simple unordered list that we have defined inside our HTML file we have converted it into one of the attractive navigation Bars by using the style. CSS properties over here for the unordered list and the list items and the anchor tags as well so guys this is is one of the ways that you can use in order to create your own navigation bars over here so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is position property in CSS so stay tuned
