welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about making text strikethrough in HTML using the strike tag so guys anything that appears within the strike tag as you can see we have the strike opening tag and the strike closing tag over here that content will be displayed with the strikethrough which is a thin line through the text so guys let us understand this with the help of example now in the vs code over here so guys previously we had seen how we can make the text as bold or strong or Italy sized and underlined now we can have another paragraph over here so we will have the P tag and inside the speed tag we will say this text is stripe in this paragraph So guys basically this is a very simple paragraph that we have written it has a single statement that this text is striked in this paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here you can see that this is a very simple paragraph over here without any formatting now what we we will do is we will make these three words at this text is Strike which will have a strike through so what we have to do is we just need to enclose these three words in between the strike tags so over here we are going to have the less than symbol and then we will type strike and then we will have the greater than symbol over here and what we have to do is this ending 10 we just need to cut it and paste it after the striped word over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see text is striped is being displayed in the form of a strikethrough over here you can have any single word or the multiple words display with the strikethrough based on your requirements now guys if you notice in this code this strike word is being colored with the red color so basically this means that this strike tag is being deprecated in the latest version of the HTML so in HTML5 you can simply use the S tag so instead of using the strike tag over here we can use S tag so as you can see the S Elementary represents contents that are no longer accurate or no longer relevant so this will have the same functionality similar to that of the strike tag so we will replace this ending tag as well with the S tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see we are getting the same output over here these three words are being striked through using the S tag so guys basically the strike tag is deprecated and we must use the S tag over here in the latest version of the HTML please comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is mono spaced font in HTML so stay tuned
