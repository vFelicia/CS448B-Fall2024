so now we will see customized tool tip text in CSS so guys basically a tool tip is often used to specify extra information about something when the user moves the mouse pointer over an HTML element so guys we are going to check with the help of examples what is the meaning of tool tip and how we can customize the tool tip text with the help of CSS properties now because first of all we will check the basic inbuilt tool tip that is provided by the HTML using the title attribute so let us move to the VSS code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code inside the HTML and the CSS files over here now simply we are going to have the paragraph tag that is the P tag in this case and we will say get your mouse cursor on below text so guys we have a very simple statement over here that is get your mouse cursor on below text in this case and simply we are going to have the diff tag with the class that is text in this case so guys inside this D tag we are going to have the hover me text over here so that the user can get the mouse cursor on this text and basically by default we want to show certain tool tip so we are going to use the title attribute over here that is provided by the HTML by default so guys in this case we are simply going to provide tool tip text over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have this paragraph that is get your mouse cursor on below text over here and then when we get the mouse cursor on the overover me text as you can see the tool tip text is getting displayed and we can provide any information inside this title attribute to be displayed when the user gets the mouse cursor on this over me text or any other text based on your requirement now guys this is the default Behavior as far as the displaying of the tool tip is concerned now how do we customize this tool tip so basically we can use certain CSS proper properties in order to customize this tool tip over here so what we will do is simply I'm going to remove this inbu tool tip in this case that is the title attribute and we are going to have the span tag over here with the class name that is tool tip so guys basically we are going to provide certain CSS properties for this span tag as well and simply we are going to say the text that is tool tip text over here that we had defined previously inside the title attribute as well now guys inside the style. CSS file what we are going to do is we will provide certain CSS properties for this class name that is corresponding to the span tag over here so simply we are going to provide dot character followed by the tool tip and let's say we provide the background color as the black color over here for the pan tag apart from this we want to have the color as white color and also we will have the padding of five pixels in this case so that the tool tip is displayed properly when we get the mouse cursor on the diff tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see this is the tool tip text that will be displayed with different CSS properties that we have applied so far we can also have the Border radius over here so simply we will have the Border radius of 5 pixels so that the corners are rounded for this particular tool tip text as you can see this is the way that we have the rounded Corners over here now guys the important thing in this case is when the user gets the mouse cursor on this text that is over me then only the tool tip text should be displayed so what we can do is simply we will provide the visibility equal to Hidden in this case so this is the CSS property that we are going to use with the value that is hidden so by default the span tag that is having the class name Tool tip will be hidden on the HTML page let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we don't have any span tag over here and when we get the mouse cursor on this over me text we are not not able to see the tool tip text so in order to display the tool tip over here we have to provide the hover sudo class in this case so the class name that we are going to use is text in this case which is corresponding to the diff tag which is having the text that is over me so guys let me just copy this class name and after the dot character we will paste this class name and then what we have to do is on Hover we need to display the span tag that is having the tool tip class over here so simply we will use the over Pudo class in this case and Then followed by the class name that is tool tape over here so guys basically when the user gets the mouse cursor on this diff tag which is having the text we need to provide certain CSS properties for the tool tip text and in this case we are going to use the visibility it is equal to visible over here so guys basically from visibility equal to Hidden we are going to visibility equal to visible when the user gets the mouse cursor on this class name that is text which is corresponding to the diff tag that is having the text that is over me let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and now when we get the mouse cursor on this over me text as you can see we are able to see the tool tip text over here so guys in this way we can have the customized tool tip text over here with the help of the CSS properties let us get all these text at the center of the screen now so simply we are going to provide the style for the body tag over here so we will say style and then simply we can say text the line it is equal to Center let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see when we get the mouse cursor on this hover me text the tool tip text is now getting displayed over here now guys currently the tool tip text is getting displayed at the right of the text we can also display this tool tip at the bottom of this hover me text over here so how we can do that so first of all we need to provide the position property for this class that is text over here which is corresponding to the diff tag so so guys over here we will say position it is equal to relative and then after this for this tool tip class we need to provide the position equal to Absolute over here so that we can provide the different CSS properties such as top left bottom and right so guys basically we will say absolute in this case and then after this we need to provide the left property as zero and then also the top property is 100% over here so guys basically what we are doing is currently the diff tag that that is having the class name text is having the position equal to relative and the tool tip text which is having the class tool tip will be having the position equal to Absolute and due to this we can use the left and top properties and other CSS properties as well as far as the positioning CSS properties are concerned so from left we are having the zero pixels and from Top it should be 100% so we are trying to get the tool tip text at the bottom of this text over here so let me just save this file now and try loading this page once again on the browser so now when we get the mouse cursor on this hover me as you can see the tool tip text is coming at the bottom of this hover me but at the extreme left right now so guys in order to correct this what we can do is simply we can use the display property and this time let's say we provide the display as in line over here let me just reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see the tool tip text is now coming at the bottom of this particular text let us also provide the width property to this tool tip text over here so simply we are going to provide the width as 130% so that the text can fit the box over here so let me just reload this page as you can see this is the tool tip text over here that can be displayed at the bottom of the hover me text in this case so guys in this way you can also provide the other positioning properties over here in order to get the tool tip text at the left or at the top of the overover me text over here now guys let us move to the default position that is at the right in this case so simply I'm going to remove these lines of code that is top and left over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so now we are able to see the tool tip text at the right of the overover me text over here now guys how do we create an arrow for this tool tip text so guys let us check that as well so we need to use the class name that is tool tip and this time we are going to use the codo element that is after so guys we need to use the colon two times over here and then we need to use the after after keyword and then guys simply we are going to use the content which is going to have a space character over here and also we need to define the position as relative so in this case we will say position is equal to relative and we need to provide the Border CSS properties over here so let's say we have the border with as five pixels in this case apart from this the Border style as solid in this case so over here we will have the solid value and then we also have the Border color over here here so guys simply we are going to define the Border color as yellow for now we will change it to black color as well after positioning the Border properly so that we can create a arrow for this tool tip text so guys what we are going to do is let's say by default we are going to remove this visibility equal to Hidden so that we can create the arrow for this tool tip text first of all so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have this border that is getting displayed over here right now now guys the border is taking the entire height of this particular tool tip text so we need to change the position value over here to Absolute instead of relative so let me just save this file now after providing the absolute value to the position and reload this page once again so as you can see this is a small square box that we have created now guys we need to get this border at the left of this tool tip text over here so what we can do is simply we will provide the left CSS property and we will say 0 pixels over here apart from this we have also provided the top CSS property as 50% so that from Top we have certain spacing over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the small square box has moved to the left right now and guys instead of having this yellow square box inside the tool tip text we want to have it outside of the tool tip text so simply we will change this left CSS property to right CSS property and over here we need to to provide the value as 100% which means from right it should be having the space of 100% that is the entire width of the tool tip text so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the small square box has come to the left of the tool tip text now guys let us also provide certain margin at the top so we need to have the margin top as a negative number so let's say we have 5 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so that horizontally it is aligning with this particular hover me text over here now guys apart from this let us also provide the margin left property to the tool tip in this case so simply we are going to say margin left it is equal to 5 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have moved the tool tip text slightly to the right now guys in order to have the arrow shape what we want to do is we need to have only one side of the Border have the color so let us change the Border color to black color right now so instead of yellow color we will be able to see the black color for the small square box and then we need to only have the right color as the black color so guys what we have to do is the top color should be transparent over here followed by the black color which is at the right side of the border and Then followed by the transparent that is at the bottom and then again the transparent that is at the left hand side so let me just save this file now this particular line of code will help us in order to provide the arrow to the tool tip text so let us check that as well when we reload this page as you can see there is a arrow that is getting displayed over here for this tool tip text right now and then apart from this we can simply provide the visibility equal to Hidden so that when the user gets the mouse cursor on the diff tag the visibility will be changed to visible over here let me just reload this page and when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see this this is the tool tip text that is getting displayed right now so guys this is a very simple way in order to customize the tool tip text apart from this you can also provide the fade in animation for the tool tip text so how we can do that simply we can use the transition CSS property so guys over here inside the tool tip class name we are going to use the transition and let us see whether we will be able to use it for the visibility CSS property or not we will provide the duration as 1 second over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so when we get the mouse cursor over here there is no fade in animation right now but guys when we get the mouse cursor out there is a 1 second delay right now so guys with visibility equal to Hidden and visibility equal to visible the transition will not work since the transition CSS property is expecting certain values that is 0o and one and the values in between as well so instead of having visibility we can use the opacity so first of all we will provide the opacity equal to Zer which will be same as visibility equal to Hidden which means the element will not be displayed on the HTML page when the opacity is set to zero over here and instead of having visibility equal to visible we will have the opacity equal to 1 this time so guys by using the opacity CSS property we will provide the transition CSS property have some values in between 0 and 1 such as 0.5 or 0.7 when there is a transition within the time span of 1 second over here so guys simply we are going to change the visibility keyword to opacity right now let me just save this file now and let us see how the fade in animation will be displayed for the tool tip text when we reload this page now when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see there is a fade in animation and the Fade Out animation as well within the time span of 1 second over here so guys in this way you can provide the fade in animation as well for the tool tip text and apart from this you can also draw the arrow with the help of the border that we have just seen using different CSS properties so guys comment in the
