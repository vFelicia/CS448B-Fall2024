so now we will see pagination in CSS so guys basically pagination helps to display The Limited results on the web page across the various pages in the same view and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well we will see how we can create the pagination section so that the user can navigate through the different pages on the same view on the web page so guys first of all let us see how we can create the simple page Nation so let us move to the vs code over here and simply we are going to to create a div tag with the class pagination in this case so guys we have the diff tag with the class page Nation over here and let us add certain links in this case so that the user can click on that link in order to navigate through the different pages so guys over here we have the a tag with the HF attribute we can provide the hash character over here and simply we are going to number the pages so guys this is the first page and so on we are going to create more pages over here so as you can see we have created the page Nation tag over here and it is having seven links in this case now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser and let us see how it looks like so as you can see these are the links that the user can navigate to now guys we can also add the previous and the next arrows over here so simply I'm going to copy this line of code in this case and then what we will do is we will use the special character in this case so guys we have the special character that is less than symbol which will be displayed twice and then at the end as well we are going to to create another special character over here so guys this special character will be the greater than symbol which will be displayed twice so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see these are the arrows over here that is the less than symbol and the greater than symbol which will represent the previous and the next pages that the user want to navigate to now guys apart from this let us get this pagination at the center of the page so what we will do is we will have another diff tag over here and then we will have the class as Center in this case and then we will end this diff tag after the pagination tag over here so guys simply we are enclosing this pagination tag inside another diff tag and then in this case we will align the text at the center so guys let us move to the style. CSS file over here and simply we are going to have the class name that is Center in this case and then we are going to say text align it is equal to Center let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see these are the pages inside the page Nation diff tag now guys we can ALS Al remove this text decoration which is coming by default over here so simply we are going to move to the style. CSS file in this case and then inside the pagination we need to go to the a tag over here so simply we will say pagination class in this case and then inside this we have the a tag and then what we will do is we will have the text decoration as none also we will provide certain padding over here so let's say we have a padding of five pixels so that there is enough space in between the page numbers so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the pagination is looking more decent over here apart from that we can also have the color for all these text so let's say we have the black color inside of the default blue color for the link so as you can see we have provided the black color text for all the pages inside this pagination now guys apart from this we can also have the hoverable pagination in which case when the user hovers over one of the pages over here the background color can be updated so that the user gets the feedback that that is the page number that he or she wants to click so guys what we have to do is simply inside the page Nation we need to have the Pudo element that is hover so guys inside the page Nation class we have the AAG and for this we are going to create the hover sudo class over here so guys what we want to do is we need to change the background color so let's say we want to change the background color to Aqua over here so basically when the user gets the mouse cursor on this a tag so the hover sudo class will help us in order to update the background color to equa let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and when the user gets the mouse cursor on these Pages as you can see we are getting the background color updated to equa over here so guys this is the hoverable pagination that we can create based on our project requirement and then when the user clicks on any of the specific links simply you can provide the required hrf attribute over here the URL that that you want to call based on the page number that the user has clicked on so guys this is the way that the page ination will work apart from this we can also have the active page color over here so let's say the second page is active right now so what we can do is simply we will have the class over here and we will say active as the value for this class and simply when the user clicks on any of the pages you can set the class for that particular page as active and remove the class from this particular active page over here so guys what we have to do is inside the style. CSS file simply we need to update the background color for this specific page that is second which is having the class equal to active so guys what we are going to do is simply I'm going to copy these lines of code over here and then inside the pagination we will have a a tag which is going to have the active class over here so I'm going to remove this hover Pudo element and simply we will say a do active in this case so guys basically whatever CSS properties that we provide inside this particular select it will be only applied to the a tag that is having the class active so guys what we want to do is let's say we want to update the background color as green yellow over here for the page that is active So currently we have made the second page as active over here so let us see how it looks like let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the active page right now and when the user goes to the other pages over here on over the background color is getting updated in this case so guys in this way you can also have the active page color apart from this you can also have the hoverable transition effect so guys in this case on over there is no transition currently but we can provide the transition so that there is certain kind of Animation that the user experiences so guys over here we can use the transition CSS property and then simply we can use the background color because that is the CSS property that we are changing on Hover event and then we need to provide the timing so let's say we provide 0.5 seconds in this case so guys basically what will happen is there is no background color by default for the a tag but we are changing the background color on over event so that background color will be updated to the aqua color within the time span of 0.5 second instead of 0 seconds which was present by default so guys let me just save this file now you will experience that the background color of the a tag will be updated to Aqua with some transition so let us reload this page once again on the browser and when we get the mouse cursor over here as you can see there is certain transition that is fade in and Fade Out of the background color for all these a tags over here which is nothing but it is representing the pages inside this pagination so guys you can have the transition effect over here and then apart from this you can also have the bordered pagination in this case so guys basically we have not provided any borders to all these pages so what we will do is simply inside the a we can have the Border CSS property as well so when we provide border of let's say one pixel of the type solid we can provide the color as gray color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see all the pages are now getting the borders over here but guys there is a space in between all the borders for all these pages so what we can do is simply we can use the float property in this case and the value should be left over here let me just save this file now so this is used in order to remove the Border spacing in between the two borders of these pages and when we reload this page so as you can see there is no more spacing between the borders of all these pages over here so guys in this way you can apply the borders as well and this type of pagination is looking more decent over here along with the borders and the hoverable effect in this case now guys apart from this you can also apply multiple other CSS properties to all the pages inside your pagination diff tag you can have the rounded pagination as well in which case you will be using the Border radius and you can also provide the space in between the link by using the margin property so guys I'll leave this up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own and based on your project requirements you can apply any of the CSS properties for all the pages inside your pagein nation so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is multiple columns in CSS so stay tuned
