hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about arithmetic operators in Python Programming so guys arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition subtraction multiplication and many other operations which can be done using the integers or the numbers in Python so guys for example let's say we provide the print function over here and inside this function we provide 5 plus 6 as the parameter so what will happen is the plus operator is being used over here in order to add these two numbers that is 5 and 6 and the result that is 11 will be printed so let us quickly check this with the help of example over here so what we will do is we will use the print function and inside this parenthesis we will simply provide 5 plus 6 over here and when we just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 11 is getting printed so guys what we have done over here is we have simply used the plus operator in order to add two numbers we can also do this by using the very variables as well so let's say we provide num1 it is equal to 10 and let's say we provide a num2 it is equal to 20 and then let's say I provide sum it is equal to num 1 plus num 2 over here so guys basically once again we have used this plus operator in order to add two numbers that is num1 and num2 for which the values are 10 and 20 respectively and the result will be stored in this sum and when we provide this sum inside the print statement we will get that result so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 30 is getting printed that is the sum of 10 plus 20 over here so guys this is one of the arithmetic operator that is plus is being used in order to add the two numbers apart from this addition we have other operators as well as you can see subtraction we have in which the two numbers can be subtracted so over here 4 minus 2 it is equal to 2 so over here minus operator is being used we have multiplication as well in which multiply operator is used in order to multiply two numbers we have division as well in order to divide the two numbers so as you can see 4 divided by 2 it is equal to 2 so we are getting the quotient over here and we have the modulo operator as well which can be used by using this percent operator so guys what happens is five percent to what this will do is it will divide the number on the left hand side that is 5 by the number on right hand side that is 2 so 5 divided by 2 it will give us the quotient as 2 but the remainder will be 1 and we will be getting the remainder of this operation that is 1 over here and similarly we have power operator as well so as we can see 4 and then 2 times multiplication symbol over here which is the power symbol and then 2 which means 4 multiplied by 4 will be done which is equal to 16. so basically this is nothing but the square of the number in this case it is the square of this number that is four so guys let us take all these operators with the help of examples over here so what we will do is first of all we will print and add two numbers so let's say we provide 10 as first number and 20 as the second number so this is the addition of two numbers let's say we want to subtract two numbers over here and the two numbers are let's say 20 and then minus what we do is we will minus 15 over here let's say the third expression is multiplication so I will simply provide 5 as the number multiplied by 7 is another number the next operator is the Divide operator so let's say I provide the print statement over here and we provide 50 as one number divided by 10 as another number and then we have another print statement let's say we want to find the remainder after dividing two numbers so let's say 40 is one number and then we provide percentage sign and then we provide 15 as the second number and then the last operator that is the power operator I simply provide 5 as the number and then two times multiplication over here which means power and then I provide 2 is the second number so guys let me just save this file enter running this code we will check the results of all these operations over here so as you can see the first print statement that is 10 plus 20 it is providing us 30 as the result and this is the correct result over here 20 minus 15 should be 5 and that is what we are getting over here as 5 and then 5 multiplied by 7 it is equal to 35 and we are getting 35 over here then 50 divided by 10 should give us the quotient that is 5 and we are getting 5.0 over here and then 40 percent 15 which means 40 is divided by 15 and then what is the remainder is getting returned to this print function and 10 is getting returned why 40 divided by 15 the quotient will be 2 that is 15 multiplied by 2 is 30 but the remaining number will be 10 which will be the remainder and that is what we are getting over here is the 10 as the remainder and then 5 power 2 which means 5 multiplied by 5 is done over here and 5 multiplied by 5 is 25 and that is what we are getting over here so Guys these are certain arithmetic operators that you can use which include addition subtraction multiplication division and then finding the remainder of the two numbers by dividing them and then we can also find the power of the number so guys you can use them based on your requirements so guys
