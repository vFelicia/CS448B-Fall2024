so now we will see input attribute value in the input field so guys basically the input value attribute specifies an initial value for an input field which will be the default value when the user clicks on submit button without providing any value to this input field so basically it means the value attribute will help us to provide the default value inside the input field let us check this with the help of examples and vs code over here so I'll remove the previous lines of code in this case and we will only keep the form tag over here and then guys inside this form tag what we will do is we will have a P tag that is the paragraph tag in this case and then we will say below content is in HTML form so basically we have a very simple statement that is below content is in HTML form and simply we will ask the user to provide the first name and the last name over here so simply we will have the input with the type text in this case so we have the input tag along with the type text and then let's say the name attribute is f name and the same value we provided inside the ID as well and before that we will have the label and for the for attribute we will say F name over here so that this particular label is linked to the input field in this case and then we will say first name over here as the label followed by colon now guys this is a very simple text field in this case and we will not have any value in inside this input field so let us have a submit button in this case so we provide input followed by colon and then we have the type submit over here and the value will be submit in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have two times below content is in HTML form so previously we had provided another paragraph before that form as well so I'll just remove one paragraph in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the first first name over here followed by colon and then simply we have the input field in this case guys we want the submit button to be on the next line so simply we will provide a couple of line braks over here using the BR tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have a simple text field that is first name in which we can provide the first name over here now guys let's say we want certain default value to be provided inside the first name so what we can do is we can have the value attribute for this input tag so after this ID we will provide the value attribute and let's say the first name with the value John will be the default value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see when the user loads this particular page the default value that is drawn will be displayed to that user inside the first name input field in this case and then user can provide his or her own name over here or simply click click on submit button so that the value that is drawn will be passed to the server so when we click on the submit button over here as you can see inside the URL we have the F name parameter followed by equal to and the value is drawn in this case that's because the default value that we have provided in the first name input field is drawn over here similarly we can have another input field as well so let's say we simply copy these lines of code and paste it after the first name over here and we provide L name in this case that is last name as the name and ID and for the for attribute as well we provide the L name as the value and instead of first name we will say last name as the label and for the value part we will say do in this case so guys basically the first name is John last name is do so we have John do as the full name of the user as the default value for both these input Fields so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the first name that is having the value default value of John and the last name is having the default value as do and when we click on submit button simply without providing any data over here so these two names that is John and do will be passed to the server as the URL with the F name and the L name as the parameters we can also modify the first name and last name over here so simply we can say programming and then for the last name we can say beginners over here so let me just click on submit button now so basically the first name and last name has been updated that is programming and then beginners as the last name in this case which is being passed to the server so in this way we can have the default values for the required input Fields based on your project requirements by using the value attribute over here inside the input tag so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video
