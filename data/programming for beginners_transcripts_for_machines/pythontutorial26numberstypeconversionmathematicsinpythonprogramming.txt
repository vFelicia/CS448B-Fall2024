hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about numbers type conversion and Mathematics in Python Programming so guys in Python the number data types are used to store the numeric values so python supports integers floating Point numbers and complex numbers which we are going to see with the help of examples as well so they are defined as end float and complex classes in Python so as you can see this end is a data type which holds the signed integers of nonlimited length and then we have float as well which holds the floating decimal points and its accurate up to 15 decimal places so in case you want the 15 decimal places for a number you can use the float class in the Python Programming and also we have the complex data type which holds the complex numbers so guys let us check this with the help of examples now over here so let's say I want to print the simple integer so over here I will simply say num1 it is equal to 10 and then inside the print function we can simply provide num1 so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 10 is getting displayed similarly we can have the float and complex data type as well so I'll just copy paste these lines of code over here I'll put num2 it is equal to 5.76 and then over here we will print num2 as the variable name and then let's say we have num3 in which case let's say we have the complex number that is 3 plus 2 J so this is the format in which we provide the complex number in Python and then we provide the num3 as the variable name over here so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting the integer over here then we have 5.76 and then we have 3 plus 2 J all these numbers are getting printed now in order to see what is the data type of each and every number variable that we have provided we can simply provide the type function over here and enclose the variable name so as you can see this type function will help us in order to find the data type of the variable so num1 is the variable and we have enclosed it within the type function and then similarly we will say pi and then num2 will be enclosed over here and then let's say we want to find the type of this that is num3 variable as well so we provide the type function so instead of printing the values we will be printing the data types of all these variables now so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see in the sequence we are getting all the data types the first number that is num1 it is of integer data type since we have stored the integer value then next we have the float that's because we have stored the float value and then we have the complex data type so in this way we can easily use the type function in order to find the data type of any variable in Python Programming now guys over here let us understand the number system so basically the numbers that we have seen so far are of the decimal that is base 10 number system but in computer programming we need to work with binary that is base 2 then we also have hexadecimal that is base 16 and octal that is base 8 number systems as well so how do we work with these number systems can we represent them in the Python Programming yes we can so as you can see the binary numbers can be represented by using the 0b prefix the b letter can be lower case or uppercase character similarly we have the octal that is the base 8 number so we can have the prefix that is 0 and O and Then followed by hexadecimal which is having the prefix that is 0x so guys let us check this with the help of examples now over here let's say we want to have a number which is of a binary data type so let's say we have num1 and then let's say we want to represent the number 8 with the help of its binary representation so we have 1000 which is the binary representation but this is a simple base 10 number that we have provided in order to make this as a binary number we have to provide the prefix that is 0b so as you can see 0 B is the prefix and then and next time when we print this number so over here we can simply put into this number so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting eight instead of one thousand so 1000 is the binary representation of the number eight and when we provide the zero B which means it tells the python interpreter to treat this as the binary representation and print this number that is num1 in the base 10 format over here similarly we can have the octal numbers and the hexadecimal numbers as well so let's say in the octal numbers what we do is instead of 0b we provide 0 o and then let's say we just provide 10 as the number over here let me just save this file and try running this code now so octal number that is 10 it is being represented as the number 8 in the decimal format and that is what we are getting over here what will be the octal number that is 15 in this case so let me save this file and try running this code now as you can see 13 we are getting which is of the decimal format similarly let's say we want to represent the hexa decimal number so let us say see what will be the base 10 number for this hexadecimal number that is 0x15 so let me just save this file and try running this code so as you can see 21 is the decimal number now let's say we want to print 15 as the decimal number but we want to represent it as the hexadecimal number so we have something called as F over here the numbers it is going from 0 to 9 and then a to F characters as far as hexadecimal representations are concerned so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 15 is getting printed over here so if you are familiar with the number systems then you must be knowing about what are the different values when we say hexadecimal octal and binary numbers over here and if you are not familiar then no need to worry about it it is just the formats in which the numbers are being stored and are being represented now very important topic the type conversion in Python so basically in Programming type conversion is the process of converting one type of number into another so in some cases we might want the float number to be converted to the integer number or the integer number to be converted to a complex number and so on based on the requirements so operations like addition subtraction convert integers to float implicitly so it is very important to note that whenever you are going from the integer to the float number it will be done automatically that's because float is taking extra memory compared to the integers so whenever you are going from a lower memory data type to the higher memory data type it will be done automatically but the same is not applicable when you go from a higher data type to the lower data type that's because there is some kind of a loss of data in that case so let us see how the integer gets automatically converted to the float value as you can see over here we have the print statement which is taking one operand that is the integer on the left hand side and a float number on the right hand side so let me just copy this line of code and we will print this over here so let me just save this file and try running this code so what exactly is happening over here is this is is a float number that is 2.0 and this is the integer number but an integer and a float number cannot be added so basically implicitly this integer is being converted to 1.0 behind the scenes and then that 1.0 is being added to 2.0 and after that we get the result as 3.0 similarly let's say if we have 2.45 over here so the result should be 3.45 in this case after this integer is being converted to the float number so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see 3.45 is getting displayed and this is how the implicit type conversion happens in Python Programming now what is the explicit type conversion so we can also use builtin functions like integer that is as you can see this is the end function name followed by the open and close parenthesis that will help us to convert any complex number or the float number to the integer it can also help us in order to convert the string to the integer as well we also also have the float and then we also have the complex function to convert between types explicitly so let's say we only want the integer format to be displayed over here that is the sum should be in the integer format so what we will do is for this 2.45 we have to explicitly convert this to the integer the left hand side is already integer we want to convert the right hand side to the integer so before this number we have to provide the int function name and then the number needs to be enclosed within the open and close parenthesis so this is the way that we can explicitly convert a data type to another data type so 2.45 that is the float number will get converted to the integer number over here so in this case there will be a loss of data the point 45 will be removed and only 2 will be considered over here so 2 plus 1 the 3 should be the sum of this addition operation so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 3 is getting displayed so since there is a loss of data over here since we are going from a higher memory data type to the lower memory data type that is why we are required to provide the explicit data conversion functions guys similarly you can convert the string data type as well so let's say we have a string it is equal to 12 and what we want to do is let's say I want to add 10 to this particular string so string is represented in this format that is it needs to be enclosed between the double quotes or the single quotes over here so what I want to do is let's say I want to add a 10 to this particular string so I just say 10 plus Str over here so what we are doing exactly is this is the integer and this is a string data type we are trying to add both these things over here so let me just save this file and try running this code so it says type error unsupported operand that is Type S for plus integer and string so we cannot add an integer with the string over here so we need to convert this string to the integer so similarly we can use the end function that we have seen just now and enclose this string variable inside the open and close parenthesis and that is how the string will get converted to the integer after which we can add it to other integers as well so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see 22 is the result 10 plus 12 which is 22 and that is what we are getting in the form of integer so in this way you can convert the data types to another data types as well by using such kind of functions now let us talk about python mathematics so python offers the math module to carry out different mathematics like trigonometry logarithms probability and statistics Etc so for example I have certain lines of code over here what I will do is I'll simply copy and paste these lines of code since I am little bit lazy in order to type the entire code so basically this is very important we use the import keyword which we have already seen previously in order to import a particular module in Python programming language and then math is the name of the module now by using this module that is a library we can use the various variables and the functions that are present inside this math module so we have Pi variables we have the COS that belongs to the trigonometry functions then we have exponent as well log tan syn Edge and we also have the factorial function for which we have already returned the code in the previous video so there is a builtin function in order to find the factorial of a number over here as well so let me just save this file and running this code now so as you can see we are getting all the results over here first of all we are getting the pi value which is 3.14 and then COS of math Pi it is giving us minus 1 and then 22 026 which is the exponent of 10 and then log 10 it is equal to 3.0 then we are getting sin h of 1 it is equal to 1.17 and factorial of 6 we are getting 720 can you guess what is the factorial of the number 4 so try to find out what is the factorial of 4 by using the Python programming language on your own as a homework for you and comment in the comment section below what will be the answer of the factorial 4. so Guys these are some of the things that you should know as far as numbers and Mathematics are concerned in the Python programming language please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is random module in Python Programming so stay tuned
