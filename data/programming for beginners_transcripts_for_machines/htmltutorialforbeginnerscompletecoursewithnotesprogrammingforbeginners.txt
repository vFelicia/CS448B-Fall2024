in this video we are going to cover the complete HTML tutorial as a part of web development so guys if you want to make a career in web development it is very important that you should know the basics of the HTML and we are going to cover the basic and the intermediate levels of the HTML tutorial with the help of several examples so guys while you're watching this video please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs and that is how you are going to learn a lot about HTML so let's get started now HTML stands for hyper text markup language so guys basically this is the full form of HTML that is hyper text markup language which is the most widely used language on web to develop web pages so any web pages if you see if I open the Google Chrome browser over here this is the default page of the Google and if you right click over here and then go to inspect as you can see inspect is the option under the elements stab you can see the entire HTML content over here so basically this is the HTML that was written behind the scenes in order to show you this particular page with an image of Google over here so basically it has various attributes as you can see these are nothing but these are the tags that we are going to see in this video series as well so guys you are going to learn a lot about the HTML in order to develop the web pages that you can see in today's world now HTML is a must for students and working professionals to become a great software engineer especially when they are working in web development domain now guys what are the advantages of learning HTML first of all you will be able to create a website which is very important as a software engineer you can also become a web designer over here and design the websites you will also be able to understand the web and how it works and apart from this you can learn the other languages as well for which HTML becomes very important and how you understand HTML will help you to learn the other languages as well so guys let us now see the example of a Hello World using HTML over here I will be using VSS code over here in this entire video series you can use your own text editor of your choice whichever you are comfortable with so over here I'm going to create a new file so as you can see we have a new text file over here and then we are going to click on this select a language and then basically I'm going to search for HTML since this is the format that we are going to write the HTML code over here so guys let me just save this file now I just save it in a particular folder in this case so basically I'm going to create a new HTML file in this directory so I'm going to copy this and paste this over here and then we are going to give the name that is test.html so guys always remember that whatever HTML code that you are going to write in the HTML file it must be having the extension of HTML over here or else HTM so that is the extension that is being used by the HTML files and then we click on save so guys basically this file has has been named as test.html now guys we are going to write a simple HTML code over here that is having hello world which is going to be displayed on the web page so guys the very first thing that you are supposed to do whenever you writing the code in the HTML file is have the dog type tag over here so basically you have to type the less than symbol over here and then as you can see vs code is suggesting us all the tags that you can use in the HTML code based on your requirements so guys basically the very first line is this exclamation And Then followed by dog type and then we have something called as HTML over here so guys this particular line tells the browser in order to interpret this file as the HTML and show it to the latest browser as the HTML 5 version and then guys after this we need to have the main HTML tag so over here again we need to press the less than sign and then we have something called as HTML and then we need to close it by using the greater than sign over here so as you can see the less than sign and greater than sign are being used and then within that we are using the keywords which are known as tags so guys basically these things are called as tags in HTML we have the opening tag as the HTML over here within the open and close angled brackets and then over here we have the closing tag which is starting with the forward slash over here as you can see so guys most of the tags have start tag and the end tag in this case we called this tag that is the starting tag as the start tag and the ending tag tag is the end tag over here and then inside that we will have our content so inside the HTML main tags we have the two main tags over here one is called head so this is another tag so which is having the start tag and the end tag in this case and then in order to define the body of the web page we have something called as body so as you can see we have the body tag as well if you notice all the Texs are starting with the less than sign over here which is the angled bracket and then getting ended with the greater than sign over here so this is important whenever you are writing the HTML code now guys what we are going to do is inside head you can Define the title of the web page so what is the meaning of title so over here as you can see we have the head tag over here of the Google page and then if you go down over here we have something called as title now this title as you can see the content is new tag which is being displayed over here on the new tab in this case so whatever content you put inside the title tags over here the same content will be displayed on the tab of the browser so guys let us put the title over here inside the ha Tex so basically this title must be inside the head tag and then it must start with the title tag over here and then it will end with the another title tag which is having the forward slash over here at the start and then guys what we will be having is we will simply say test title in this case so guys basically this content will be displayed instead of this new tab on the tab of the browser now guys what we we will be doing is inside this body we will say hello world so how do we display the hello world we will be using the header tag that we are going to check in the upcoming videos as well now how do we Define the header tag again we press the less than sign over here and then we have something called as H and Then followed by one number so basically these are the numbers of the header tags so H1 represents the highest heading with the biggest size so as you can see over here the H1 element represents a section heading and then if you go to H2 again it represents the section heading but the size of this H2 that is the header tag is less than the size of this H1 tag over here and then similarly as we go down to the number H6 the size of the headers will keep on decreasing so guys in this case we are going to use H1 over here and then followed by closing bracket in this case and then we will say hello world so over here we are saying hello world inside the header tag that is H1 so guys this is the basic structure of the HTML page this page looks very simple and it is very basic as we move forward to the upcoming videos we will move from the very basic code to the advanced level code so that you can learn a lot about the HTML now guys what we have to do is simply we will save this file now so we can go to this file and then we can select this save option you can also use the control as combination of the keys on your keyboard in order to save the file now guys after saving this file we we have to come to this Windows Explorer as you can see we have this test.html file being saved over here and then we should be able to open this using the Google Chrome so you just need to double click over here on this file so when we double click on this as you can see we are getting hello world in this case guys basically since we have provided this hello world content inside the header tag over here that is why we are getting this hello world as the heading of this page now guys if you just change the size of this H1 to H2 which means the size should decrease to some extent and when we just save this file now and come back again to this browser we just need to press this refresh button so that it takes the latest content from this test.html so I'm going to press this refresh button as you can see the size of this hello world has decreased to some extent since we have changed the tag from H1 to H2 so guys to summarize basically we are going to have the dock type HTML over here as the first tag and then we are going to have the main HTML tag inside this main HTML tag we are going to have two sections one is the head section which is having the title of the page and then another section is the body section which is going to have the entire content of the page if you see the head section over here the title you can see the test title which is coming from this title tag if we change this title to test page in this case and let me just save this file now and try refreshing this browser you should see the change in this test title over here so when we press refresh as you can see it has changed to test page in this case so guys this is the very basic simple HTML code that you can practice on your own please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the basic HTML Texs that you can use in the HTML so guys basically below are some of the basic HTML Texs that we have already seen in the previous video as well the very first tag is the exclamation mark And Then followed by the dog type keyword and then we have something called as HTML over here now guys this helps the latest browsers to understand that the code that is going to be followed after this tag is going to be the HTML code and then it is going to be the HTML 5 version so basically this tag defines the document type and the HTML version over here the next tag is the HTML tag now this tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document header which is represented by the first tag that is head that we have already seen in the previous video as well and the document body which is represented by Body tags over here so guys previously we have seen that inside the HTML tag we have two main tags that is head tag over here and then the other tag is the body tag inside the head tag we have the title of the page and then if there is any script that is to be written then we can include that as well or else meta description or the external files that we want to refer to we can use all them inside the head tag and inside the body tag we can Define the content of the body like what should come inside the page of the web application those things will come inside this body tag over here so previously we had seen that this hello world is included as the content of this body tag inside the header tag over here so guys this is the main purpose of the body tag to have the entire content of the page now guys next we also have the head tag over here this tag represents the docents header which can keep the other html text like title link Etc as we have just discussed and then we have title which comes inside the head tag over here basically this title tag is used inside the head tag to mention the document title so basically this title that you see that is test page over here it comes from this title tag so if we change the title tag content over here to some other content let's say we provide example title in this case instead of test page let me just save this file now and go to the browser and refresh this page as you can see the title has been changed to example title in this case so you can control this thing inside the title tag over here which comes inside the head tag now guys the next important tag is the body tag over here now this tag represents the documents body which keeps other HTML tags like H1 Dev and then p and then Etc so basically this is the div tag that we are going to check in the upcoming video videos as well and then we also have the P tag which represents the paragraph inside the body tag so basically all those things comes under the body tag over here we also have H1 tag which is the highest heading so over here let us say we change the H2 to H1 over here so when we just save this file now and try refreshing this page you can notice the size of the hello world content how it increases once we refresh over here so when I press refresh as you can see the size of the hello this is the highest size as far as the header tag is concerned since we are using the H1 tag over here now guys the next tag as you can see we have just discussed about the H1 tag it ranges from H1 up to H6 so it depends on your requirement as to which header tag you want to use so basically this tag represents the heading of the web page and then we also have the P tag which represents the paragraph over here so guys what we will be doing is let us say we want to add a paragraph inside the page P so we come over here and inside the body tag after this hello world header we will have the paragraph tag so let us say I provide the less than symbol and then we need to provide the P which stands for paragraph and then as I have told you this is the start tag over here and this is the end tag over here inside this we are going to provide the content that this is a paragraph in this case so we simply say this is a paragraph let me just save this file now go to the browser and we need to refresh this page once again in order to see the updated content so when we press refresh as you can see it is saying this is a paragraph over here now guys it may so happen that the size of this content that you are seeing right now while watching this video may not match with the size of the content that you are typing on your own that may be because I have increased the zoom level over here it is up to 150% on your browser it may so happen that it is 100% by default and automatically the size will be shown in this particular way so since I showing you how it works that is the reason why I have increased the zoom level over here so that you can clearly see the difference between the different tags that we are using so guys it depends on you at which zoom level you guys are working now guys if we want to add another paragraph over here we will once again provide another P tag so over here let us provide another P tag over here and then we will say this is another paragraph so guys what exactly will happen is the control flow will come to the next line on the browser and then it will display this particular line so let me just save this file now and refresh this web browser once again so as you can see we are getting this is another paragraph over here so basically both these tags that is H1 and the P tag makes the browser to come to the next line and then print the content that is provided to them guys there are certain texts which will help you to continue on the same line like how we have provided hello world over here and then after this we will have this is a paragraph content on the same line so those are the different tags that we will be using in the upcoming videos as well heading paragraph and line break tags in HTML so guys what is a heading tag so basically any document right now you can see on the web it starts with a heading so if you open any of the web page related to news or sports articles it starts with a heading which mentions about the headline or what what is going on in the sports news now guys you can use the different sizes for your headings over here it ranges from H1 and then we have H2 up to H6 and the only difference while using these header tags is the decrease in the font so basically we are going to check all these with the help of example now so let us move to the vs code over here as you can see this is the basic structure that we have already learned in the previous video but what we are going to do is I'll just remove entire content and type it once again so that you get more clear understanding about the entire basic structure of the HTML code and you can practice on your own similarly so guys the very first thing that we are going to do is start with the less than symbol and then we are going to have the doc type keyword and Then followed by HTML which is being suggested by the vs code over here now the next thing is the main tag that is HTML so over here the entire content comes inside the HTML tags so this is the start tag over here once we we press on this and then we use the greater than symbol and then you can see we also have the end tag that is automatically return by the VSS code over here now guys why we are using VSS code that's because it helps us in order to provide certain autoc completion when we are writing the code you can also use the other text editor like simple notepad over here because what will happen in the notepad so if we open the notepad text editor over here we will have to manually type all the tags over here as you can see we have started with the less than symbol and then we have to provide the exclamation mark and then simply we have to provide the talk type and then HTML keyword now in this case you are not having any auto suggestion over here which is being provided by the vs code and that is why most of the programmers use vs code text editor in order to write their HTML code or any other code in the other programming languages such as python C or C++ languages so basically after writing this HTML start and the end tag we need to write the content inside these tags that is between the start and the end tag over here now you can divide the content of the entire web page into two parts the first part is the head tag over here and then after this the second part is the body tag over here so guys we have the two main Texs that is head tag which will Define The Meta description of the page and also the title of the page over here as you can see this is the example title being showed which comes from the title tag which will be present inside the head tag and then this body tag will Define all the content inside this web page over here as you can see these are the things being highlighted which will come inside the body tag over here now guys what we will do is we will Define the title so inside the head we are going to have the title tag so over here we will use title and then what we are going to see we are going to see headers and Then followed by paragraph and then we are also going to see line breaks over here so we say line brakes now guys I'll simply close this text editor over here and the very first thing that we are going to see is the different sizes of the header tags over here so we are going to Define inside the body the first tag that is H1 in this case which is the header one now we will simply say this is heading number one over here okay similarly we are going to provide the other tags that is H2 as well so we provide h2 tag and then we simply say this is heading to and then we have H3 as well so simply we say H3 and then this is heading three now similarly I will quickly type The Heading four 5 and six as well so as you can see I have quickly typed over here the headers that is H1 H2 H3 and Then followed by H4 H5 and H6 as well and then we have given all the numbers that is 1 up to 6 over here now Guys these are all the header Texs that we have already included inside the body of our HTML code now let me just save this file now and open this file that is test.html in the browser now it is already opened over here that is test.html notice that this is the previous content which we have not refreshed yet so when I press on this reload this page button over here you can see all the changes that we have just done so after pressing the reload button you can see headers paragraph and line break the title is being displayed over here which is coming from this title tag in this case and then guys all the content that is this is heading one up to this is heading six is being displayed over here as you can see with different sizes so this is H1 and then we have H2 H3 H4 H5 and H6 so the only difference you can see is the decrease in the size of all the headers so guys this is the example of the header tag as you can see now guys let us move to another example as you can see we have something called as paragraph tag over here now the P tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs so basically after this heading in any of the articles that you can see online we have certain information on those pages and those are nothing but the paragraph that are being written while creating the HTML code and this is the tag that we are going to use now each paragraph of text should go in between an opening tag that is the P tag and a closing tag which includes the forward slash over here so guys let us check that after all these headers what we are going to do is we are going to define the paragraph tag so over here we simply use the P tag over here and then we can have the content that is this is a paragraph over here so guys basically we are going to have this is a paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so over here we come to our Chrome browser and then when we reload this page you can see this is a paragraph being displayed over here now guys in order to continue on the same line we can write another statement inside the same paragraph so what we will do is we will simply provide a full stop and then we will say this is a statement inside same paragraph So guys basically we are writing another statement after having a full stop over here but inside the same paragraph over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see we are getting this is a paragraph and then this is a statement inside same paragraph So basically this is the way in order to write the paragraph we can have multiple statements inside the same paragraph and if you want to go to the next paragraph over here if you want to write some other paragraph you have to create another paragraph tag so over here again we are going to create another P tag over here and then we are going to say this is another paragraph and then let's say after this full stop we want to write another statement so we will say this is another statement in paragraph number two and then we have full stop so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see we are getting our second paragraph over here it says this is another paragraph This is another statement in paragraph number two so guys this is the way in order to write your content inside different paragraphs over here by using different P tags please note that you have not used anything extra in order to make the control flow come from the first line to the second line over here basically when you write the content inside the P tag The Interpreter of the browser takes care of coming to the next line and writing the content of another tag on another line and not to continue on the same line so guys this is very important as far as the header tags and the paragraph tags are concerned now guys let us move to another example as you can see we have something called as line break tag so whenever you use the BR followed by a space character and then we have the forward / element so this is another line break tag that you can use what it means is anything following it starts from the next line so basically whatever content you write after this particular tag will go to the next line so this tag is an example of an empty tag where you do not need opening and closing tags as there is nothing to go in between them so guys this is an example of the empty tag because there is no open and end tag over here so in the same example what we will be doing is let's say we have this is a paragraph now you want this statement that is this is a statement inside the same paragraph to go on the next line so what you can do is before this content you can have the line break tags so over here what we will do is we will provide the less than symbol and then we have the BR tag in this case followed by a space character and then we have forward slash over here and then the greater than symbol so guys this is the tag over here which is called line break tag which helps you to go to the next line and print this statement on the next line within the same paragraph so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again you can notice that we have both these statements at is this is a paragraph and this is a statement inside same paragraph on this single line so what will happen after we reload this page so when we press on reload as you can see this is a statement inside same paragraph has gone to the next line over here that's because we have provided the line break tag over here now if I remove the same line break tag and then save this file now and try reloading this page once again so this statement has come back to that first line over here similarly if we provide the line break tag over here in the second paragraph so what we will do is we will provide BR tag followed by space and then we have the forward slash so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see this is another statement in paragraph number two so guys this is the main functionality of the BR or the line break tag that is it helps The Interpreter to come to the next line and print the content that is following that tag now guys one very important thing is it is not necessary that you end it with a forward slash over here so if I remove this and if I remove the space character as well so this will work or not let us check that so if I save this file now and try reloading this page once again as you can see there is no change right now and then this particular statement is still on the second line over here so simply if you provide the BR as well it will work but guys it is still recommended that you provide the BR tag followed by a space character and then we have the forward slashes so that in case the client is having any of the older versions of the browser then the line break tag should work and it should not break its own functionality so if we check certain older browsers it is still using this particular format so that the line break text work properly so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see this is the functionality that works in the older browsers as well as the new browsers as well so guys comment in the comment section below how are you liking this video series whether you are getting some real value or not and whether you are learning HTML with the help of this HTML tutorial please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs Center tag for centering the content in HTML so guys basically we can easily use the center tag over here to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell guys please note that this tag is dicated in HTML 5 so it was being used previously in the previous versions of the HTML compared to HTML 5 and you should instead use CSS property that is the text align in order to Center the content of the HTML but still we are going to see how the center tag used to work over here so let us move to the vs code over here so basically I'm going to remove certain content from the previous code that we have written so from H2 to H6 we are going to remove the content over here and for this paragraph as well we are going to remove the statement that this is a statement inside the same paragraph and over here we are going to remove this particular content so we are going to keep it simple that is one is the header tag with this is heading number one and then we are going to have the two paragraph tags over here that is this is a paragraph and then we also have this is another paragraph over here let me just save this file now we will also change the title over here to centering the content so over here we will say centering the content let me just save this file now and reload this page to see the updated content as you can see we have centering the content as the title and and then we have this is heading number one we have this is a paragraph and this is another paragraph now we are going to see how we can bring this paragraph that is this is another paragraph to the center of the page so it should come over here that is at the center of the page as far as the entire width of the page is concerned so guys if you want to get anything to the center of the page we need to enclose that thing inside the center tag so over here in this case we are going to enclose this entire content and the paragraph tags as well that is the starting tag and the ending tag within the center tag so over here we are going to have the center tag so we type Center over here and when we close this tag as you can see since this tag is deprecated in HTML 5 VSS code helps us in order to identify that this particular Center tag is depricated and it shows it with the red color font over here but still we can use it for now but it does not guarantee that it will accurately show the entire a content in the center when you use the different versions of the browser in future now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page you can notice that this is another paragraph content should come at the center of the page over here when we reload the page so let me press on the reload icon over here as you can see this is another paragraph has come to the center of this page as far as the width is concerned so guys this is one way in order to get the content on the center of the page but guys this is not recommended since this tag is replicated so the other way is to use the text align property of the CSS now guys it may so happen that you have not learned about the CSS which we are going to learn in the upcoming video series as well after the HTML video series so over here I'm going to Simply show you how CSS works with the help of the internal CSS code so let me just remove these Center tags over here and then let me get the paragraph tag over here once again to it origal position let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so that this is another paragraph comes to the extreme left over here now guys what we will do is inside the P tag over here before the greater than sign we have something called as attributes inside all the Texs we can Define their own attributes as well one of the attributes is the style attribute over here so when we type style you can see vs code is suggesting us the style attribute in this case it says it contains the CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element so basically whatever style that we want to apply to this particular content that is this is another paragraph only to this paragraph it will be applied and no other paragraph will be impacted so over here we display the style and one of the property inside this attribute is the text align over here so we simply type text you can see all the suggestions from the vs code over here but the first suggestion that is text align we are going to use this it says describes how inline contents of a block are horizontally aligned if the contents do not completely fill the line box and it also says which are the browser versions that is being supported by this property over here so guys simply we are going to use this property and then we are going to use the value as Center in this case so guys every property inside the attribute will have some of the other value over here which we can use use so basically we are going to use this Center and this is the way that we can use the text align property inside the style attribute of the paragraph tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again you can notice that this is another paragraph should come at the center of this page so when we reload this page you can see this is another paragraph has come to the center of this page and this is how we can get the content to the center by either using the center tag which is already deprecated or else you can use the latest property that is text align property by using the CSS code inside the start tag of the element that you want to get to the center of the page so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well displaying the horizontal lines in HTML so guys basically the horizontal lines are used to visually break up the sections of the document so we can use the HR tag as you can see we have the open angled brackets and then we have the HR keyword and then we have the closing angled brackets over here so this is the HR tag that creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line accordingly so guys let us check this with the help of example in the vs code over here so this is the pre prev HTML code that we have written so I'm simply going to change the title of the page which we can do so using the title tag over here which is inside the head tag so we will say horizontal line example so over here we have horizontal line example over here and then guys this is a heading number one we will keep this header as it is we have the paragraph as well inside the body that is this is a paragraph now guys what we will do is this is another paragraph is being displayed on the center of the page as you can see we have provided the style attribute inside this we have the text align property which helps us in order to make this content display at the center of the page now guys what we will do is between these two paragraphs we want to display a horizontal line over here so simply in between both these paragraphs we will place this HR tag as you can see this is the tag so over here we will use the open angled bracket and then we use the HR tag so as you can see the HR element represents a paragraph level thematic break a scene change in a story or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book so in short this is going to draw a horizontal line on the web page and then we are going to close this tag over here using the closing angled bracket now guys this is another example of the empty tag there is no content that should come in between the St tag and the end tag over here of the HR and that is why we need not have the end tag over here so this is another example of the empty tag apart from the line break tag which we have already seen previously so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again you can notice the change in the title and you will be seeing a horizontal line over here in between both these paragraphs now let me reload this page once again so as you can see the horizontal line example title is being displayed over here and then we can see a thin line which is horizontal in between both the paragraphs that is this is a paragraph and this is another paragraph So guys in short if you want to draw a horizontal line in between any of the sections in your web page you can use the HR tag let us draw a horizontal line in between the heading number one and the first paragraph over here so we will move to the VSS code so after this header tag that is H1 we will simply have the HR tag in this case as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page one again you can see there is another horizontal line that is in between the haer number one and the first paragraph over here how to preserve formatting in HTML so guys sometimes you want your text to follow the exact format of how it is WR in the HTML Source document so in such cases we can use the preformatted tag that is p so guys basically any text that is between the opening p PR tag and the closing PR tag will preserve the formatting of the source document and the content that is in between the pr tag over here so let us understand this with the help of example now so basically this was the previous code that we had written so I'll just remove these lines of code over here and this is the basic structure that we have already seen we have the doc type HTML and then we have the main HTML tag inside which we have the head starting and the ending tag and the body starting and the ending tag over here here so basically we are going to update the title that is preserve formatting so that we can see the changes in the browser so guys we are going to have the pr tag over here so we have the less than symbol and then we type PR as you can see vs code is suggesting us this tag that is the pr element represents a block of preformatted text in which the structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements so whatever you type inside these PR start and the end tag the formatting will be preserved so let me show you one example so let us say we write the JavaScript function if you are not aware about the JavaScript functions then don't worry we are going to check them in the upcoming videos as well when we are going to cover the JavaScript tutorial Series so over here we are just writing few lines of code as far as JavaScript code is concerned so over here we are writing the function and the function name is test and then we give certain arguments inside the open and close parenthesis over here and then we have the curly braces and then we are going to Simply alert something that is the test so over here we have the alert statement as well so guys this is nothing but it is a JavaScript code that we have just written inside the pr tag no need to worry about the functionality over here it will be just displayed on the UI for now so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so previously this was the content of the test.html that we had return now once we press the reload this page Button as you can see we have got The Preserve formatting title over here and this is the formatting that we are looking for so basically inside the pre tag you can see these are the space characters over here on all the three lines and that is what is being displayed on the UI as well you can see all these are space characters over here and basically we are preserving the format in which the code is returned let me just remove the space characters over here so so we will quickly remove the space characters from all the lines and then we will see what will happen on the UI let me just save this file now and try reloading this pate once again so as you can see all the space characters are gone because we have removed them from here so this is the way that we can preserve the formatting and the way in which we write the code in our HTML document the same way it will be displayed on the UI as well guys what happens if we don't provide the pr tag to preserve the formatting so let me just remove these t tags over here the start tag and the end tag so after removing them we are just keeping these lines of code over here inside the body tag let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see all the lines of code are displayed on one single line over here and it is not preserving the format in which we have return in our source document and then what if we provide the P tag over here that stands for paragraph So if we enclose these lines of code inside the paragraph let us check what happens so over here we'll just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see it is being showed as a paragraph but all the lines of code that we have written over here on different lines those are not being preserved so we can enclose them within the pr tag once again inside the paragraph and let us check what happens then so over here we have the starting and the ending PR tag and then let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see now we can see the format is being preserved so guys this is the way that you can preserve the formatting in the HTML in case that is the requirement while you are working on your projects HTML elements versus tags so guys basically we have seen different tags so far in this video series now what is an HTML element so basically an HTML element is defined by a starting tag and if the element contains other content it ends with a closing tag as well where the element name is preceded by a forward slash so we have already seen what is the starting tag and the ending tag for the various tags so these are certain examples as you can see we use the P tag over here which starts with the less than symbol then we have P character and then we have the greater than symbol so basically this is the starting tag for the paragraph and we have the ending tag as well in which case we have a forward slash before this P character and then in between we have certain content that this is a paragraph content so guys basically this is the difference between HTML elements and tags over here this is referred as one single tag that is the starting tag and this is the ending tag but this entire thing is considered to be an HTML which consists of the starting tag and then the content and Then followed by the ending tag over here similarly we have the header tag that is hed1 this is the starting tag and then we have the ending tag of the hed1 but this entire thing that is starting tag along with with the this is heading content and then the ending tag is considered to be the HTML element so over here this entire thing is the HTML element over here similarly we have the div tags as well which helps us in order to group the content inside the HTML code so this entire thing is the div element over here which is one of the HTML elements and then guys sometimes we don't have the content in between the starting and the ending tag so over here as you can see the BR tag which helps us in order to break the line this can also be referred to as the HTML element over here so basically you can see the P tag that is the starting tag and the ending tag and then whatever content is there in between them is an HTML element similarly we have the H1 tags as well it is another HTML element along with the starting and the ending tags so there are some HTML Elements which don't need to be closed such as image which we are going to check in the upcoming videos as well then we have the horizontal line which we have already seen and the BR tag which helps us in order to break the line so these are known as the void elements over here so guys let us check them once again with the help of examples now over here so I'll just remove these lines of code which we had return previously now let us say we want to use the paragraph tag so over here we will be using the P tag and then we will simply say this is a paragraph So guys basically this entire thing it is an HTML element over here let me just save this this file now and go to the browser and reload this page once again so as you can see this is a paragraph is being displayed so basically this is nothing but it is an HTML element now let us write another HTML element which is the header over here which we will write before the paragraph so over here we will be using H1 tag and then we will say this is heading of this page over here we will update the title as well we will say HTML element versus tags so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see it is saying this is heading of this page and then this is a paragraph So Guys these are different HTML elements now you can see the various HTML elements on a web page by using the inspect feature of the browser so guys what you have to do is you need to come over here right click and you can see on this Chrome browser you have this inspect option so when you click on this you will be able to see the elements tab over here and inside that all the HTML code that is written in order to display this web page is being return over here so as you can see this is the heading of this page you can click on this and then this particular element that is the HTML element is getting highlighted similarly when you hover over this is a paragraph then this particular HTML element is getting highlighted so Guys these are nothing but these are the HTML elements along with the start and the end Tex tag and the individual tags over here are the HTML tags that we refer to and guys this is the basic difference between the HTML elements and the tags attributes in HTML so guys an attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the elements opening tag so guys so far we have seen what are the starting and the ending tags and the starting tag is also called as the opening tag and basically based on the tagt that we use the content will be displayed on the browser now guys inside those Texs we have certain attributes that we can Define now all attributes are made up of two parts that is a name and a value so basically this is the name value pair that is being expected by the browser that should be present inside all the attributes that we Define in the opening tag over here guys we will check this with the help of examples as well now the name is the property you want to set for example the paragraph that is the P element in the example carries an attribute whose name is title which you can use to provide hint to the user so guys basically if you use the P tag that stands for paragraph you will be able to see the content but in case you want to explain more about that content you can use the title attribute inside the opening P tag which we are going to check with the help of example as well and this title is going to be the name of that attribute and on the right hand side the value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within the quotations so guys let us check this with the help of examples now in the vs code so guys basically this is the content that we had return previously we have a heading that this is a heading of this page and then we have the paragraph as you can see over here we will change the title to attributes in HTML so we will say attributes in HTML over here let me just save this file now and try read loading this page once again so as you can see the title has been updated we have a heading and then we have a paragraph now guys let us say we overover over this paragraph over here that is we are getting the cursor on the content of this paragraph so nothing is being displayed right now so what we are going to do is when we get the cursor on this content of the paragraph We should see certain hint or the title that we are going to set the attribute inside the opening tag so let us check that over here after this tag name we are going to have the space character before the greater than symbol and then we can simply hold control and the space bar on the keyboard over here you can see all the attributes that is related to this tag so basically what we are going to do is we are going to use this title attribute so it contains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to so we are going to use this title and then as you can see we have the equal to symbol that has come come automatically and then inside the double codes we can write our content as the value of this attribute so guys what we are going to do is simply we will say paragraph over here as the keyword so that the user comes to know that this is a paragraph basically we are making the user understand in this content only but for the sake of understanding inside the title we are going to provide this keyword that is paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again guys remember that previously we were not getting any title over here when we used to get the cursor on this content of the paragraph now once we reload this page what will happen let us see that so after clicking on the reload this page I get the cursor over here so here is the title that we can see that is kind of a Hint it is saying the paragraph that is the keyword that we have mentioned in our source document over here so guys this is one of the attributes of the HTML tag that is paragraph that we can use we can have any value over here as you can see we are going to update the value to test title in this case so let me just save this file now and reload this page once again so when we get the cursor over here on the paragraph it can be seen that the test title is being displayed as a hint so guys this is one of the attributes of the HTML tag that is paragraph similarly we can have different attributes for the different tags over here guys let us say we want to make the statement color as green so what we have to do is after the space character we can we can have another attribute that is style over here now guys inside this style we need to mention what particular property we need to set so we are going to say color in this case so as you can see color attribute is being displayed it sets the color of an element's text so we are going to use this and simply we are going to select the green color over here so green is being selected so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the color has been changed to green and this is the way that we can me some more attributes belonging to this particular tag making text bold in HTML using the B tag so guys basically you must have used bold formatting feature of the word processor now similarly we can have such formatting in HTML documents as well so in order to make the text as bold over here anything that appears between the B tag as you can see it is the less than symbol followed by the B character and then the greater than symbol and then we have the same ending tag over here which is having the forward slash before the character and in between both the starting and ending tags we have certain content now in between both these tags whatever content is present it will be appearing as the Bold text which means we want to get certain attention of the user while showing this content over here now guys we can also use the strong tag in the HTML 5 for bold appearance which shows importance so guys let us check this with the help of examples now in the vs code I'll just remove these lines of code that were written previously and inside the body tag we will have a simple paragraph using the P tag we will say this text is bold in this paragraph So guys this is a simple paragraph and it will be displayed normally on the browser I'll just change this title to formatting over here since we are going to see the formatting examples in HTML so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the web brows browser so as you can see it is saying this text is bold in this paragraph now guys so far we have not used the B tag over here and this is a simple paragraph now let's say we want to make this highlighted text that is text is bold to appear as bold text so what we have to do is we need to enclose this text within the starting and the ending B tag so before this text we are going to have the less than symbol and then we will say B so as you can see the B element represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate Voice or mode so guys basically it doesn't show any extra importance but only to draw the attention to this particular phrase we can use the B text over here and then after this character we can have the greater than symbol and then the same ending tag I'm going to cut this and paste it after this bold word over here here so guys basically text is bold these three words are enclosed inside the B tag over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again before reloading you can see that this is a simple paragraph now after reloading we will check what happens so when we press on reload this page you can see text is bold appearance is changed now it is drawing the attention of the user by showing it as bold over here and guys this is the way that we can use the B tag now guys similarly we can also use the strong tag over here let me just copy this line of code and paste this over here and what we will do is instead of using the B tag we will use the strong tag so as you can see the strong element represents strong importance seriousness or urgency for its content so we are going to use this tag over here and then I'll just cut this ending tag and then paste this over here instead of the ending tag of the B I will say text is bold so guys basically the content of both the paragraphs the same but we are having the strong tag over here instead of the P tag so let us see how it will be appeared so we will just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see it says this text is bold in this paragraph So guys there is no difference as far as appearance of both the paragraphs is concerned it's just that the meaning behind the scenes for this text is bold is not that important compared to what we have used over here in the this text is strong over here so basically we will have to change this text to this text is strong since we are using the strong tag guys it depends on you what text you want to make bold or strong but this is the main importance that to seek users attention to certain keywords on your web page we can either use bold or strong text based on our requirements so making text italicized in HTML using the it tag so guys basically if you must have used the italicized formatting feature of the word processor you must be knowing how the italicized works but how do we use it in the HTML Source document so just like how we used the italicized feature in the word processor we can have such formatting in HTML documents as well so in order to make the text look italicized anything that appears within the I tag over here that is the starting and the ending tag will be italicized so let us check this with the help of examples now previously we had seen how we can make the text as bold and strong which helps us in all order to grab the users attention now we are going to use another paragraph over here so we start with the P tag and then we will say this text is ital sized and then we have in this paragraph So guys basically this is another simple paragraph that this text is italicized in this paragraph now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so when we reload this page as you can see this is a normal text TT that is being displayed over here inside the paragraph now guys we want to make this text is italicized look as italicized over here so what we have to do is we need to enclose these three words within the I tag so over here we will come in the source document we will have less than symbol and then we say I and Then followed by the greater than symbol over here and then this ending tag we can just cut it and paste it after the italicized word so over here we have the text is ital ized being enclosed within this I tags so let me just save this file now go to the browser and reload this page once again so as you can see the text is italicized is being displayed in the italicized format and this is the way that we can use the feature in the HTML document as well guys based on your requirements you can show any of the text whether it is one word or multiple words in the italicized format making text underlined in HTML using the U tag now guys you must have used the underline formatting feature of the word processor or any other text editor now similarly we can have such formatting in HTML documents as well so in order to make the text as underlined anything that appears within the U tag that is the starting and the ending tag will be underlined while showing that HTML element on the browser so guys let us check this with the help of example now in the vs code so previously we had seen how we can make the text as bold by using the B and the the strong text over here and we have also seen how we can make the text as itally sized now we will have another paragraph so we will start with the P tag over here and then we will say this text is underlined in this paragraph So guys we have this simple statement that this text is underlined in this paragraph let me just save this file now and reload this page to see what happens over here so as you can see it says this text is underlined in this paragraph So guys basically this is a very simple paragraph that we have written now guys what we will do is we will underline these three words that is text is underlined so how we can do that simply we have to come in our source code and we need to enclose these three words within the U tag which stands for underlined so we will simply use the U tag over here and then we will have the greater than symbol and then I will just cut this closing tag and then paste it after this word that is underlined over here so guys basically we are enclosing this text is underlined in between the U tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again you will notice the change in these three words how it will be underlined so when we reload this page as you can see these three words over here are being underlined in this case and that is how we can use the U tag in order to underline any text in our HTML document guys you can underline any single word in this case or else multiple words based on your requirements making text strike through in HTML using the strike tag so guys anything that appears within the strike tag as you can see we have the strike opening tag and the strike closing tag over here that content will be displayed with the strike through which is a thin line through the text so guys let us understand this with the help of example now in the vs code over here so guys previously we had seen how we can make the text as bold or strong or italic sized and underlined now we can have another paragraph over here so we will have the P tag and inside this P tag we will say this text is strike in this paragraph So guys basically this is a very simple paragraph that we have written it has a single statement that this text is stried in this paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here you can see that this is a very simple paragraph over here without any formatting now what we will do is we will make these three words at is text is Strike which will have strike through so what we have to do is we just need to enclose these three words in between the strike tags so over here we are going to have the less than symbol and then we will type strike and then we will have the greater than symbol over here and what we have to do is this ending tag we just need to cut it and paste it after the strike word over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see text is stried is being displayed in the form of a strike through over here you can have any single word or the multiple words display with the strike through based on your requirements now guys if you notice in this code this strike word is being colored with a red color so basically this means that this strike tag is being deprecated in the latest version of the HTML so in HTML 5 you can simply use the S tag so instead of using the strike tag over here we can use S tag so as you can see the S element represents contents that are no longer accurate or no longer relevant so the this will have the same functionality similar to that of the strike tag so we will replace this ending tag as well with the S tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see we are getting the same output over here these three words are being stried through using the S tag so guys basically the strike tag is depricated and we must use the S tag over here in the latest version of the HTML monospaced font in HTML so guys the content that is within the TT tag that is the starting tag and the ending tag over here is written in a monospaced font now what is a monospaced font so most of the fonts are known as variable with fonts because different letters are of different widths for example the letter M over here is wider than the letter I so you can see the width of the letter M it is more compared to the width of the letter I over here now in a monospaced font however each letter has the same width so this we are going to check with the help of examples now now guys remember that the TT tag that is used for the monospaced font in HTML is being deprecated and we must use the kbd tag if we are using the HTML 5 version so let us check this with the help of examples now in the VSS code so what we will do is we will have a paragraph with the P tag over here and we will say this text is monospaced so over here we have this text is monospaced in this paragraph So this is one statement inside the paragraph that this text is monospaced in this paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we are getting a simple paragraph over here now guys what we need to do is these three words at is text is monospaced we want to display it in the monospaced font so what we will do is inside the source code we need to enclose these three words within the TT tag so over here we will simply have the less than symbol and then we will say TT over here and then greater than symbol so let me just cut this ending Tex and paste it after this monospaced world so we have enclosed this text is monospaced within this TD tag that is the start tag and the end tag as you can see it is being displayed in the red color that's because this tag is deprecated in the latest version of the HTML let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the appearance of this text is monospace is different compared to the other words in the same paragraph over here all the characters of this this text is having the same width now so guys basically even though this tag is deprecated but still it is being supported in some of the latest versions it is better to use the latest tags over here and that is what we have the kbd tag for so basically this is another tag in the HTML 5 that we can use in order to have the same functionality similar to this TT tag so I'll just remove the TT tag over here and we will see KBT in this case so when we type KBT so as you can see KBT is being suggested by the vs code I'll end it using the greater than symbol and then cut this ending tag and replace this TT tag with the ending tag of the kbd let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again no change will be noticed as you can see since the text is monospaced is being displayed over here using the kbd tag as well so guys this is the way that we can have the monospaced font for some of the text or all of the text inside the paragraph or any other text that you are using based on your requirements making text superscript in HTML using the S tag so guys basically whatever content that we put within the starting Su and the ending Su tag is written in the superscript the font size used is the same size as the characters surrounding it but is displayed half of characters height above the other characters so guys let us check how this superscript works in the HTML so we will move to our vs code and basically we are going to write another paragraph We are going to have the statement inside this paragraph and we will say this text is superscript in this paragraph So guys this is a very simple statement that we have written inside this paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we are getting a normal paragraph that this text is superscript in this paragraph now guys what we will do is we want to make this word that is supert script appear as the superscript in this particular statement which means this text will be displayed above the is keyword over here on the right so let us do that using the Su keyword so over here we will move to the vs code and this particular word needs to be enclosed in between the Su tag so we will have the less than symbol and then we will say s as you can see the Su element represents a superscript so this tag will help us in order to display the word is superscript so over here we will select it and then we will also have the ending tag over here we will write that keyword once again so we have this superscript word being enclosed within the Su starting and the ending tag let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again in the browser so as you can see this text is and the superscript is being displayed on top of this is word and then we have in this paragraph statement so guys this is the way that we can display the superscript script in the HTML using the S tag you can have any word or multiple words over here being displayed as the superscript let us say we have more words over here to be present in the superscript so we will say superscript on top and then let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again as you can see the superscript is having multiple words over here that is superscript on top and that is how we can use the Su tag making text subscript in HTM ml using the sub tag so guys basically the content within the sub starting tag and the ending tag will be return in the subscript so the font size used is the same as the character surrounding it but is displayed half the character's height beneath the other characters so let us check this with the help of example now in the vs code over here what we will do is we will have another statement inside the paragraph tag so over here we will have the P tag in this case and then we will say this text is subscript over here in this paragraph So guys this is a single statement that we have included inside the paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here so as you can see this simple statement is being displayed as a paragraph now what we will do is this particular word that is subscript we want to display it as the subscript inside this paragraph So guys what is the difference between the subscript and the superscript so so previously we had seen that the Su tag can be used in order to display the subscript in this way which is displayed on the top now similarly we will be using the Su tag in this case in order to display the subscript word on the bottom right of this is word over here so guys let us make these changes in the vs code so what we have to do is so we need to enclose this subscript word between the sub starting and the ending tag so we will simply have the less than symbol and then we will type sub and then we will have the greater than symbol over here and then what we have to do is I'll just cut this ending tag and paste this over here after this subscript word so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the subscript is being displayed so it says this text is and then we have the subscript in this paragraph now guys this is the example with one word we can have multiple words as well being displayed as the subscript so what we have to do is we need to in include those words within the sub starting and the ending tags so over here we say subscript on bottom so basically we have three words over here as subscript when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see subscript on bottom is being displayed as the subscript guys the height of this subscript is half the height of the other characters that is being displayed normally in this paragraph but the font size is same whenever the superscripts and subscripts are being displayed in the HTM ml inserted text in HTML using inss tag so guys basically anything that appears within the ins starting and the ending element is displayed as the inserted text over here in the HTML so let us check this with the help of example in the vs code so what we will do is we will simply have a paragraph So we have the P tags over here and then we will say this text is inserted in this paragraph so guys this is a very simple paragraph it is having the statement that is this text is inserted in this paragraph so let me just save this file now go to the browser and reload this page so as you can see we have the extra paragraph that this text is inserted in this paragraph now guys what we will do is we will make this text is inserted only these three words appear in between the ins starting and the ending tag so over here in the vs Cod we will have the start tag that is the inss tag and then we also have the end tag over here we will simply cut this and paste it after the inserted word so basically we have enclosed text is inserted these three words within the inss starting and the ending tag which stands for inserted so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see text is inserted is being underlined now and guys this is the meaning of the inss tag so basically whatever content we put inside the ins tag it will be underlined so the functionality of the inss tag is similar to that of the underline tag that is U tag over here since both of them are used in order to underline the text in this case we have used the ins starting and the ending tag over here so guys this is the main functionality of the inss tag deleted text in HTML using the deel tag so guys basically anything that appears within the deel starting and the end ending tag over here is displayed as the deleted text now how it will be displayed let us check this with the help of the example in the vs code over here so let me just provide a simple paragraph over here using the P tag and we will say this text is deleted in this paragraph So guys this is a very simple paragraph that we have written over here in the vs code let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the web browser so as you can see this is a very simple paragraph that we have added on the browser over here now guys what we will do is we will enclose these three words that is text is deleted in between the D tag which represents the deleted text so over here we will say d and then we will close the starting tag over here and then we also have the ending tag which we will cut and paste it after the deleted word over here so guys basically we have enclosed the text is deleted in between the D starting and the ending tags now how it will appear on the browser let us check that so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so when we reload this page as you can see text is deleted is being stried over here so guys basically this is similar to the strike through that we have seen previously using the S tag and this is how we can mark the text as deleted whenever we are building a web page using the HTML now guys where it becomes important is let's say you want to delete certain words from the paragraph in the article that you have already written so you can enclose it within the D tag and if you want to insert something else instead of the deleted text then you can use the inss tag which will underline the text so basically in the same paragraph we can have some more words over here we can say this text is deleted and then we will say and this text is inserted where we need to enclose this text is inserted inside the inss tag so we will simply say inss over here and then we will have the ending tag after the inserted word so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see this text is deleted we have it strike through and then we have end this text is inserted so basically we have inserted this text over here within the same paragraph So guys basically this is the functionality of the delete and the inserted Tex text where we want to delete certain words and insert some more words in the existing paragraph larger text in HTML using the big tag so guys basically the content of the starting big and the ending big tag is displayed one font larger than the rest of the text surrounding it so guys let us check this with the help of example now in the VSS code so what we will do is simply we will have another paragraph over here using the P tag and then we will say this text is big in this paragraph So guys we have a simple statement in this new paragraph over here this text is big in this paragraph so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this text is big in this paragraph now guys what we will do is we will have the text is Big that is these three words appear one font size larger than the rest of the text so what we have to do is we need to enclose these three words within the big tag over here so we will move to the vs code and then we will say big in this case so this is the big tag that we can use so basically as you can see since the font color of this tag is red this tag is deprecated in the newer versions of the browser but guys still it can work in certain browsers so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the text is big it is being displayed as one font size larger compared to the other text in the the same paragraph now guys if we see what exactly is happening behind the scenes we can simply right click over here and we can use the inspect option so when we use the inspect option you can see under elements the paragraph is being displayed over here using the P Tex and inside this we have this text is big in this paragraph now these three words are being enclosed within the big tag over here and the big tag is being given the font size as larger and this is what is happening behind the scenes the larger value for the font size is making these words appear bigger than the other text in the same paragraph now guys since this tag is deprecated it is recommended that we use the style attribute over here now how do we use the style attribute only for these three words so we will remove these tag first of all and then we can have the span tag over here so instead of the big tag we can have the span tag so we say span and then we have the closing span tag over here after the the big word in this case and then we say this text is Big so guys basically what we have done is we have enclosed the text is Big these three words within the span tag now what will happen after this let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is a normal paragraph now but since we have used the span tag it is used in order to group certain words and apply certain styles to these words over here so what we can do is inside the span tag we can have the style attribute in this case and the style can have the font size so guys what we have seen is the font size value was larger so over here we will again provide a larger value for the font size and then let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so now we can see that text is big is appearing as one font size larger compared to the other text in the same paragraph So guys this is the replacement of the big tag that we have seen just now either we can use the big tag or in the newer versions of the browser we can also use the span tag and along with that we can use the style attribute over here we are going to learn more about the style attribute and what are the different properties and the values that we can have inside the style attribute in the upcoming videos as well displaying smaller text in HTML using the small tag so guys basically the content of the small starting and the ending tag is displayed one font size smaller than then the rest of the text surrounding it so guys basically whatever text we enclose within the small starting and the ending tag will appear smaller compared to the rest of the text so let us check this with the help of the example in the vs code over here so the very first thing that we will do is we will have a simple paragraph using the P tag and then we will say this text is small in this paragraph So we have a very simple statement that is this text is small in this paragraph in the P tag that is the paragraph now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here so when we reload this page as you can see we have a paragraph this text is small in this paragraph now guys what we will do is we will enclose these three words that is text is small in between the small tag so over here in the vs code we have to enclose it in between the small tag so we will have the small starting tag over here and then we have the ending tag as well which we will put after the small word in this case so basically text is small these three words are being enclosed now in between the small starting and the ending tags over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again to see how it appears so when we reload this page as you can see text is small these three words are appearing one font size smaller compared to the other text in the same paragraph now guys if we see what is happening behind the scenes we can simply right click over here and select the inspect option so after this we have under the elements tab we have this P tag over here inside which we have the this text is small in this paragraph statement and then guys you can see for this small tag we have the font size that is smaller over here so we can also use the CSS property that is font size with the value smaller in order to make the text appear in the same way just like how we have done for the the text is Big over here so if we check the code for this text is big in this vs code you can see we have used the span tag and then we have used the style attribute over here for which we have used the property that is font size and the value is larger in this case so guys either we can use this CSS property using the span tag or we can simply use the small tag over here which is supported by the latest version the big tag that we have seen previously is not supported with the latest versions of the browser and that is why we had used the font size property inside the style attribute so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs marking text in HTML using the mark tag so guys basically the content of the mark starting tag and the ending tag over here is displayed as the highlighted text on the browser so guys let us check this with the help of the vs code over here how the mark tag works so let us add a simple paragraph using the P tag so we will say this text is marked in this paragraph So guys this is a very basic statement that we have included within the pag and it will appear as a paragraph on the browser let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this text is marked in this paragraph now guys let us say we want to provide the text is marked these three words in between the mark starting and the ending tag so what we have to do is in the vs code we will simply enclose this text is marked over here within the mark tags so we say the mark starting tag over here and then we cut this and paste it after the marked word over here so we have the starting and the ending Mark tags and then we have text is marked which is enclosed Within These tags over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see text text is marked is being highlighted as yellow and this is the functionality of the mark tag so whatever text is present in between the mark starting and the ending text it will be highlighted in yellow as you can see the background color is yellow over here now guys what exactly is happening behind the scenes so let me just right click over here and click on the inspect option you can see the exact CSS property over here the background color is being used as the mark value and the color property is given the value as the mark text so guys the same thing we can do for this text is small in this paragraph as well so what we can do is simply we will come in this vs code and over here instead of using the mark tag in this case we will use the background color property inside the style attribute so we have the style attribute for this paragraph that is this text is small in this paragraph over here and we say background color in this case so we say background color it is Mark so let me just save this file now and we will check what what is the effect of this inside this browser so when we reload this page as you can see this paragraph that is this text is small in this paragraph the entire paragraph is now having the background color that is yellow which is being depicted by the value of Mark of the background color property inside the style attribute so guys this is the main functionality of the mark tag it helps us in order to highlight the required text that we want to highlight based on our requirements how to commment code in HTML now guys the comment tag is used to insert the comments in the source code now the comments are not displayed in the browsers so basically we are going to provide the commands in our HTML source code over here in the vs code but the same thing will not be displayed when we are going to see our web pages in the browser so guys basically what is the functionality of the command now you can use the commments to explain your code which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date so basically you can provide certain commments in order to explain what kind of code you have written so that you can edit it at a later stage now this is espcially useful if you have a lot of code over here another functionality of having the commands is to make someone else understand what you have written in the code for the review purpose as well so whenever you are going to write the HTML code it will be reviewed by your seniors so in order to make them understand what the HTML code section is doing you can provide the comments in order to explain its functionality so guys over here as you can see this is the example so this is a comment and the comments are not displayed in the browser so you can see this entire statement being enclosed in between the commment Tex over here we have the less than sign and then we have the exclamation mark And Then followed by two times hyphen over here so this is the starting tag and then we have the ending tag over here as the two * hyphen and then we have have the greater than sign so guys basically whatever content is present in between these starting and the ending comment tags those will be commented out and will not be displayed on the browser so guys let us check this with the help of example now over here so let's say we add another paragraph in between these two paragraphs over here that this text is small in this paragraph and then we have this text is marked in this paragraph now we will have another paragraph in between them using the P tag we will say say this statement needs to be commented so we have simply provided this simple statement this statement needs to be commented in between the P teag which means it is a paragraph so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here so as you can see we have this paragraph this statement needs to be commented now guys what we will do is we will comment out this statement so what we have to do is over here before the starting P tag we have to provide the the comment tag over here so how do we provide the comment tag we have the less than symbol followed by exclamation mark and then we have two times hyphen over here and then as you can see automatically we have the ending commment tag as well that is two * hyphen and Then followed by the greater than symbol so we just need to cut this and paste it after the ending tag of this P tag over here as you can see for now we have the starting command tag and all the HTML code after this is being displayed in the green color which means these text will be commented out but we need to provide the ending comment tag over here after this particular statement so we need to provide the ending commment tag over here so as we provide the ending tag over here you can see only this P tag is being displayed in the green color so guys let me just save this file now and let us see what happens now after reloading this page so as you can see the statement that we had written is now commented out and that is why we cannot see see that statement over here on the browser so guys this is the functionality of the comment tags over here we can simply provide certain explanation as well in between the commment text in order to explain the functionality of the HTML code that we have return now guys in the browser you can see where the comments are by viewing the page source of the HTML code so over here we can simply right click and choose the inspect option so as you can see under the elements tag over here we can see this P tag that is present and then we also have the comment tags over here which depicts that this particular HTML code is commented out now guys we can also see the page source so when we right click and select the view page Source option as you can see on the new tab we are seeing the page source so over here we have the comments that this statement needs to be commented and it is commented out though we are not able to see it on the browser but we can see on the page source of that HTML div tag in HTML in order to group the content so guys basically the div and the span elements allow you to group together several elements over here to create sections or subsections of a page so basically this div and the span tags are used in order to group the content inside your HTML source code which we are going to check with the help of examples as well now guys for example you might want to put all of the footnotes on a page within a div element to indicate that all the elements within that div element relate to the foot noes and with this foot noes you might then attach a style to this div element so that they appear using a special set of style rules so guys basically the div tag is used in order to group the content in the HTML source code and in order to provide the common set of style rules over here you can provide the style attribute inside the div tag so that all the the tags inside the div tag will have the same style property so guys we will check this with the help of example now in the vs code so what we will do is simply I'll remove all these lines of code that we had written previously as part of formatting the text in the HTML now what we will do is simply we will have two paragraph over here so the first P tag that is the starting P tag we will say this is first paragraph and then guys we will have another paragraph over here so again we will have the P tag and we will say this is second paragraph So guys we have two paragraphs over here this is the first paragraph and this is the second paragraph now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here so as you can see we have two paragraphs being displayed over here now guys what if I want to provide certain color to the first paragraph let's say I want to provide the font color as blue over here so what we will do is simply we can come to this p t and we will say style in this case the style attribute is used in order to provide the background color or the text color or the various properties as you can see over here being suggested by the vs code so in this case we will say color property so we have the color property and let's say we provide the value as blue over here so guys this is the key value pair for the style attribute that is color is the property and blue is the value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see this is first paragraph is being displayed in the blue color now so guys basically this is the way in order to provide the color to any particular paragraph or any other HTML element now guys let's say you wanted to provide the same color to the second paragraph as well so one more option was to provide the same attribute that is Style with the color property and the blue value to this second paragraph as well so I'll just copy this and paste this over here inside the P tag of the second paragraph now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the blue color is being assigned to the second paragraph as well now guys let's say we have more paragraphs in this case so I'll just copy this and paste this over here in the remaining lines but this time we are not having the style property for the other paragraphs so I'll simply remove the style properties from all the remaining paragraphs and we will name name the paragraphs as third paragraph then we have fourth paragraph over here and then we have the fifth paragraph So guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have more three paragraphs being displayed but the colors are blue only for the first and the second paragraph what if we want to provide the blue color to all the paragraphs over here now guys it will be a repetitive task if we simply go on applying all the Styles and the colors to the remaining paragraphs over here so simply what we can do is I'll just remove the style attribute from both these paragraphs in this case and now we have the simple paragraphs without any color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the color is black by default now guys let's say we want to provide the blue color to all the paragraphs in an easy way so what we can do is we can group them in between the div tags so over here we will come in the source code and we will say div tag over here so div tag helps us in order to group the HTML content and that is what we are going to do in this example as well so we have the starting div tag and the ending div tag we have to cut it from here and paste it after the fifth paragraph in this case so guys let me just format it properly so that it is in a good readable format so as you can see after this body we have the div tag and inside this div tag we have five paragraphs over here and then after that we have the div tag that is closed now guys what will be the impact of this div tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so nothing is happening over here that's because behind the scenes only we have grouped the content that is all the five paragraphs are being grouped inside one div tag now guys what we can do is we can simply provide the style attribute over here to the div tag so that it applies to all the paragraphs over here so simply we will come to this div tag and then we will say style attribute and and then we can say color over here which is one of the properties of the style attribute and then we can say blue that is the value we want to apply to all the paragraphs that is the children of this div tag so guys basically this div tag is the parent tag over here and all these tags that is inside the div tag are the child tags so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see all the paragraphs are being displayed with the blue color now and we do don't have to provide the style attribute separately to all the paragraphs that we were supposed to do earlier without the div tag so guys basically this is the main functionality of the div teag it helps us in order to provide certain formatting or the style to the child text that is present inside the div tag now guys let's say we want to display all these paragraphs at the center of the browser so what we can do is again inside the style attribute we have something called as text align property so as you can see we have this text align property and then it is having one of the values as Center so we can provide the center value so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so over here when we reload this page as you can see all the paragraphs are being displayed at the center of the browser now guys similarly you can provide any of the formatting or the styles to all these paragraphs you can also provide the style to the individual paragraph as well so let's say we want to display the four fourth paragraph over here that is this is the fourth paragraph at the right of the browser so we simply have to come to this P tag and then we will say style and then we will use the text align property once again and we can simply provide right value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see this is fourth paragraph is being displayed on the right of the browser and this is how we can provide the formatting so basically whatever formatting is being provided to the parent tag over here those will be applied to the child tags as well but in case a child is having their own formatting or the style attribute so it will be applied separately only to that child element and that is what we have seen just now with this fourth paragraph over here we have displayed it on the right and let's say we want to change the color of this fourth paragraph instead of this blue color we want to display it with the red color so we have to come over here inside the style attribute and we use the color property and we can simply provide the red value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is fourth paragraph is being displayed with the red color now so this is the functionality of the div tag over here basically it helps us in order to group the content of the HTML source code and apart from that you can provide the required formatting and the style attribute as well with the required property values based on your requirements spend pan tag in HTML to group The inline elements so guys basically the span element can be used to group inline elements previously we had seen the div tag that was used in order to group The Block elements now guys what is the difference between the block and the inline elements over here so basically this P tag which depicts the paragraph in the HTML is the block element which means whatever content we write inside the starting and the ending P tag will be followed by a new line and that is why we call it as the block element so over here as you can see the first paragraph Was displayed and then the control went to the next line and then the second paragraph Was displayed so these are nothing but the block elements over here now when we talk about the inline elements these four words by themselves are the inline elements over here so let's say when we want to provide certain different style attribute to this first word we can use the span tag in order to provide the style attribute and that is what is the meaning of the styling of the inline elements that can be done by using the span tag over here so if you have a part of a sentence or a paragraph which you want to group together you could use this Spen element and you can provide the different CSS property to this pen element as well so as you can see also you can use pen for using different CSS properties in same sentence of a paragraph So guys let us check this with the help of example now in this vs code code so what we will do is simply I'll remove the style attribute over here from the div tag as well as from this P tag which is the fourth paragraph over here so basically we have these five paragraphs in the source code let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see these five paragraphs are being displayed normally with the black color and there is no CSS property of the style attribute being applied over here now guys what we will do is I will modify the parag over here and we will say this color is green in this first paragraph So basically we have modified the statement and we are saying this color is green in this first paragraph now guys in the second paragraph what we will do is we will have this background color is red in this second paragraph so over here we are saying background color is red and over here we were saying color is green in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the statements are updated now and the paragraphs are modified now guys let us say we want to provide the color as green to these three words that is color is green over here so how do we do that so simply if we provide the style attribute to this P tag then the entire statement will be displayed as green over here so I'll just show you that so we can provide the style at attribute and then we can say color as green in this case so when we provide the color as green let me just save this file now and try reloading this page you can see that the entire first paragraph is being displayed with the green color now but what if we only want to provide the green color to these three words that is color is green so what we have to do is we can use the span tag over here so simply I'll remove the style attribute from the P tag over here and then we can provide the span tag so we will say Span in this case so we have the starting span tag and then the ending span tag needs to be cut and we need to paste it after the green word over here so basically color is green is being surrounded by the span tag now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so you can see there is no difference right now since we are not providing any attribute or The Styling to the span tag for now so what we have to do is inside this starting span tag we need to provide the style attribute and this style attribute will have the property that is color since we want to provide the font color as green so over here the color attribute will have the value as green in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see color is green is being displayed now in this green color and the rest of the words are still being displayed with the black color and guys that is the the main functionality of this span tag in order to provide certain styling or the formatting to the inline elements over here we can use the span tag similarly we can provide the background color as red over here in the second paragraph so what we can do is we will come over here and then before this background word we will provide the span starting tag and then we will cut the span ending tag over here and paste it after the red color so when we paste it after this so we need to provide the style attribute before providing the style attribute let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so nothing has happened over here for now but what if we provide the background color as red to this pen tag so when we provide the style attribute and the property that is supposed to be used is the background color over here and we simply provide the value as red in this case since the background color needs to be red so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see background color is red is now having the background color displayed as red over here based on our requirement so guys this is another way in order to use the span element how to inspect HTML elements in browser so guys basically we can easily inspect or see the properties or the attributes of any existing HTML code via browser so guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can see the code of the existing web page that is being displayed with the required properties and the attributes and we can come to know like what is exactly written behind the scenes in the HTML source code so basically it also helps us to understand the existing web pages with their structure and The Styling so guys over here previously we had seen how we can use the div tag and the span tags as well in order to group the content in the HTML source code so over here you can see this color is green in this first first paragraph and then we have this background color is red in this second paragraph so how you can inspect these elements and see the HTML source code that is being written behind the scenes so simply we have to come over here get the cursor on the required paragraph that you want to see the source code for and then we have to right click over here and you can see the inspect option so guys basically this inspect option will be present on all the modern browsers currently we are using the Chrome browser over here but when you are using the other browser such as Firefox or Microsoft Edge or any other browser in your operating system you will be able to see this inspect option so we need to click on this inspect option so after clicking on the inspect option this particular section will open and inside the section you have to come to this elements section it can so happen that by default you are on the console or the sources section in this case but you have to come to this elements section over here here and then you can see the entire HTML source code so over here you can see the HTML tag which is the parent tag over here and then we have the two tags that is the head tag which is having the title that is formatting in HTML so you can see formatting in HTML title being displayed over here and then guys we also have the body in this case so you can expand the body as well and then you can see first of all we have the div tag inside the body and then we have the first paragraph tag so when you click on this you can see that the first paragraph is being highlighted over here so we need to expand this first paragraph and then you can see this word and then we have the span element in this case that is the starting and the ending tag so over here the HTML content is color is green and then guys you can see something different over here you are seeing the style attribute in this case so basically the style attribute is having the property that is color for which the value is being given as green and on the right hand side as well you can see element do style that this particular elements style is being set as the color property is given the value as green color over here similarly we have another paragraph as well so when we go on the second paragraph you can see the second paragraph is being highlighted over here above so when we get the cursor over here the second paragraph is getting highlighted and this is one of the best ways in order to inspect the element and see what code is written behind the scenes in order to display this particular paragraph or any other HTML tag in this way now what is making this paragraphs content that is background color is red with the background color as red over here so let us check that so when we go to this paragraph and we expand this paragraph we can see this pan tag over here for which the style is given as background color is equal to Red so when we click on this pan tag you you can see background color is being showed as red over here you can also uncheck this option on the right you can see so when we click on this you can see that the background color that was red over here is not being displayed that's because we have unchecked that option and in the source code you can see it is now commented out over here and there is no background color that is being applied now again when you check on this option the background color that was red is set again over here on the browser so guys this inspect option also helps you to play around with the code over here that is already written on a particular web page and you can see what is the effect of unchecking and checking certain options over here now we can also come over here and provide some more properties so let's say we want to make the text color as yellow over here along with the background color so we can simply provide the color property over here and then we can simply provide the yellow value so as you can see automatically the yellow color is being applied to this text in this case that's because we have provided this property now we can simply uncheck and check these options over here once again so when we uncheck this background color the background color is gone now and you can see the text color is yellow in this case when we uncheck that text color is yellow so we can see the text color is black by default so guys this is the way you can play around with the CSS properties as well by using the inspect option of the browser and guys if you see the source code that was written in the vs code over here this is the same source code that you can see when you choose the inspect option on the browser so in this way you can inspect any of the web pages on the internet that is present in order to learn something out of it and make changes in order to play around and check how the text looks like on those web pages style attributes in HTML so guys basically the HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element such as color background color or font size and many more properties that we are going to check with the help of examples as well now guys this is the format we first of all have the less than symbol followed by the tag name that we have been using in the previous videos as well now guys in this starting tag we have the space character and then we have the style attribute so basically we need to provide the style attribute followed by the equal to symbol and all the styling properties must be present in between the double codes so over here we have the double codes and Within These double codes we are having the key value pass that is property followed by colon and then value and then if we have the multiple key value properties those must be separated with the semicolon in between the double quotes over here so guys let us check this with the help of examples now so first we are going to check the background color over here so we are going to come to this vs code and we simply have the HTML parent tag over here and then we have the head tag as well and inside the title tag we are going to change the title of the page that is we are going to say Styles in HTML so guys we have the title that is Styles in HTML and then guys over here inside the body we will simply have the paragraph and we will say this paragraph has background color as red so guys we have the content as this paragraph has background color is red over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the title that is Styles in HTML and the paragraph is being displayed as this paragraph has background color as red now guys to make this paragraph have the background color as red what we can do is we will be using the style attribute so in the vs code we will come over here and as we have seen in the format with the start tag we have the space character followed by by the style attribute and then we have the property value pirs over here so basically inside this starting P tag we will have the space character and then we will say style attribute over here as you can see VSS code is suggesting us the style attribute so we are going to select this and then automatically we are getting this equal to symbol and the double codes over here since vs code is helping us in order to complete this code so basically we are going to use the B ground color property in this case and then the value that we are going to use is after the colon we are going to have the value that is red over here so guys basically as you can see this is the format we have the style attribute followed by equal to symbol and then in between the double codes first of all we have the property and Then followed by the colon and then the value that is red color and then automatically the semicolon is also placed so if you have more properties to be applied after the semicolon you can provide more properties so over here this is the code that we have completed with the background color that is red for this paragraph so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here so as you can see the paragraph is having the background color as red and since it is a block element the entire width of the screen is being taken and the color red is being applied over here to the background now guys let us check another property we also have the color property over here here which will change the text color for the element to which we have applied this color property so guys let us have another paragraph in our source code so we have the P tag over here and then we say this paragraph has color as green so guys we are going to provide the text color as green over here so what we have to do is first of all simply we will save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have another paragraph over here it says this paragraph has color as green so we are going to change the text color now so how do we do that simply we have to provide the style attribute to the starting tag of the paragraph So we have the style attribute and then we use the color property and the value that we have to provide as green color so over here we have provided the value as green so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the color is being displayed as green now for this particular paragraph that this paragraph has color as green now guys let us move to another property we also have something called as font family which means it is the font style so basically the default font family for this particular paragraph that are being displayed is the Times New Roman we will be applying some other font family to another paragraph over here so let's say we have another paragraph with the P tag and we will say this paragraph has different font family so guys we have another paragraph gra over here this paragraph has different font family when we save this file now and try reloading this page it is having the same font style that is the font family over here so we are going to change the font family in this case so again we have to come over here in the start tag we will say style and then we will say font family in this case so as you can see it specifies a prioritize list of font family names or generic family names so we are going to select this the default font family that we are using right now is the Times New Roman but instead of this let us say we want to provide something else so let's say we want to provide this aial font family so we select this value and then when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the font family for this particular paragraph has been updated now so this is the way that you can update the font family of a paragraph or any other tag based on your requirements now guys let us move to another property we have something called as font size over here so guys by default the font size that is being displayed on the web browsers is having the 100% as the value so what we can do is we can come over here for the second paragraph that is this paragraph has color as green we are going to increase the font size so simply we have to come over here after the semicolon we provide the space character so that it is more readable so simply we have to provide the font size property over here and when we provide 100% no change will be observed on the web browser so when we save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the font size is same as the previous one that's because by default the font size is the 100% let's say we want to increase the font size by 50% and make it 150% over here so when we do it as 150 the font size for this particular paragraph will be increased to some extent so let me just save this file now and try reloading in this page so as you can see the font size for this particular paragraph has increased now so guys this is one of the ways in order to change the font size of a particular paragraph or any other HTML content guys instead of using the percentage we can use the pixels as well percentages are used when we want the web pages to be responsive and on the mobile we want the size of the different elements of the web pages to adjust on their own but when we use pixels over here fixed pixels will be used so basically when we provide 20 pixels in this case so let's say we provide 20 PX in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so basically the font size will be fixed over here based on the resolution of the screen in this case so guys it depends on you which one you want to use whether you want to use the percentage or the pixels but basically for the best case scenario if you want your web pages to be viewed properly on all the screen resolutions such as desktop or laptops or mobile devices as well you should be using the percentages so that it is responsive in nature so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so basically this is the font size that is increased to some extent compared to the default font size over here let us move to another style property so we also have something called as text align which will help us in order to align the HTML element so guys what we will be doing is let's say we want to display this third paragraph that is this paragraph has different font family at the center of the browser so what we can do is simply we have to come over here in the source code and after this font family property we can simply provide the text align property so we have text align property and the value that we are going to use is Center in this case so when we use Center then this particular paragraph should be displayed at the center of the browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this paragraph has different font family is now being displayed at the center of the browser so guys this is the way that you can use the different properties and the values inside the style attributes for different HTML elements based on your requirements without the style properties you will be able to write the simple content on your web pages but with the style properties you will be able to provide certain styling and the formatting to those elements quotation and citation elements in HTML so guys we are going to see number of tags over here in this video to understand what are the different tags and their meaning so the very first tag is the blog code tag so as you can see the HTML block code element defines a section that is qued from another source so if you want to quote a particular section from another source in your HTML page you can use the blog code tag over here now the browsers usually in indent the block code elements so basically there is certain indentation on the left hand side while we are displaying the content inside the block code tag so guys let us check this with the help of example now in the vs code over here so inside the body we will first of all have the paragraph So we have the P tag over here and then we will have below content is within blog code so guys we have below content is within block code after this paragraph We will have the block code tag so as you can see we have the block code tag that is being suggested by the vs code over here so we will use this and then we will say this content is from another source and then let us say we want to go to the next line so we will have the BR tag over here and then after this BR tag what we will do is we will say this is another statement in Block code so guys basically we have two statements over here inside the block code tags so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the first paragraph that is below content is within block code and then you can see this content is within the block code and on the left hand side we can see certain indentation over here so guys whenever you want to mention certain information from another source you can mention it within the block code so that it is understandable by the other developers as well that this particular content is from another source that is taken from the internet and guys that is the usage of this block code tag over here now guys let us move to another tag so as you can see we have the Q tag as well so the HTML Q tag defines a short quotation so basically browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation so whenever we have certain content in between the starting and the ending Q tag over here so that content will be enclosed within the double codes so let us check this with the help of example now over here in the vs code so guys we will have another paragraph so we will Define the P tag over here and then we will say this text is within double codes and then we will say in this paragraph So guys this is a very simple paragraph that we have defined let me just save this file now and try running this code just to to show you how it looks so basically this is another paragraph it says this text is within double quotes in this paragraph but we have not used the Q tag for now so basically we want to enclose this particular string that is text is within double Cotes in between the double quotes over here so what we have to do is we need to enclose this text in between the starting and the ending Q tag so let us come to the vs code over here the starting Q tag is being defined and the ending Q tag we need to provide after this codes word so guys let me just save this file now as you can see we have enclosed only this substring in the entire paragraph in between the starting and the ending Q tags so let me just come to the browser and reload this page so as you can see we are now getting the double codes for this substring in this entire paragraph over here and that is the main functionality of the Q tag in order to provide the double Cotes in between the content where it is applied in our HTML source code now guys let us move to another tag over here so we have something called as abbr tag so the HTML abbr tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym like HTML CSS Etc so guys basically whenever you have certain abbreviation or the acronym to be defined you can use the abbr tag and then you can provide the full form as well so let me just come to the vs code over here we will write another paragraph So we have the p bag and then we will say this page is return in HTML so basically the source code of this particular page is in HTML and that is what we have written this page is written in HTML now guys what we want to do is certain users won't be knowing what is the full form of this HTML so we can enclose this HTML word in between the a br starting and the ending tag so guys over here we will mention AB BR r tag over here and then the ending tag will come after the HTML word so guys basically we have provided the abbr tag now what happens when we reload this page so let me just save this file now and reload this page on the browser so it is displaying it as a normal paragraph over here and we are getting this HTML word as well but we are not getting the full form of this abbreviation so what we can do is we can come over here in the vs code and inside the abbr tag we have the attribute called as title so as you can see it contains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to so basically we can provide the title in order to give the full form of this particular HTML word so let me just provide this title and we will say hyper text markup language which is the full form of HTML because we have the full form that is hyper text markup language so when we provide the title inside the this abbr tag let us see what happens now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so as you can see it is now underlined with the dots over here that is the HTML word is underlined and when we get the cursor on this HTML word now you can see that hyper text markup language that is the full form that we have provided in the title attribute is now being displayed to the user and guys this is the main functionality of this abbr tag it helps you to provide the full form of certain words that is the abbreviations and the acronyms can be represented by this tag so guys you can use this tag based on your functionality and the requirements now let us move to another tag over here we have something called as address tag as well now the HTML address tag defines the contact information for the author or the owner of a document or an article so guys let us try using this address tag now so what we will do is after this paragraph We will have the address tag over here so we can use the address starting and the ending tag and then guys what we will do is we will simply say YouTube channel name and then colon and then on the next line we will say programming for beginners which is the name of this YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so in order to learn a lot about the web development and other programming languages and then we will also have editor which we use use as vs code so guys basically this is just an example that I am showing you in reality you will be using the exact address of certain person or the company based on your requirements that you want to display the information on the page so this is just an example that we have taken in order to see how it looks on the web browser so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the address tag makes the content to be displayed with the it sized formatting on the text now guys the entire content is being displayed on one single line so what we can do is we can provide the BR tag over here so at the end of the lines we can simply provide the VR tag over here and now let us save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the entire content now is being displayed on the different lines over here inside the address tag which is formatting the text and displaying it on the browser as the itally sized text now let us move to another tag over here so we have something called a site tag as well now the HTML site tag defines the title of a creative work so for example a book a poem a song a movie a painting Etc so basically the text in the site element usually renders in italic so guys again we have another tag that is site tag which will help the element to be displayed as itally sized text so guys let us check this now with the help of example in the vs code over here so we will simply have another paragraph and then we will say this video is created by programming for beginners YouTube channel so we have programming for beginers YouTube channel so guys basically we have a very simple paragraph over here that we have defined let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is a very simple paragraph guys as we have just seen the site tag it helps us to define the title of a creative work so it can be any author a book a poem so basically what we are going to do is we are going to apply the site tag for this programming for beginners because this is the YouTube channel that is helping us right now in order to learn HTML with the help of these videos so guys what I'm going to do is we will have the site tag over here so we have the side starting tag and then I'll just cut this and paste it after the big word over here and then let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so as you can see now the programming for beginners this text has been formatted with the itally sized text and this is how the content in between the site tag will be displayed whenever you are going to use it based on your requirements so Guys these were certain quotation and citation elements in the HTML that you can use based on your requirements the block code helps us in order to quote some other information from another source and then we also have the Q tag that will just enclose the string in between the double quotes over here and then we have also used the abbr tag which will help us in order to display the abbreviations and the acronyms in HTML we also have the address tag that can be used in order to display the contact information of an individual or a company or an organization as well and then lastly we have the site tag in order to display the name of the poem or any other creative work that has been done Block versus inline elements in HTML in order to display the values so guys basically there are two display values in HTML one is the block element and another is inline element so we are going to understand what is the difference between these two display values over here in HTML now guys as far as Block Level elements are concerned these always starts on a new line and the browsers automatically add some space that is a margin before and after the element so basically the two commonly used block elements are the P tag which is for the paragraph and the div tag that is used in order to group the content on the HTML now guys let us check this with the help of example now in the VSS code so over here I have defined the title as Block versus inline elements and now what we will do is we will have the P tag over here and and then we will say this is simple paragraph So guys we have written a simple paragraph with the help of a P tag over here now guys let us say we have another tag that is the div tag in this case which is used in order to group the content on the HTML so when we use the Dev tag inside this we will be using some another tag over here so let's say I use another paragraph tag and then we will say this is another paragraph inside div tag so guys basically this div tag is used in order to group the content so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this is a simple paragraph and then we also have this is another paragraph inside div tag if you notice we did not provide the BR tag that is used in order to break the line so basically the browser displayed both these paragraph and the div tag on separate lines over here AO automatically without the user providing any BR tag so that these two elements are separated and guys that is the meaning of this block type element if we go and check in the inspect option as well and when we get the cursor over here on the first P tag the region that is highlighted in blue color that is the main paragraph over here using the P tag and the region that is highlighted with the light orange color that is the margin that is provided automatically by the browser the same thing will be applied to the other P tag over here as well as you can see the one that is inside the div tag now it is being highlighted with the blue color but then we also have the margin at the top and the bottom with the light orange color and that is how the block elements are displayed on the browser now let us see how the inline elements will be displayed so basically an inline element does not start on a new line an inline element only takes up as much width as necessary so basically it will not start with the new line unlike the Block Level Elements which starts with the new line and also it has the ending margin as well and these inline elements will only take as much width as necessary over here we have seen with the block elements that the entire width of the screen is being taken by the P tag and the div tag as well but the inline element will take the width that is necessary in order to display it on the browser so commonly used inline elements are the span tag and the a tag so guys let us check this with the help of example now now guys let us say after this div tag we directly want to provide the span tag over here so when we provide the span tag we will say this is a span tag now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is a span tag is being displayed over here after the div tag so basically this div tag was displayed which is having the paragraph and then we have the span tag over here which is displayed right now so this is on another line that's because we have provided the div tag and it is having its own margin at the bottom right now as you can see being displayed using the light orange color now guys let us say we have another span tag over here after this first span tag so what we will do is we will have another span tag over here and then we will say this is another span tag now guys what we will do is we will also have the full stop over here after the first span tag since the second span tag will also be displayed on the same line so that we can differentiate both of them now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the another span tag that is this is another span tag over here is being displayed on the same line and that is the meaning of the inline element so it continues on the same line wherever it is being displayed in the source code and also it takes as much with as necessary so if we get the cursor over here you can see only the blue part that is this is span tag is being highlighted over here again this is another span tag is being highlighted over here and not the entire width of the screen is being taken unlike what we have seen in the P tag you can see the entire screen withd is being taken and the color is till the end of the screen on the right so guys this is the main difference between the block and the inline element over here we have another element that is the a tag which is used in order to display certain link so if we provide the a tag over here and then we can simply provide this is a hyperlink so guys we also call it as hyperlink since it is used in order to link to another source where we can navigate to we will be checking the a tag in the upcoming videos as well so that you get to learn more about the a tag now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the a tag content is also displayed on the same line since it is the part of the inline element in HTML currently we have not given the href attribute value over here to which we want to navigate to when the user clicks on this link on the web browser so we will be learning more about it in the upcoming video as well but this is the main difference if we see the block elements they are being surrounded by the margins on the top and the bottom and also it takes the width of the entire screen as well but with the inline elements they don't have any top margin or the bottom margin over here and they will take the width that is necessary to be displayed and not the entire width of the screen colors in HTML and we are going to see the background color text color and Border colors as examples so guys basically the HTML colors are specified with the predefined color names or we can also have the RGB values which stands for red green and blue component we also have the hex values as well and other color systems such as hsl rgba or hsla values so guys let us check this now with the help of examples in the vs code the very first thing that we will be checking is how we can set the background color over here so guys over here in the VSS code let's say to the body of this HTML page we want to provide certain background color so we come to the starting tag of the body and then we provide the style attribute and inside the style attribute we have something called as the background color property so this property we are going to use and how we can define the color is by using the color names or we can also use the RGB or the hex values over here so the first example that we are going to see is by using the color names so over here you can see that there are various color Nam that you can use so we will be using the aqua color in this case so guys over here you are just defining the color name you can also provide the red color as well so as you can see red color is being displayed or we can also provide green color so we have the variants of green color such as green or green yellow so in this case we will be using the aqua color as it will look decent as the background color over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see colors in HTML is the title and we can see the background color of the body as the aqua color and this is one of the ways in order to provide the color by using the color names over here we can also adjust the colors as you can see it is showing us the RGB values and this is the RGB value for this particular color now guys let us see another way in order to use the color that is by using the RGB values and we will be using the text color in order to see the example so let's say we have one paragraph over here so we use the P tag and then we will say this is one paragraph on HTML page so guys this is a very simple paragraph that we have written it will be in black color by default so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see this is one paragraph on HTML and it is black in color let's say I want to change the color to some other color by using the RGB values so how we can do that so we come over here on the VSS code and inside the starting pte we again provide the style attribute and then in order to provide the text color we will be using the color property so you can see it sets the color of an element's text so basically in order to change the text color we can use the color property so we use this property and then in order to mention the value of color using the RGB values we can use R GB as you can see it creates a color from red green and blue values so these are the combinations of the red green and blue values over here so if we hover over this you can see that RGB value is 255 and then 0 and 0er which means the full component of red color is being taken over here and the green and the blue components are zero when we hover over this green color it is showing 128 as the green color it is not at the full capacity but we can drag this over here and we can use the 255 component of the green color as well as when hover over the blue color over here so it says 255 of the blue color component and we have 0 component of the red and green colors respectively so guys we can provide the numbers over here in the sequence of red green and blue so let's say I want to display this paragraph in red color so the maximum number that we can provide is 255 the range is from 0 up to 255 and then let's say I want 0% of the green color and 0 % of the blue color so it is a pure red color that we are defining over here in the RGB format so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see red color is being displayed over here let's say we want to add certain component of green color as well to this red color so what we have to do is we come over here in the green component instead of zero let's say I provide 50 in this case so to some extent this color will be updated on the browser browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so we are not able to notice the color change over here that's because the green component is increased slightly what if we provide the value that is 200 over here what happens so as you can see it is updated to yellow color now so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page you can see that it is being displayed as the yellow color now and let's see we provide the 200 of the blue component as well so it has changed to some other color over here right write down so guys this is the way you can play around with the RGB values as well over here for now I will just keep it as red so that it matches with the background color and we can clearly see the text over here inside the paragraph so you can check what are the different colors when you are defining the green and the blue components as well along with the red components in the RGB format of the color now guys let us move to another task let us see how the Border colors can be mentioned and we will be using the hex value in this case so basically in order to provide the border for this paragraph what we will be doing is we will provide the border to this paragraph over here so inside the style we have to provide the Border attribute and it is having certain values the first value is the width of the border so let's say we provide the 2 pixels as the width of the border and then let's say we want the border to be solid you can also have the dotted Borders or the double Borders or the dashed borders as well but for now we will be having the solid bers and then after that we will be mentioning the color now guys how do we mention the hex color so let us check that so over here I have provided hex value of green color on Google so you can see that certain green color values are being displayed over here and you can find multiple websites that will provide you the shades of the different colors based on your requirements in the hex format so over here you can see the hex code and the corresponding RGB code as well so let's say I want to use this particular hex code the red component is zero the green component is 80 and the blue component is zero so let me just copy this and paste this over here so guys basically what is the meaning of this hex code so after this hash character the first two characters will be the red component zero means it is not having any percentage that means it is the 0% of the red color then 80 means to some extent we are having the green color over here the maximum can be 2 * F in this case so basically it ranges from 0 up to F if we see the characters and then over here the last two characters are the blue component again it is ranging from Zer up to F so guys if we provide all zero characters over here it will turn out to be a black color that's because we don't have any of the components of the red green and blue colors and if we provide 6 * F so over here we have 6 * F so all the components are being used over here with 100% of their contribution that is red green and blue and it will turn out to be a white color in this case we will change it back to green color now so let's say we provide 0 0 and then if we use the pure green component we have to provide two * F in between the third and the fourth character and then the last two characters will be 0 0 so it is red green and then blue so guys we have the green color right now as the Border color so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page you can see that the border of this paragraph now is having the two pixels width and it is green in color we can have the color little darker over here so again we will change it back to 80 in this case that we had copied so it will make the Border color as little darker so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we are seeing the dark green color of the border of the paragraph So Guys these are certain ways in order to use the color names or the RGB values or the hex values as well now guys apart from this you can also use the hsl value or the rgba value now a over here stands for Alpha which will Define the opacity of the color to some extent so guys I'll leave this up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own the other color values as well links in HTML that are clickable using the a tag so guys basically links that are also called as hyperlinks in HTML allow users to click their way from one page to another page and basically these HTML links are also called as hyperlinks when we deal with HTML pages so guys basically you can click on a link and jump to another document or a web page and that is how the entire internet is being served to the users and when the users are reading the content of the web pages they have the links to the external websites or the internal web pages as well from where they can get more information so this is one of the useful element when you are going to develop your own web pages you should have the links to the other Pages as well if you want to refer to certain other source in your existing or a new web page so when you move the mouse over a link the mouse Arrow will turn into a little hand so this we are going to check in the example as well and as you can see this is the syntax we have the less than symbol and then we have the a tag so guys basically the a tag is used in order to mention the link on a web page and then we have a very important attribute that is hre over here which will provide you the URL of the page to which the user should go to when the user clicks on this link over here so guys let us check this with the help of example now in the vs code so over here I have set the title as links in HTML and then let's say we have a simple paragraph using the P tag and then we will say this video is created by programming for beginners which is a YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so guys basically we are saying that this video is created by programming for beginners YouTube channel now guys let us say if the user wants to know that where is this programming for beginners YouTube channel how I can access this YouTube channel over here by just seeing this information so we can use the a tag and provide the link to this programming for beginners YouTube channel in this particular statement so guys before doing that let me just save this file now and show you how it looks on the browser so basically right now it is a very simple text and it is in the form of the paragraph and we don't have any link right now where the user can click on this programming for beginners text now guys what we will do is I have already provided the link over here to the YouTube channel and this is the link so I'm going to copy this and what we are going to do is we will be enclosing this programming for beginners in between the starting and the ending a tag so over here we will have the less than symbol and then we will use the a tag over here and then we will close this tag with the greater than symbol and then guys we will also have the ending tag over here after The Beginner's word in this case so we have enclosed the programming for beginners in between the a tag so let me just just save this file now and try reloading this page once again for you on the browser so nothing has happened that's because we have not provided the HF attribute for now to which the user should be redirected to when we click on this programming for beginners text so guys let us do that quickly so over here in the starting a tag we have the space character and then we have something called as hrf attribute as you can see it contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink point to so guys this is the location where we have to provide the URL where the user will be redirected to so over here I'll copy the link of this YouTube channel that user should go to so I'll just copy this and paste it inside the double codes so guys always remember that this is the attribute that is hre and then we have the equal to symbol and then after that since we are specifying the string value we have to provide it in between the double codes over here so let let me just paste this link in this case and now we are having the programming for beginners in between the a that is the anchor tag which is having this particular link so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the programming for beginers text is now being converted to a link and it is being displayed with the blue color which is the default color for the links on the modern browser and then guys when we hover over this link so if you notice the cursor is changed to the hand tool over here so basically it is automatically converted to the hand tool so that user comes to know that this is the link so guys now our aim is achieved so basically whichever user accesses your web page and sees that this video is created by programming for beginners YouTube channel and if he or she wants to know where is this programming for beginners YouTube channel and where they can find it so they can simply come over here to this link and click on this link so what happens when we click on this link so let me just show you that so when I click on this link as you can see the link that we have provided in the HF attribute the user is redirected to that particular link over here and you can see that this is the YouTube channel that I have created for you so that you can learn the various tutorials with the help of the examples and programs so guys this is the way that we can link a particular web page to your existing or the new web page now guys the browsers maintain the history as well so you can simply go back over here you can see the back button on the browser so when you click on this back button you can go back to the original page where you have clicked the link so let me just click over here to the back button so now you can see we have come to the main page over here you can again go forward by using the forward button over here but guys this is the main functionality of the anchor tag that is the a tag in order to provide the links inside the web pages which will refer to other web pages on the internet now guys there are certain other attributes as well to this link so basically the target attribute can be used to tell browser to open page in same or different tab so guys if you must have noticed by default when we click on this link the URL that we have defined in the hre over here it was opened in the same tab over here on the browser now how do we make this link open in the new browser so I'll show you that once again when I click on this link it opens this particular link that we have provided in the hre in the same Tab and we cannot see the original page on the different tab over here so how we can open it in a different tab so when the user clicks on this link the link present in the HF must open in the new tab over here so we can achieve that simply by using the target attribute so over here inside the a tag after HF attribute we can simply provide the target attribute it's spe specifies where to display the linked URL so when we use this it has certain values over here and we are going to use this value that is underscore blank so guys when we use this underscore blank it will tell the browser to open this particular Link in the new tab so let me just show you that so we'll save this file now and try reloading this page once again so that the new changes are implemented over here and now when we click on this link let me just click over here so as you can see it has opened a new tab over here and we can also go back to the source page over here which is on the left hand side so there are two tabs right now on the same browser and this is how we can make the links to open in the new tab over here so you can easily use the target attribute in order to mention where the link needs to be opened now guys you can also use the image as the link using the IMG tag so we are going to learn more about the IMG tag in the upcoming video as well but instead of having the text over here that is programming for beginners we can have the image as well now how we can do that so I'll just remove this text over here so I'll just save this file now and try reloading this page to see what happens so we don't have any text but instead of this text let's say we want to provide certain image over here so I'll quickly provide the IMG tag over here which will help us in order to provide the image on the web page so guys this IMG tag it doesn't have the end tag over over here so only the starting tag and then at the end we can provide the forward slash in this case in order to end that tag over there and then we have a very important attribute that is SRC attribute which is the image URL so we need to provide the URL of the image that we want to use so guys over here we will be using the SRC attribute followed by equal to and then we have the double codes over here now guys I already have certain images in this case which I use as is the thumbnails for the videos that I create for you so let's say I want to use this particular image so we need to provide the entire directory path for this particular image so I have copied the location and we will paste it inside the SRC attribute as the value so guys after providing this value we again have the slash character and then we need to provide the name of this file so it is the name of this image over here so we provide the name of this image so guys let let me just save this file now and try reloading this page for you so as you can see certain image is being displayed but it is not being displayed properly that's because we have not provided the extension of this image so guys the extension of this image is PNG so as you can see it is a DOT PNG format that we are using so over here after this name of the file we will provide PNG in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so guys you can see certain image is being displayed over here but the size of the image is very large so we can also mention the size of this image over here so after providing the SRC attribute we will provide the width so let's say I provide 40 pixels as the width and also we need to provide the height in this case so let's say I provide 30 pixels as the height so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this image is being displayed right now so this is the example where we are having the image as the link so when we come over here this video is created by and then we have certain image now guys it is not making any sense right now since programming for beginers text would be ideal to be displayed but over here I'm just showing you the example of how we can provide the image as the link so simply by coming over here you can see on this image the cursor is changing to a hand tool in this case and when we come over here and click on this link so in the new tab the link that we had provided to the programming for beginners YouTube channel is being opened right now so guys in this way you can provide the image as well as the Link and Link it to another web page as well now guys you can also link to an email address in the HF attribute so instead of opening another web page when you give this particular link this email address will be opened by using the email application it can be Gmail or the Outlook mail as well so using that the email address will be given in the two address when you provide that particular email address in the hrf attribute of the anchor tag so guys this exercise I'll leave up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own another important attribute is the title attribute which can be used to show additional information about the link so guys let us check this with the help of example once again so what we will do is instead of showing this image we will give the text information once again over here so instead of this IMG tag we will say programming for beginners text so we have programming for beginners text let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so instead of the image now we have the text once again which is a link right now that will open the web page in another tab now guys let's say we want to provide certain information so when the user hover over this particular link the user should get the information so what we can do is we can provide the title attribute as well so after this target attribute as you can see this title attribute it contains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to so let us use this and then we will say YouTube channel so we are simply providing this information that is YouTube channel over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so now when the user hover over this particular link you can see YouTube channel is being displayed which is the additional information for the user so that user comes to know that yes this is the name of the YouTube channel and user can then choose whether to click on this or not so guys in this way we can easily use the anchor tag that is the a tag in order to implement the links or hyperlinks in HTML displaying images in HTML using the IMG tag so guys basically the HTML IMG tag is used to embed an image in a web page so we can easily embed the images in our web pages based on our requirements now guys images are not technically inserted into a web page whereas images are simply linked to the web pages so how we can link the images to the web pages we will see that but technically we don't actually insert the image over here on the web page but those images are linked and they are present or they are stored in some another location and we just provide the link to that path where they are stored now guys the IMG tag creates a holding space for the referenced image and that is how the images are displayed now the IMG tag is empty it contains attributes only and does not have a closing tag so basically we are not going to have any content in between the starting and the ending tag and it is going to be a single tag that is the IMG tag along with the forward slash and this forward slash will be optional and there will be no specifically closing tag for this particular IMG tag over here now guys the IMG tag has two required attributes one is the SRC which specifies the path of the image so as I've told you we need to provide the location or the path of the image where the image is stored and then we also have the alt attribute which specifies an alternate text for the image so guys we will check both of these with the help of examples now in the vs code so let's say over here we have a normal paragraph So using the P tag we will say there is an image after this paragraph So guys we have Prov provided a very simple statement inside the paragraph there is an image after this paragraph and then guys we can simply provide the IMG tag in order to display the image so let's say we have the less than symbol and then we use the IMG tag over here you can see an IMG element represents an image so this is the description that is provided by the vs code and then we can close the tag so over here we don't have the specific closing tag we can provide the for/ at the end before the greater than symbol and this is optional in order to mark that this tag is closed for now and then guys what we can do is it doesn't have any content in between the starting and the ending tag so we can only Define the attributes now how do we provide the link to the image so let's say we have certain images over here and we want to display this particular image so these are the thumbnails of the videos that I have created for you on my YouTube channel that is programming for beginners which you should should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so over here we have this image so we will check what is the entire path over here so as you can see we have this entire path over here so I'll just copy this entire path and inside the VSS code we need to use the SRC attribute so guys over here when we type SRC you can see that this is the image URL this attribute is mandatory for the IMG element because we Define like where is this image coming from in the SRC attribute so over here we are going to use this SRC attribute followed by equal to character and then we have the double codes now guys inside the double codes we are going to provide the entire directory path where the image is present so over here we have pasted the directory path and then after this we again have a back slash character and then guys we need to provide the name of the file as well so as you can see this is the name of the file so I'll just copy this and paste it over here so we have pasted this and guys another important thing is after the name of the file we need to provide the extension of the file as well so some extensions can be PNG and then others can be jpg or any other format that you are using for that particular image so in this case it is a PNG file so we are going to provide a PNG in the end after the name of the file over here that is the image so guys this is the source attribute that we have defined now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting there is an image after this paragraph and this image it seems to be very large that's because increased the zoom factor of this browser what if I get the zoom factor to 100% so guys this is the way that the image is being displayed over here but I'll change this Zoom to 150% so that you can clearly see what are the contents of this web page now guys we want to display this image little bit smaller so that it looks decent over here so what we will do is we can also use the width and height attributes of this image so we can get the cursor on the other line and then we can again have the width attribute so guys inside the width attribute we can say display only 40% of this image so we will say 40% of width and let's say height we want to display only 25% so guys after providing the width and height attributes as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see now we can properly see the image that is being displayed over here on the web page so basically it is taking only the 40% of the entire width of the screen and height is being taken as the 25% of the height of the screen and that is how it is being displayed over here if we change the width to 50% so basically the image will take the 50% width of the entire screen so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the right hand side side of the image is coming at the exact middle of this screen right now and guys that is how we can mention the width and height of the image we can also use pixels as well so let's say we provide 100 pixels for the width and then for height let's say we provide 70 pixels in this case so we provide 70 PX note that there is no space character after these numbers and in between the PX keyword so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the image is being adjusted now based on the numbers of the width and height that we have specified guys we will change it back to the 40% and 25% over here since that was looking more decent so after changing let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the image is being displayed properly now now guys there is another important attribute that is the alt attribute that you must specify now it specifies the alternate text for the image in some cases what happens is let's say if the image is not present in this particular directory that you have mentioned or if you are using the URL then let's say if the URL is down for some time then that particular image will not be displayed properly on the web page now how it will be displayed let me just show you so what if we just remove the extension of this file that is PNG we have removed and let us see how the image will be displayed on the web page now so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the image is not being displayed right now now so guys when this particular thing happens it becomes very important that we have the alt attribute so that some kind of text is being displayed when this condition occurs so we can come to vs code and then over here after the height attribute we can provide the alt attribute as well as you can see this attribute defines an alternative text description of the image so we will use this alt attribute and over here we will say image displayed for test purpose so guys over here we are simply providing a text message that is image displayed for test purpose you can have any other string based on your requirements when such conditions occur now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page to see what happens so as you can see even though image is not being displayed but it is saying image displayed for test purpose you can provide any other exception message or the error message that you want based on your requirements and that is how it is going to work by providing the alt attribute for the image tag it is going to provide certain text message in case there is some issue to display the image over here now guys let me just provide the extension over here once again so we will provide PNG and see how it appears along with the alt attribute content over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see since now the image is being displayed there is no alt attribute content or the message that is being displayed right now but guys behind the scenes it will be present so let me just right click over here and use the inspect option in this case so it will open the elements tab over here so if you see there is a alt attribute that is image displayed for test purpose so basically you can see the source code over here for whatever HTML code that is written behind the scenes in order to display this particular web page so Guys these are certain attributes that you can use that is SRC attribute and and then we have the alt attribute as well along with this we have also seen how to mention the width and the height of the images that you want to display now we will see how we can display the background images in HTML with the help of examples so guys a background image can be specified for almost any HTML element in this video we are going to see how we can display the background image for the body tag that is for the entire page the background image will be displayed now to add the background image on an HTML element we can use the HTML style attribute and the CSS property that is the background image property so guys let us check this with the help of example now in the VSS code so previously we had seen how we can use the IMG tag in order to display a simple image on the HTML page as you can see this was the image that we had displayed so we will remove these lines of code over here for now and then what we will do is we will change the title to background image so we have background image in HTML and guys simply what we can do is in this body tag we can have the style attribute over here so we say style and then inside the style attribute we have the property that is the background image so we type background image over here as you can see vs code is resting us this background image property it sets the background image of an element so guys basically we are setting this background image for the body tag we can also set set it for the paragraph tag or the div tag or any other tag based on your requirements now guys after this property we have a colon over here and then we have something called as URL so guys this is used in order to refer an image file by a URL so we are going to use this URL as a prefix and inside the open and close parenthesis we are going to have the single codes over here and inside the single codes we are going to provide the name of the image file which is going to be the background image so guys for Simplicity purpose I have taken a sample image over here as you can see in the same folder where we are having our HTML document over here so guys we are going to use the same sample image in our code as well so we are going to say sample image. PNG guys it is very important that you also provide the extension of the image file so that it is displayed properly over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the background image in HTML being displayed as the title of this page and guys this image is being set as the background image over here now if you notice that the image is very big as far as the screen size is concerned so guys we have certain properties over here the first property is background image which we have already used in order to set the background image the second property is background size over here which we can use in order to increase or decrease the size of the image that is being displayed as the background image so guys what we can do is inside the style attribute only after the semicolon we can have the background size over here so when we say background size in this case as you can see this is the property that we have to use so guys using this we can use any of the values in order to set the size of the image so when we say cover as the value for the background size over here the entire screen will be covered with the image that is being set by the background image so let us check that let me just save this file now and and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the width and the height of this particular image is set to the entire body of this HTML page over here now guys we can change the size to the 50% as well so that it only takes the 50% width of this screen so let me just change that value from cover to 50% over here so guys we can give the values in percentages as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see only 50% of the image is being taken over here and being displayed as the background image now guys by default what happens is if the image size is smaller than the HTML element then the image will be repeated and that is what we can see over here that this is the first image and then on the right we have the image once again repeating and then below as well the images are being repeated over here so guys that brings us to the third property that is background repeat which can help us in order to avoid the repeat repeating of the background images so let me just go to the code over here once again now guys when we use the background repeat over here the attributes might go out of the screen so what we can do is simply we can Define the style in the head section as well so instead of defining the style in the body tag we will come over here after the title and then we will say style tag over here and then guys for this body tag we are going to Define all these attributes once again so over here we need to provide body so this is the internal CSS that we are going to see till now we have seen the inline CSS wherein the attributes were defined inside the starting tags but over here when we Define the style tag inside the head tag we call it as the internal CSS so guys over here we need to provide the tag to which we need to provide certain styling and then after that tag we need to have the attributes inside the open and close curly braces as you can see we have provided body that is the tag name and then we are going to provide these attributes along with their values so I'm going to Simply cut this and paste this over here that is the background image and then again we will also have the background size as well I'll just remove this and paste this over here so guys this is looking more decent compared to the inline CSS that we were defining inside the body start tag over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser to see if there are no more changes so as you can see there is no change over here after defining the internal CSS and in this way we can easily Define the internal CSS that is inside the head tag over here we can Define the style tag and for this tag name inside the open and close curly braces we can have the different attributes of The Styling that we want to Define now guys we will check the third attribute that is background repeat in order to avoid the repetion of these background images so over here we need to define the background rep repeat in this case so as you can see this is the property that is background repeat and then we will say no repeat in this case you can see this is the value that we have to use that is no repeat so when we set the value as no repeat the repetion will be avoided so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see only one image is being displayed now and there is no repetion even though when the size of this particular image is smaller than the size of the entire body tag over here on the HTML page now guys let us move to another property over here we have something called as background attachment as well so guys this we can use along with the background size so when the background size of the image is set as cover so let us change that so over here we can change it to cover in this case and then we can use the background attachment property so in this case we can use the background attachment property and make it as fixed so that the image is fixed over here even if you you are scrolling the content of the page in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the image is covering the entire body of the HTML page and whenever you are going to scroll the content on this particular page the image will be fixed over here and it will not scroll and if you want the image to be scrolled then we can use the scroll value in this case for the background attachment so guys this is the meaning of the background attachment over here so quickly let us see the example of how this fixed and scroll values for the background attachment will work what we will do is we will have the simple paragraphs over here so we are defining the P tag and then we will say this is a paragraph So guys we are saying this is a paragraph and let us say we want to increase the size of this paragraph so we will have another P tag over here inside the style tag and then we will have the open and close curly braces and we will say font size in this case so font size we will say 30 pixels and then let's say I want to define the background color as well so we will say background color and let's say we have the color that is red in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see we have this is a paragraph over here being displayed along with the red background color if you can notice now guys similarly what we will do is we will simply copy and paste this line of code multiple number of times so that the page is scrollable over here so we have this many number of paragraphs in this case on this HTML page let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see we have more paragraphs and when we scroll you can see that the image is also getting scrolled over here so guys behind the scenes we also have the image in this case so what happens when we change the value from scroll to fixed over here currently we have the value of background attachment as scroll and when we change it to fixed let us see what happens let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the image is being fixed as the background image and now when we scroll only the content that the paragraphs are getting scrolled over here and the image is fixed in this case so guys if you want to keep the background images fixed over here like how we have done right now so you can change the background attachment property to fixed in this case and you can change it to scroll as well if you want the background image to scroll when the user Scrolls to check the content of the HTML page so guys this is the way that we can set the background image for the HTML page and along with that we have certain attributes as well that we have seen so now we will see how we can display favicon in HTML on the browser tab so guys basically a favicon is a small image that is displayed next to the page title in the browser tab so if I show you over here on the browser tab as you can see this title that is favicon in HTML before that on the left hand side we have a icon which is a globe by default over here when there is no favicon that is provided to the HTML page so guys we are going to see how we can provide the favicon so that an appropriate image can be displayed over here besides the title of the page so basically a favicon is a small image that is displayed next to the page title now guys we can easily add favicon in HTML using the link tag which we have to specify under the head tag over here so when we come to the vs code in this case what we have to do is under the head tag after the title we can have the link tag over here so when we have the link tag you can see that by default we are having the value of the Rial attribute as a stylesheet over here we need to change it to icon in this case so we type icon over here and then for the href attribute we need to provide the path of the small image which we want to set it as a favicon for that particular HTML page so guys I have a small image over here that is the favicon image in the jpg format let me just open this image for you so this is the image that we are going to set which is also set as the profile picture for this YouTube channel that is programming for bers which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so guys basically we are going to set this image as the favicon for this particular HTML page so we simply come over here on the VSS code and then we give the name of this favicon image that is favicon do jpg so in this case we say favicon jpg as you can see vs code is suggesting us this particular file name that's because we have provided it inside the path where this particular HTML page is present so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again over here so when we click on reload you can see that this image has been changed to the image that I have just showed you and this is the small image that is being displayed right now over here so basically it is the favicon image that is being displayed besides the title of this page that is favicon in HTML and guys now we can change the content of this page we can now say that this HTML page is having a favicon over here so basically we have set the favicon for this particular page and guys this favicon image must be present on all the pages that are present on your web servers and whichever page opens with your particular domain it will be present by default over here when the title of this page will be displayed to the user guys it basically shows the identity of your website so that users come to know that this is the website that they are referring to which they have been using more frequently so now we will see how we can display tables in HTML with the help of examples so guys HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns and we are going to check this with the help of examples as well in the VSS code so so guys it is very important for you to understand what are the different tags that you can use in order to display your tables in the form of rows and columns so basically we have the very first tag that is the main tag which is called as table over here so again we have the less than symbol and then we have the table keyword and then greater than symbol and this is the start tag we also have the corresponding and tag for this table inside which all the content of the table will be defined and and then guys inside the table first of all we are going to define the rows which can be defined using the TR tag over here so TR stands for table Row in this case and it defines a horizontal row in a table and then next we have the table header so in case your requirement is to display the headers in the table you can use the th tag which stands for table header over here which defines the header for the table in this case and then guys we also have something called as TD which refers to the table data over here so TD tag helps us to define the content or data in one cell of a table so guys when we talk about HTML table over here it is similar to Microsoft Excel so if you have used Ms xcl anytime you must have noticed that we have multiple cells over here in Excel and this can be treated as one table over here so we can have the header in this case so let's say we have the number over here as the header and their string representation so guys this is nothing but these are the headers that are defining what will be the content of these particular columns over here so we can have them in the Bold formatting so we apply the Bold formatting over here and we can make them display at the middle of the cells and then guys what we can have is we can have the numbers over here so we have 1 2 3 4 5 and the string representations say 1 2 3 4 and then we have five so guys this is nothing but this is a table over here and this is what we are going to see in the HTML as well we are going to Define this as a table and these are the rows so as you can see this is one row over here then this is second row then this is third row and so on these are the rows and these are the columns so guys this row is being defined by the TR tag and the data inside each cell is being defined by the T CD tag over here which stands for the table data and guys this header is being defined by the th tag which is the table header over here and outside all these tags we also have the main tag that is the table tag in order to define the entire table so guys with this knowledge let us move to the vs code now over here in order to create the table so first of all we will have a simple paragraph and then we will say below content is defined in a table so guys we have a very simple paragraph that is this below content is defined in a table and now on the next line we are going to define the table over here so when we type table as you can see VSS code is suggesting us this particular tag and when we press enter you can see that we have the starting tag and the ending tag so guys this is the shorthand format we can simply type the name of the tag and press enter in order to get the starting and the ending tag in the HTML now in between the starting and the ending tag what we need to Define is first of all we are going to Define this row which is going to have the table header so guys over here we will have the TR tag so when we type TR over here and press enter as you can see TR starting and the ending tag is being displayed over here and then inside the TR tag we will have the th tag over here since these are the headers that we want to Define so we have the th tag and when we press enter as you can see the starting and the ending tags are being displayed now we can simply have number which is the text for this header tag over here and then guys we are going to have another tag so again we are going to type th and then we will say string representation so guys as you can see inside the table starting and the ending tag first of all we have one row so inside this row we are having the two headers that is numbers and string representation we can also have one header over here or two headers or any number of headers based on your requirements that you want to Define so guys over here we are only taking two columns in this case so based on your requirements you can either increase or decrease the number of rows and columns in the HTML table now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page to see how the table appears over here so when we reload this page as you can see we have the numbers header and the string representation as the header which is being displayed with the Bold formatting over here now guys let us Define certain data as we have seen over here how we have defined the data in the Excel similarly we will Define the data in the HTML as well so again we are going to have another row over here so guys basically this is the first row as you can see now we need to come on the next line that is after this first row we are going to define the second row over here and inside that as well we are going to have two columns with this particular data that is one and o1 so guys we come over here to the vs code we again say TR in this case and this time we will use TD that's because it is not the header that we want to Define now we want to define the data inside a particular cell of the table so guys we use the table data that is the TD tag in this case so we use TD over here and then we simply provide one that is the number one over here and what is the String representation it is o1 so again we Define another TD in this case and then we say one over here now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see another row has been added inside the table and it says one and then one over here now guys similarly let us add remaining data that is 2 3 4 and five numbers in this case so let us move to the vs code simply I will copy this TR data which is having the row with the first number in this case so I'm copying this and we will paste it four times over here in order to cover the remaining numbers so guys over here we will change two and then string representation will be two and then over here we will have three and then again we have the three word and then we have four and then the string representation that is four and then over here we have five and then again we have the string representation that is five so guys basically we have defined multiple rows over here and inside each row we are having the table data that is the TD tag and inside the TD tag we are having the actual data that needs to be displayed inside the cells of the table now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so as you can see all the data is being displayed now in the tabular format so guys you can see under the headers that is numbers over here all the numbers are getting displayed in the left aligned format and in the string representation as well all the string representations of the numbers are getting displayed in the left aligned format so guys this is the main purpose of using the table that is it allows the web developers to arrange the data into rows and columns guys we can also use the border for this table so that it actually looks like a table for you so what we can do is we come over here to the vs code and then inside the head tag we can simply provide the style tag over here and for this style tag we can say table in this case and let's say for this table tag we need to provide the border the Border will be of one pixel size and it will be of the solid type and then let's say we want to give the color as black in this case so guys this is one of the ways in order to define the Border along with the width of the Border then this is the Border style like what type of Border we want to display and then this is the color of the border so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got a border now to the table guys we can also have the border to this table data in the table as well over here so we can include the th and TD tags over here to the same styling in this case that's because we want the styling to be common so guys after table we can provide comma and then we can also provide th comma TD tags over here so guys this particular styling will be applied to all these Texs that we have defined over here in the HTML body so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see it is being displayed Now using the borders over here here all the celles are having their own borders guys also we can align the text to the right in this case by default it is on left so what we can do is we can simply come over here and we say text align in this case so this is the property that can be used in order to align the text and we say write as the value so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the content of the entire table is being displayed on the right now so guys this is the very basic way in in order to display the table content inside the HTML so to summarize we need to have the main tag that is the table tag and then inside that individually we need to define the rows of the table the first row can be a header if you want to define the header and if you don't have any headers you can start with the TD tags as well the only difference between the TD that is the table data and the th that is the table header tag is that the content in the th tags will be displayed with the Bold formatting over here as you can see whereas the content with the TD tag will be displayed normally without the Bold formatting but you can apply the formatting based on your requirements to the TD tag as well using the internal or the external stylesheets guys apart from this you can also have the table cell that can contain all sorts of HTML elements that is it can have text which we have seen just now with the help of examples instead of text you can also have the images list links and other table as well so guys you can check out the images in the links as the content of the table data and this activity I'll leave up to you as a homework for you so now we will see table borders in HTML so guys the HTML tables can also have the borders of different styles and shapes and we are going to check this with the help of examples now in the vs code and we are going to see these CSS properties that is the Border property then we also have the Border collapse then background color then we have border radius style and then color so guys let us move to the vs code over here so previously we had defined an HTML table that is having the numbers and their string representation and this is how it looks right now over here so guys we had added the borders as well but without the borders how does it look let us remove the styling over here from the HTML code so when we remove the style from the HTML code let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so guys this is the very simple table that we had written previously without any borders and without any distinctions between the rows and the columns now guys let us add certain borders over here so what we can do is simply we have to come in the vs code so as you can see we have the table tag then we also have the TR tag th tag and TD tags so guys basically to these tags we are going to add the border so over here inside the head section we are going to define the style tag and over here we are going to apply B orders to the table tag and Then followed by comma we also have the th tag over here and then followed by comma we will also apply for the TD tag as well so guys whenever you are going to apply the common styling to multiple tags you can Define them on a single line separated by commas over here and inside the open and close curly braces we can have the styling that can be applied to the content of these tags over here so guys what we have to do is we are going to first Define the Border in this case and let's say we want to define the Border width as 1 PX and Then followed by the style that is the Border style it will be solid and Then followed by the color that is let's say we want the color of the border to be black over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see all the cells that is the headers and then we also have the table data and then we also have the main table that is having the borders over here now guys there are double bord orders so we also have the border for the table cells over here and then again we are having the border for the outer table as well so what we can do is we can use the Border collapse property in this case so when we use the Border collapse property we are telling the browser to collapse these borders and display it only as a one border so let us use the Border collapse property as well so we come over here we say border collapse in this case and we use the collapse value for the Border collapse property let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so if you notice there are no double borders right now and there is only single border to the outer table that is the main table and also to the individual cells as well that we can see as the table data over here now guys let us provide certain padding as well to the entire content of the table so what we can do is we can provide the padding in this case so padding property and after colon let's say we provide two pixels over here as the padding let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so now we can see the spacing between the content of the table and the borders as well let us change the padding to five pixels so that we can clearly see the spaces in between the content on the border let me just reload this page once again so now the HTML table is looking little bit decent over here with the padding that we have already applied now guys let us move to another property over here we also have something called as background color for the table data so guys what we will do is let's say we want to provide the background color to the even rows that is the second row over here then we have the fourth row and the sixth Row in this case so what we can do is simply we have to come over here we will be defining the TR tag in this case but guys over here we only want the even rows to be having the background color so we provide colon and then we have something called as nth child over here so when we type nth you can see this particular suggestion from the vs code which we are going to use so guys it is n hyphen child over here and inside the open and close parenthesis we are going to provide the word that is even so guys basically this is nothing but this is the TR tag that we have defined over here to which The Styling needs to be implemented and this is the end the child meaning we are selecting that which TR Tex will be having this particular styling so inside this open and close curly braces we are going to have the background color over here guys no need to worry about the nth child over here for now we are going to learn more about it when we are going to see the CSS tutorial as well so please make sure that you subscribe to this YouTube channel that is programming for beginners because we are going to learn a lot about the HTML and the upcoming CSS tutorial as well and again much more knowledge as far as web development is concerned so guys over here simply the meaning of this is we are going to apply the background color to the even rows over here and what is the color that we want to apply let's say we want the aqua color to be applied so we are going to give this color name let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so as you can see the even rows are now getting this particular background color similarly we can also have the odd rows as well so when we change this even to odd in this case so the odd rows will be having the background color as Aqua so let me just just reload this page once again so as you can see the odd rows are now having the aqua background color so guys in this way you can easily apply the background color to the table content over here now guys let us move to another property we have something called as border radius as well so let us apply that so we will apply the Border radius to this table and th and then TD tags as well so when we say border radius in this case we need to apply certain value for for that radius so let's say we provide 10 pixels as the Border radius in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again to see what happens so as you can see the Border radius is now getting displayed over here and the color that we had applied is now showing the Border radius let us remove the Border collapse in this case so that we can clearly see the Border radius over here so when we remove this save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have the Border radius now and the borders are having certain kind of radius in this case both the entire table as well as the th and the TD tags are having the Border radius now let us move to another attribute we have something called as border style as well so guys we have already provided the Border style value over here that is the solid value in this case so basically the first value that we provide to this shorthand method that is the border is the Border width over here followed by the border style and Then followed by the Border color so guys individually you can have all these values as the Border width then border style and the Border color or you can have the Shand method that we have used that is border attribute along with that you can provide all the three values over here so guys basically this border style is having multiple values we can also have the dotted border as well so when we type dotted in this case so instead of the solid border we will be having the dotted borders so let me just save this file now and and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the borders are dotted for now and this is the way that we can have the Border style being implemented let us change the value to dashed over here so we can have the dashed borders as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page one again so as you can see the borders are having the Border styl as dashed let us move to another attribute over here we also have something called as border color in this case so guys the Border color is also provided over here that is the black color let us change the Border color to Red in this case so when we type red color name let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the Border color is changed to Red let me just change the Border style to solid in this case so when we change it to solid let me just save this file reload this page as you can see we are having the solid border over here with the red color so Guys these are certain properties for the borders that we can apply to the table and based on your requirements you can display the HTML table over here on the page so so now we will see how we can set the table size in HTML using the width and the height attributes so guys basically the HTML tables can have the different sizes for each column row or the entire table and that is what we are going to see with the help of examples we will first set the table width and then we will also see the table header width and then we will see the table row height so guys let us move to the vs code over here and this is the table that we had defined previously along with this particular internal CSS code as well and this is how the table is being displayed right now on the web page now guys let us say we want the entire table width to be displayed as the 100% of this page which means the width of the table will be same as the width of this device screen over here so what we can do is simply for the table tag we need to define the with attribute so guys over here we need to define the table once again because this particular CSS will only apply to the table tag and no other tag so basically th and TD tags will not have this particular width for now and that is why we are having another table tag over here inside the internal CSS code so guys over here we simply have the width attribute and then we will say 100% so this will make the table width extend to the device screen width so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the width of the table is being extended to the width of the screen right now now guys let me just add another column over here to make the table look more decent on the HTML page so what we will do is we will add another column over here so we have the header and then we say another column and then we will Define certain table data as well for the third column over here so we will say this is first number so guys basically we are just describing what the content of these particular rows are so we will say this is second number and so on up to the fifth number we are going to define the new tags over here so guys we have defined the content of the third column as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see now we are having three columns the First Column is the numbers then we have the string representing and we have another column which is having the description of all these rows over here now guys we can also change the width to another perc in this case so basically instead of having the 100% width over here we can also say to have 60% width of the device screen so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so this is the 60% width over here and this is how we can change the size of the table now guys we can also have the table header width so guys basically let's let's say if you want the width of this particular header to be more compared to the width of the other headers so we can do that as well so what we have to do is let's say we provide 100% over here as the width of the table let me just reload this page once again to see the changes so over here we are having the 100% width of the table now guys what we will do is we will come over here and it is a third header that is another column so we will change the content to description over here to be more precise so let me just save this file now so over here the description is the header for which we want the width to be 50% So currently it is not 50% because it is not starting at the middle over here so what we can do is simply we can come to the th tag for the description header over here and then inside the th tag we will have the style attribute and this style attribute will have the width property in this case and we will say 50% should be taken by this particular header over here and all the values that are present inside this header so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again as you can see now the description column is taking the 50% of the entire 100% of the table and guys this is the way that we can provide the width of a particular column as well inside the TH or the TD tag as well inside which the data is being defined guys it is important to note that we have provided the style attribute just to this this particular header that is the th tag of this particular row that is the first row so using the width of this th data over here the other TD datas that are present in the third column will also have the same width over here this cell is having 50% so all the cells under this particular column will also have the width as 50% now guys let us see how we can change the height of a particular row so let's say we want this row that is the row having the number two over here to extend it height so what we can do is we can come over here to this row that is having the number two in this case we provide the style attribute so we say style and then inside this we can provide the height property and then guys let's say we have 150 pixels as the value for this particular height property inside the style attribute so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see for this row that is having the number two the height has been increased to 150 pixels over here and that is how we can set the height of a particular row inside the table so guys this is the way that we can change the size of the table as you can see by using the internal CSS and then we have also seen how we can change the width of a particular header which will be followed by the other data that is present inside the same column and then we have also seen how we can change the height of a particular table Row in this case and this is this is how the table is being displayed on the HTML page right now after all the changes so now we will see table headers in HTML that is horizontal and vertical table headers so guys basically HTML tables can have headers for each column or row or for many columns or rows So based on your requirements we can have the headers in each column or in each row or in multiple columns and rows which we are going to see with the help of examples as well so guys the very first thing that we are are going to see is the horizontal headers which means the headers are present in the first row of the table so guys let us move to the VSS code now over here and first of all we will Define a paragraph and we will say below content is in HTML table so guys we have defined a very simple paragraph over here having this particular statement now guys we will Define a table so we will say table in this case and we have the starting and the ending tag of the table and now guys inside this table we are going to have the first row by using the TR tag that is the table row and in this first row we are going to have all the headers that we want to Define so guys we will be using the th that is the table header tag and in this case let's say we want to define the details of certain players so we say first name and then we copy paste the header and then we will say last name over here and then we will say age so again we will copy paste another header over here and we will say age in this case so guys basically we have defined three headers over here by using the th tags in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see below content is in HTML table this is the paragraph that we have defined and this is the first row of the table which is having the Bold formatting of the text now guys let us Define the table data in this case by using the TD tags so over here once again we will have another row in this case so in this row we will be defining the details of the first player so we will have the TD tag and then let's say we have Cristiano Ronaldo as the first player so we will have the TD tag in this case and then again we will have the table data tag for the last name as well so we will say Ronaldo in this case and let's say for the age we have once again another TD tag and currently his age is 38 years so we will say 38 years in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got the first name that is Christiano under the first name header and then we have last name header under which we have Ronaldo as the last name and then age as well that is 38 years in this case so guys basically this is the example of the horizontal header that we have defined for now in which case the headers are present on the first row of the table now guys let's say we want to Define another players data over here that is Leonel Messi so we will simply have to copy this TR tag in this case and then paste it after the first record in this case over here so we will say Leonel Messi so last name over here we have Messi in this case and then his age is 36 years currently so basically we have defined the details of this player as well that is the second player let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this this is the second player that is Leonel Messi and his age is 36 years so guys basically this is the perfect example of the horizontal headers that we have defined for now we can also have the borders so quickly we will Define the style tag as well inside the head tag so over here we will say style and then we will give borders to table as well as the th and the TD tags so over here we will say th and TD tags and then we can simply say Border in this case and we will say 2 pixels width for that border and then it should be a solid border with a color that is black so guys let me just save this file now this particular CSS property will apply to the table then we have the table header and the table data tags over here so guys let us reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see the Border has been applied but over here we have the multiple borders in this case so we can simply have the table tag over here here and then we can have the property that is border collapse in this case and we can have the value as collapse so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the perfect border for all the TD th and the table tags over here so guys this is the example of the horizontal headers that we have seen now let us see the same example with the vertical headers as well which means the first name last name and the age headers should come on the left hand side over here in the first column so how should we create the table for that so guys over here what we will do is again we will create another table so first of all we will have a paragraph and we will say below is another table and then after this paragraph We Will Define the table tag over here now guys inside this table tag what we have to do is we need to provide the first TR now this TR will have the first element as the th tag which is the header tag over here and this time it will be first first name in this case now guys the second and the third element inside the first row over here should be the TD tags that will Define the first names that is Cristiano and Leonel so guys over here what we have to do is we need to provide the table data tag and then we will say Christiano that is the value of the first name for the first player and then again we will have the TD tag for the value of the first name of the second player so over here we will say Leon so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the first name we have defined in the leftmost column over here and this particular row is only having the first name in this case similarly we will have the last name and age as well in the second and the third rows over here so guys let me just copy and paste this TR that is the table row that we have defined over here two times and then in this case we will have last name and we will change the value to Ronaldo over here and this leonal will be changed to Messi in this case and then again in the third row we will have age as the vertical header and then over here we will have 38 years for Ronaldo and 36 years for Messi so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the example of the vertical headers that we have defined which can be displayed in the First Column over here and the first name we can see we have Cristiano then we have the last name as Ronaldo and his age is 38 years similarly for player two we have Leonel Messi and 36 years as first name last name and age respectively so guys this table is having the horizontal headers whereas this table is having the vertical headers in this case now guys let us move to another task over here we can also have the header alignment so basically to the th text we can provide the text align property so if you know notice the headers are aligned in the center for now by default so what we can do is we can align them on the left hand side so what we can do is over here in the style tag we can create another tag that is th and then this should have the text align as left so over here we will say text align and the value can be left in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page if you notice the headers are at the center right now it should move to left over here so when we reload the this as you can see this is aligned to the left and also all these table headers are aligned to left and in this way you can set the text align property of any of the table headers or the table data elements now guys let us move to another task we can also have the call span to merge headers over here so guys basically what this means is let's say we only want to define the single header that is name over here instead of first name and last name but we want the values to be in different columns over over here so what we can do is we can merge these two columns in this case that is first name and last name can be removed and we can have a common name that is name as the name of the column so what we can do is we can have the call span attribute over here so guys basically these are the two headers that we want to transform into a single header so I'll just remove these lines of code over here and we will simply have one th tag and the label of this particular header is name in this case but guys this particular name should Span in two columns over here so that we come to know that these two columns are having the names of the players so guys what we can do is over here inside the starting th tag we have to provide the call span attribute so over here we can simply say call span and then we can say two in this case that's because the two cells needs to be merged together and we need to have the label as name over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the first name and last name were replaced now with this particular label that is nam which is a single label and it is occupying the space for these two cells over here we can have the text align as Center in this case so that the label is displayed properly and we come to know that both these cells are having the first name and last name of the players so simply we have to come over here in the style and for the text align property we can say Center value so let me just say this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see name is being aligned at the center now so guys this is the importance of the call span attribute it helps us in order to merge the multiple cells in the table now guys let us move to another task over here we have something called as table caption which is the details of the table that we want to show on the HTML page so we can use the caption tag immediately after table opening tag so guys over here we don't have any any other details for these tables apart from the paragraph that we have just defined so what we can do is we can also have the caption tag after the table tag over here in order to Define what exactly is present inside the HTML table that we have defined so guys over here after the table tag and before the first row in this case we will simply have the caption tag over here so when we say caption we need to provide certain text over here so let's say we provide player details in this case so guys basically this particular information should be present for this particular table just above this table so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see player details is being displayed now on top of the table that we had defined now guys similarly we can have the caption for the second table as well so what we can do is simply we have to come over here in the second table and after this table tag and before the first table we can have the caption tag over here and then we can say player details part two so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the table caption that is being displayed just before the table which is being displayed on the browser so Guys these are some of the ways in order to define the table headers whether you want to define the horizontal table header or the vertical table header based on your requirements okay so now we will see table padding and spacing in HTML so guys HTML tables can adjust the padding inside the cells and also the space between the cells so we are going to check what is the difference between badding and spacing in HTML tables with the help of examples as well so basically a cell padding is the space between the cell edges and the cell content which means the data that we have defined and the border that is present for that particular table cell the space in between these two ele ments is called cell padding and by default the padding is set to zero so we can use the padding CSS property in this case so guys let us move to the vs code over here we already have a table which is being defined in this case which is having three rows over here the first row is having all the headers that is the first name last name and the age of the players that we want to Define and then the second row is having the player details in this case so as you can see we have the first name and the last name as Cristiano Ronaldo and his age is 38 years and the second player that is Leonel Messi and his age is defined as 36 years so these are the two records that we have displayed in the form of the HTML table so if I show you this is the table that is being defined over here now guys let us provide certain borders over here in order to understand what is the difference between padding and spacing and how we can apply them in the HTML table so guys over here what we have to do is inside the style tag we will use the text that is table and we will also have the header and we will also say table data all these Texs must have the border of one pixel in this case so we will say border which is having the width as 1 pixel and the Border type is solid in this case and we will say the Border color is black color in this case so guys this is the shorthand method in order to define the border of the table in HTML now guys let me just say this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see a one pixel border is applied to all the elements that is the entire table element over here and then in between you can see that the table header and the TD that is the table data which is having the player details are also having the borders over here we can have the Border collapse property for the entire table as well so that the border is displayed only once instead of these double lines in this case so guys over here we will have the table tag and they should have the Border collapse property in this case and the value should be collapse in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser what is the importance of this border collapse property so guys over here you can see multiple lines in this case that is for each individual cell over here but when we reload this page once again you can see only one single border for all the cells and that is the importance of this border collapse that is being applied to the entire table over here now guys if you notice there is not much space in between the content that is let's say if we consider this Ronaldo as the last name over here we cannot see much space in between this particular content and the border that is surrounding this last name over here so what we can do is we can provide the padding property and provide certain space so that it looks good inside the table cell so guys over here where we have applied the Border we can simply come over over here and provide the padding property and the padding that we want to provide is let's say we want to provide 10 pixels as the padding from all the sides so guys basically you can also Define padding at each individual sides that is left top bottom and right but you can also use the padding property in order to apply the same value from all the four sides so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see now we have some space in between the content and the borders that is surrounding the content over here so all the cells in this table is having 10 pixels of padding in this case so guys this is the meaning of the padding property over here that we have just seen now guys what is the meaning of cell spacing so basically cell spacing is the space between each cell by default the space is set to two pixels use border spacing CSS property in order to define the cell spacing so guys we have already seen that that by default the two pixels of spacing is present between all the cells so to understand it more clearly we have to remove the Border collapse property from the table so that multiple borders are being displayed once again so I'll just remove these lines of code over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have got the multiple borders once again for each and every cell over here now guys you can see that there is certain spacing in between the border that is covering the table data over here so this space is 2 pixels by default so we can increase or decrease it so we can remove it by using the Border collapse property or we can increase it by using the Border spacing property so guys let us use that as well so over here what we have to do is again we have to come over here and then we will say border spacing in this case and then let's say we want to provide 10 pixels of the Border spacing in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see all the cells now are having the 10 pixels of Border spacing in between them so guys this is the space in between the borders that is covering the table data content over here inside the HTML table and that is the meaning of this particular cell spacing over here so guys both these CSS properties that is padding and spacing are important as far as HTML tables are concerned So based on your requirements you can design your own tables and whatever padding and spacing is required you can Implement them by using these CSS properties so so guys HTML tables can have cells that span over multiple rows and columns so basically what is the meaning of a call span so it is the attribute that helps us to make a cell span over multiple columns and we use the call span attribute and similarly we also have the row Span in order to make a cell's pen over multiple rows we use the rows pen attribute over here so guys in in order to understand both these attributes we are going to create these two tables that is the first table is having the horizontal header over here and then we are having the data in the table and the second table is having the vertical table headers over here and this is the table data that we are going to Define and then guys what we can do is the first name and last name can be combined over here so basically in Microsoft Excel what we do is we click over here on the merge and center so when we do do this basically we are going to label it as name in this case and this is how we are going to combine the two cells in the HTML table as well and similarly we are going to combine these two rows over here in this case by using the rows pen so guys the first scenario will be done by using the call span over here and in the second table we can merge these two rows by using the row pan in this case so guys let us move to the vs code now over here and let us Define the first table that is having the the horizontal table headers so guys the first row is having the table headers in this case so we will have the header that is the first name over here and then we have last name and then age so in this case we will say last name and then age over here so guys all these three elements are the table headers in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see these are the table headers that we have defined now guys we will Define the table data as well so we will have another row over here and the details of the first player that is Cristiano Ronaldo will be defined rowwise so over here we have the first name and then we will Define the last name over here and then we will Define age in this case that is 38 years okay similarly we will Define the details of the second player as well by using this second row so over here simply we will copy and paste these lines of code and then we will say the details of the second player that is Leon whose age is 36 years now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have created this table in the HTML similar to the Microsoft Excel table that we have defined now guys how we can combine the first name and last name over here so before doing that let us apply certain border over here to the table so what we can do is simply we have to come in this style tag and then we will say table we will also have th and TD in this case case for which the Border CSS property will be applied the Border width will be 1 pixel and it will be a solid border and then the color of the Border will be black in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see now we have the borders as well we will also provide the Border collapse property to the TBL so that we don't see these multiple lines over here in between the cells as the borders so over here we have border collapse property and the value of this property will be collapse in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have provided the Border collapse property as well let us also provide the padding as well so we will provide 10 pixels of padding so that we can see the spaces in between the data and the borders of the table so now you can see that there is certain spacing as well inside the table now guys what we will do is we will simply merge these two cell data that is first name and last name by using the call span attribute so guys what we have to do is the first name and last name headers are present in the first row over here and now we will remove these two headers over here and we will simply provide just one header which will have the label as name over here now guys what we have to do is since we have provided three values over here for the player details we need to adjust this particular First Column label in such a way that it occupies two cells over here so inside the th St starting tag we need to provide the call span attribute so as you can see this is the attribute that we can use and we just have to provide the number of cells that will be used in order to display this particular label so in this case these two cells will be displayed in just one cell that will be labeled as name over here so we provide the call span as two in this case so let me just save this file now and when we reload this page you will notice that the first name and last name will be removed moved now and these two cells will be combined and it will have the label as name over here so when we reload this page as you can see name is being displayed as the common label for the first name and the last name of the players and guys this is the importance of the call span attribute that is in order to merge the two cells column wise we can use the call span attribute inside the TH or the TD tags as well now guys let us move to another task that is how we can use the those pen so guys over here we will have to create another table in such a way that the table headers are present vertically over here in the First Column so let us Define this particular table quickly so in vs code what we will do is we will have another table tag over here and then inside this the very first row will be having the first element as the header which will be the first name over here and then guys the second and the third element will be having the first name of both the players so so over here we will have the TD tag and we will say the first name of the first player that is Cristiano and the third tag will be another TD tag and this time it will be the first name of the second player that is Leonel okay similarly we will have two more rows over here in which case the first element will be table header and the other two elements will be table data over here so let us Define that as well and over here in the second row we will have last name in this case so we will have details of the player that is Ronaldo and Messi in this case and then in the third row we will have the age so we will Define the age as 38 years and 36 years so guys we have defined all the data over here in the second table as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the table headers in the first colum over here and the data is being displayed in the second and the third columns in this case guys let us Pro IDE certain spacing in between both the tables so we can simply have the line braks that is the BR tags over here so we will have multiple line braks in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the second table now now guys over here we had used the call span attribute in order to merge the two cells column wise now similarly we will use the row span attribute in order to merge the first name and the last name over here these two sets vertically so that we can say that Cristiano Ronaldo is the full name of the player so guys what we have to do is we have to come over here in the second table and we have to remove both the headers from here so first of all we will remove the first name and we will also remove the last name in this case and we will simply have just one header over here so we will say th and in this case we will give the label as name over here and then guys what this th is doing is it should have the space of the two rows over here so in the second row we are not going to Define any of the table headers but in the first row we have already defined and we need to provide the rose pan as two in this case so we provide Rose Pan and the value should be two so that it takes the space of both these cells over here inside the First Column so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so now as you can see the first name and last name is not being displayed and instead of that we are getting the common label that is name over here that is occupying the space of the first and the second row over here inside the First Column and guys this is the way that we can use the rose pen based on our requirements so now we will see table styling in HTML using CSS so guys we can use CSS in HTML to make the tables look better and these are the examples that we are going to see with the help of VSS code as well so basically we will see zebra strips in order to add the background color on every other table row inside the table that we have defined in the HTML so guys to check this example we are going to Define this particular table as you can see it is kind of a calendar which is having the days that is Monday Tuesday Wednesday and up to Sunday in the first row and then in the other rows we have the dates over here from 1 up to 28 which is the number of days in the month of February provided it is not a leap year so guys we are going to Define this particular table in HTML so let us move to the vs code over here and inside the body section we will have table tag over here and for this table tag we will Define the caption as calendar over here so we will say calendar now guys simply what we have to do is we need to define the first row and it should have these days over here so what we can do is we will have the TR tag over here and then inside the table row tag we will have the table headers that is the th tags so the first th tag is having Monday as the value similarly we will have the other six th tags as well and we will Define the other days so we have Tuesday over here then we have wedes day and then we have Thursday and then we have Friday and then Saturday and then the last day that is Sunday over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so as you can see we have defined the headers of the table we we have not provided any borders for now so we will provide it at the end of the creation of this particular table now guys we will Define the dates inside this table using the table row so once again we will have the table row over here which is the second row and then inside this we will have the table data this time because these are not the table headers these are the simple data that we want to Define inside the table so guys we have the date that is 1 over here similarly we will have the dates from 1 to 7 in this case so as you can see we have provided the dates from 1 to 7 let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have provided the dates as well so guys similarly I will quickly provide the dates in the other rows as well inside the vs code so guys as you can see we have provided the table data in the other rows as well over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the way that our calendar looks like over here on the browser now guys let us provide certain borders as well to all the table cells over here so in the vs code we will come inside the head section and then we will provide the style tag over here and we will provide the border to the table and also to the table header that is the th tag and the TD tag as well which is the table data so simply we have to provide the Border property over here and let's say we provide one pixel that is the Border width and then border style will be solid in this case case and let's say we provide the color as black to the border of this table so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have provided the borders as well over here and we will also provide the Border collapse property so that we don't get to see the double borders over here to all the cells of the table so inside the table tag we need to provide the Border collapse property over here and then the value will be collapse in this case and guys also we will provide certain padding so that we have some space over here between the content and the table borders so in this case we will provide padding of six pixels over here so we say padding as 6 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have provided the padding as well as the collapse property is helping us to display the borders of the cells only once now guys let us see how we can provide the zebra strips over here to the table so we will be adding the background color on every other table row so basically we are going to provide the background color to the even rows over here so let's say this is the second row so it should have certain background color and again to this fourth row as well we will be having the same background color so how we can achieve this particular task so guys simply we can come over here under the style tag and we will be providing the TR tag over here that's because we want to provide the background color to the entire row and then in this case we need to provide the background color to the even rows so what we can do is after the TR tag we can use colon and then we can use the nth child over here so guys under this nth child inside the parenthesis we can say even over here which means only to the even rows the property that we are going to Define under this particular tag will be applied so inside the curly braces we will have background color over here and then let's say we want to provide Aqua as the background color in this case to all the even rows of the table so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so as you can see this aqua color that is the background color is being applied to the even rows over here to this particular table and that is how we can achieve this particular task of applying the zebra strips to the HTML table now guys similarly we can also have the vertical Ze strips so instead of having the color being applied to the rows we can apply it to the columns as well so let's say if we want to apply the colors to the even number of columns which means on Tuesday then on Thursdays and then on Saturdays so the background color of these columns should be applied with a particular color so how we can achieve that basically this is called vertical zebra strips in order to add the background color on every other table column in this case so guys what we can do is instead of having the table row we will be having the th and the TD in this case so since this particular cell is being defined with th and these cells are defined with the help of TD Tex we need to apply The Styling to the th and the TD tags over here so instead of having TR we will say th and then similarly we will copy this and we will provide comma and then paste this once again and this time we will say TD over here so guys to the T tag we are applying the nth child and then it should be even in this case and similarly for TD tag as well separated by a comma in this case we are applying the nth child and it is even in this case and we are having the same color that is the background color that is aqua over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we are getting column wise over here the even columns are having the background color as Aqua in this case and that is how we can simply achieve the vertical zbra strips over here now guys how do we combine the vertical and horizontal zbra strips so simply we can include the TR tag as well once again over here in this case I'll simply copy this particular section of this line and then after providing comma we will have TR as well over here so we say TR for which the nth child is even over here so for all the even rows and for all the even columns as well this particular background color will be applied so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see the even columns are having the background color as well as the even rows that is the second row and the fourth row is also having the background color as Aqua which we have defined over here in the vs code so guys this is the way that we can achieve the combined vertical and horizontal zra strips in the HTML table now guys how we can provide the horizontal dividers over here so let us remove all the styling for now in this case so I'll remove all the lines from the style tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so there is no styling to this particular table right now so what are horizontal dividers so basically this is nothing but this is a simple bottom line over here that we want to draw after each row so how we can achieve that so guys simply we can provide the Border bottom property to all the table rows inside the table so what we have to do is inside the style tag we have to define the TR tag over here and inside the open and close curly braces we will be having the border and this time it will be applied to the bottom only so over here we will say 1 pixel border width and then we have the Border style as solid and then the color of the Border will be black color in this case so guys basically this border bottom will only be applied to the bottom of all the rows and not on all the four sides of the rows in this case so let let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so guys there is no change for now we cannot see the horizontal divider that's because we have not provided the Border collapse property to the table so over here what we need to do is we can Define the table tag as well and inside the table tag we need to provide the Border collapse property over here and the value of this border collapse property will be collapse in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so now you can see that a horizontal divider is being displayed to all the table rows over here now guys let us move to another task over here we will be seeing hoverable table which can be achieved by using a hover selector to all the TR elements so guys what this will do is whenever we will get our cursor on the table Row the table row must be highlighted with some background color over here so let us achieve that in the vs code let me just remove all the styling over here and then let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser now guys over here simply we will have the borders for the table and the table data so over here we have the table tag we have the table header and the table data tags as well and for this we will have the Border as one pixel width and the Border style will be solid and the color will be black in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser let me provide the Border collapse property as well to the table tag over here so we have border collapse in this case for which the value is collapsed now and guys we will also provide the padding of six pixels over here so that we get to see certain spacing in between the content and the edges of the borders in this case so guys as you can see we are now having a decent table being displayed on this HTML page now guys let us implement the hover selector over here so what we can do is we can def find the TR tag that's because on a particular row if we get the cursor the entire row needs to be highlighted over here so after the TR tag we have colon and then simply we can provide hover so as you can see it applies while the user designates an element with a pointing device a mouse cursor in this case so basically we will use this hover and then what we will do is we will have a background color in this case so basically what we are saying is whenever user gets the Cur on a particular row of the table the background color will be set to this particular color that we are going to Define so guys let's say we Define the color that is gray in this case so gray color will be displayed as the background color for the entire row when we get the cursor on a particular row of the table so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so after reloading if you see now when we get the cursor over here on the table Row the background ground color of the entire row is being set to the gray color now guys this is the way that we can use the hover selector in order to highlight a particular row inside the HTML table so now we will see table call group teag in HTML so guys basically the call group element is used to style specific Columns of a table so the call group element should be used as a container for the column specifications so guys previously we had created a table containing the calendar for the month of February for a particular year as you can see the first row is having all the name of the days over here and the other rows are having the dates of the month over here from 1 to 28 and we are also having the table caption that is calendar over here and the source code as you can see in this vs code over here we had defined the table tag and then after that we had the caption that is calendar which is being displayed at the top of the table over here and then the first row is having the names of the days in the month and then guys we have the remaining rows that are defining the dates over here for the month of February which is having the dates from 1 up to 28 considering that the year is not a leap year so guys what we are going to do is we are going to style only particular columns over here which can be done by using the call group tag so as you can see the call group element should be used as a container for the column specifications which we are going to see with the help of examples as well and each group is specified with a call element over here so guys basically inside the call group tag we will also have the call Tag which is going to Define which columns need to have a particular style so guys the span attribute inside the call Tag will specify how many columns that get the style over here and then we have the style attribute as well which specifies the style to give the columns so guys we will check this with the help of example as well and we can also have multiple call Elements inside call group tag so guys let us move to the vs code over here and let's say based on our requirements we want to have the background color for the first two days over here that is Monday and Tuesday and both these columns should have the background color as yellow over here so how we can Implement that so guys basically the call group tag can help us in order to achieve this task and this should come inside the table tag and after the caption tag so guys always remember if you are having the caption tag as well as the call group tag to be implemented so it will always come after the caption tag over here so as you can see this is the call group tag that we are going to use and it is having the starting tag and the ending tag over here which will just act as a container and then guys what we can do is we have to come inside this call group tag and then we can create the call Tag over here this call Tag is not going to have the end tag over here but we are going to have certain attributes that is the span attribute and the style attribute so guys the span attribute will Define how many columns need to have the style that we are going to Define so guys over here the span attribute will have the value as two that's because the first two columns need to have the background color as yellow as per our requirement so guys we come over here we provide the span as two and then we provide the style attribute over here and inside the style attribute we can easily provide the background color property and this background color property will have the name of the color as yellow as per our requirement so guys over here we have provided the background color is yellow for the call Tag which is having the value of span attribute s two over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see the first two columns are having the color that is yellow guys I'll remove this hover property as well over here since it is not required for now so this is the hover property that that we had provided let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so now as you can see the first two columns are having the background color is yellow now guys let us say we have another requirement wherein we want to have the background color for Wednesday and Thursday as some other color so what we can do is again we can create a call tag over here so guys once again when we create the call tag and now we need to provide the span of two once again so that the third and the fourth column can be painted Ed with a particular background color so guys over here we provide the spam is equal to 2 and then again we provide the style attribute and then we use the background color property so guys in the background color let's say we want to provide the color as Aqua over here so guys the Wednesday and Thursday column should have the aqua color as the background color now that's because we have provided the span as two after the first call Tag over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see these two columns are having the different background color now and that is the meaning of using the call group as a container and using the call Elements over here we can specify how many columns we want to style based on our requirements and we can provide the properties of the style attributes over here in this same call tag and then guys again we can have the multiple call tags over here in order to provide different styling properties to the remaining Columns of the table now guys let us say we want to skip this particular column and we want to color Saturday and Sunday with some other color so what we have to do is first of all we need to skip the column having the Friday label over here so we will be creating another call element in this case and then guys over here the span attribute should have the value as one and it will be a blank call element which means it is not going to have any style attribute over here that's because we don't want to provide any styling for this particular column that is having the Friday label and then guys what we can do is after providing this span is equal to 1 for this particular call element we can create another call element and this time the span must be two that's because this third call element is helping us in order to skip this column that is Friday and then we will move to Saturday and Sunday and that is why we can provide the span as two over here so that the style is applied to the last two columns so guys over here we will Pro provide the style and then let's say we provide the background color property and let's say we provide the color as yellow green in this case so guys let me just select this yellow green color let me just save this file now and if you notice the Friday column should be skipped over here that's because we have provided the blank call element in this case and then Saturday and Sunday should have the yellow green color as the background color so after saving this file let me just reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see see Saturday and Sunday is being styled with the background color that is yellow green in this case so guys in this way if you want to skip any of the columns over here you can provide the blank call element in this case whatever number of columns you want to style based on your requirements you can provide that many number of columns in the span attribute of the call tag in this case which will come under the container that is being defined by this call group tag guys apart from this you can also have the visibility property equal to collapse value which can be used to hide the columns so guys let us say in this particular table where Friday column is not having any style if you want to hide this particular column in this table so what we can do is we can come over here and to this call element which is the empty element in this case where we have specified just one column over here with the help of this pen attribute we can provide the style attribute in this case and then we can use the visibility properties so guys this visibility property will have the collapse value and when we use this particular value the column will be hidden when it is displayed in the HTML page so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the Friday column that was displayed is now being hidden over here due to the visibility property that is set to the collapse value so now we will see unordered list in HTML so guys HTML unordered list is used to group a set of related items in list and we are going to check this with the help of examples as well now an unordered list starts with the UL tag over here so as you can see we have the less than symbol and Then followed by UL which stands for unordered list and then we have the greater than symbol over here and this is the starting tag of unordered list we have the ending tag as well now each list item starts with the lii tag over here here so we have the less than symbol followed by the Li and then greater than symbol in order to define the list item inside the unordered list and then guys the list items will be marked with bullets that is the small black circles by default so guys let us check this with the help of examples now how we can Define the unordered list in the HTML page so guys over here I have defined the title as the unordered list in HTML simply we will have the paragraph inside the body and this paragraph will say that below content is an unordered list so we have defined a very simple paragraph having the statement below content is an unordered list now guys we will use the UL tag over here so when we type UL as you can see vs code is suggesting us this UL tag and we have created the starting tag and the ending tag in this case now guys inside this UL tag we need to define the list of items so we will be using the LI tag over here so when we we use the LI tag it is also having the starting tag and the ending tag over here and inside the LI tag we can Define the name of the item so let's say we Define coffee as one of the items over here and then similarly we will have more items so I'll copy this and paste this over here in the next lines and then let's say we Define another item as T and then one more item as milk in this case so guys we have three items over here inside the list which is being defined as is the unordered list now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser to see how the list items will be displayed so as you can see this is the list items I'll simply zoom in so that you can see the content properly so this is the way that unordered list items are being displayed with the help of the circular bullets over here in black color so guys this is the default appearance of the unordered list we can have any number of list items in this unordered list so over here let's say we create more items so we can simply copy and paste these list items in this case and let's say we say CocaCola over here as another drink and then let's say we have another list item as Pepsi so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see now we have five items in this case and all the items are having the prefix in this case it is a circular bullet over here which is defined as the unordered list which is not having any order now guys we can also change this appearance of the bullet in this case so as you can see we can use the list style type over here as the CSS property for the unordered list tag so what we have to do is inside the UL tag we need to define the style attribute so inside the style attribute we can say list style type over here so this is the property that we can use and it is having multiple values that you can see and the disk value is the default default value that is being seen right now so what we can do is we can change the value to Circle in this case so when we set the value to Circle it will be a circular appearance instead of a bullet appearance for the unordered list so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see small circles are being displayed now for each and every item inside the unordered list and that is the meaning of the circle value for this list style type another value can be a square sare value as well so we can have the Square value let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the squares now that are being displayed for this unordered list items now guys we can also have the nested list as well so let's say we want to describe more items inside this T that is we want to Define black T as well as green te in this case so we can have another unordered list inside this list item so what we have to do is we have to come over here and for this list item that is T in this case we can Define another unordered list by using the UL tag over here and inside the UL tag again we can have the LI tag in order to define the list item so let's say we have black T in this case so we Define black T and then again let's say we have another list item and this time we say green te so over here we have defined green te in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser to see how it looks so as you can see black tea and green tea are being displayed inside this list item that is T with a circular appearance over here so guys in this way we can also have the nested unordered list apart from this this list item can also be an image or a link as well which is pointing to another web page over here so guys you can try those things as well as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own so so now we will see ordered list in in HTML so guys HTML ordered list is used to group a set of related items in list and they will be having a particular order in which we Define them now guys an ordered list starts with the o tag over here so we have the less than symbol followed by o which is ordered list and Then followed by the greater than symbol and then inside the list each list item starts with the lii tag in this case so guys the list items will be marked with the numbers by default so let us check this with the help of examples in VSS code over here so guys previously we had written the unordered list items in this case and this is how the unordered list items looks on the web browser now guys what we will be doing is we will Define the ordered list as well below this unordered list so simply we are going to have a paragraph and then we will say below content is in ordered list we have a very simple statement that is below content is in in ordered list now guys we can simply use the o tag over here so when we type O as you can see this is the starting o tag and the ending o tag so in between these o Texs we will be defining our list items so we can simply have the Ali starting and the ending tag over here and then guys let's say we want to have the list of programming languages over here in a particular order so let's say we Define the first list item as Python and then we copy and paste this line of code to the remaining lines and then let's say we have another programming language that is Java and then let's say we have C++ over here and then let's say we have dot in this case guys we have taken these programming languages just for the example to show how the list items will be displayed in the ordered list it doesn't mean that python is ranked number one over here and Java is ranked number two over here this is just for the example purpose and all of the programming languages have their own advantages and disadvantages so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the paragraph that is below content is in ordered list and then we have all the programming languages that we have listed python Java C++ and Dot so guys as I have told you this is not the rankings that we are giving to the programming languages you can learn based on your interest and each and every programming language have their own advantages and disadvantages and if you want to learn more about python Python and Java programming languages I have created lot of videos related to the tutorials of these programming languages along with it we have also covered multiple Python and Java programs with the help of examples so guys you can watch all those videos which I have added in the playlist the links I have given Below in the description section so guys this is a way in order to display the ordered list in this case where by default we get the numbers that is 1 2 3 4 and so on based on the number number of list items in this case now guys we can also have the type attribute inside the o tag in order to mention how the list items should be displayed so by default as you can see over here the numbers are being displayed in this case but we can also have letters over here so let's say if you want to display all these programming languages with the help of the uppercase characters so what we have to do is inside the o tag we have something called as type attribute so as you can see it indicates it's the numbering type so it can be a lowercase letter or the uppercase letter or it can also have the Roman numerals as well so over here right now we will be using the uppercase letter in this case so let's say we provide capital A over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the programming languages are being numbered with the uppercase characters that is a b c d and so on so guys similarly we can have the lowercase characters as well over here we need to provide the type that is lowercase a in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have a b c d and so on the lowercase letters are being displayed and these are used as the numbers for the ordered list we can also have the Roman numbers as well so let's say we provide capital I over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see these are the Roman number numbers 1 2 3 4 and so on based on the number of the list items all the Roman numbers will be displayed over here in the ordered list now guys apart from this we also have the start attribute of the o tag so guys let us move to the default numbering system over here so we will change this type value to one in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so we are getting 1 2 3 4 and so on but guys let's say if you want to start start with some other number let's say we want to start with the fifth number over here so what we can do is for the o tag we have the start attribute so over here we can provide the start attribute as you can see this integer attribute specifies the start value for the numbering of the individual list items so we can say that whatever value we provide to the start attribute from that value the list items will start so let's say we provide the number five in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the numbering is starting from the number that is five and then we have 6 7 8 and so on so guys in this way we can easily use the start attribute as well in order to start the ordered list from a particular number now guys we can also have the nested ordered list as well so inside one of the list items we can have another ordered list so let's say inside the Java list in this case we want want another ordered list over here so what we can do is after the ending tag of this Java list item we come over here and then we provide the ordered list tag that is O and then we again Define the list items and then let's say we want to define the Java versions 19 and 20 so over here we will say Java version 19 and then we will have another list item and then we will say Java version 20 in this case as the second list item inside the nested ordered list over here within Java list item so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see inside this Java list item we have two more elements that we have defined which is again an ordered list over here that is being numbered as 1 and two and it is saying Java version 19 and Java version 20 in this case so guys in this way we can also have the nested ordered list over here and B based on our requirements we can also have images and other links over here inside of the simple text that we have defined in this ordered list and if you want to have the unordered list over here we can do that as well so instead of using the o tag in this case we can use the UL tag over here which defines the unordered list so we have changed the starting and the ending tag to the unordered list in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now a small circle is being displayed instead of the numbers over here which is the unordered list that we have defined inside the nested order list so Guys these are certain ways in order to display the ordered list and the nested ordered list as well so now we will see description list in HTML so guys a description list is a list of terms with a description of each term so let's say we have the list of items and we want to have some description for each and every item inside the list so we will be using the description list in HTML in such cases so guys we have the DL tag over here which defines the description list and then inside the DL tag we can have the DT tag which defines the term that is the list item that we want to Define and we also have the DD tag which describes each term that we have listed in the DT tag over here so guys let us check this with the help of examples in VSS code over here so previously we had seen the unordered list and the ordered list so I'll quickly remove these lines of code over here and then we will say below content is in description list in this case so guys we have a very simple statement below content is in description list and then we will also change description list in HTML now guys the main tag that we are going to use over here is the DL tag over here so we have the description list starting in the ending tag and then we are going to define the term that is the list item using the DT tag so over here we provide DT and then let's say we provide coffee as one of the list items over here and then guys what we can do is we can have the DD tag that describes the coffee item over here so we provide the Double D tag in this case and then we can simply say black hot drink in this case so over here we are just providing certain description for this coffee over here now guys let us say we have another element so again we will have the tag over here and then let's say we have milk in this case and then we will describe it with certain statement so let's say we have white cold drink in this case so guys basically we are describing what milk is over here so this is the format that we can use inside the DL tag first we have the DT tag and Then followed by The Double D tag over here in order to describe the DT term and then again we have more list items along with their descriptions so guys let let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see below content is in description list so this is the list of items that we have so first item we have coffee and then we have the description that is black hot drink over here and then the second item is milk which is a white cold drink in this case so guys if you have the requirement in such a way that you want to describe certain list of items over here you can have the description deson list in this case and use these DT and the DD tags over here in order to define the terms and the descriptions as well so now we will see class attribute in HTML so guys the HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element and multiple HTML elements can share the same class so guys the basic idea behind using the class attribute is to provide certain styling to that particular HTML element and apart from this we can have the same class name being defined for the multiple HTML elements so that they can share the same styling now guys the Syntax for CSS of class is in such a way that to create a class we first write a period that is dot character over here and then followed by the name of the class that we have defined for that particular HTML element and then guys we Define the CSS properties within the curly braces so guys this dot character followed by the class name will be defined inside the style tag that we Define under the head section of the HTML page and then we are going to define the style properties inside the curly braces so guys let us check this with the help of examples now in the vs code over here so guys we have updated the title to class attribute in HTML and let's say we have the paragraph tag over here so we say P tag and then we will say this is first p paragraph So guys we have a very simple statement that is this is first paragraph and let's say we have another paragraph over here and we say this is second paragraph in this case now guys let's say we want to provide certain background color to this paragraph so what we can simply do is we can come over here to the P tag and inside the P tag we can provide the style attribute and then we can simply have the background color and let's say we provide the background color as yellow so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the first paragraph is having the background color that is yellow but the second paragraph is not having the background color so what we can do is we can simply copy paste this background color property of the style attribute to the second paragraph tag as well but guys in this way our code will become little complex and it will be little difficult in order to read the HTML code and with the increasing number of The Styling property the HTML code will become more worse if someone else is going to read your HTML code in future so guys what we can do is we can Define the class over here for the P tag in this case so simply we come inside the P tag over here and then we say class in this case and then let's say we give the name of the class as BG color so guys it depends on you what name you provide to your classes when you use in the HTML elements but make sure that these are sensible names and we can come to know the meaning of it what exactly the class name means and also these class names are case sensitives so you have to use the exact names over here and then again guys what we can do is name and paste to the second P tag as well so that we can Define the classes in both the paragraph tags now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we simply have the two State stying properties that we have defined for this particular class name that is BG color so now what we will do is we will come inside the head section and then we will Define the style tag over here now guys as I have told you this is the syntax that we first have to mention the period that is the dot character and Then followed by the class name so over here we provide the dot character and then the class name that is BG color over here now guys make sure that the name of this class name is matching with the class name that we have provided provided in the HTML elements so we can simply copy and paste over here in order to avoid any mistakes so this is the format that is we have the dot character followed by the name of the class and then what we have to do is we need to provide the open and close curly braces inside which we will be defining our styling properties now guys we will provide the background color over here so we can simply say background color in this case and then let's say the background color is yellow over here now let me just save this file now and since the classes are being mentioned in both the HTML elements that is both the paragraph text so in this case both the paragraphs should have this background color that is yellow now so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the background color that is yellow in this case and in this way we can easily use the classes in HTML in order to provide certain styling properties to the HTML element now guys apart from this we can also have different HTML elements that can use the same class attribute so what we can do is let's say we have div element over here so we Define another div element and we will say this is first div element and then let's say we have another second div element and we will Define the content as this is second Dev element in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have both the div elements over here being displayed but let's say if we want to provide the same styling properties that is being applied to the first two paragraphs over here to the div elements as well so what we can do is simply we can Define this class that is BG color over here inside the div element as well so I'll copy this and paste it inside both the div elements let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the styling prop properties to the div elements are also applied and in this way we can have the same class name being used for different HTML elements if we want to apply those styling properties now guys another important thing is the HTML element can also have multiple classes associated with it so let's say we have another class over here so we Define The Styling of another class so let's say we have the dot character followed by font size in this case the curly Braes we will Define the font size over here so let's say we have the font size property and we Define it as 26 pixels in this case so guys let's say we want the first paragraph to have this font size as 26 pixels so what we can do is since this class name is font size we can apply this class name to the first paragraph tag over here inside the class attribute but along with this we also want the BG color to be applied so that it also has the background color over here so what we can do is after this BG color we can provide the space character and then provide the name of the class that is font size in this case so guys we have applied multiple class names over here which are separated by the space characters and those styling properties from multiple classes will be applied to such HTML element which is mentioning multiple classes over here so in this case the first paragraph will be having the font size as 20 6 pixels and the other HTML elements will be having the default font size so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is first paragraph is having the font size of 26 pixels compared to the other HTML elements that are being displayed with the default font size so guys in this way we can also combine the multiple styling properties from different classes and apply it to a single HTML element by using using those class names which will be separated by a space character over here so Guys these are the certain things that you should know while using the class names this property of HTML helps us in order to provide the similar styling properties to multiple HTML elements irrespective of their tags so now we will see ID attribute in HTML so guys the HTML ID attribute is used to specify a unique ID for an HTML element and we can use the styling Properties by using this ID attribute that we are going to check with the help of examples as well now guys you cannot have more than one element with the same ID in an HTML document previously we had seen that the class attribute name can be applied to more than one element but when we are using ID attribute we cannot assign it to more than one HTML element inside the HTML document and the Syntax for CSS of ID is in such a way that first we write a hash character so as you can see this is the hash character over here and then followed by the ID name in this case and then we Define the CSS properties within the curly braces so guys let us check this with the help of example now in the vs code over here so guys let's say we have the two paragraphs and then we have the content inside the first paragraph s this is first paragraph and then let's say we have another paragraph over here and then we will say this is second paragraph in this case now guys let's say we want to define the ID for this first paragraph over here so inside the starting P tag we provide the space character and Then followed by the ID attribute as you can see it defines a unique identifier which must be unique in the whole document so we are going to use this ID attribute and then we are going to say par one in this case so guys this is the name of the ID that is par 1 and we can use this par 1 ID over here inside the style text in order to provide certain styling to this first paragraph so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the two paragraphs over here but we don't have any styling So currently we have just applied the ID to this first paragraph but we have not provided any styling attributes to this ID so we will be providing the same over here so as I've told you the syntax for the CSS properties to be defined to the ID is by using the hash character and Then followed by the ID name so over here we will provide hash character followed by par 1 that is the name of this ID in this case and Then followed by the open and close curly braces inside which we will be having the CSS property so guys let's say we want to change the color of the font for this first paragraph over here so what we can do is simply we can provide the color property in this case and let's say we provide the color that is red over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser since this time we are providing the ID to the first paragraph and the color is red for this ID only the first paragraph will be having the color that will be updated now when we reload this page as you can see the color of this first paragraph is red over here so guys in this way we can easily use the ID attribute for a particular HTML element and provide certain styling attributes in this case now guys let's say we want to change the font size as well so over here we provide the font size property and let's say we provide 26 pixels as the value of the font size property over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the font size of this particular paragraph has been updated and it is larger compared to the font size of the second paragraph which is being displayed with the default font size so guys based on your requirements you can have any styling properties over here being defined to this ID that we have defined inside the style Tex now guys what is the difference between the class and the ID so as I've told you ID is being used only with a single HTML element and we cannot use the same ID with multiple HTML elements but we can have the same class with the multiple HTML elements over here so let's say we have another class BG color in this case and then let's say we have the background color property over here and the value for this background color property is yellow and then let's say we also want to have the text align property for this class and we will say Center as the text align property and then let's say we want to use these styling properties that is being used in the BG color class name to this particular paragraph so what we can do is we can simply have the class attribute over here and then we can provide the name of the class that is BG color so in this way the second paragraph will be having the background color that is yellow and it will be also having the text align property as Center so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the yellow background color and the text align is also at the center now guys let us say we have another element over here so we have another div element in this case so when we provide div and then let's say we have this this is a div element as the content of this div tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so we have a very simple statement that is this is a div element for this div tag now guys let us say we want to provide the same styling property that we have provided to the second paragraph over here to the div tag as well so what we can do is simply we can use this class name and provide the class attribute inside the div tag as well and give the value of this class name as BG color so when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so the same styling property is being provided to this Dev element as well and that is the main difference over here between the class and the ID we can use the class name with the multiple HTML elements over here they can be of the same type or the different types as well but when we are talking about the ID of the HTML element it can only be used with a single HTML element and that is why the ID must be unique in nature now guys there is a very important application of IDs that is using the HTML bookmarks with ID so for example we have the Google search blog link over here I'll simply open this in the new tab and then guys what we are going to do is as you can see this is the content of the Google search Central blog over here and this is the Google search core updates heading in this case so guys I want to know what is the ID of this particular in so simply we will right click over here and click on the inspect option and then we use the select an element tool over here and simply highlight this particular heading as you can see this is the H2 heading which is having a particular ID so you can see this is the ID over here I'll simply copy this ID and what we will be doing is we will be providing a link that is by using the a tag in the HTML document and we will point it to this particular heading over here so what we have to do is simply I'll come over here and provide the a tag in this case and then let's say we provide the content that is click here in between the starting and the ending a tags now guys what we have to do is for the hre we need to provide the link to that web page so simply I'll copy this link of the URL and paste it over here and then we need to provide the hash character over here that's because we want to specify the ID of the HTML element that is present on this page so simply I'll come over here copy this ID once again and then paste it after the hash character so guys the main idea over here is to click on this particular link and go directly on this page where the user will be taken to this particular heading directly and that is what we are going to achieve with this task over here so guys let me just close this tab and then what we have to do is inside this a tag I will provide the target attribute as well which will help us in order to open this link in the new tab so over here the value will be provided as the underscore blank value in this case so that this link is opened in the new tab of the browser so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the click here hyper Link in this case and when we click on this link a new tab is opened and as you can see we directly come over here to this heading in this case that is Google search core updates over here and if you notice in URL we also have the hash followed by the ID of that particular heading so guys this is the way that we can directly point out to a particular ID of the HTML element on that page and directly navigate to that particular Heading by using the hyperlinks so Guys these are certain things that you should know about the ID attribute in HTML so now we will see I frame in HTML so guys basically an HTML I frame is used to display a web page within another the web page so we are going to check this with the help of example as well how we can display a web page inside the already existing web page now guys the HTML iframe tag specifies an inline frame so basically whatever HTML element we have written in our code besides that HTML element the inline if frame will be displayed with the help of the iframe tag over here in HTML an inline I frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML do doent so let us check the example and along with it we are going to use the SRC which is the source attribute that is used to refer to another web page to display an iframe so guys let us move to the vs code over here and first of all we will change the title to ifame in HTML so we will say iframe in HTML now guys we will have a very simple paragraph So by using the P tag we will say below is an iframe element so guys over here we have a very simple statement that is below is an iframe element inside the paragraph now guys we will provide the I frame over here so basically when we type if frame as you can see this is the tag that we are going to use so this is the SRC attribute that we can use in order to provide which web page we want to display inside this iframe element now guys this another attribute that is frame border we can remove it for now and guys before defining it we need to have another web page over here so let me just go to the Explorer so as you can see we only have the test.html page over here so what we can do is we can add a new file in this case so we click on this new file option and then we will say if frame. HTML in this case so guys basically we will be creating another web page over here which will be used in order to display it inside the iframe so guys let us provide the HTML file tag over here so automatically we will get the boilerplate code with the help of the vs code special feature over here so guys inside this we will have a very simple paragraph and we will say this is an iframe web page so guys basically we are displaying the simple statement that is this is an iframe web page so that we come to know that this is the web page that is created to be displayed inside the iframe so guys let me just save this file now and move to the other file that is test.html so guys as you can see we can switch between the different HTML web pages over here by using these tabs on the vs code so this is the if frame. HTML file and we are going to test.html file now guys we can refer to this if frame. HTML that we have just created so inside the source attribute and inside the double codes we can simply provide if frame. HTML so this is the page that we want to display inside the iframe tag over here inside the test.html so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we will be using the test.html this time so when we refresh this page as you can see this is an iframe web page over here that is being displayed right now and guys you can see the border of the iframe as well which is the default CSS property that is applied to the iframe on this web page guys to make it more clear we can provide the background color as well to the if frame. HTML web page so what we will do is we will come to this if frame. HTML PB page over here and inside the head section we will Define the style and for the body tag we are going to display the background color so that we can easily know what are the boundaries of the iframe element inside the test.html so guys over here let's say we provide the aqua color as the background color for the entire iframe web page so let me just save this file now and come to the test.html and then this time when we reload this page as you can see this is the dimension of the iframe over here and we are getting to see this is an iframe web page now if you notice this is another web page and it is an independent web page over here if we go to the file explorer and as you can see this is the if frame. HTML file that is created so when we double click on this this particular if frame. HTML web page is being opened for you in another tab so guys this particular web page is being displayed in a small if frame over here inside the test.html page and that is the main purpose of this iframe element that is to display another web page inside the existing web page now guys apart from this it is very important that we also provide the title attribute which is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the iframe is so basically we come to this test.html and inside this iframe tag after the source attribute we provide the title attribute as well and then we say test I frame over here so guys basically whatever title we give inside this double codes it will be used by the screen readers in order to read the content of this title attribute so no change will be seen over here so when we just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser there is no change when we provide the title attribute but it will be used by the screen readers whenever they are going to read the iframe content now guys apart from this you can also use the height and width attributes of the I frame so basically this is the default width and height that we have set so far over here we can explicitly set the width and height of the if frame in this case so after the title let me just provide the height of the I frame as 100 pixels over here so we provide 100 pixels and as well as the width as 100 pixels in this case so since the width and height are same the iframe will be displayed as a square I frame over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see it is a square I frame in this case guys we can increase the width and height over here so we will keep it as 300 pixels so it looks more decent over here so as you can see this is a square I frame in this case and that is how you can easily set the width and height of the I frame you can also use the CSS properties as well inside which you can provide the height and width properties when you are providing the style attribute for that if frame now guys by default the border of the iframe is being displayed so as you can see this is the gray border for the I frame so what we can do is we can remove the Border as well so simply we have to come over here and inside the style attribute in this case we provide the Border property and then for this border property we provide the value as none so guys what is the meaning of none value for the Border property it means there will be no border at all for this particular iframe HTML element so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see there is no order right now and it simply looks like it is some another element which is having a background color property and guys apart from this we can also have the border that is specified so simply we can provide two pixels over here and then solid and black color so guys basically we are providing the two pixels width of the border and it is a solid border and the color of the Border will be black over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the border is being applied to this iframe element now now guys apart from this we can also have the iframe target for a link so what this means is we can also have the anchor tag over here so what we will be doing is we will Define the anchor tag and after clicking on that particular link that is the hyperlink that is being defined by the anchor tag the content of the iframe element will be updated so guys for this we will have another iframe page over here so what we will do is I will have another iframe HTML page so this time we will say iframe 1. HTML now guys inside this file we will again have the HTML code and again we will have the paragraph tag over here and then we will say this is another I frame but guys this time what we will do is we will have the background color of this page as yellow so we will provide the style tag inside the head tag over here and then for the body tag in this case we will provide the background color over here and the background color will be yellow in this case so guys let me just save this file now I'll show you this file that is being created that is iframe 1 over here so when we click on this this is the iframe 1 that is being created and we can independently view all these files over here I'll simply close these files now guys what we will do is by default the first if frame that we defined will be displayed over here but when we are going to click on a particular link the content of this if frame should change to the second I frame that we just defined with the yellow background color so what we are going to do is inside this test.html we will have a hyperlink over here so let's say we Define the a tag in this case and then we will have the content as click here so guys basically we are asking the user to click on this particular link and for the HF attribute we are going to point it to the iframe 1. HTML page that we just defined which is having the yellow background so guys over here iframe 1. HTML is being provided to the HD attribute now guys by default what is the meaning of this so basically this iframe 1. HTML page will be displayed on the same page where this test.html page is being displayed right now so guys let me just show you that so I'll save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see since the iframe element is the inline element the anchor tag is being displayed over here to the right of this particular element and when we click on this particular link over here since we have given the HF attribute as iframe 1. HTML this page will be opened in this same tab so when I click on this as you can see this is another iframe so iframe 1. HTML is getting loaded over here but guys what we want to do is when we click on this link we want to open that page inside this iframe so how we can achieve that so basically what we have to do is first of all we need to provide the name to this if frame over here so let's say we provide the name attribute in this case and we simply say I frame over here as the name of this particular HTML element now guys we need to refer to this name when we click on this particular link and that can be done by providing the target attribute so guys if you remember the target attribute is used in order to open this particular web page in the same browser tab or the different browser tab so when we provide the blank value over here this particular page will be opened on a different browser Tab and by default the value is self right now which is making it open in the same browser tab but what we want is we want to open it in this particular iframe so we simply copy the name of this I frame and paste it to the Target attribute of the a tag over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now guys when we click on this particular link the I frame with the yellow background should display in this particular iframe element so when I click over here as you can see this is another iframe is being displayed right now in the iframe element that was defined in the test.html element itself rather than opening this particular iframe 1. HTML in the same or different browser tab so guys this is another application wherein you can provide the target attribute as the name of the I frame for that particular hyperlink where you want to load a particular if frame inside the iframe HTML element so now we will see basic Java JavaScript with HTML so guys JavaScript makes HTML Pages more Dynamic and interactive so far we have seen only the HTML elements and tags that we use in order to design the web pages and also we have seen how we can style the HTML documents by using the CSS properties but guys we have not seen how we can click on a particular element inside the HTML document and change the content of the existing HTML element which is known as the dynamic property of a web page and how we can interact with the web page so guys basically this JavaScript helps us in order to interact with the HTML web page and get certain HTML elements updated as per our requirements now guys we are going to have a simple problem statement and we are going to solve this with the help of the example in the vs code and we are going to learn at least the basic JavaScript that we can use in the HTML apart from this we will also be having the upcoming videos in which we are going to learn a lot about the JavaScript that we can use along with the HTML to make our web pages interactive and dynamic so guys let us move to the problem statement so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to create a button over here so we move to the vs code so inside the body what we can do is first of all we will have the paragraph and then we will say click below button so guys we have a very simple statement that is Click below button over here now guys how do we create a button so we simply have to create the input tag over here so when we say input as you can see there are number of suggestions that is being provided by the vs code over here and we are looking for something that is input colon button in this case and when we click on this as you can see the type attribute should have the value that is button guys apart from this button value there are many values that you can set so if I show you these are all the suggestions so we can have the button in which case a button will be created over here then we can also have the check boxes and then we have the color then date date time so guys all these are the different types of inputs that we can have inside HTML and we are going to learn about these as well in the upcoming videos as well so for now in order to create the button we are going to select this value of the type attribute inside the input HTML element now guys we are supposed to set the value as well that is the text that is going to be displayed for this particular button so we will simply will say click me over here so guys basically this text will be displayed on the button in order to show what action will be taken when the user clicks on this button you can also have the submit value over here or you can also have the reload value in order to reload the entire page so guys it depends on the functionality of the button to have the value attribute for that particular button now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the click below button paragraph that is being displayed and then we have something called as click me and this is a button right now over here now guys nothing will happen when we click on this so as you can see when we click on this nothing is happening right now so guys we need to add certain functionality to this particular button element over here so what we will be doing is the next step is to create a paragraph with ID demo so guys we will do that after this button we will create another P tag over here and then this time we are going to provide the I ID and the ID that we have given is demo to this particular paragraph now guys what we have to do is we need to click the button to show the current date time in the demo paragraph So guys over here I'll simply provide demo paragraph As the text so that you can see where this paragraph is being displayed on the web page so when we reload this page once again as you can see demo paragraph is being displayed right now over here now guys what we want to do is when I click on this button right now we want want to change this demo paragraph to the latest date time that is provided by the system over here right now so currently when we click on this button nothing is happening right now so let me just come to the code over here what we have to do is to this input tag we need to provide the onclick attribute so as you can see we have something called as onclick attribute over here and then guys what we have to do is we need to find the paragraph with the ID that is demo and fill it with the current Tim stamp over here so what what we can do is we have to type document so as you can see document is the word that we have to use followed by Dot and then we have something called as get element by ID so as you can see this is the method that we are going to use that is get element by ID because this paragraph is having the ID that is demo over here so guys we are going to provide this ID inside the open and close parenthesis we need to provide the single codes over here since we have already used double codes and then we provide the demo that is the ID of this paragraph now guys this particular statement that is document. get element by ID and then providing this ID inside the single codes inside the open and close parenthesis will help us to find this particular HTML element that is paragraph over here now guys what we have to do is after finding this paragraph We need to provide Dot and then we need to say inner HTML so we want to change the content of this HTML element so we are going to use the inner HTML property over here so when we click on this and then after this we need to provide equal to and then we need to get the current time stamp of the system so simply we can provide the date and then followed by open and close parenthesis so guys this particular date is being used over here in order to get the current time stamp in this case so guys it may be little complex for you to understand this but slowly with time when we are are going to practice more about JavaScript you will come to know exactly what we are doing over here and along with the practice as well you can understand that basically we are getting the current time stamp of the system and assigning it to the paragraph that is having the ID which is demo over here by using the inner HTML property now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and this time when we click on this particular button this text that is demo paragraph should get replaced with the current Tim stamp so let me just click over here so when we click on this as you can see the current Tim stamp right now along with the date is being displayed over here it is showing us the time in hours minutes and seconds right now when we click on this once again as you can see the minutes and seconds will change over here when we continuously click over here on this particular button so as you can see the time is being changed right now every second the time will get updated over here when we click on this button so this is a very basic JavaScript that we have seen over here right now apart from this what we have done is we have provided this particular statement within the tag over here but instead of having the onclick button and specifying all the steps of the JavaScript over here what we can do is I'll simply cut this and we can also have the script tag over here you can see that the script tag in HTML for JavaScript we can Define it inside the head section or within the body section as well so when we Define it inside the head section over here we can simply have the script and then guys what we can do is we can provide a function over here so we are going to learn more about the function as well in the upcoming videos when we are going to learn about JavaScript tutorial and then let's say we provide the name of the function as demo and then after the open and close parenthesis we provide the curly braces over here and inside the curly braces we provide the statement followed by the semicolon so guys this is is a simple format in order to define a function inside the JavaScript inside the script tag over here now guys function keyword is being followed by the function name and then we have the open and close parenthesis over here so guys what we have to do is we just need to call this function from this onclick attribute so simply we will have the demo function over here followed by open and close parenthesis now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser this time when we click on this button once again as you can see the date is being captured over here and it is being written in this demo paragraph So guys this is the way that we can provide the JavaScript line of code inside the script tag over here by defining the functions as well and calling that function on the click of a particular button we can have multiple buttons inside the HTML body tag and then guys we can have different functions based on their functionalities and have different Dynamic content being added to the HTML web page over here guys apart from this we can also set the style attributes with JavaScript so let's say we want this particular text to be displayed in the red color so by default it is being displayed in the black color over here so what we can do is again we can come over here in the demo function that's because when we click on this particular button we are calling the demo function over here with the help of the onclick attribute so guys the control flow comes over here to the demo function and sees that we are supposed to get the element by ID that is demo which is this particular paragraph and set it with the current time stamp by using the date function over here now guys what we will be doing is again we will find the paragraph with the ID that is demo over here so we will type document followed by Dot and then we say get element by ID and then inside the parenthesis we will again have the single quote over here and then we will say the ID is demo in this case and then guys what we can do is in order to set the color as red over here to this text we can provide dot followed by style attribute so guys basically we use the style attribute in order to change the color of a particular text as well when we use the CSS so the same thing we can do over here programmatically so after dot we provide style and Then followed by dot we can set color over here because that is the property that we use inside the style attribute when we Define the colors using CSS and then guys after this we can simply have equal to and inside the double codes we can give the value as red over here so that the color of the text is being changed to red and then after this we have a semicolon so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so guys by default demo paragraph is being displayed in the black color right now that's because we have provided the style inside the demo function which will be called only after clicking this button so when we click on this button right now let me just click on this as you can see we are seeing the date by using this first line of code over here and by using the second line of code inside the demo function we are getting the color of this text as red color so guys this is the way that we can set the color of the text by using the JavaScript as well and apart from this we can also change the content of the HTML elements so guys this is a very basic JavaScript that we have seen right now in this HTML tutorial we will be seeing more JavaScript videos in the JavaScript tutorial as well in the upcoming videos so now we will see head element in HTML so guys basically the HTML head element is a container for the following elements which are title and then we have style meta link script and the base text so guys basically some of the texts we have already seen in the previous videos as well that are being used inside the head element which is a container for all these tags over here and guys the head element itself must be defined inside the HTML tag now guys one by one we are going to see all these tags over here so first of all the title tag it defines the title of the document and basically the title must be text only and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page tab over here so guys we have already seen this in the previous videos as well as you can see this is the HTML document the first tag is the HTML starting tag and then in the end we have the HTML ending tag as well and then inside this HTML tag we have two main tags that is the head tag which can have multiple tags over here that we have just defined right now and then we also have the body tag which defines the body of the web page so guys basically we have the title tag over here inside the head tag which defines the title of the document so as you can see we have head element in HTML so this is the title of this particular HTML document and when we save this file and try reloading this page you can see this title of the document that is head element in HTML on the browser tab over here so guys this is the main functionality of the title tag it helps us in order to display that title of the document on the tab and you must be defining the title of the document whenever you are creating new web pages now guys apart from this we also have the style tag over here which is used to define the style information for a single HTML page so guys what we can do is inside the head tag we also have the style tag over here so when we Define the style tag we can Define The Styling of the HTML elements that are present inside the body so let's say for example we want to define the background color of this body tag over here so what we can do is simply inside the style tag we Define the body tag first of all because for the body tag we want to define the background color so inside the body tag over here we provide the open and close curly Braes and then simply we provide the background color property as you can see when we type background over here we are getting number of Suggestions by the vs code so we can use the background color over here and simply we can Define the value of the color so let's say we want the background color of the entire body of the web page to be yellow color in this way we can Define the style that is the background color inside the style tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the background color of the entire body has been updated to the yellow color that we have defined inside the style tag in this case so guys this is another important tag that we can use inside the head element of the HTML page now guys we also have the link attribute as well so it defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource so guys one of the best applications of the link link attribute is to link to another external stylesheet which means a CSS stylesheet that you have created so guys when you are going to actually work on big projects basically instead of having this internal Styles or the inline styles that you can Define inside a particular HTML element we are going to mostly deal with the external stylesheet so let me just open the Explorer over here and we will create a new file and we will name it as style. CSS so guys basically this name we have given is the style that is the file name followed by Dot and then the extension that we are using is CSS over here which means it is a CSS file where all our styling properties will be stored so guys let me just create this file and inside this file what we will be doing is let's say the style that we have provided right now for the body I'll just remove from here and paste it inside the style. CSS so basically all the Styles will be stored inside this style. CSS file in this case and let me just create another style for the paragraph tag over here and let's say for the paragraph tag we want the color of the text to be read in this case so when we provide color and then we can simply provide the value that is red so guys what this means is whatever paragraph that we are going to create inside our main HTML file over here will be having the red color of the text in this case so guys in this way we can Define multiple styles for the different HTML elements including multiple properties as well so guys let me just save this style. CSS file and come to this test. HTML I'll remove these style tags for now and then what we are going to do is simply we are going to have the P tag over here and then we will say this is paragraph one in this case and then again we will have another paragraph that is this is paragraph 2 so guys we have defined two simple paragraphs that is this this is paragraph 1 and 2 so guys currently we have not linked this style. CSS file to the test.html which we are going to do with the help of the link tag right now so let me just save this file now and show you how this file will look so when we reload this page as you can see there is no background color for now and even the paragraph being displayed are black in color right now that's because we have defined the style in the style. CSS but we have not linked this particular file to this HTM ml web page so guys what we have to do is inside the head tag we need to provide the link attribute right now and then we are going to use this link colon CSS which means the RL attribute which is the relation attribute it is telling HTML that the file that we are going to specify will be a stylesheet file so guys this is the RL attribute and the value that we must Define in order to link to a stylesheet file and then guys already the style. CSS file name is being taken over here so in the hre we need to provide this tile. CSS file name that we have just defined in this case so guys in this way what exactly we are doing is we are separating The Styling of the document that we have defined in the style.css file over here from the HTML code that we have returned so guys our code looks more cleaner in this case so this is one of the best practices that we must follow that is to create the HTML files and CSS files separately and to link them by using the link tag over here so that we have the separate stylesheets and the HTML files that can be maintained properly so guys let me just save this file now and this time when we reload this page we should get all the styles that are defined inside the style. CSS file so let me just reload this page as you can see we are getting the background color as well and we are getting the red color for this paragraph as well so guys in this way we can make use of this link tag in order to link to a particular external stylesheet file which is mostly the case when we are going to create major projects now guys let us move to another tag over here we have something called as meta in this case which is being used to specify the character set or the page description or the keywords or the author of the document and the viewport so guys basically this viewport settings is being used in order to make the page responsive which we are going to check in the upcoming videos as well so simply what we can do is we have have to come over here and we provide the meta tag in this case followed by colon and then you can see this VP over here which means viewport so when we select this option as you can see the name is provided as viewport and the content is width is equal to device width which means the entire device width will be used whenever the images or other HTML elements are going to scale automatically and then the initial scale is 1.0 over here so guys this is one of the important property of the meta tag that is using the viewport if you want your website to be responsive which means the pages should be displayed properly on the desktop as well as mobile and tablet devices so guys meta tag is being used to provide the viewport settings and apart from that you can also provide the character set the description of the page the keywords that will be used by the search engines in order to display your web page to the audiences when they are going to search for your keyword and then also the author of the document can be defined now guys apart from this we can also have the script tag over here which can be used to define the Cent side javascripts so basically inside the head tag we can also Define the script tag over here and then the script tag can have a particular function so we are going to learn more about the functions when we are going to see the JavaScript tutorial so over here we can have function and then the function name is let's say demo and then we can have our own JavaScript code over here so guys basically whatever JavaScript that we are going to write we can have it inside the script tag as well which can be defined inside the head tag over here inside the HTML now guys apart from this we also have the base tag over here which specifies the base URL or the target for all the relative URLs in the web page so guys what this means is we can also have the base tag over here in this case and we can provide the HF so guys what is the use case of this base tag so guys over here let's say we have a particular folder from where we want to show the images on our web pages so guys what we are going to do is we are going to provide this common directory path from where we are going to refer to that image so I'll simply copy this and paste it inside the HF attribute of the base tag over here so when we provide this value of the HF attribute and then in the end we need to provide the SL character over here now guys this is the base directory that we have defined now guys whatever image that we want to Define inside the body of the web page we can simply provide the name of that image now instead of providing the entire directory path to be displayed so guys let's say we want to provide the image over here along with the source in this case so what we need to provide is the source will be the name of this file so simply I'll copy this name of the file and then after that we provide the extension that is do PNG over here and guys simply this particular image will be displayed right now by using the the base directory path that we have already defined so guys let me just set the width and height of this particular image as well so let's say we have the width as 300 pixels over here and then let's say we have the height as 100 pixels in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this image is being displayed right now by using the directory path that we have provided in the base tag over here now guys let's say we don't provide this base tag in this case so I'll just comment out this particular line by using the control and for/ keyboard keys on the windows so let me just save this file now and let us see whether this particular image will be displayed right now so basically when we reload this page once again as you can see the image is not being displayed that's because the HTML page is trying to find the image over here in this particular directory where the main HTML file is present that is test.html which we are viewing right now but guys the image is not present in this directory but it is present in another directory over here which we had defined inside the base tag so guys basically this base tag is being used over here as the target directory where we have to find all the resources that is being used inside the HTML document so when we provide the base tag once again along with the directory path over here from where we are going to extract all the images that we want to display on the HTML page let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this time again the image is being displayed that's because we have provided the base tag along with the directory where all the resources are present so Guys these are some of the tags that can be defined inside the head element of the HTML so now we will see responsive web design in HTML so guys basically responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices so whether you view the web pages on the computer or desktop or your laptop or tablets or even your mobile phones so basically whatever web pages that we design using the HTML code it should be looking good on all the devices irrespective from where the viewer is viewing your web page now guys this design is called the responsive web design that means the HTML web page will adapt itself in order to look good on all the devices now a responsive web design will automatically etches for different screen sizes and the view ports responsive web design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize hide shrink or enlarge a website to make it look good on all the devices such as desktops tablets and phones so guys as I've told you responsive web design is nothing but it is the attempt in order to make the HTML and CSS in such a way that it should resize hide and Shrink or enlarge the existing HTML elements to different devices such as desktops tablets and mobile phones as well now in order to create the responsive website we add the meta tag over here so as you can see this is the meta tag with the name that is viewport and the content as the width is equal to device width and the initial scale is equal to 1 so guys this we are going to check with the help of example as well we need to mention this meta tag inside the head tag of the HTML document so guys let us move to the vs code over here I'll click here are all the lines of code for now so basically whenever we are going to create the new HTML code what we do is we first type HTML and as you can see HTML colon 5 this is the option that we will select so that we get the boiler plate code in the vs code so guys this is one of the important features of the VSS code it helps us in order to create the boiler plate code that is ready for use so that we can focus on our functionality of the web page now guys over here by default as you can see see this is the meta tag over here with the name that is viewport which is responsible in order to create this web page as a responsive web page so what we will do is first of all we will comment out this line over here so that we don't see a responsive web page that we are going to Define and then guys the title of this document we are going to Define it as responsive web page over here and now guys what we will be doing is first of all we will have the image so I'm going to define the image over here in which case we are going to display this image which is the thumbnail of one of the videos that we have already created so guys the directory path we are going to provide in the base tag over here so that we can refer to that particular path as the parent path so over here we provide the base tag and to the hrf we provide this directory path over here followed by the back slash in this case now guys since we have to use the horizontal scroll bar over here what we can do is we can use the word rep functionality of vs code so we have to come to this view menu over here and then you can see word RP in this case so basically we are using the word RP so that we can see the entire content on one screen without using the horizontal scroll bar over here guys this becomes important when we are having the text that is long enough that goes outside the screen width on this vs code now guys what we have to do is we need to provide the source of this image and then this is nothing but it is going to be the name of the file so let's say we want to Pro provide this file that is the image to be displayed on the web page so we provide the name of this file and the prefix that is the entire directory path is being provided in the base tag over here so we just have to provide the name of the file followed by PNG that is the extension in this case and then let's say we provide the alt attribute as test image over here which is the value so in case the image is not found over here then this test image will be displayed so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see the image is being displayed over here but guys the image is right now enlarged in this case so what we can do is let's say we only want to display the 50% of the image as the width so we provide the width as the 50% so guys this will be the 50% of the screen that will be occupied by the image over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see only 50% of the withd is being taken by the image right now over here guys what if we don't provide the extension so when we don't provide the extension so basically whatever text is being provided inside the alt attribute that text will be displayed that's because the HTML code will not be able to find this particular file because we have not provided the extension let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see test image that is the text inside the alt attribute is being displayed right now guys that is why it becomes very important that we provide the alt attribute over here so in case there are certain issues in order to find the files on the server then we can at least have the text being displayed to the user now guys what we are going to do is after this we are going to have the heading that is H1 over here and then we will say this is heading one in this case and then guys again we are going to have the paragraph and we will be having a long paragraph over here so guys for test content we are going to provide the lurm Epsom text so guys this is a long text and this is what we are going to select on the vs code so guys this is another important functionality of V code it provides a certain test data as well in order to test our web pages now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we are having the 50% width of the image that is being displayed and then we are having this is heading one that is being displayed using the edge1 tag and then we also have the P tag which is having certain content over here now guys how do we know whether this page is responsive or not so what we can do is we can press the F12 button on the keyboard so as you can see this is the Dave tools that is being opened right now over here and then on the left the second icon you can see toggle device toolbar so guys basically we are going to select this option so that we can see how this web page looks on different devices with different screen sizes so guys we just need to click over here on this particular icon so as you can see we have selected the responsive option over here we can select different options that is iPhone SE and then there are different options for the mobile phones and the tablets as well but currently we are going to see the responsive option and this is how it is being displayed right now I'll just decrease the size of this Dave console and then when we increase the size you can see that this is the perfect web page that is being displayed that is 50% of the width is being occupied by this image and then we have the heading and then we have the the paragraph as well now guys when we decrease the screen size as you can see the size of the image heading and paragraph is also decreasing up to this point and then guys what is happening is when we decrease the size more you can see that the paragraph is getting truncated now and then the heing is also getting truncated so guys this is the main issue when we are not making our web pages responsive over here when you decrease the width of the screen more as you can see now the image is getting truncated and not the entire image is being displayed right now so guys currently as you can see even the heading and the paragraph is not getting displayed properly right now not all the text is getting displayed currently so you can see this is the horizontal scroll bar that is present right now on this particular screen with very small width so guys what we can do is we can use the meta tag over here that we had just commented during the start of this video so we'll just remove the command from here and then we are going to set the view port property that is under the meta tag in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page with the same width of the responsive device over here so when we reload this page as you can see the image is now set to the 50% of this particular current with right now and then the entire heading is being displayed this is heading one and then this paragraph is also being displayed right now and there is no horizontal scroll bar right now that you can see and if I moving left and right it is not moving so guys basically this is a complete responsive page right now just by using this viewport we are making the web page responsive which will adapt itself based on the width of the screen so as you can see the image is being displayed completely even though it is very small but it is not truncating the image or the text from the right hand side so guys in this way we can easily make our web pag is responsive over here and test it by using the Dave tools under which we have the responsive option over here now guys we can make the width of the image as 100% as well so let me just do that quickly so when we do it 100% that is the width of the image let me just refresh this page once again so as you can see the entire width of the device is being taken by this particular image and when we decrease the width of this screen you can see that the image is even scaling down its width automatically so guys this is the main functionality of having the responsive page over here it automatically shrink or enlarges the content that is present inside the web page which is responsive and then to disable this view we can again click on this particular icon over here so that it can be displayed on the normal web page so guys it becomes very important to include this particular line of code that is the meta tag along with the name attribute that is viewport and then this content attribute over here which gets automatically applied when you are writing the HTML code in the VSS code so so now we will see HTM ml style guide and best practices so guys in this video we will see what are the best practices that you must follow while you are writing the code in the HTML document and the same practices you should be following when you are going to work on the big projects as well so guys a consistent clean and tidy HTML code will make it easier for others to read and understand your code and that becomes very important when you're going to work along with your other team members as well so guys are some of the guidelines that you must follow so basically you should always declare the document type as the first line in your document so guys in the vs code what we can do is simply I'll remove all the lines of code over here and simply you can type HTML and the second option that is HTML colon 5 is the one of the simplest option that you can select while creating a new web page so when you select this option you will have the entire boilerplate code that is being generated by the vs code and simply you can start writing your HTML elements inside the body after updating the title of the document now guys what is this first best practice is we need to declare the document type as the first line so over here automatically we have defined the document type over here you can see less than symbol followed by exclamation and then we have the document type and then we have HTML and then greater than symbol so guys this is nothing but the first line of the HTML document that is the document type in this case and that is one of the best practices that you must follow and it will be automatically done with the help of the vs code special feature by generating the boiler plate code now guys apart from this you must use the lowercase element names so whenever you are going to write the content inside your body tag that is let's say you want to provide the H1 tag over here simply you can provide the H1 tag as you can see so this is the lowercase HTML element that we are using and inside this we can simply Define the content that is this is heading one and then let's say we have another div element over here so again we type div and then these are the lowercase HTML elements and this is another best practice that you must follow we can say this is div one over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see the content is being displayed over here based on what we have written in our HTML document so guys the HTML elements must be always lowercase we must not use the uppercase letters so let's say over here we provide the uppercase letter that is div in this case so as you can see all these are uppercase HTML elements this will help us in order to display the content but guys this is not one of the best practices over here so when we save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see it is helping us in order to display the content but this is not the right practice in order to use the upper case letters for the HTML elements so we must avoid this and use these kinds of HTML Elements which are having all the lowercase letters as the name of the HTML element now guys we must also close all the HTML elements over here so if you notice we have created the H1 and the tip elements these are the starting tags over here and we are ending them with the ending tag which is having the forward slash over here and this is one of the best practices when we are creating the HTML elements there might be certain HTML Elements which do not have the ending tag over here so let's say when we have the input tag this tag doesn't have the ending element and that is why it is not getting automatically generated with the help of VSS code and then we also have the line break tag over here and this again is not having the ending element but what you can do is instead of having the ending element we can end them by using the forward slash over here which becomes very important when your HTML code will be by the XML or xhtml that is the other documents so guys you can end them by using the forward slash in this case just before the greater than symbol over here of the starting tag so one of the best practices is to close all the HTML elements with the ending tag over here for whichever HTML elements they are applicable now guys apart from this we must also use the lowercase attribute names so as you can see in this input tag over here we have provided the attributes and the attribute name is the the type in this case which is using all the lowercase letters over here similarly let's say inside the D we can have the class attribute so this class attribute must have all the lowercase characters over here and that is what we should be using which is one of the best practices in order to define the attributes with the lowercase letters now guys apart from this we must always quote the attribute values so by default whenever we are defining any of the attributes in the vs code you can see after this equal to symbol we are having the double codes over here so always the attribute values must be qued inside the double codes or the single codes over here in this case so as you can see the name of the class that is class name is being defined inside the double codes and then the type attribute is also having the value that is text inside the double quotes over here and that is the meaning of always quote attribute values so this is another best practice apart from that we also specify alt width and height for images so guys whenever we are going to provide the image tags over here so let's say we create the image tag in this case so we must provide the source attribute and apart from that we must be also having the alt attribute and the width and height attribute as well of the image so guys either we can have the width and height attributes directly inside the image tag or else we can also use the CSS properties as well by using the style attribute and providing the width and height properties inside the style attribute rute so these three attributes are a must when we are using the image tag in order to display the images on the web pages apart from that the spaces and the equal signs so guys basically you can see that there are no spaces before and after the equal to sign so guys providing the space characters before and after the equal sign is not one of the best practices over here so you should avoid this so as you can see we have provided the class attribute name and then we have the space character and then we have equal to and then we have another space character so Guys these space characters are useful when you are writing programs in Java or python which we have covered in the other playlist the links I have given in the description section below if you want to learn about the Java tutorial and the Python tutorial as well but in HTML these space characters are not required and these are not one of the best practices that you must follow so guys avoid having the space characters before and after the equal to operator over here whenever you are going to use the attributes inside the HTML elements guys apart from this avoid the long code lines so let's say we have the test paragraph over here so what we can do is we can simply provide the P tag in this case and then we have the test line that is lurm Epsom so guys when we use this text as you can see currently we have the view set as word r over here but when we disable this word rep as you can see this is a long text that is being written over here inside the HTML document ment so guys we must avoid this thing in order to avoid the horizontal scroll bar and we can simply use the word RAB over here and apart from this we should also avoid such large statements inside the web pages so if we see this web page how it looks let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see from left to right the entire statement is being displayed so what we can do is we can display them separately so this second line can be displayed on another another line over here so that the width of the content is limited and users find it easy to read your content on the web page so guys this is another best practice that is to have the short sentences and to avoid the long code lines over here as well now guys apart from this we should never skip the title element so inside the head element over here as you can see we have the title that is the document in this case so let me just comment out this line so guys this thing that is commenting out the title tag over here or not having the title tag at all inside your HTML document this is not one of the best practices since it is used in order to display the content on the browser tab over here so when we reload this page as you can see it is displaying the name of this file right now but this is not the best practice we should always have the title of the web page over here and we should set it to the relevant string based on the content of the web page so in this case we will say HTML style guide over here so let me just save this this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this title of the document is being displayed on the browser tab right now guys similarly we should not omit HTML and the body tags as well so we can remove this HTML and the body tags as well still it will display the web page as it is so let me just remove these text and let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see it is being displayed but guys this is not one of the best practices we should have the HTML and the body tags as as well so that there are no issues in future and all the browsers read your HTML document properly apart from this we should not omit the head tag as well so similarly we should also have the head tag over here inside which there are multiple tags that we must be defining based on our requirements and then very important thing is setting the viewport which helps us in order to make our web page responsive so guys this is the very important line of code over here that is the meta tag along with the name that is viewport inside the head tag over here which will make our web page look good on all device screens so whether it is mobile or tablet or the computer device irrespective of the size of the screen the web page content will be looking decent as far as user experience is concerned so Guys these are some of the HTML best practices from the exhaustive list of all the best practices that you must follow so now we will see form in HTML so guys basically an HTML form is used to collect user input and we are going to check this with the help of examples as well in VSS code the user input is often sent to a server for processing so guys basically we are going to see the form example with the text input and a submit button along with the labels so guys let us move to the vs code over here so in the body tag what we are going to do is we are going to define the form and before that we are going to have the paragraph tag and then we will say below content is in form we will have the form tag over here so as you can see we have the starting form tag and by default we have something called as action attribute now guys inside this action attribute the value can be the name of the file where the user input will be delivered so that further processing can be done so guys we are not going to provide any value for now over here because this is required when we are going to do some server side processing over here now guys inside this form tag first of all we are going to have the label that will Define what input the user is expected to provide so basically we are going to ask the user for first name over here so guys this is nothing but a simple text that will be displayed on the browser so first name followed by a colon in this case this for attribute is present by default and I'm going to explain you what value should come inside the for attribute in some time so guys basically this is just a label that we have defined now let me just save this file now and show you how it looks on the browser so when we reload this page as you can see below content is in form and we are getting the label that is first name over here this is a simple text that we have defined now guys we want a text box over here so that the user can provide his or her first name in the text box so what we can do is after this label we need to provide the BR tag over here so that the text field comes on the next line because the label tag is the inline element that we have defined so after this we come on the next line and then we say input and guys there are many types of input over here you can provide the button input or the checkbox or color or date or date time as well we have email input as well so in this case we are looking for something called as text input so as you can see input followed by colon and then we have something called as text over here which is the type attribute of the input tag so as you can see this is the type attribute for which the value is assigned as text over here and this will help us to provide the text box so that the user can provide its input in the field now guys this name attribute will be used when we submit this particular form and the content goes to the server on the file that will be referenced by the action attribute over here so we can give certain name to this particular input so we can simply provide F name over here and the next attribute that is ID we can simply provide it as first name in this case so guys basically we are having the name as F name and by this F name this this particular input field value will be referred by the server side script and then apart from that we also have the ID over here that is the first name now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now we are having a text box over here that will allow the user to provide the input inside the text box in this case now guys what is the importance of this four attribute over here so basically inside the label tag we have the for attribute so that the user can simply click on this first name so what will happen is the ID of the input tag that will be provided inside this for attribute will be activated so guys for now if I show you when we click on this first name nothing is happening over here as you can see the cursor is not coming over here by default inside the text box so what we can do is we can provide the ID of this text box that is first name over here I'll simply copy this and paste it inside the value for this for attribute in this case now let us save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and now if we try to click on this first name the cursor should automatically be activated inside this input field so guys let me just click over here so as you can see after clicking the cursor is activated over here and then we can simply provide the data inside the first name input field so guys this is the importance of this for attribute that helps us to attach that is to bind to a particular input field over here now guys similarly we will have another label for last name as well so what we can do is again we can provide the BR tag so that the last name can be displayed after this input text box over here and then simply I'll copy these lines of code and then paste it over here and simply we will give the ID as a last name in this case the name will be L name over here and then again we will give the ID as last name over here so that the user can simply click on this last name label so that the cursor is activated on the last name text box so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting the last name text box as well over here we have repeated the labels so I'll just correct it quickly so as you can see now we have the first name and last name over here now guys simply we can have the submit Button as well so what we can do is after this we can simply have the input tag once again and this time we will have the submit button so as you can see input colon sub submit this is the emit abbreviation that is the feature provided by the vs code over here and if you are working on simple notepad you can simply type this input tag and Then followed by the space character and then we have something called as type attribute which should be equal to the submit value over here and then guys what value we want the submit button to be displayed so over here we can simply provide the string that is submit over here so this particular text will be displayed on the button so let me just save this file now and try reload loading this page once again on the browser so as you can see submit button is being displayed over here guys you can have any text over here in this case so submit one is the value so basically the string will be updated over here on the submit button so as you can see submit one is being displayed right now so whatever value you want to have for your submit button you can assign it using the value attribute guys we will add one more V tag over here so that it looks more decent so as you can see submit button is being separated with two BR tags over here so this is a very basic form that we have created for now basically the user will be able to provide the first name and the last name and then click on the submit so what will happen is the file name that is provided inside the action attribute over here will be called and along with that the file can access this first name and last name values that is provided by the user and guys this is the main purpose of using forms in HTML we can also provide certain styling to this form so let's say we want this form to be at the center of this page so what we can do is we can come to this head element and then we can provide the style tag over here so basically we are going to provide the form tag and then we can simply use the text align property and then we can use the value as Center over here so that the form can be aligned to the center of the page let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the form is being Center aligned over here and and we can also provide the Border as well so let's say we provide the border and it is going to be 2 pixels over here which is of the type solid and then let's say we provide the color of the Border as red in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the border of this form is being given and it is a two pixels border with a red border color over here it is not looking that attractive but guys this is the basic knowledge that you should know about the forms over here in HT ml now guys apart from this we also have the other input types so for now we have checked the type that is text over here which only displays a single line text input field we also have something called as radio which helps us to display the radio button which can be used for selecting one of the many choices and then we also have checkbox which displays a checkbox for selecting zero or more number of choices and then we have also seen the submit that will help us in order to show the submit button which is used to submit the form and then we also have something called as the button similar to submit but in this case by default the button will not call the server side script that is provided in the actions so guys that is the main difference between the submit and button type over here so it basically displays the clickable button so guys all these we are going to learn in the upcoming videos as well so now we will see form attributes in HTML so guys basically there are different form attributes that we can use based on the requirements so the first form attribute is the action attribute which defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted so guys let us move to the vs code over here so we will simply remove the previous lines of code that we had written regarding the form so guys basically as you can see inside the form we have something called as action attribute over here we should be providing the file at the server site which will be responsible to handle the input that is provided by the user so guys instead of having the server s side scripting we will be handling it using the client side scripting over here so I'll just remove this entire form for now so that we get the practice once again in order to write the content of the form so guys we are Simply Having the paragraph that is below content is in form so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so this is the content so far that we have written in the HTML now guys we will have the form over here and by default as you can see the action attribute is provided and over here we are not going to have any file but for now we will be using the client side scripting that is the JavaScript over here a very basic JavaScript function will be written so no need to worry with practice you will come to know how we can write the HTML along with the JavaScript code as well guys you can subscribe to my YouTube Channel programming for beginners because I'm going to cover the JavaScript tutorial in the upcoming videos as well so you can subscribe to this Channel and click on the Bell icon so that you get the notifications on the upcoming videos as well now guys what we are going to do is we are simply going to have the input of the type text so that we have the first name text box over here so this is the input of the type text and then the name that we are going to provide is the F name and then the ID we are going to provide it as the first name over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have a text field over here but guys we should also have the label for this text field so that the user comes to know what is the input that is being expected from the user so what we can do is before this input we can simply provide the label over here and by default we are having the for attribute in this case and for this the value should be the ID of the input that we are binding this particular label with so guys basically when the user clicks on this label that is the first name over here we are going to provide this label so when the user clicks on this first name label the input that is this text field should get focused or automatically so we are going to bind it by using this ID I'll copy this and paste it inside the for attribute over here so after saving this file let me just reload this page as you can see we are getting the label that is first name and when we click on this label so as you can see the cursor is activated inside the text box field that is the first name over here now guys similarly we will have the last name as well so we are going to provide the BR tag over here and then simply we will copy and paste past these lines of code I will say last name in this case and then we have this last name over here and we also change the ID to last name in this case and the name will be L name over here so guys basically we also have the second text box in this case let me just reload this page as you can see we have the first name and the last name now now guys we are also going to have the submit button over here so let me just have another BR tag over here and then after this we will have the submit button so input followed by colon and then we have something called as submit in this case so guys basically the type value will be submit and the value that we are going to provide in this button is submit over here so that this text is displayed on the button so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see submit is being displayed over here now guys what we will do is once we click on this submit we will display the alert by using the JavaScript on this web page so what we can do is we can additionally have the onclick attribute over here so guys this onclick attribute will help us in order to call the function that we will Define inside the JavaScript so guys when we provide the on click attribute and then we need to provide the name of the function or we can also have the JavaScript code being written over here but guys it is best practice in order to have the JavaScript code separated from your HTML code over here so what we can do is we can simply call the test function in this case so we provide the name of the function that is test followed by open and close parenthesis and then guys what we have to do is we need to Define this test function somewhere so inside the head section for now we will be creating the script tag over here and this script tag will help us in order to write the JavaScript so inside the script tag we will first of all have the keyword that is function and we need to Define this function that is test so after this function keyword we have the test that is the function name followed by open and close parenthesis and then we need to provide the open and close curly braces so guys this is how we create a function inside the JavaScript we will be covering about the JavaScript tutorial as well in the upcoming videos so over here what we have to do is first of all we need to extract the value that is provided by the user inside this first name text box over here so we can simply provide document in this case followed by Dot and then get element by ID so guys any HTML element that is having ID over here we can simply call the document that is the keyword followed by Dot and then get element by ID method and then inside this we can provide the ID of that particular HTML element so in this case we are having the first name as the ID so I'll simply copy this and paste this over here and then we need to get the value inside this text box so simply we can have the dot and then value in this case followed by semicolon so so guys this will return us the value that is provided by the user inside this input text box over here now after getting this value we can store it in a variable so in the left hand side we can simply provide where keyword followed by F name over here so guys this is nothing but it is a variable which is used in order to store data now guys this variable we can use in order to provide the alert that is to display the alert so simply we can call the alert function over here and inside the alert function we can simply provide this F name over here so basically we are just displaying the first name that is provided by the user inside the form in this case so let me just provide the semicolon over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and then now we have to provide the first name and the last name so guys let me just provide programming as the first name and beginners as last name over here and then guys when we click on submit we we should see the alert that will just display the first name that is programming so when we click on this submit as you can see this page says programming over here and this is what is being displayed right now with the help of the JavaScript we are just providing the alert on the same page by taking the input from the user by using this form tag over here and in most of the cases this particular data will be sent to the server and a specific file that can be mentioned over here inside the action attribute will be responsible to handle that data so we come over here on the browser and click on okay as you can see we are getting this data on the URL as well because by default it is a get method over here so guys what is the get method we are going to check that as well now before that we also have something called as Target attribute so basically it specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form so guys basically when the user clicks on the submit button the data will go to the server and server will provide certain kind of response to the client as well so that response can either be displayed on the same browser tab or a different browser tab that is the new tab over here and that will be defined by this target attribute so guys we have already seen the target attribute previously using the anchor tag so this self value of the target attribute is set by default over here so basically the response from the server will be displayed on the same window but if we provide the target attribute value and as underscore blank over here then the response will be provided in the new tab in this case so guys you can set the value of this target based on your requirement now apart from this we also have something called as method attribute for which by default the method is get method it specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data so guys basically there are two types of method we have get and post so over here we have the method attribute and as you can see this get method is by by default in which case whatever data is being provided by the user and when the user clicks on the submit button the data will be passed to the server within the entire URL of the page so as you can see till this test.html we have this URL and Then followed by there is a question mark over here and then guys we have something called as F name and L name which we had defined as the name attributes over here inside the text Fields so those variables are being defined over here and the value are being also passed using the URL and these values are being taken from these text boxes for which the data was provided by the user and guys this is the meaning of the get method over here but in case of the post method when the value of this method is post the values will not be passed through the URL but it will be passed in the form of the HTML body parameters shortly we will see the difference between the cat and post after seeing all the attributes over here we also have something called as autocomplete attri attribute which specifies whether a form should have a autocomplete on or off and guys also we have the no validate attribute which specifies that the form data that is the input should not be validated when submitted one example for this no validate attribute can be while we are using the email IDs so we can validate on the client side whether the email ID that is provided by the user is a proper email ID or not so Guys these two attributes I'll leave up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own now guys what is what is the difference between the get and post so basically there are certain notes about the get request over here so it appends the form data to the URL in name value p and that is what we have seen over here it is appending the data in the form of name and value p over here inside the URL itself apart from that we should never use the get to send sensitive data so guys this is just the first name and last name that we are sending what if there is a username and password over here so in that case we should not be using the get request that's because anyone will be able to know what you have sent as the password over here just by looking at the URL because get method will help the data that is the username and password to be passed with the help of the URL over here and then guys the length of the URL is limited that is 248 characters only can be used it is useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result and get is good for nonsecure data as I've have told you it is good for first name and last name kind of data but not for the sensitive data such as password or any other contact details that you don't want to be disclosed so basically the nonsecure data it can also be a query strings in Google so guys if you notice when we go to Google over here and type certain string so let's say we provide football as the string over here and when we press enter as you can see after this search we have something called as the Q field over here that is a variable and the value is football and then apart from that we have more name value pads over here so this is basically the get request that is being passed over here and the response we are getting from the server which is being displayed on the browser now guys apart from this we also have something called as post request over here it appens the form data inside the body of the HTTP request and the submitted form data is not shown in the URL so this is perfect when we are sending some sensitive data such as email IDs or passwords or Fields such as contact numbers apart from that post has no size limitations and can be used to send large amounts of data and form submissions with post cannot be bookmarked over here so Guys these are certain differences as far as get request and post request is concerned so now we will see form elements in HTML so guys basically there are various form elements in HTML so one of the form elements is input tag which takes the input from the user so guys let us check this with the help of example in the vs code over over here so first of all what we will do is we will Define the paragraph by using the P tag over here and then we will say below content is in form so guys we have a very simple statement that is below content is in form and then on the next line we will Define the form tag over here so we type form and as you can see this is the Mt abbreviation that is form tag over here we are going to select this and the action attribute helps us in order to provide the name of the server side file that will be responsible in order to handle the data when this form is submitted so guys we are going to ignore this particular action attribute for now since it deals with the file that is on the server side now guys what we are going to do is we are going to Simply provide the input tag over here so that the user can provide certain input so we will provide the input tag in this case and the type will be text over here so guys basically there are multiple types for the input tag so the type text helps us to have a single line text box that will help the user to provide certain data which we can send to the server now guys we can have a particular name to this text box so let's say we provide the name value as name over here and then let's say we provide the ID as YouTube channel so guys basically we are going to provide the YouTube channel name in this particular text box and that is why we have given the ID that is YouTube channel we can modify it as YouTube channel name over here so that it becomes more specific and over here as well we will say YT and then name over here so guys basically we have provided the input text box in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see below content is in form and we are Simply Having the text box over here that will allow the user to provide certain data inside the text box in this case but guys this Standalone text box doesn't give us much idea about what kind of data is being expected from the user so basically we have another form element that is the label element which will Define the label for this input so guys what we can do is before this input we can have the label tag as well so over here we can provide the label and then guys we have something called as for attribute which will take the value as the ID of the input that we want this label to link with so guys this label will be related to this text box so we should have the ID of this text box being copied and pasted over here as the value of this for attribute so that when the user clicks on this label this particular input text field gets activated so we need to provide the label that is Youtube channel name over here so guys basically this is the simple text that will be displayed to the user so that he or she comes to know that what input is being expected to be provided inside this text box after this label we will have the line break so that the input is displayed on the next line line and over here as well we are going to have the line break in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now we have the YouTube channel name and this makes more sense since the user comes to know that inside the text box you are supposed to provide the name of this YouTube channel so guys basically this for attribute helps us in order to click on this label so that we can activate this text box over here so when we click on this YouTube channel name so as you can see the text box is being activated now and then we can simply provide the name of this YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so basically we have provided the name that is programming for beginners over here by using the simple label and the input text box now guys let us move to another element we have something called a select which helps us in order to provide the dropdown list so guys over here we can provide the select tag as well so when we provide the select tag we again have the name and the ID over here so let's say we provide the name as social media in this case so we are going to provide the list of social media platforms and the ID we will again keep it as social media so over here we will copy and paste it as the social media over here now guys what we have to do is in between the select starting and the ending tag we need to have the list of values being defined over here so simply we can have the option tag so as you can see option tag will help us in order to have the list of values that we can provide inside the select tag over here so basically the first option let us say we have YouTube as the first option in this case and then let me just copy this and paste it few times so that we can provide the different values for these options so let's say we have the second option is Facebook and then let's say the third option is Instagram over here and then let's say we have Twitter in this case so basically we have four social media platforms over here that we have defined and then guys we also have to provide the value attribute over here because this is the value that is going to be passed to the server and server will differentiate between all these list of values by using the value inside this value attribute so basically we are going to Simply have YouTube as the value over here and we can also have Facebook in this case as the value of the second option and then over here we have Instagram and for the last option we will simply have Twitter so guys basically these are nothing but the values that we have provided and these values will be used on the server side when the user clicks on the submit button these values will be passed for the list of options and guys the text that we have provided that is YouTube Facebook Instagram and Twitter over here this will be displayed at the UI site to the user so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting a drop down field over here and we need to click on this drop down field and we will get all the options in this case so by default the first option is selected over here and when we click on this we can select one of the options so let's say we select Instagram over here so when we click on this so Instagram is selected in this case so guys basically whatever value is being selected over here it will be passed to the server for further processing and again we can have the label over here so after this BR line break we will have another line break over here and let's say we provide the label in this case and this label should belong to this select tag over here so I'll just copy the ID of the select tag and paste it over here and then we will say social media platforms over here so guys we have social media platforms and then we will again have the line break so that all the options are being displayed on the next line let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting the social media platforms over here now guys by default the first option will be selected that is YouTube so how do we make this second option that is Facebook as selected over here so simply what we can do is we can come to this option that is Facebook and after the value inside the starting tag we can simply provide selected attribute over here so as you can see if present this Boolean attribute indicates that the option is initially selected so we simply provide this selected option over here let me just save this file now and when we reload this page by default you will be seeing the Facebook option that is selected in this case so when we reload this page as you can see Facebook is being selected by default and then you have to click on this option and then you will see all the list of items that are present in the drop down so guys whatever option you want to display by default as selected option you can provide the selected keyword over here in order to show that particular option selected by default so over here we have selected Twitter in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see Twitter is being selected by default over here guys similarly for the input field we can also have the value attribute over here so when we provide the value attribute we need to provide certain string over here so let's say we provide test SD string to the value attribute let me just save this file now so guys basically this test string will be displayed by default when the user reloads this page so when we reload this page as you can see test is the YouTube channel name by default and then user can provide the name of the YouTube channel based on the requirements now guys apart from this we have something called as text area which is the multiline input field so guys we can have the multiple line input field as well if you are expecting a long input from the user such as a feedback or the remarks input so guys what we have to do is inside the vs code over here we have something called as text area so as you can see this is the tag and then we can provide the name such as we can provide remarks over here and then again the ID that we are going to provide is remarks in this case and then guys we have something called as rows and calls over here so this is going to define the number of rows meaning how many number of rows vertically the text area will occupy the space and then horizontally how many columns the text area will be occupying the space so over here by default the rows are 10 and the columns are 30 in this case and then guys before this we can also have the label that is assigned to this text area so simply we will have the label and for the for attribute we are going to provide the ID of this text area so I'll simply copy the remarks ID and paste it over here and then simply we will provide the remarks label over here followed by colon and then we also have the line break over here at the end of the label and guys in between the text area tags we can provide the hint to the user we can say provide your remarks so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the multiline input field that is expandable over here so guys on the bottom right as you can see when you get the cursor it gets converted to this Arrow cursor over here and we can simply click it and drag it to the appropriate point so that we can increase or decrease the size of this particular text area and this is the hint that is provided to the user we can provide the remarks over here and we can simply say this is programming for beginers YouTube channel which I have subscribed so guys basically this is the multiline input that can be provided by the user with the help of the text area HTML element now guys apart from this we also have the button form element over here which will help us in order to display the clickable button so what we can do is simply inside the this form we can have the input tag over here followed by colon and then we have something called as button in this case so guys basically the type will be button so we have already seen the type that is text which is the input field the type button will be a clickable button and the value will be provided over here inside the value attribute which will be displayed on the button itself so for the value attribute we can simply say click me over here followed by exclamation mark So guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this click me button which is being displayed on the right and when we click on this since we have not added any JavaScript code over here nothing will happen but we can simply click on this particular button and based on our requirements carry out the actions that we want to perform now simply we can have the line break after this text area so that the button is displayed on the next line over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see over here we are getting the button that is being displayed on the UI now guys apart from this we have something called as field set and the legend as well which helps us in order to group the form elements and provide name to the form so guys this entire form that we have seen just now right from the YouTube channel name and then we have social media platforms which is the select element and then we have the remarks which is the text area and then we also have the button this entire form can be enclosed in between the field set which is nothing but grouping of the form elements so what we can do is we can have the field set tag over here so guys what we are going to do is first of all I'm going to set the word rap so that all the content is being displayed on this screen instead of using the horizontal scroll bar now after this form element over here we can simply have the field set in this case so this is the field set tag over here and I'll cut this field set ending tag and paste it after the last input that is the button over here now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting a border in this case and this is defining our form that is all the form elements are present inside this border now guys we can also give the name to this form that will be displayed over here along with the border so what we can do is we can have the legend tag over here so we provide Legend tag and we simply have to Pro provide the name of the form so let's say we provide the name of the form as test form over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see along with the Border we are getting the name that is test form over here with the help of the legend tag so guys this is the main functionality of the field set which will help us in order to group the entire content of the form and the legend tag that will give the name to that particular form so guys apart from this we also have something called as data list over here which will help us in order to display the list of the drop down options so guys what we will do is after this button we are going to have the data list over here so guys basically we are going to have the input tag over here and for this input tag instead of having the type attribute we will be having the list attribute so over here we will say list and we will give some value to this list so let's say we provide the browsers as the value to this list now guys we are supposed to define the list list of browsers which will be displayed as the drop down for this input list over here so what we can do is on the next line we can have the data list as the tag in this case and guys for this data list tag we are going to have the ID which will be equal to the value of this list attribute for this input so I'm going to copy this and paste it as the ID over here and in between this data list starting and the ending tag we are going to have the list of options so let's say the first op option over here is Chrome in this case and the value that we are going to provide is Google Chrome over here so we say Google Chrome and then after this we will have more options over here so we will say another browser as Firefox and then let's say we provide Safari as the third option and then let's say we have Edge as the fourth option so let's say over here we say Firefox Guys these values will be displayed on the UI that we provide in between the starting and the end ending tag and the values that we provide will be passed to the server so over here we have Safari as the third browser and then we have MS Edge that is Microsoft Edge as the fourth option over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have CAU another input field over here and you can see there is a drop down option in this case so when we click on this drop down option as you can see these are the options that we have are getting so guys we are getting the value as well along with it the text that we had given that is Chrome over here for Google Chrome and then we are getting Firefox Safari and Edge so guys this is another way in order to show the list of options by using the data list and binding it with the input tag by using the list attribute which will have the value as the ID of the data list tag so Guys these are certain form elements that you can use based on your requirements so now we will see input type text in HTML form so guys basically this is the format we have the type attribute in order to Define what kind of input we are expecting from the user so in this case we are going to see the type attribute for which the value is text which defines a single line text input field so guys for example if you are having a website wherein there is a registration form and you want the user to provide the full name that is the first name and last name so such input Texs with the type text can be used in order to help the user provide the first name and the last name data apart from that while you are logging in into some of the websites you will be seeing that username is one of the text fields and that is of the type text over there so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so first of all we will have a simple paragraph and then we will say below content is in HTML form so guys this is a very simple statement below content is in HTML form and then what we will do is we will Define the form over here and by default we are getting the action attribute we will ignore this particular attribute for now because we are just checking the input type that is a basic text field with the help of the input tag over here for which the type will be text so guys what we have to do is inside the form we can simply have the input followed by colon and then we can type text over here so guys this is the Mt abbreviation that is provided by the vs code which is one of the special features of the VSS code and this is the reason why majority of the software developers use VSS code as one of their editors so guys when we select this option as you can see the type is text over here and by default the input tag provides a type as text and this will be a basic text field that will be displayed on the UI so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see below content is in HTML form form paragraph is being displayed and then we are having a simple text field over here that will allow the user to provide the data over here and guys this is a very simple way in order to provide a text field by using the input tag over here with the type attribute as text value guys apart from that we can also have the label for this particular text field so what we will do is we will provide the name as F name over here which is first name and then let's say we provide the ID as first name in this case now guys this particular ID will be used inside the label tag that we are going to Define so before this input tag we will say label in this case and we are having the for attribute which will be expecting the ID of the input tag that we want to link this particular label tag over here so what we will do is we will copy the ID that is first name and paste it as the value for this for attribute and then we will give the label as first name in this case so we have given the first name label over here after the label we will provide the line break in this case so that we can see the text field on the next line over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see first name label is being provided over here and this is a basic text field that is being displayed right now and guys what is the importance of this for attribute so as you can see when we click on this first name the cursor will be activated inside this text field which is linked to this first name label so when we we click on this as you can see now we can provide the first name and we can type the first name over here inside the text field in this case now guys similarly we can also have the last name over here so what we can do is simply I'll copy this lines of code and paste it after the first input tag over here and then simply we can change the ID to last name in this case and over here as well we will change the ID to last name over here the name will be changed to L name we will update the label as well to last name in this case let let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got the last name as well so when we click on this last name the text field is automatically activated over here and user can provide the required data in this particular text field as well now guys what happens when we provide the incorrect IDs for this for attribute so let's say we provide the last name ID to this first label over here and the first name ID to the second label over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page now what will happen is when we click on this first name since this first name is now linked to the second input field the cursor on the second input field will get activated when we click on this first name over here as you can see the cursor in the second input field is getting activated and whatever we type will be displayed in the second input field and when we click on this last name over here so when we click on this as you can see the cursor is getting activated on the first input field so guys that is the importance of providing the correct ID inside this for attribute so whichever input field we want to get activated we should provide the ID of that input field to this for attribute over here inside the label tag and Guys these are certain things you should know as far as input type of text is concerned so over here we are clicking on the correct label and the cursor is getting activated in the required input field over here this text field will be used a lot when you are going to work on the real projects as well so now we will see input type password in HTML form so guys basically we can have the input tag and we can set the value of the type attribute over here as password so that whatever content you type inside this particular input field will not be displayed on the UI and the main use case over here is when you are logging in into a particular website you are providing your username and when you type the password you don't want someone else to see while you're typing it on the screen and that is where we use the input type password over here which defines the password field in this case so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so previously we had checked the input type that is text which allows us to provide certain kind of input with the help of a text field and this is how we can see the text field over here so guys what we will do is we will make some changes in this case so we will remove the second input field over here we will keep the first label as username in this case so we will change the label to username over here and the input type will be text and we will set the name as username which will be used by the server in order to refer to the value provided into this text field and the ID that we provide over here will be username in this case and as I've told you the ID of this input must be set as the value for the for attribute over here for the label so that when the user clicks on this username label the cursor for this text field will be activated so we change this to user name in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have a simple text field over here with a username label and when the user clicks on this username this particular text field will get activated and we can simply provide the username for the login purpose now guys what we will do is we will have another field over here which will be the password field but we want that field to be of the type password so that whatever we type inside that particular text field will not be displayed over here since password should be secret so what we will do is I will simply copy and paste these lines of code over here that is label and input and for this input that is the second input over here we will change the type to password in this case so as you can see the type is equal to password and the name we will change it to password over here here and then the ID as well we will change it to password in this case now guys this particular ID should be linked to this label so I'll copy this ID and paste it inside the for attribute over here and the label should be password in this case so we have changed the label as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got the password text field as well now guys because we have set the type as password over here whatever we type type inside this password text field will not be displayed to the user so when we start typing over here inside this text field so over here we are not able to see the characters that I am typing right now but the same thing when we type over here in the username you can see that we can type anything that we want and we can see it inside the text field over here so guys this is the main functionality of the input type password over here it doesn't allow anyone else to see what exactly you are typing inside that text box now guys when we are working of sending of this data that is username and password it is recommended that we use the post request over here so for example let's say we have another input that is the submit button over here so we will say input type submit and then the value that we provide is submit in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have provided submit button in this case so guys when we click on the submit Button as you can see username is equal to so some data will be sent sent over here that's because by default the method for this form tag is get request so we have another attribute over here that is method for which there are two values that we can use the get request which is by default the value that is set for this method attribute and that is what we are using right now over here and the post request which will help us in order to hide this data so by default the get request is being called over here so what exactly is happening I'll show you once again over here we will reload this page and let's say for username we provide username over here and for password we provide simple password in this case but guys when we click on submit over here as you can see the username is equal to username that was provided and password is equal to you can see that what I have typed over here is being displayed inside the URL so we should avoid this whenever we are dealing with submission of the form and that form contains some sensitive data so how we can avoid it is by using the post request over here so when we provide the post method and the request goes to the particular file that we Define in the action attribute in such case the username and password data will be sent as part of the HTTP request so guys it won't be displayed inside the URL over here so let me just save this file once again and try reloading this page on the browser so now if we provide the username in this case and then let's say I provide some password over here and click on submit as as you can see the URL is not displaying the username and password over here but it will be passed to the server as the HTTP request so in such cases when the passwords needs to be validated or if there is any sensitive data that is supposed to be sent on the server side we must use the post request over here by mentioning it to the method attribute of the form tag so that our sensitive data is protected from any other viewer who is trying to submit the form so guys this is the way that we can create the password text field using the HTML form so now we will see input type submit in HTML form so guys basically we can use the input tag along with the type attribute whose value can be submit in order to display the submit button so basically it defines a button for submitting the form data to a form Handler so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so basically inside the form if you want to submit the form data we can use this submit button over here so first of all we will have a paragraph and it will say below content is in HTML form so guys we have a very simple statement over here below content is in HTML form and then guys we will be defining the form over here so as you can see by default we are getting the action attribute in this case for which the value should be a server side file which will be handling the input that is provided by the user in the text Fields inside this form so guys what we will be doing is we we will provide the text field for the username so basically we are going to have the input and Then followed by colon we are going to have text over here so as you can see the type is set to text in this case so basically it is going to display a normal text field over here and then we will say username as the name attribute and the ID attribute as username once again now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see below content is an HTML form and and then we are getting the text field over here now guys we must also have the label that is associated to this text field so what we will do is before the input tag we will have the label tag over here and then we will bind this input tag with the help of the ID so we will copy this ID and paste it as the value for this for attribute over here for the label tag so guys I'll paste this ID for the for attribute and over here we will give the label as username in this case and then we will also give the braks for both the tags over here so guys basically we have defined the label over here for the username now guys we can also set a default value for this username text field so we also have something called as value attribute which can help us to provide the default value inside this text field when the user loads this page so we can simply provide user as the default value in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see username is the label and we are getting the default value that is user in this case and when the user clicks on the label or the text field the user will be able to edit this text field over here so we can simply provide our own username that we had used in order to register on a particular website now guys apart from this let us also provide the password text field over here so we will simply copy and paste these lines of code and then for this type we are supposed to change it to password in this case for the name attribute we will change it to password and ID as well we will change it to password over here and in this password text field we don't need any value because user will be providing his or her own password in the text field so we are going to remove the value part and then we will also provide the label as password over here and once again we are going to link this label with this input type that is password so I'll copy the ID inside the for attribute of the label so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have two Fields username and password now comes the most important part that is how we can create the submit button so guys basically we can have the input tag with the type submit over here so that the username and password that is provided by the user can be sent on the server for further processing so what we can do is again over here we have to provide the input and this time it should be of the type submit so as you can see input colon we have something called a submit over here this is the emit abbreviation that is provided by the vs code so guys basically type A submit and for this value attribute we can provide the text that we want to display on this submit button so guys simply we can provide submit in this case so the submit text will be displayed on the button so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see this is the submit button that we have created with the help of this type attribute for which the value is submit over here now guys when the user clicks on this submit the username and password will be passed to the server side for further processing so let's say we provide some username over here so we say programming and then let's say we provide test password over here so we say test password in this case so over here the data is masked that's because the password type of the input field doesn't allow us to see what data is being provided by the user so let me just click on submit over here so as you can see in the URL we are getting the username is equal to programming and password it is equal to test password over here and guys this is the way that the form is submitted by using the submit value for the type attribute in the input tag guys it is important that whenever you are submitting the form if it contains any sensitive data such as in this case we have the password field it is recommended that we send the data using the post method so by default inside the form the method attribute is having the the value as get and for that reason we will see all the form data being passed in the URL over here which is not the best practice as far as security is concerned so guys basically we can have the method attribute in this case and then we can say post over here so that whatever form data is present it is sent as part of the HTTP request inside the body and not as the URL over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we provide the username and password over here so let's say I provide username and then password is let's say password test in this case and when we click on submit over here now there is no URL change this time that's because we have provided the form data by using the post request over here and all the data is going as the part of body of the HTTP request so guys this is the way that we can easily create the submit button inside the form by using the type attribute for which the value can be submit for the input tag so now we will see input type reset in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type value as reset will Define a reset button that will reset all the form values to their default values so guys let's say for example you have multiple text fields in a particular form and then when the user tries to enter some data and wants to reset all the data that is clear the data in such cases it would be very helpful in order to provide a button that will help the user to reset all the data and this input tag with the type reset will help us to do the same so let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so guys previously we had seen that we had provided the username text field along with that we had also provided the password text Fields along with their labels and then we had also provided the submit button we had provided the value that is user by default to the username text field so let me show you how it looks on the browser so this is the content of the previous code that we had return so we have a normal username and then we have the password and then we have the submit button in which case we can simply provide the username over here and we can also provide the password which will not be displayed to the user or any other person who is seeing your screen and then we have the submit button now guys let's say the user wants to clear all this data what we can do is simply we can have the input tag along with the type value which is reset over here so guys let me just Define that as well so we provide input followed by colon and then we have something called as reset over here guys this is the m abbreviation that we can use in the vs code over here as you can see input type reset will be autogenerated when we type this so if you're working on any other text editor such as notepad or notepad++ you need to manually type all these characters over here as you can see inside the tag we have the type attribute and the other attributes as well but if you are working with the V s code you can make use of this emit abbreviation over here so we click on this particular option as you can see this is the tag that is input followed by type attribute and then we have the reset value as the type now guys we can also have the value on this button to be set so either we can say reset or we can simply say clear over here so basically this is the text that will be displayed on the button in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got the clear button over here now guys let's say I want to increase some spacing in between the submit and the clear button so what we can do is after this input of type submit button in this case we can have ENT and then nonbreaking space that is nbsp so guys basically this is helpful when you want to add certain space characters in between the HTML elements and to avoid them to break into multiple lines so over here when we select this nonbreaking space let me just save this file now and after reloading this page you will be noticing that the space between the submit and the clear button will increase over here so when we reload this as you can see the space got increased in this case and based on how many space characters you want you can provide the nonbreaking space characters over here after the submit button now guys what happens when we click on the clear button so for now there is no data in the username and the password fails and that is why we are not seeing any results over here but when we provide certain data so let's say we provide username and let's say we provide some test password over here and then either we can click on submit but let's say if we have provided some incorrect data over here in multiple Fields inside the form so simply we can click on clear over here so when we click on clear as you can see all the text boxes are cleared now and they will be having their default values if they have any so over here basically we have the user value as the default value inside the username that is we are getting that value but if we remove this value that is user from here then that content will be also removed so let me just refresh this page once again over here and when we provide the data once again that is username in this case and then let's say we provide password over here and then when we click on this clear button as you can see the text Fields got cleared and that is the main functionality of this reset value for the type attribute inside the input tag so now we will see input type rate video in HTML form so guys basically we can have the input tag and inside that we can have the type attribute value as radio which defines a radio button now guys what is a radio button so basically radio buttons let a user select only one of the limited number of choices so you will be having a list of choices and then you need to select only one element from that list of choice and for this purpose we can use the radio button inside the HTML form so guys guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so previously we had seen how we can set the input type as text over here then we have also seen the input type that is password we have also seen the input type that is submit and reset buttons over here and this is how the page looks like that is username which is a text field and then we have the password field over here and then we can have the submit button or the clear button in order to clear the data now guys over here we will be having the list of options that you you can select by using the radio buttons so let me just move to vs code over here and first of all we will have a simple paragraph and then we will say select your favorite web language so guys we have a very simple statement that is select your favorite web language over here and then we are going to have the radio buttons in this case so basically we are going to have the input tag and Then followed by colon and then we are going to have the radio option in this case so as you can see the type must be set to radio over here and then we can set the name and ID so guys let's say we provide the name as language over here and the ID let's say we provide HTML as the ID so basically this is a radio button that will be representing the option that is HTML over here I'll correct the spelling of language in this case and then guys we will be having two more options that is CSS and JavaScript so these are some of the web languages that we can select from so we have the ID that is CSS and then we have we have something called as JavaScript ID over here so Guys these are three radio buttons that we have defined let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting select your favorite web language we are getting the radio buttons in this case and when we click on this we can only select one of all these three options we cannot select multiple options over here now guys it doesn't make any sense because we are not getting to see the options in the form of the text string over here so what we can do is we can provide the labels to this radio buttons so after the first radio button over here we need to provide the label tag in this case and over here in the for attribute we can provide the ID of this HTML radio button so I'll copy this ID and paste this over here and then we can say I like HTML so guys this is the label that will be defined just besides the radio button that is the first radio button and then guys we want the second radio button to come on the next line so what we can do is after this label we can have the line break tag over here so we can have the BR tag in this case and then once again we will be having the label for the CSS and JavaScript as well so I'll simply copy this line of code and paste this over here and we will copy the ID as well and we will paste it to the for attribute in this case and then we will say I like CSS and guys once again we will copy the label tag over here for the third radio but button and then we will copy the JavaScript as well that is the ID and paste it for the for attribute of the label and then we will say I like JavaScript in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see we have some text string as well which is more sensible in order to select one of the options from this list of radio buttons over here and guys since we have provided the label tag and we have linked all those label tags with their respective input radio buttons over here we can simply click on this text string as well to select that particular radio button so let's say if I click on this I like HTML so when we click on this you can see that the radio button is selected over here and then when we click on this I like JavaScript over here so when we click on this this particular option is selected and once again when we click on I like CSS so the second radio button is selected over here so guys basically either you can use the radio radi buttons or we can also use the text over here since we have linked these labels to the radio buttons that are displaying on the left so guys this is the main functionality of having the radio buttons over here in order to select one of the options now guys it is important to note that for all the radio buttons we have provided the name attribute as same that is the language value but what if we provide the different values over here let's say I provide the name value as language one for CSS and language two for JavaScript now guys what will happen in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now if I select I like HTML so HTML option is getting selected but when we click on this I like JavaScript over here as you can see the third option is also getting selected over here the first option is also activated since we had selected it previously and if we select this I like CSS as well so this option is also getting selected so guys this is because we have kept the names as different for all the radio buttons so over here we have kept as language then we have language one and then we have language two so in order to make the user to select only one of the options from all these options you need to keep the name value as the same for all the radio buttons that you are referring to so let's say if I change the name of this particular JavaScript option to language over here now we have the radio buttons for the HTML and JavaScript that belongs to the same name so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we select I like HTML so the first option is getting selected but when we select the I like JavaScript so third option is getting selected and the first option was deselected over here so we can select one of the options in this case but in the second option for which we have kept the name as language one over here we can select it and we can see that the third option is still getting selected over here that's because for the second option as as well we need to keep the name value as same so when we change the value to language over here so all the three radio buttons are now having the same value of name attribute in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so now you can select any one of the options from all these three options in this case so guys that is the importance of having the same value of the name attribute for all the radio buttons that you want to display but only want one option to be selected so now we we will see input type checkbox in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type attribute that is having the value as checkbox will Define a checkbox on the UI now guys what do you mean by checkbox so basically checkboxes let a user select zero or more options of a limited number of choices so either you don't have to select any of the options or you can select one option or multiple options as well that is present inside the list of choices as part of check boxes over here so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so previously we had seen the input types that is text and then we had also seen password we had seen the submit and the reset button over here and also we had seen the list of radio buttons out of which only one option can be selected and this is how the page looks like on the UI now guys this is not one of the best designs in HTML that's because we are having the submit and clear button in between which should be present at the end of the form over here at the bottom so guys what we will be doing is we will move these two buttons that is reset and submit buttons at the end of the form over here so I'm simply going to cut those lines of code and paste it over here now let me just save this file now enter I reloading this page so as you can see now we are having the submit and the clear buttons at the end now guys what we will do is after this list of radio buttons we will be having the list of check boxes as well so over here I'll simply remove the extra line break tags over here and then guys after the radio buttons what we will be doing is we will be providing the check boxes so over here simply we will provide the input followed by colon and then we have something called as checkbox over here now guys this is the Mt abbreviation which is one of the features of the vs code that we are using if you are using any other editor such as notepad or notepad++ then you have to manually type the entire content inside this tag along with the type attribute for which the value will be check boox over here now guys let us set the name as vehicle in this case so we will say vehicle one and then let's say we provide the ID as bike over here now guys similarly we will have two more options and these options will be car and boat over here so we will change the name to vehicle 2 and vehicle three in this case and the ID over here will be car and then the third option it will be boat in this case so we have just set the ID that is bike car and boat for all all these three options now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are getting the three check boxes over here if you click on them these are getting selected in this case let me provide some line breaks before and after these check boxes so over here we will provide the line break and then over here as well we have to provide the line brakes so that we can see the check boxes properly so let me just reload this page once again so these are the three options that we can see on the UI now guys it doesn't make sense in order to see only those checkboxes so we can associate them with the labels as well so just like how we had done for the radio buttons over here we will be having the labels for the check boxes as well so simply after the check boox we need to provide the label so this label will be for the ID that is bike so we are going to copy this ID that is bike and provide it as the value for this for attribute to the label so that this particular label tag can be linked to the first the checkbox over here so guys we are going to provide the B and then after providing the value for this four attribute we can simply provide the label so we can say I have a bike now similarly we will have the labels for the other two checkboxes as well so we will be providing the line break once again over here after the label and we will simply copy the labels for the car and boat as well and then we will change the IDS so for the second checkbox label we will copy the ID over here and then we will say I I have a car and then this ID that is the third option we are going to set it as the for attribute for this last label and then we will say I have a boot in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see we have the list of check boxes over here which are being displayed we can either select a zero of them or one or multiple of the options so in this case when we select I have a bike so this option is getting selected and let's say if you have the car as well so you can select this option also that is I have a car so we can click on the label as well in order to select this option so as you can see I have a car is getting selected you can also select I have a boat as well so this option is getting selected over here if you want to deselect any of the options you can click on that particular option once again so this option is getting deselected in this case so guys this is the main functionality of the checkboxes either you can select zero one or mult multiple of the options that are present as the list of check boxes we can also have the label before the list of check boxes over here so what we can do is simply we can have the paragraph in this case and then we can say select the mode of Transport that you own so guys basically we have a very simple statement over here and then let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see select the mode of Transport that you own and then we have these three options over here so you can select any of of the options based on your choices so now we will see input type button in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type attribute for which the value that is set as button will Define a simple button inside or outside the HTML form so you can either Define this button inside the HTML form or outside the HTML form as well so let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so guys previously we had seen some of the input fields that is the text field field and then we have also seen the password field as well we have also seen the list of radio buttons as well along with it we had also seen the checkboxes list as well and then apart from that we had seen the submit and the reset input tags as well and this is how the UI looks like so we have the text field the password field and then the list of radio buttons then the list of checkboxes submit button and the clear button as well now guys what we are going to do is after this list of check boxes we will be having a simp button over here that will help us in order to display the alert so what we can do is after the list of check boxes over here simply we will have the input and Then followed by colon and then we will have the button over here so guys this is the m abbreviation as you can see so this is the feature that is provided by the vs code so we can simply have the input tag along with the type attribute that is button and the value attribute will have the value which will be displayed on the button so let's say we want to display click me over here so guys basically this particular text will be displayed on the button so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we are getting the click me button over here now guys we can apply our own styling over here with the help of the style attribute or we can also have the external CSS file as well so if we want to provide certain styling so let's say I provide the style attribute over here and let's say we want to provide the background color as red in this case and the font color is white so over here we will say color as white in this case so guys basically we are defining The Styling properties over here I'll just select the word RP options so that we can see the entire tag on one screen instead of having the horizontal scroll bar now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the background color of the button is changed to red and then we are getting the text color as white over here so guys when we click on this button nothing is happening so it is a part of JavaScript tutorial that we will be seeing in the upcoming videos as well so when we click on this button if we want it to react in a certain way based on our requirements we need to write certain code in the JavaScript so what we can do is for now over here we will be having the onclick attribute so when we say onclick we can provide certain small JavaScript code over here that will be triggered when we click on this particular button so let's say we provide Alert in this case and then inside the open and close parenthesis we simply provide certain string so let's say we provide subscribe to programming for beginners which is the name of the YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so in order to learn a lot about the HTML and the upcoming web Technologies as well so guys basically this is a string that will be displayed inside the alert box over here subscribe to programming for beginners so let me just save this file now and when the user clicks on this button the alert should be displayed so let me just reload this page once again on the browser and now when we click on this button so as you can see this page says subscribe to programming for beginners so this is a kind of a alert that is being displayed over here on this particular browser and guys this is a part of a JavaScript by using the JavaScript code we can make this alert display on the web browser over here and this is a very basic button that we have seen so far we can also remove remove the styling properties over here so I'll quickly remove the styling properties so that it looks like a normal button in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have a very simple button in this case and when we click on this button again the alert is being displayed over here so whenever the user will click on the button based on the function that we have return over here that function will be called based on the requirement of the project so now we will see input type color in HTML form so guys basically the the input tag along with the typee attribute color is used to display the Color Picker from where you can pick the colors now guys depending on the browser support a Color Picker can show up in the input field over here so it depends on your browser the users browser that is being used in order to display your web page so guys whenever you are going to use the input tag along with the type value as color you need to test on the different browsers in order to check whether that particular browser supports the Color Picker or not so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so previously we had written these lines of code over here which we will remove for now and then what we will do is simply we are going to have the Color Picker so basically we are going to have the label as well and then after the label we will have the input and then colon and then we have the color in order to have the type value as color over here now guys what we will do is depending on the users selection of the color we will change the background color of the entire page so we will have the name value as BG color over here so that it defines that we are going to change the background color by using this Color Picker and then similarly we will have the ID as the BG color over here and then we are going to copy this ID for this four attribute of the label tag so we are simply going to copy this ID that is BG color over here and then we will say select your background color and Then followed by a colon now this input tag will help us in order to show the Color Picker on the browser so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser over here so as you can see below content is in HTML form and you can see select your background color and by default black color is being displayed over here and when you click on this Color Picker as you can see you can change the color over here so you can also see that we can change the color to blue green or yellow colors as well and similarly based on your requirements you can set the color now guys by default the color that is being displayed over here is black so when we reload this page you can see that the color is black over here so what we can do is we can have the value attribute as well inside the input tag so we can simply provide the value and let's say we want the default color to be red over here so what we can do is simply we can provide the hex value of red color which is Hash character followed by 2 * F and then 4 * 0 so guys basically this is the first comp that is the red component in the hex color and Then followed by the green component which is zero and Then followed by two digits that is blue component which is again zero over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see now we have the red color by default and when we click on this red color you can see that we can select any of the color that we want and then we can also drag this Color Picker over here and then accordingly the red green and blue components over here will be updated based on the selection of the colors in this case now guys what we are going to do is once we select the color over here we are going to set the color as the background color of this entire page so we need to add some JavaScript code over here so we will come to this head section and then we will Define the script tag in this case and then guys we are going to define a function so we are going to type function keyword followed by the name of the function so guys if you are not aware about the JavaScript don't worry we are going to write a very simple JavaScript function over here that will help us in order to just change the background color of the web page so this is the keyword that is function that we use in order to define the function followed by the name of the function and then we have the open and close parenthesis we are going to learn a lot about the JavaScript in the JavaScript tutorial videos that is going to be followed after the HTML tutorial so guys please make sure that you subscribe to this channel that is programming for beginners so that you get the notifications on the up coming videos as well now guys inside the curly braces what we have to do is we need to get the value of the color that we have set by using the input tag over here so simply we are going to define the variable by using the V keyword followed by the name of the variable that is color and the way that we get the value is by using the document keyword followed by Dot and then we have something called as get element by ID over here and then inside the parenthesis we provide the ID that is BG color in this case so guys we provide the ID over here followed by Dot and then we have something called as value so guys basically this particular line of code will help us in order to extract the color that we have set over here by default the color will be red but whatever color we set on the browser it will be extracted by using this line of code and that color will be saved in this variable now guys we just have to provide this variable to the background color property of this page over here so what we can do is again we can Define the document keyword followed by Dot and then this time we are going to use the body tag over here and then followed by dot inside the body tag we have something called as style because the background color property is present inside the style property so we are going to use the style property followed by Dot and then we have the background color over here so as you can see once we are typing vs code is suggesting us various attribut that can be used so over here we are going to use this background color in this case and then equal to we are going to provide this variable name that is color over here followed by semicolon so guys we have defined a function inside the JavaScript that will help us in order to set the background color of the body of the web page by getting the value from this input tag over here that we have defined as the color Pier now guys what we have to do is simply we need to call this function so so basically once you are selecting the color using this Color Picker we are going to have a button over here so simply we are going to have the line Brakes in this case and then we will Define the simple button over here so we say input colon button and this time we will say click me as the value of this button and what we have to do is when the user clicks on this button we need to call this test function over here so we can have the on click attribute in this case so we will say onclick attribute over here and simply we are going to provide the name of the function that is test followed by open and close parenthesis so guys once we click on this particular button that is having the value as click May the JavaScript function that we have written with the name that is test will be called and the color will be extracted from the Color Picker that we have set and then the background color will be set using that particular color that we have set now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so so as you can see we have the select your background color and red color is being displayed over here so when we click on this and let's say I want to change the color to Yellow so I drag it over here and then let's say I want this particular shade of color and then what we have to do is simply we can click somewhere else since the color is already set over here in the Color Picker and in order to set the background color of this web page simply we need to click on this button that is Click me over here so when I click on this as you can see the background color of this web page is updated again if we want to update the background color to let's say green color in this case we will set it to light green and then when we click on this click me as you can see it is set to light green color now that is the background color of this web page so guys in this way we can easily use the Color Picker to select one of the colors from the Color Picker over here so let me just reload this page once again so in order to set the background color is red simply we can click on this button that is Click me so this particular red color is already set over here in order to set the color as blue in this case so we will change it to light blue over here and then when we click on this button as you can see the color of the background is updated now so now we will see input type date in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type attribute that is date is used for input fields that should contain a date so basically inside a HTML form or it can be outside the HTML form as well if you want to show a input field that should allow the user to select one of the dates you can use the input tag along with the type attribute that is date over here now guys it is very important that you test the input tag with the type date on the different browsers because depending on the browser support a date picker can show up in the input field most of the latest browsers will be showing the date properly but some of the old browsers will not show the date properly so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so previously we had seen how we can provide the input tag with the type color in order to have the Color Picker on the page over here now guys after this Color Picker we are going to have the input field with the type date as well so what I'm going to do is we are going to have the input followed by colon and Then followed by date over here so guys this is the input tag that we are going to use along with the type date in this case we are going to set the name attribute as birth date and then similarly we will copy this birth date and set it as ID as well for the same input tag over here now guys what we will be doing is we will also have the label in this case so let's say we Define the label and this label will be for this ID that is birth date so I'm going to copy this and paste this for the four attribute of the label and then we will say select your birth date in this case followed by colon so guys the user is supposed to select the date of birth by using this date picker and then guys we will also have the line breaks in this case so we will have the couple of PR tags as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser over here so as you can see select your birth date label is being displayed over here and then we have this date picker in this case now guys when the user clicks on this date picker he or she will be having the option to select one of the dates over here so when the user selects this 17th date in this case so it will be set as 17th December 2023 guys you can also change the month and year over here so as you can see the month that is December and the year that is 2023 is being displayed over here you can scroll down and see the future dates as well so let's say we select the 16th date over here so it is 16th of February 2024 so in similar way you can also select one of the past dates as well and let's say if you want to select one of the past dates that is in the 2000 year so we can simply click on this particular drop down arrow and then you can see that the ear are also getting mentioned and we can scroll up a little bit so that we can see the year 2000 in this case so as you can see this is the year that is 2000 and in the month of January let's say you want to select the date as 20 so when you select this as you can see 20th January 2000 date is being displayed over here and guys this is the very simple way that you can show the date picker to the user in order to select the date now guys what we will do is once the user clicks on this button that is Click me we want to extract the value that is being set by the user and show it as a alert on the web page over here so what we will be doing is we already have the input that is of the type button in this case and onclick attribute is pointing to this test function over here in the JavaScript so we simply have to change some lines of code over here inside the JavaScript so we will be removing these lines of code and let's say we provide the variable which will be storing the date that is being selected Ed by the user so guys we need to get the value that is being selected by the user on this particular date picker by using the ID so I'm going to copy this ID and over here we are going to use the document keyword followed by Dot and then get element by ID so guys this is a very basic JavaScript that we are writing over here and we are going to cover a lot about the JavaScript tutorial as well in the upcoming videos so make sure that you subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on the upcoming videos as well so after this we are going to have parenthesis and then inside the double codes we are going to have the ID that is birth date over here followed by Dot and then we will say value in this case in order to extract the value of the date that is selected by the user now simply we can use the alert function in this case so we type alert and then inside the parenthesis we have double codes and then we say birth date is followed by colon and simply we have to provide a plus operator because we are concatenating two strings in this case and Then followed by we need to provide the date variable which is storing the date that is being selected by the user so guys we provide the date variable in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now guys whatever date user selects over here and when the user clicks on this button that is Click me we will be able to see the alert that will have that same date that was selected by the user now guys let us us select one of the dates in this case so let's say the user selects the date from one of the years that is 2005 over here so when we select 2005 and let's say it is the month of April and then let's say the date is 15th in this case so it is 15th of April 2005 and then when we click on this button that is Click me as you can see birth date is 2005 that is the year is being displayed followed by the month which is 04 Then followed by the date that is 15 over here so guys in this way we can also use the value that is being set by the user on this date piaker guys apart from this we also have some more attributes that is min and Max in order to restrict certain dates so let's say if we want the user to select only specific dates let's say from the Year 2005 and only from the month of April so what we have to do is simply we have to come over here in the input tag of the type date and then we have something called as main add attribute over here now guys inside this main attribute we have to provide the minimum date that the user can select so it is 205 followed by hun and then 04 and then we have 15 so guys this is the format that is being used right now so if I show you once again when we click on this this is the format that we should be using so let me just copy it from here and I'll paste it once again in this case so that there is no issues with the format so over here we will paste it similarly we will set the me Max attribute as well so we type the max attribute followed by the date so guys in this case we will be having the date as let's say 20th of April so over here we will set it as 2005 and the month is 04 and the date is 20 now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now this time since we have set the minimum and maximum values of the dates as you can see the April that is 04 and 2005 that is the Year is already set over here and we will will only get the option to select the dates between the 15 to the 20th day of that particular month and year because that is the restrictions that we have put by using the Min and the max attributes over here so guys in this way you can also allow the user to only select the dates that are ranging in between the Min and the max values you can also have just the minimum value so that the user does not select the date before this particular value or you can also have just the max value as well so that the user does not select any of the values which is having the date higher than the max value so guys I'll leave that exercise up to you so that you can practice on your own as a homework for you so now we will see input type date time local in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type attribute that is date time local will help us to specify the date along with the time as well as the input field with no time zone so basically whatever time is being selected by the user it will be the local time for that particular user over here now guys it depends on the browser support so you need to test this particular input tag on the different browsers in order to check whether some of the older browsers are still showing the input type with the date time picker or not so guys some of the older browsers might not support this particular type attribute but majority of the latest browsers will be able to show this date time picker so let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so basically previously we had seen how we can use the Color Picker by using the type that is color and also we have seen the date picker by using the type that is date this time we will be using the type that is date time local over here so again we will be defining the input followed by colon and this time we will be using this date time local over here so when we select this as you can see the type attribute is being selected as the date time local in this case and then then for the name attribute we will set it as date time over here so guys this is the name attribute and for the ID attribute as well we will set the string that is date time in this case and before this input we will also set the label as well so that the user is able to select the date as well as the time from this particular date time picker now guys for the four attribute we will set the ID of this datetime picker as the for attribute in this case so I'll simply paste this datetime string and then we will say select date time over here so we have select date time followed by colon and then guys after this input tag we will also have the couple of line braks so that the next button that is having the value click me will be displayed on the other line now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have select a date time as the label and Then followed by the date time picker over here now guys we are having the date along with that we are are also having the time picker as well so as you can see we can select the time as well along with the date and the difference between the date and the date time local type is that for the simple date picker we can only select one of the dates over here but for the date time picker we can also select the time in this case so guys this is the basic difference between the type attribute that is date and the type attribute that is date time local over here so in case you have the requirement of setting the time as well you can use the date time local in this case so we can select one of the dates in this case so let's say we select 15th of December 2023 and the time is 18 over here so 18 0 0 so guys in this case we are setting the date as well as the time over here as you can see now guys let us say when we click on this button that is Click me we want to see the date as well as the time in the alert box so what we have to do is already we had return return the code over here that is having the on click attribute for this button that is Click me we are calling the test function that is already written in the JavaScript so guys this is a very basic function that we have written over here what we are doing is we will be getting the value of the datetime Picker and we will show that value inside the alert function so we simply have to set the ID that is date time over here and then we have to provide the alert that is date time is and Then followed by the variable in which the date time is being selected in this case so guys let me just save this file now Ander try reloading this page once again on the browser I'll select the date as 10th of December 2023 and then let's say the time is 1805 over here so when we set this 1805 in this case you can see that the date and time is being selected over here and when we click on this button that is Click me as you can see we are getting the year that is 2023 followed by the month that is 12 and Then followed by the date that is 10 and then guys we have this character that is T which is separating the date as well as the time time and then after this character we have the time that is 18 which is the hour and the 05 which is the minute in this case so guys in this way you can easily select the date time by using this date time picker over here let me change the timing in this case so we set the time is 2016 over here and then let's say we select the date is 20th of December so guys we have 20 December 2023 and then the time is 2016 so when we click on this button that is Click me over here you can see that we we have the 20th December 2023 date as well as the time that is set as 2016 over here as the alert so guys in this way you can easily use the datetime Picker based on your requirements so now we will see input type email in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type email is used for input fields that should contain an email address so if you want the user to provide his or her email address you should be using the input tag along with with a type that is email over here and basically it is also having the builin validation that will be used in order to validate whether it is the proper email format that is provided by the user now guys you need to test this particular feature on different browsers because depending on the browser support the email address can be automatically validated when submitted so not all the browsers will validate whether the email is being correctly provided by the user but some of the latest browsers will help you in order to validate the email IDs that is provided by the user now guys some of the smartphones as well recognize the email type and add the Doom to the keyboard to match the email input so you will be noticing the Doom button on your keyboard when you are typing and providing your email address on some of the websites and this is one of the important features in the smartphones that can help the user in order to quickly provide the input so guys let us check this with the help of example samples and vs code so previously we had seen the different input Fields such as Color Picker then we had also seen date picker date time picker as well now we will see the input tag with the type email over here so guys simply we will provide the input followed by colon and then we have something called as email over here which is the Mt abbreviation so when we select this the type attribute will have the email value for this input tag now guys let us say we provide the name as email over here and same value we provide to ID attribute as well that is email in this case and we also have to provide the label so before the input tag we provide the label and for the for attribute we set the ID of this particular input tag that is email as the value for this for attribute now guys simply we can have the statement that is provide your email as the label over here followed by colon in this case so guys in this way we can allow the user to provide the email by using this input tag with the type attribute that is email over here let us provide a couple of line breaks after this input tag now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this provide your email label in this case and the user can provide the email inside this text box so let's say we provide programming at gmail.com so guys let's say we provide programming over here and when the user clicks on the submit button let us see whether the validation message is being displayed over here here so guys we need to add the submit button in this case because this particular button is the normal button and it is not related to the form so over here we will have the input followed by colon and then we have the submit button over here and we provide the value as submit in this case which will help the user in order to submit the details that is being provided over here and then guys what we will do is we will provide the method as get so that we can see the values that are provided by the user for all these input tag inside the URL itself so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got the submit button now so let us provide the email over here so we just provide programming in this case and let me just click on this submit button so as you can see please include an at theate in the email address programming is missing an at theate so guys over here this particular web page is telling us that we don't have the at theate character which must be present inside the email address so let me just provide that at the rate as well and let us see if now our email address is being accepted over here so when we click on the submit Button as you can see please enter a part following at theate programming at theate is incomplete so guys over here the email addresses are designed in such a way that after the etherate we have something that is gmail.com or anything based on which platform you have created your email address so let's say we provide Gmail over here and let me just click on on the submit button now so as you can see now it is allowing us to submit over here and since we have provided the method as get we can see all the values of different parameters that are going inside the URL so as you can see we have the background color then we have the birth date date time as well as the email over here so as you can see programming and then we have the at theate which is being encoded as per 40 over here and then we have the Gmail that was provided by the user as the email address inside this text box so guys in this way you can easily use the input tag with the type attribute that is email in order to help the user provide his or her email address while he or she is submitting the form it will also help us in order to validate whether it is a proper format of the email or not based on your requirements so now we will see input Type image in HTML form so guys basically we can have the input tag along with the type that is image which defines an image as a submit button so guys inside of the submit button we can also have the input type that is image over here that will act as a submit button and it will be the image that will be displayed as a button over here now guys the path of the image is specified in the SRC attribute so let us check this with the help of examples and vs code as well it acts as a submit button and sends the coordinates of the user click as X and Y coordinates so guys let us move to the vs code over here and what we will be doing is after the submit button we will will also have the input type that is image so let us provide the line brakes over here so that the image is being displayed on the next line and then over here we will provide the input followed by colon and this time we will have the image in this case so guys it is important to note that we are having this input Type image inside the form over here so that the form attributes can be submitted and the form that is having the method attribute as get will help us in order to see all the value that is being set by by the user inside the browser URL so guys let us check this we have the input tag with the Type image over here and for the source part we will have one of the images that is sample image that I have already stored in this directory path where this particular test.html file is present now guys as the alternate we will provide submit as the value over here in case there is any issue as far as displaying of this image is concerned now guys apart from this we will also set the width and height of the image so let us say we have the width attribute has 50 pixels over here so we set it as 50 PX and then let's say we have the height attribute as well and we have the same value that is 50 pixel in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the image that we have set over here guys the height and width of this particular image is set in such a way that it is not looking very clear but for the example purpose we will see what happens when when the user clicks on this particular image over here so guys let's say we click on this bottom right of this particular image so when we click on this as you can see the attributes are getting displayed over here in the URL so you can see that BG color that is the background color that is coming from the color pickle over here and then apart from that we have the birth date date time as well as email and then in the end as you can see we have something called as X which is 47 and then we also have y that is equal to 47 so this is nothing but the attributes where the user has clicked on this particular image over here now let us click on this image once again somewhere over here that is at the top left so when we click on this so as you can see again the attributes are updated over here and you can see that the X attribute is now set as 2 and Y attribute is now set as one over here so guys in this way we can come to know at which particular coordinates by using the X and Y coordinates over here the user has clicked when the user clicks on the image that represents the submit button inside the form so guys this is the basic functionality of the input tag that is having the type that is image over here we can set it as the normal image that is by having the source attribute we can set the image for this particular submit button and let's say when the image is not present inside the directory so let me just provide one over here that is sample uncore image 1.png which is not present inside that directory let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see since the image is not present so we can see what text is being provided as the alt attribute so that is what we can see over here that is submit in this case so guys in this way we should be having the alt attribute as well in case if there is any issues as far as displaying of the image is concerned on the browser let me just save this file once again and reload this page on the browser and if we click somewhere in the middle of this image so you can see that the parameters are updated once again and this time the x value is 23 and the Y value is 25 so guys since we have set the height and width as 50 pixels over here so we will see all the numbers between 0 to 50 in this case based on where the user clicks on that particular image so now we will see input type file in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type file defines a file select field and a browse button for file uploads so basically if you have the requirement inside your HTML form to help the user in order to upload one of the files as attachment then you can use the input tag along with the type file and that is what we are going to check with the help of examples as well in the VSS code so let us check this in the VSS code over here I'll remove the previous lines of code that we had written so now over here we have a very simple statement that is below content is in HTML form inside the paragraph tag and then we have the form tag over here along with the method that is get request in this case now guys what we will do is we will have the input of the type file over here so input followed by colon and then we have the file in this case in order to have the type attribute as file over here and then guys for the name part we will provide the name as my file and simply we will copy and paste this value to the ID attribute as well and before this what we will do is we will also have the label and then for the for attribute we will have the ID of this input tag that is my file so we will simply copy this ID over here and then for the label part we will say select a file so that the user is able to select the file by using this particular input that is of the type file over here and then guys after this let us have the line breaks so over here we will have the BR tag and Then followed by the input tag with the type submit over here so we have the input tag with the type submit and the value that we will provide is submit in this case so guys basically this is the input tag that will help you in order to select one of the files such as JPG files or the PNG files as far as images are concerned or you can also select a PDF file or any other file of your choice now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see below content is in HTML form and then we have this select a file label over here and we get this choose file button in this case with the help of this input tag with the type file over here now guys user will be able to choose the file in this case so when the user clicks on this button that is choose file you will be able to select the file by using the file explorer over here so let's say we choose this favicon JPG file in this case so I select this the file name is favicon over here and we click on open in this case so as you can see favicon do jpg is being selected and when the user clicks on submit this particular file will be sent on the server and we are going to check this with the help of the URL in this case so let me click on submit over here so as you can see my file in the URL it is equal to favicon do jpg so basically this particular file was sent on the server with the help of the get request and that is why we are getting the name of the file inside the URL and guys this is the way that you can use the input type file inside the HTML form in order to allow the user select one of the files based on your project requirement so now we will see input type hidden in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type hidden defines a hidden input field that is not visible to a user so in case in your project requirements you want to have the hidden input field which is not supposed to be displayed to the user you can use the input tag along with the type hidden over here now a hidden field lets the web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified ified by the users when a form is submitted so let's say if you want the user to submit one of the values which is always going to be fixed when the user submits the form then you can have the input field along with the type hidden that will not be showed to the user but when the user submits the form this particular field will be also submitted and will be processed by the server it is very important to note that while the value is not a displayed to the user in the page content it will be visible and can be edited by the user by using the browsers developer tools or the view Source functionality so basically if the field is related to the security you should not use the hidden inputs as a form of security in that case so guys we will check this with the help of examples as well so let us move to the vs code over here so previously we had seen how we can use the input tag along with the type file which will allow the user in order to choose a file and submit to the server now guys after this input we will have another input over here which will be of the type hidden in this case now this particular input will not be displayed to the user and the name that we are going to give to this input field is hidden over here and the value that we want to be submitted to the server is 1 2 3 4 so guys basically this is the fixed value that will be submitted to the server when the user clicks on submit button and this value will be displayed on the URL since we are using the get request over here as the method for the form so so guys over here simply we will have the ID as well and we will say hidden in this case and this ID we are going to provide to the four attribute of the label as well so let me just provide the label and for the four attribute we will give the value as hidden and then we will say hidden input after this label so guys we have hidden input after this label which means after this label there is a hidden input which will not be displayed to the user but we can simply inspect this particular input and see what the value is present inside that input and then guys after this we will simply have the couple of line braks over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see hidden input after this label but we cannot see any input over here but when the user clicks on submit button in this case as you can see my file is equal to blank in this case that's because we have not selected any of the files over here but after that we have the hidden label over here and then we have the value as 1 2 3 4 that's because for that label we had set the value as 1 2 3 4 over here and on this web page we can simply inspect that hidden field so let me just right click over here and click on inspect button so now we can see all the elements over here of the HTML page and let me just go over here to the hidden input after this label when we click on this after this you can see the input of the type hidden in this case which is having the value as 1 2 3 4 so basically anyone who is aware about the HTML code can come over here and make the changes in this value so let's say we can change the value to 9876 over here and press enter in this case and then after this when we click on the submit Button as you can see hidden value is now containing 9876 over here so this particular value can be changed by the user if he or she is aware about this developer tools and can make changes over here for the value attribute of the Hidden input tag so guys you should not use this to perform one of the security measures but simply to allow the user in order to submit the form and along with it you want some constant value to be passed to the server then you can make use of this hidden input tag so now we will see input type month in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type month allows the user to select a month and a year and this we are going to check with with the help of examples as well now depending on the browser support a date picker can show up in the input field and we are going to select one of the months and the year as well it is very important to note that the type month is not supported in Firefox Safari and Internet Explorer Lev let us move to the vs code over here and previously we had seen the input tag along with the type file and the type hidden as well now after this hidden input tag we are going to have another another input with the type month over here so input colon month as you can see this is the Mt abbreviation over here which is a special feature of the vs code that allows us in order to have the required attributes inside the input tag so guys over here we have the type as month that is set and then let's say we provide the name as month over here and the same value we provided to the ID attribute as well now before this we are also going to have the label and for the for attribute we are going to have the ID as month over here that's because when the user clicks on this particular label you will be seeing the month picker over here that will be displayed to the user in order to select one of the months and the year so guys over here we will say select a month in this case as the label and then after this input tag we are going to have couple of line braks over here so that the submit button is showed on the next line now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see select a month the label is being displayed over here and then user can click on this particular label or you can also click on this icon over here in order to display the month and the years as well so when we click on the label as well so as you can see over here you can select one of the months in this case so let's say we go back to 2022 and then the month of April we want to select so when we select April 2022 it is being displayed over here and when the user clicks on submit button input field will be passed via the URL to the server that's because we have provided the method value as get request over here inside the form tag so guys let us submit this form over here so as you can see the month field is having the value as 2022 and the month that is 04 being displayed over here which is being passed to the server and guys this is the way that we can have the input field with the type month that will allow the user to select one of the months over here the past month or the future months can also be selected in this case so now we will see input type number in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type number defines a numeric input field which will allow the user to only provide the numbers in this input field now you can also set the restrictions on what numbers are accepted so guys we will check this with the help of examples as well with the help of Min and Max attributes so let us move to the vs code over here and previously we had seen the different input types such as file and then hidden and the month type as well now we will provide another input field over here and this time we will have the type as number in this case so when we press enter as we can see the type is being defined as number over here and for the name field we will provide it as age because we will ask the user in order to provide the age of the user so guys the same value we will copy it as the ID as well for this particular particular input field and before this we will also have the label tag over here and for the for attribute we will have the value as age so that the user can click on this label and provide the number to this input field in this case so we will provide the label as provide your age in years followed by colon and then after this input tag we will also have the couple of line breaks so that the submit button is displayed on the next line so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see provide your age and years is being displayed over here and the user will not be allowed to provide any of the alphabets or the special characters in this case that's because we have provided the input field with the type number which means it will only accept the numbers in this particular input field so guys over here let's say if I provide some string in this case so I'm not able to type the characters and only the numbers are being displayed over here let us try the special characters so over here I'm typing the special characters as well but it is not being displayed over here that's because the input field will only accept numbers in this case so let's say we provide the number as 105 in this case and when we click on submit button over here you can see that the age attribute is being displayed inside the URL with the value of5 over here now guys over here we can provide any number in this case let's say we provide 10,000 1,05 over here and click on submit so basically it is submitting that value but for the age Factor we need to restrict the numberers so that the user can specify the age in between two numbers over here the user can also provide a negative number in this case so when we go down over here as you can see negative numbers can also be displayed over here and we can increase this number as well so guys basically you can use these arrows in order to increment or decrement the numbers as well but guys let us put some restrict over here so the minimum age that we want is 18 in this case and the maximum age is 60 over here so we provide the main and the max attributes over here so as you can see the main attribute is equal to 18 and the max attribute is 60 in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now we will be able to restrict the age in between the 18 and the 16 numbers so as you can see when we are decreasing the number from 18 it is not decreasing so 18 is the minimum value that we can provide and 60 will be the maximum value so when we provide 59 and increase this number it is going to 60 and then when we click on the Arrow once again so it is not incrementing the value and when we click on the submit button the age is being taken as 60 over here and what if we provide a number which is greater than 60 manually so let's say we provide 67 over here and when we click on submit as you can see we are getting the validation value must be less than or equal to 60 so so basically this is the validation which will be displayed for the minimum number as well so when we provide 15 over here and click on submit so value must be greater than or equal to 18 over here so this is the validation that is automatically provided by the input field with the type number over here where we provide the Min and the max numbers in this case guys apart from this we can also have the step attribute which will increment or decrement the value by that particular step value over here so let's say we provide five as the step value let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and now if we provide any of the numers so let's say we provide 18 over here and when we increment it by one so over here when we press on this upper Arrow as you can see the next number is 23 that's because we have provided the step as five by default the step is set as one over here so that the user can increment or decrement the value by one but you can change that step value and we have set it S5 over here in this case so that is the reason why when we increment the value the value is getting increased by five and when we decrement the value the value is decreasing by five and that is how we can set the attributes that is min max and the step value as well apart from this we can also have the default value by setting the value attribute over here so let's say the default age of the user is 25 in this case so we provide the value is 25 let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see by default you will be able to see the ages 25 so now we will see input type range in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type range defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important so we are going to display a slider control over here so basically the type range is responsible to display a slider control that the user can slide and select one of the values based on the range Now the default range values is from 0 up to 100 that we are going to check with the help of examples as well and we will also see the different attributes that are min max and step attributes so guys let us move to the vs code over here and previously we had seen the different input tags with the types file hidden month and the number as well now we are going to Define another input field over here so basically we are going to type input followed by colon and then we are going to say range over here so we type range so as you can see this is the Mt abbreviation over here which is one of the important features in the vs code so we select this option and the type attribute is set to range over here now guys for the name part we are going to set it as range in this case and for the ID as well we are going to keep the same value that is range and then over here we will set the label and we are going to set the for attribute as the range value over here now guys let's say we want the user to provide the age previously we had asked the user to provide the age inside the text field over here but now we are going to ask the user to provide the age with the help of the slider so over here we will say provide your age using slider in this case and Then followed by colon so guys basically a slider will be displayed to the user with the help of this input field with the type range in this case and by default the range value will be 0 up to 100 in this case let me just save this file now and and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see provide your age using slider and this is the slider that the user can use in order to select one of the numbers using the slider now guys by default you cannot see the numbers over here so basically we are going to have another tag over here on the right side of the slider and we will have the output tag in this case so basically let's say after this input field we will have the output tag over here and this output tag will have the default value so let's say the default value in this case that we set is 20 over here and the same value we are going to set it as 20 in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so the slider is adjusted at the value of 20 and the same value is being displayed in the output tag over here now guys when we slide this in between the two numbers we cannot see the change in this number which is being displayed inside the output tag so what we have to do is we have to write a JavaScript code and there is a attribute that we are going to use as you can see in order to display the value we have to use the JavaScript and this is one of the properties that we are going to use that is next element sibling so guys basically what is the meaning of this so after this input field we have the next element that is output which can be referred by using the next element sibling over here so what we have to do is inside this input field with the type range we will say on input over here so this is the attribute that we are going to use in such a way that when the user slides this particular slider over here the on input attribute will be called and inside this on input attribute we will be using the this keyword followed by Dot and then we are going to use this property that is next element sibling over here so we have next element sibling which is going to refer to this particular tag that is output in this case and Then followed by Dot and then we have something called as value so basically what we are doing is we are setting the next element siblings value over here to which value so again we need to provide equal to since we need to assign certain value to this particular sibling over here after this input tag and the value will come from this input itself so basically we are going to use the this keyword followed by Dot and then we will say value so guys over here we are taking the value of the slider by using this do value in this case and then this value will be assigned to the next element sibling which is the output tag in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now when the user slides over here as you can see the number is also getting updated so when the user goes to the extreme right you can see that the maximum number is 100 and to the extreme left the number is set to zero over here so guys in this way we can also have the number that is being displayed to the user by using the on input attribute and Then followed by the next element sibling property followed by Dot and then the value of the slider can be set to this particular property now guys apart from this we can also restrict the values that is the Min and the mix values over here so what we can do is inside the same input tag in this case we can provide main attribute over here and let's say the minimum attribute we want is 18 and the maximum attribute we want is 60 over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the value is set to 20 by default and when we take it to extreme left the value is 18 which is the minimum value and to the extreme right the maximum value is 60 over here and that is what we had set as the minan and the max value for this particular input field with the type range so guys this is the way that you can set the input field with the type range over here and also display the number to the user so that the user comes to know what is the number that is being selected by the user apart from that you can also have the step attribute as well so let's say we provide the minimum value as 1 and the maximum value as 50 over here and we provide the step as 10 so in this case the values will be incremented or decremented by 10 so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see 20 is the default value and then when we take it back it is 1 and then 11 21 31 41 and then the last value will be 50 over here which is not being taken because the step value is 10 and the maximum value should be 51 over here so when we set it to 51 let me just save this file now and try reloading this page now as you can see the maximum value that can be taken is 51 over here so guys in this way you can also set the step attribute as well for the range input field so so now we will see input type te for telephone number in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type te which stands for telephone is used for input field that should contain a telephone number with a pattern mentioned so we will check this with the help of examples in vs code as well so basically whenever you have the requirement wherein you want the user to provide the telephone phone number you can have the input field with the type te and you can also mention the pattern as well so let us check this with the help of example in vs code so I'll remove these lines of code that were return previously over here and inside this form simply we will have the input along with the type te so input followed by colon and then we have Teel and this is the EMT abbreviation which is one of the special features of vs code that is the editor which we are using so guys over here we will say telephone as the name attribute and ID as well we will provide it as the telephone that is the value of this input field and before this we will also have the label and for the four attribute we will paste the same value that is the ID of this input field as telephone over here and then we will ask the user to provide telephone number so guys basically we are asking the user to provide the telephone number over here and for now we have not provided any pattern in this case so basically when we don't provide any pattern it will act like a simple text field in which you can provide any data over here so let us check this without any pattern over here so we will provide the couple of line breaks in this case and Then followed by the submit Button as well so input colon submit and we will provide the value as submit over here so that the value on the button is displayed as the submit value so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see below content is in HTML form form and then we are asking the user to provide the telephone number so the user can click on this label and as you can see the cursor is highlighted over here and you can provide the telephone number over here and apart from this it is also accepting the characters as well so when the user clicks on submit over here as you can see the telephone name is being provided in the URL that's because we have provided the method value as get request over here and all the values that are provided by the user in the HTML form will be passed as the parameters inside the URL and that is what we can see over here now guys there is no certain pattern in this case which the user has followed so what we can do is we can provide the pattern in this case so over here there is a pattern attribute and let's say we want the first three numbers to be provided by the user between 0 to 9 so we have the open and close square brackets over here and then we say 0 to 9 in this case and then open and close curly braces we we want three numbers over here and then followed by Hyun so guys basically over here we are trying to provide the pattern that the user must follow while providing the telephone number and While submitting the pattern will be checked whether the input that is provided by the user is correctly matching with the pattern or not and then only the value will be submitted so over here we have provided the first three numbers that is going from 0 up to 9 and Then followed by a hyphen and then let's say we want two more number numbers over here that should go from 0 to 9 so again we have inside the open and close square brackets 0 to 9 which is the range but this time we need only two numbers so inside the open and close curly braces we will provide two as the number and then again we provide Hyun and once again we want three digits over here so let's say I'll simply copy the first format in this case and paste this over here so guys basically first of all we are expecting the three digits in this case that should go from 0 to 9 followed by a hyphen over here and then we are expecting two digits from 0 to 9 followed by hyphen once again and then again we are expecting three digits from 0 to 9 in this case which completes our pattern over here of the telephone and then one more thing that we can provide is the placeholder which will tell the user what is the format that the form is expecting so over here simply we will provide 1 2 3 that is the first three digits followed by Hyun and then two more digits that is four and five followed by hyphen and then three more digits that is 6 7 8 and this completes our pattern that we have just defined over here for the pattern attribute in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see provide telephone number is now having the placeholder in this case that we have provided and then user can simply click over here and provide the numbers that is 1 2 3 and let's say if the user doesn't provide the numbers in this pattern so what will happen so over here let's say I provide 4 5 6 7 8 without any hyphen character that is Dash character over here so let me try submitting this so as you can see please match the requested format is being displayed over here and the form is expecting these two hyphens after the first three digits followed by two digits and then once again The Hyphen should be present so over here after first three digits we have hyen followed by two digits and one more hyphen over here followed by three digits in this case let me just click on submit once again over here so now as you can see the form is getting submitted with the telephone number that is provided by the user over here so in this way we can provide the telephone number with this particular format we can have any other number over here as far as we are using the correct pattern for the telephone number that we are providing so when the user clicks on submit once again so as you can see this is the updated telephone number that is provided by the user and anytime the pattern is not matched over here so let's say we provide another number wherein we provide four digits after the second hyphen in this case so when we click on submit over here we are getting the error message that is please match the requested format so basically this exact pattern needs to be matched by the user While submitting the form and based on your project requirement you can provide the required format that you want the user to provide the telephone numbers so so now we will see input type time in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the the type time allows the user to select a time with no particular time zone over here so basically the user will be provided the input field that will allow the user to select one of the time that is the hours and the minutes based on the user's requirement so over here depending on the browser support a Time picker can show up in the input field so basically the user will have the As and the minutes to select based on the time picker over here so let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so previously we had seen the input tag along with the type te which helps us to provide the telephone number in a particular pattern now this time we will have another input tag over here followed by colon and this time we will have time in this case so this is the Mt abbreviation so as you can see input tag along with the type time over here which will help us in order to select the time and over here we will provide the name as time and ID as well we will provide the same value that is time over here and before this we will have the label and we will ask the user to provide the time and for the for attribute we have copied the time value over here and we will ask the user to provide time in this case followed by colon and then after this let us have couple of line braks over here with the help of BR tags so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see provide time label is being displayed over here and when the user clicks on this label Button as you can see this particular input field is now having the focus the user can simply click on this clock item over here that is the icon and when the user clicks over here as you can see we have the hours as well and the minutes as well over here so the hours it will go from 0 0 up to 23 so let's say what is the current time right now it is 1633 so we select 17 and then let's say we want to select 30 over here so 1730 is the time so we select the 77 130 and when we click on the submit button the 1730 time should go as part of the parameter inside this URL since we have provided the method as get request over here so when we click on submit Button as you can see the time parameter is having 17 followed by a colon so over here we are having the asky value of the colon that is percentage 3 a in this case and Then followed by 30 which represents the minute so basically we have the hour that is 17 and minute that is 30 over here which is being passed to the server with the help of the get request so guys we can select any time over here we can also select the pass time in this case so let's say we select 1036 in this case and then we press submit as you can see the time is being passed as 1036 to the server for further processing so in this way we can have the input field that will help the user in order to select the time in the form of hours and minutes so now we will see input type URL in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type URL is used for input fields that should contain a URL address so basically let's say if you have a URL or a link to a particular web page and you want to provide it inside one of the text boxes on one of the websites that will help you in order to have certain validations in place so guys depending on the web browser the URL field can be automatically validated when submitted so it depends on the browser that the user uses in order to F the form or provide the URL in one of the input fields that is being developed by you so you should test it thoroughly on different browsers whenever you are going to use the input tag along with the type URL and some of the smartphones also recognize the URL type and adds a doom to the keyboard to match the URL so basically this is one of the important features of the smartphone in today's date that it will help the user in order to provide a DOT button on the keyboard while the user is providing the URL in the input field that is provided by the developer so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so previously we had seen the input field with the type telephone number and the type that is time over here which will allow the user to provide the telephone number and the time respectively now after this we will have another input field followed by colon and this time we will have the type as URL so we simply type URL over over here and this is the memt abbreviation which is one of the special features of vs code in this case so guys as you can see we have the input tag along with the type URL and over here for the name attribute we will say URL in this case and for the ID attribute we will say URL once again and before this we will also have the label over here and for the for attribute we will say URL so that when the user clicks on this particular label this input field is focused so that the user can Pro provide the required link or the URL to the web page so over here we will say provide web page Link in this case followed by colon so we are asking the user to provide the web page link which is also known as URL to a particular web page and after this input tag we will have couple of line breaks over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see provide web page link label is being displayed over here and when the user clicks on this particular particular label the input field is getting focused in this case and the user can provide the URL over here so let's say we provide Google as the URL so is this the correct URL no in this case this is not the correct format of the URL still we will test it let me just click on submit button over here as you can see please enter a URL error message is being displayed over here so let me just provide Doom over here in this case so let us check whether now this URL will be submitted or not so when we click on submit so again please enter a URL so the important thing that we are missing over here in this case is the https so whenever we go to the web browser and type one of the URLs so let's say we want to go to Google so simply we can provide google.com over here but automatically the browsers are designed in such a way that they provide the https prefix over here before the domain so that is what is being expected over here in the HTML form as well so before this let us say we provide https followed by colon and then two times forward slashes over here now this is the correct URL that will be accepted by this input field of type URL over here so let me just click on submit button once again so as you can see URL parameter is being displayed over here in the URL and then after that we have the https and the entire URL that we have provided in this case it is displaying the asky characters over here for the Lear and the forward slashes that we had provided so guys in this way you can provide any of the URLs based on your project requirements and ask the user to paste a particular link to the web page if the user is expected to do so but make sure that you test this input field on different browsers because we never know what browser the actual user is using while he or she is submitting the HTML form or using it outside the HTML form as well so now we will see input type week in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type week allows the user to select a week and a year so basically the user will be provided with the input field where he or she can select the week of the entire year and that particular year as well now depending on the browser support a date picker can show up in the input field so it is very important for you as a developer to check your input field on the different browsers whether it is supported by the various versions of the browsers so let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so previously we had seen the various input field types that is telephone and the time and the URL as well now we will have another input field so over here we will say input followed by colon and this time we will have the week type over here so that the user is able to select one of the weeks of the year so the type is weak in this case and let's say we provide the name as weak over here and the same value we will provide it as the ID attribute in this case now before this input tag we will also have the label so that the user comes to know that a week is supposed to be selected from his or her side so over here we will provide the value for the for attribute as weak in this case and Then followed by select a weak and then colum so guys basically we have a label and Then followed by the input tag over here of the type week in this case and then we will have BR tags over here that is line braks so that the submit button is displayed on the next line so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see select a week label is being displayed and Then followed by the input field where the user is expected to select one of the weeks so when we click on this calendar icon over here as you can see a calendar is being displayed and user can select the entire week from a particular year so let's say we want to select the next week in this case so we can click on any of the dates over here so let's say we select this so it says week 51 of the Year 2023 and then when we click on submit over here as you can see the week name is being displayed as the parameter inside the URL followed by the year that is 2023 and Then followed by week 51 over here which you can further process based on your requirements so guys in this way user can easily select the required week based on the data that the user wants to select over here we can select any of the past weeks as well and click on submit and then accordingly the week will be passed to the server for further processing we can also select one of the future weeks over here so let's say we go to the year 2027 in this case and then let's say we have the month of December over here and we select the first week of December over here and week 48 2027 is the year when we click on submit 2027 week 48 is being displayed in the URL so guys in this way you can simply have the input field and allow the user to have one of the weeks for a particular year so now we will see input attribute value in the input field so guys basically the input value attribute specifies an initial value for an input field which will be the default value when the user clicks on submit button without providing any value to this input field so basically it means the value attribute will help us to provide the default value inside the input field let us check this with the help of examples and vs code over here so I'll remove the previous lines of code in this case and we will only keep the form tag over here and then guys inside this form tag what we will do is we will have a P tag that is the paragraph tag in this case and then we will say below content is in HTML form so basically we have a very simple statement that is below content is in HTML form and simply we will ask the user to provide the first name and the last name over here here so simply we will have the input with the type text in this case so we have the input tag along with the type text and then let's say the name attribute is f name and the same value we provided inside the ID as well and before that we will have the label and for the for attribute we will say F name over here so that this particular label is linked to the input field in this case and then we will say first name over here as the label followed by colon now guys this is this is a very simple text field in this case and we will not have any value inside this input field so let us have a submit button in this case so we provide input followed by colon and then we have the type submit over here and the value will be submit in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have two times below content is in HTML form so previously we had provided another paragraph before that form as well so I'll just remove one paragraph in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the first name over here followed by colon and then simply we have the input field in this case guys we want the submit button to be on the next line so simply we will provide a couple of line braks over here using the BR tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have a simple text field that is first name in which we can provide the first name over here now guys let's say we want certain default value to be provided inside the first name so what we can do is we can have the value attribute for this input tag so after this ID we will provide the value attribute and let's say the first name with the value John will be the default value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see when the user loads this particular page the default value that is drawn will be displayed to that user inside the first name input Field in in this case and then user can provide his or her own name over here or simply click on submit button so that the value that is drawn will be passed to the server so when we click on the submit button over here as you can see inside the URL we have the F name parameter followed by equal to and the value is JN in this case that's because the default value that we have provided in the first name input field is John over here similarly we can have another input field as well so let's say we simply copy these lines of code and past it after the first name over here and we provide L name in this case that is last name as the name and ID and for the for attribute as well we provide the L name as the value and instead of first name we will say last name as the label and for the value part we will say do in this case so guys basically the first name is John last name is do so we have John do as the full name of the user as the default value for both these input Fields so let me save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the first name that is having the value default value of John and the last name is having the default value as do and when we click on submit button simply without providing any data over here so these two names that is John and do will be passed to the server as the URL with the F name and the L name as the parameters we can also modify the first name and last name over here so simply we can say program programming and then for the last name we can say beginners over here so let me just click on submit button now so basically the first name and last name has been updated that is programming and then beginners as the last name in this case which is being passed to the server so in this way we can have the default values for the required input Fields based on your project requirements by using the value attribute over here inside the input tag so now we will see input attribute read only in input field so guys basically the input readon attribute specifies that an input field is a readon field so basically let's say if you want the input field to be displayed to the user but you don't want the user to provide any of the values inside that input field then you can provide this attribute that is read only which will allow the user to only read that particular content inside the input field now a read only input field cannot be modified however a user can tab to it which means the user can press on the tab key on the keyboard and go to that particular input field also the user can highlight it and copy the text from it so basically all the other things can be done inside this readon input field but the user cannot modify this field now the value of the read only input field will be sent when submitting the form so when the user submits that particular form the input field value that is present inside the read only field will be sent to the form so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so previously we had seen the input fields that were having the value attribute which will be shown by default now guys let us say we only have the first name as the input field and we will remove these lines of code that is the last name over here and this time we will again have the text input field in this case and for the name attribute we will give the value as test and the same value we provided to ID and before this we will Pro provide the label and for the four attribute we will say test as the value and then the label that we will give is read only field in this case followed by colon so guys over here we have provided the label that is read only field and then after that we have this input field over here and then after this let us have couple of line breaks in this case but guys currently this is a normal text field over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the label is being displayed but the user can provide any of the values over here so by default we will provide some values so let's say we provide the value as customer in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see customer is getting displayed over here as a default value but still the user can modify it and user can provide any of the details based on the requirements so what we have to do is in order to make this field as read only that is this the user should not be able to modify it we will simply provide the readon attribute as you can see this is the attribute that we can provide and it doesn't require any value to be provided so it is basically the read only keyword that you have to provide inside this input field over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see customize a default value but this time when you click on this input field there is no curve C that is appearing and then over here when I'm typing the characters I'm not able to modify this field now so since we have provided this input field with the readon attribute the user will not be able to modify this particular field and apart from that user can click on the submit button in order to submit this form so when we click on the submit Button as you can see we have the F name parameter over here and the test parameter as well that we have provided to this read only Fe and the value for this is customer over here so basically whatever value is being provided in the readon field it will be passed to the server and since we have used the get request we can see the parameters being passed as the part of URL so guys in this way you can easily create the input field with a read only value over here and allow the user to submit the form with that particular default value so now we will see input attribute disabled in input field so guys basically the input dis disabled attribute specifies that an input field should be disabled by disabled what we mean is a disabled input field is unusable and unclickable as well so basically this is a kind of a readon field that we had seen previously so over here as well the user will not be able to modify the content of the input field which is having the attribute as disabled over here and apart from this functionality the value of the disabled input field will not be sent when some submitting the form so basically this is the main difference between the readon attribute and the disabled attribute the readon attribute will help the user to send the input field value that is set by default to the server whereas the disabled input field will not be able to send the value that is provided inside this input field so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so simply we will have the input field and this time we will have the text input field over here and for the name part we will say disabled in this case and then for the ID as well we will provide the same value that is disabled and before this we are going to have the label and for the four attribute we have the same value that is disabled over here and then we will give the label as disabled field in this case and Then followed by colon we have this input field after this and let us say we have couple of line brakes over here so that the submit button is displayed on the next line so let me just save this file now and try by reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the disabled field label being displayed over here but we have the normal input field right now which we can modify and send to the server as well so what we can do is we want a default value to be provided inside this input field so we will say value attribute and let's say we provide disabled as the value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see disabled value is being displayed over here but right now user is able to modify this input field and will be able to send this value to the server after submitting this form so what we have to do is in order to make this input field as disabled simply we have to come to the end and type disabled keyword so as you can see this is the keyword that is disabled being suggested by the vs code over here in order to make this input field disabled so that the user is not able to modify it and nor he or she will be able to send the value to the server after submitting the form so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the background of this input field is slightly updated the color can be shown as a gray color over here and when we click on this particular input field we are not able to focus it and also the user is not able to type inside this input field over here whereas in the read only we were able to highlight this input field over here but we are not able to modify it so let us see what is the difference between read only and disabled field over here so when we click on the submit button in order to submit the form as you can see F name that is John is being provided to the server inside the URL and we have test for which the value is customer so basically the read only field value is being passed to the server in the form of URL since we have used the get request as the method type for the HTML form whereas the disabled field is not being passed to the server and that is the main difference between the read only and the disabled field over here so in case you have any of the requirements in the project that you want to disable a particular input field as a part of functionality in such a way that you don't want that particular field value to be passed to the server then simply you can provide the disabled keyword to the required input field over here so that the user is no longer able to modify that input field and the value will not go to the server so now we will see input attribute size in input field so guys basically the input size attribute specifies the visible width in characters of an input field so basically the size attribute is responsible in order to specify the visible width of the input text box the default value for the size that is the width of the text box is 20 that we have seen so far and it is very important to to note that the size attribute only works with following input types that is text search telephone number URL email ID and password so guys basically these are the only input fields on which the size attribute can be implemented and you can simply increase or decrease the width of that input field as far as UI which means user interface is concerned so let us check this with the help of examples in BS code over here so previously we had seen the different attributes that are value then we had also seen read only attribute and the disabled attribute as well now let us have another input and this time we will have the input field of the type search over here so that we can increase the width or decrease the width of this particular input field so we are going to have the input tag along with the type search and over here for the name part we will provide the value as search and for the ID as well we will provide the value as search in this case let me provide the label as well before the input field and for the for attribute we will provide the value as search over here and the label that we will provide is search your term or phrase so we have a very simple statement over here that is search your term or phrase which is the part of the label and the user can simply provide a term or a phrase as well having list of words based on the requirements so guys by default the size of this particular input field will be 20 so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got search your term of phas and then we have this input field over here for which the width is 20 right now by default let me just provide couple of line brakes over here after this input field so that the submit button is displayed on the Le line so let me just reload this page once again on the browser after providing the line brakes so as you can see the width of this particular input field is 20 right now by default so let us say we want to increase the width so that the user is able to search for some term over here so let's say programming for beginners which is the name of this YouTube channel that you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so basically when we provide programming for beginners over here as you can see not the entire phrase can be seen within this particular width of the input field which is 20 by default so let us say we want to provide the size as 40 in this case so simply we can provide size and then provide a number that is 40 over here by default it is set to 20 in other input Fields wherever we don't provide the size attribute so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the width of this input field is increased now and we can say programming for beginners so this phrase we can easily see without actually scrolling horizontally and again we can can provide more characters over here on the right so we can say please subscribe so as you can see the entire phrase can be seen right now and then further we can type more content over here HTML tutorial so the longer the phrase the characters on the left hand side will code on the extreme left over here so that it is not visible right now within the same input field so guys this is the main reason to use the size attribute in order to increase the width of a particular input field where the user is expected to provide the large input in the form of text phrases we can also decrease the size of this input field so let's say we make the size as 10 over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the size of this input field is now smaller compared to the default size which is 20 right now which can be seen on the other input Fields as well so guys in this way you can easily set the size attribute to any of the input Fields provided the type of the input Fields belong to text search telephone number URL email and password so now we will see input attribute max length in input field so guys basically the input max length attribute specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in an input field so basically if you want the input field to be limited with a particular number of characters to be entered by the user we can use the max length attribute and provide the maximum number of characters that the user can provide in this input field it is very important to note that when a max length is set the input field will not accept more than the specified number of characters and there will be no validations so this particular attribute does not provide any feedback over here to the user why the input field is not taking any more characters so if you want to alert the user you must write certain JavaScript code in order to mention a particular message that the maximum length is not allowing the user to enter more characters in the same input field so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so basically previously we had seen the different attributes such as the value attribute then we had also seen the read only and the disabled attributes as well apart from that we had also seen the size attribute which mentions the width of the input field so guys we will have another input field over here of the type text in this case and basically we are going to have the max length attribute for this input type and the name for this input field will be remarks in this case so we will provide the value of the name attribute as remarks and the same value we will provide to the ID attribute as well and let me just provide the label before this input field for the for attribute we will provide the value as remarks so that we link this particular label to the input field that we have defined and then we will say the remarks s the label followed by colon and then guys let me just provide couple of line breaks over here so that the submit button is displayed on the next line so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see remarks label is being displayed over here and you can provide your remarks in this case so basically you can provide any number of characters right now by default because we have not provided any max length attribute over here for now so you can limit the the number of characters that is being provided by the user over here so let's say we want the user to provide maximum of 10 characters in this case so let's say we provide max length in this case as the attribute and the value that we provide is 10 over here so that maximum of 10 characters can be allowed in this particular remarks input field so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now if we type something so let's say programming and then I'm not able to type type anymore that's because the number of characters that is 10 is completed over here so when we type these characters we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so as you can see 10 characters are completed over here after which we are not able to type any of the characters in this particular input field so guys this is the main functionality of the max length attribute that we can use to the input field in order to limit the input that is provided by the user While submitting the form in case you have any requirements in such a way that you want to limit the number of characters being provided by the user to let's say 50 characters or 100 characters then you can simply use the max length attribute for that input field so that the user is not able to provide number of characters that is more than the max length attribute over here so now we will see input attribute Min and Max in input field so guys basically the input min and Max attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for an input field so let's say for example if you want the user to provide his or her age and the age should be between the minimum value of 18 years and the maximum value of 60 years then you can simply use the Min and Max attributes so that the user provide the age between these two values which can be a part of a client side validation over here so the Min and the max attributes work with the following input types so as you can see number range date date time local month time and week so Guys these are the input field types that will be used on which the Min and the max attributes will be applicable you cannot provide the Min and Max attributes on the input type that is text or search or the telephone number as well so these are the only input fields that you should use while you are implementing the Min and Max attributes now it is very important to note that you should use the Max and the Min attributes together to create a range of legal values so as we have just discussed we will take the input from the user in such a way that the minimum and the maximum values for the age should be between the 18 and the 60 years of age so let me just move to the vs code over here so basically after this input tag that we had seen previously in order to see the max length we will provide another input field over here which will be of the type number in this case and for the name attribute we will provide the value Val as age and the ID attribute we will provide the value as age once again and for the label part we will again have the for attribute having the value as age over here and the label that we will provide is provide your age in this case followed by colon and then after this input field we will have couple of line breaks over here so that the submit button is displayed on the next line so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see provide your age is getting displayed over here so you can simply provide the age of the user so let's say 25 years or 30 years now guys there is no validation over here right now you can simply provide 10 years as well over here as the age and click on submit button over here so as you can see the form is getting submitted with the age value as 10 in this case but based on our requirements we want the age of the user to be between 18 and 60 years of age so what we will do is inside this input field we will have another attribute that is main attribute over here and we will set it as 18 in this case and the max attribute as well for which the value should be 60 over here so let me just save this file now so basically we are setting the range in this case for which the minimum value is 18 and the maximum value is 60 over here let me just reload this page once again on the browser so now if you provide the age so let's say when we provide the age as 15 in this case and when we press on submit over here as you can see value must be greater than or equal to 18 is getting displayed over here so when we increase the age to let's say 18 years and when we press submit now as you can see the form is getting submitted with the age is equal to 18 and in this way we can provide the minan value and the max value as well let us test the max value also so over here let me just provide the age is 62 in this case and when we press on submit Button as you can see value must be less than or equal to 60 over here so let me just set the age to 60 over here in this case and when we press submit button over here the age value is set to 60 while passing the value to the server using the get method so guys in this way we can easily use the Min and the max values over here when we provide the age as 40 which is in between the 18 and the 60 years of age which is the minimum and the maximum values that this particular input field is accepting so when we press on submit button the form is again getting submitted so as you can see age is equal to 40 is getting passed to the server so guys in this way if you have the requirements of asking the user to provide a certain number between the range for which the minimum and the maximum values are provided you can use the Min and the max attributes for that particular input field so that the user only provides the values in between these range values over here so now we will see input attribute multiple in input field so guys basically the input multiple attribute specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in an input field and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well now the multiple attribute works with the input types that is email and file over here so basically let us check this with the help of example where the input field type is file over here in which case we can select a multiple files to be uploaded to the server so guys let us move to the vs code over here and I'll simply remove the previous lines of code in this case that we had written previously so now as you can see we have a very simple statement that is below content is in HTML form inside the paragraph tag and then over here we have the form tag along with the method that is get request so that whatever parameters are being submitted by the user we can see those parameter values inside the URL on the browser so guys over here what we have to do is we will have the input field with the type file in this case so basically we are going to have the input along with the type file over here and then in this case we will say name as file and ID as well as file over here and then before this we will have the label and then we will have the for attribute value as the file value in this case now for the label we will say select multiple files so guys basically we are asking the user to select multiple files over here and then user will be able to submit by using the submit Buton button so let us have couple of line braks over here after which we will have the submit button in this case by using the input type submit and then for the value we will have the value as submit in this case so guys currently we have not provided the attribute multiple in this case so let us check how this particular input Field Works on the browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see below content is in HTML form and then we have the select multiple files label but currently we have not provided the multiple attribute over here so when the user clicks on this choose file basically the Explorer will open over here based on the machine that the user is using and then user can select one of the files over here in this case so guys basically I have come to a particular path over here on my machine you can navigate to your own directory path over here and then when I try to select multiple files over here now guys how do we select multiple files in this case so as as you can see we have selected this favicon image over here which is a JPG image in this case but let's see if I want to select another image that is sample image so I will press the control key on the keyboard and then try selecting the sample image as well but this time when we select this we are only able to select one image that is sample image now which is the second image that is selected so by default the user will be able to select only one file here that's because we have not provided the multiple attribute so when the user selects one of the files in this case and clicks on open basically that particular file will be displayed to the user in order to be sent to the server now guys how do we select the multiple files over here so basically we can go to the VSS code over here and simply we can provide the multiple attribute in this case so as you can see this is the multiple keyword that we need to provide in the input field of the type file or of the type email as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now if you notice we have choose files in this case previously it was just choose file over here which allows only single file to be selected so basically we can select multiple files now so when I click on this button again the Windows Explorer will open and then we can select let's say this particular file and then if I want to select the second file as well I will press the control key on the keyboard and then click the left mouse key over here so as you can see sample image and favicon both the files are getting selected Ed over here and when we click on open in this case so it says two files which means two files are selected by the user and when we click on submit over here as you can see file is equal to favicon jpg and again there is a file parameter and then it says the name of the other file that is sample image.png so guys in this case both the files are getting sent to the server for further processing and in this way we can select multiple files by using the multiple keyword for the input field based on our requirements so now we will see input attribute placeholder in input field so guys basically the input placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field a sample value or a short description of the expected format will be shown inside that input field so guys basically the short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value so guys we will check this with the help of exam examples as well and the placeholder attribute works with the input types such as text search URL telephone number email and password as well so guys let us check this with the help of examples in VSS code over here so previously we had seen the input tag along with the type file for which we had the multiple keyword which will allow us in order to select the multiple files in this case now guys what we will do is let's say we have the username and password over here and we don't have the labels for that them so in this case we will simply have the input with the type text over here and then for the name part we will say username in this case and for the ID as well we will say username over here now guys we are not going to have any labels in this case and we are going to provide the placeholder as well and similarly we will also have the password over here so we will say input colon and then we will say password in this case so we have the input field with the type password over here and for the name part we will say name as password and ID as well as password over here and after the username field we will have couple of line braks over here so that the username and the password fields are separated by using couple of line Brakes in this case and after the password as well we will have the line brakes now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have a simple input field over here but it doesn't display any label on the left hand side or on the top of the input field so one alternate way in order to provide the hint to the user is to provide a placeholder inside the input field so that the user comes to know what data is expected from his or her site to be provided in these input Fields so we can simply go to this input field that is the username field over here and we can have the placeholder in this case and we can say username so basically this particular text will be displayed inside the input field over here so that the user can provide his or her username over here and then similarly we will have another placeholder inside the password text box so over here we will say placeholder and then we will say password in this case so guys basically we are not providing the labels over here with the help of label text but we are providing the placeholders in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the hint to the user that is being provided so that the user understands that this particular input field is expecting a username and the second input field is expecting some password over here so simply we will provide some username in this case so we say programming over here and then for the password part simply we will say password in this case and since it is of the type password the data is being masked over here so guys let me just click on submit in this case so as you can see username is equal to programming and password is being displayed as password in this case inside the URL guys this is not one of the best practices in order to pass the password to the server by using the get request because it is being displayed inside the URL on the browser so we need to use the post request method but in order to Simply understand the example of the placeholder we have considered this particular example of input Fields So based on your requirements you can provide the string or the phrase as well inside the input Fields by using the placeholder attribute so now we will see input attribute required in input field so guys basically the input required attribute specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form so basically this required attribute actually needs the users to provide the data inside this particular input field which is having the attribute that is required now guys the required attribute works with the input type such as text search URL telephone number email password date picker number checkbox radio and file so guys as we can see there are maximum input field types over here which are covered as far as required attribute is concerned so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so previously we had seen the input tag along with the type file over here then we had also seen the text and the password types we had used the placeholder attribute and the multiple attribute as well now guys what we will do is we will have another input field and we will ask the user to provide age in this case so we will have the input field with the type number in this case so as you can see the input tag along with the type number over here and then the age attribute will have the value as age in this case and ID as well we will keep it as age over here now guys we will also provide the label so that the user understands that he or she is supposed to provide the age so basically for the four attribute we will have the value that is age and the the label we will provide it as provide your age followed by colon so guys after this we will have couple of line breaks so that the submit button is displayed on the next line now guys first of all we will see what happens when we don't provide the required attribute over here so simply let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the provide your age label and then the input field is being provided but guys we have not provided the required attrib to any of these fields for now so simply if the user comes over here and clicks on submit basically the form will be submitted in this case with all the blank values for all the parameters so as you can see file is equal to blank then username and password is also blank and the age is also blank now guys this is not one of the best practices in order to send the password as a get request over here that's because anyone can see the password inside the URL so I'll simply remove this line of code over here that is having input field password in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we submit it once again as you can see all the values are blank for now so guys what we have to do is compulsorily we want the user to at least provide the age if they are not providing any other inputs over here so what we can do is simply for this input field with the type number in which case we are dealing with the age input field we will come to the end and we will we will say required in this case so guys basically this required attribute is used in order to make the user provide some data to this particular input field so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this provide your age input field in this case and then when we click on submit over here as you can see please fill out this field so basically this validation is being thrown by this particular browser and depending on the browser different message can can be displayed based on which browser is being used by the user so guys irrespective of which browser is being used by the user but basically a validation message will be thrown if the input field is kept blank and the user tries to submit the form so we need to provide some age over here so let's say if we provide 25 that is some number in the form of age in the input field and then when the user clicks on submit now the form accepts that particular input and will be sending all the values of the parameter to the server but since user has provided only the age parameter over here the age parameter is having the value and the other two attributes are having the blank values over here but guys this is the main functionality of the required attribute so whatever input Fields you want the user to provide some data with you can use this required attribute to all those input fields we can also provide the required attribute to this username field as well so let's say when we provide the required attribute over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we try to submit the form it is asking to please fill out this field that is username over here so let me just provide some username in this case so we have provided programming as the username so now let me just click on submit over here but we also have the required field that is age in this case so it is saying please fill out this field as well so we provide 25 as the age and when we click on submit over here so now the HTML form is accepting the inputs that is provided by the user that is username as well as age in this case because those are the input fields which are marked as required so guys this is the way that required attributes work over here in HTML input Fields so now we will see input attribute step in input field so guys basically the input step attribute specifies the legal number intervals for an input field so for example if the step is equal to three that is being set for a particular input field the legal numbers could be 3 0 3 6 and so on so basically when we increment or decrement the current number inside the input field it will be increased or decreased by this step value that is three over here in this case now an important tip over here is the attribute can be used together with the Max and the Min attributes to create a range of legal values and we will check this with the help of examples as well and the Step at attribute works with the input types such as number range date date time local month time and week so guys let us check this with the help of example in code over here now guys we will have another input field which will be of the type number in this case so input followed by colon and then we have number over here and what we will say is the name will be quantity in this case so basically we are asking the user in order to select the quantity of a product so guys basically it will be feasible for a ecommerce website to have the text box in order to provide the quantity so that the user can order a particular order and based on the quantity it can be delivered to the user so we will keep the name value as quantity and the ID value as quantity as well and then for the label we will say label in this case and for the for attribute we will say Quantity as the value and then we will say select quantity so guys this is just an example that we are implementing over here so that the user can select the quantity and the requirement is in such a way that the user can only select the quantity in the multiples of even numbers that means either the quantity can be 2 or 4 or 6 and so on so the user should not be able to select the quantity which is an odd number so guys over here what we have to do is we need to provide the step value as two in this case because every time the value should be increased by two and minimum value that we we can provide is two over here so basically if the user is selecting the quantity so the minimum value will be two because zero cannot be set over here so the minimum value we have set is two in this case and every time the user increases the quantity it should be in the step of two we can also select the value attribute over here so we can simply say value and then it is equal to two so that initially the value of the quantity input field will be set as two in this case now guys after this input field we we will have couple of line braks over here so that the submit button is displayed on the next line inside the form so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see select quantity label is being displayed over here and we are seeing the value of two that's because we have kept the value attribute S2 over here and the minimum value will also be two so the user cannot go with a value that is less than two in this case and every time when the user wants to increment this value by using the up Arrow over here the value will be incremented with a step of two so as you can see four is being selected now and then again when the user increments the value is six right now and when the user decreases the number so let's say we click on this down arrow so again it is decreased by two in this case so the value is four right now and then again when we decrease it so the value is two right now and then we cannot decrease it anymore further that's because the minimum value is set as two in this case and that is how we can apply the range this particular quantity input field by providing the main attribute and we can optionally provide the max attribute as well so guys this is the main functionality of the step attribute in order to increase the number with the step value that is being provided inside that input field so now we will see input attribute autofocus in input field so guys basically the input autofocus attribute specifies that an input field should automatically get get focus when the page loads so by default there will be no focus on any of the input Fields when the user loads a particular web page but in case if you want the focus to be set on a particular input field when the user loads the page then you can use the autofocus attribute for that particular input field so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so I'll remove the previous lines of code that we had written and then guys simply we are having a statement over here that is below content is in HTML form inside the paragraph tag and inside the form what we will do is we will simply have two text boxes that is first name and last name over here so we will say input of the type text in this case and then over here for the name attribute we will say F name and the ID as well we will keep it as F name over here and before this input field we will also have the label tag over here and for the for attribute we will keep the value as F name and then we will say first name in this case followed by colon done and then guys similarly we will have the last name as well so we will have couple of line breaks first of all after the first name input field and then we will paste this for last name over here so simply we will change the label as last name in this case and we will keep the name value as L name and copy the same value to ID and the for attribute as well so guys we have two text boxes that is first name and last name over here and then after this again we will have couple of line breaks in this case And Then followed by a submit button over here so we have input of the type submit and the value will be submit in this case so that the user is able to submit this form along with the first name and last name data in this case now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the below content is in HTML form and then we have first name and last name over here now guys if you notice there is no focus on any of these two input Fields right now and that is the default behavior of all the input Fields there will be no focus on any of the input Fields by default so what you have to do is let's say if you want the first name to be autofocused when the user loads this particular web page so what we can do is simply for this input field related to first name at the end we can simply say autofocus over here so guys this is one of the attributes that will help us in order to provide the focus to this particular input field when the user loads the web page so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see if you notice automatically the first name input field is getting the focus over here after the user reloads this page so if you want the last name to be focused so simply you can remove this autofocus from the first name input field and provide the autofocus attribute to the last name input field so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see last name is now having the focus automatically when the user comes to this particular web page and guys this is the way that you can provide the autofocus on any of the input Fields based on your requirements while you are expecting the user to submit the HTML form it is a best practice to provide the autofocus at the start of the form that is the first input field over here so that the user starts providing the data that is required from his or her side and this is one of the best practices that you can follow so so now we will see input attribute height and width in input field so guys basically the input height and width attributes specify the height and width of an element and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well we will define an image as the submit button inside the form with a particular height and width attributes that will set the images height and width so guys let us move to the vs code over here so so I'll remove the previous lines of code that we had written and then we will only keep a paragraph that is having a simple statement that is below content is in HTML form so currently we don't have any form over here so we will Define the form so for the action attribute we are not going to provide any server side file in order to process the data further since we are only looking for the examples on the client side and then for the method part we will set it as get method in this case and then inside the form let us say we have a normal text box over here so basically we will have the input of the type text so input colon text and then as you can see this is the input with the type text over here and for the name we will provide F name in this case so that the user can provide the first name over here and then for the ID part as well we will provide the value as F name in this case and before this input we will also have the label and for the for attribute we will keep the value as F name so that whenever user clicks on this particular label the focus is given to this particular input field so for the label we will say first name over here so we have the label as first name followed by input field and then guys let us have couple of line breaks in this case after which we are going to have the submit button with the help of the image so over here we will say input followed by colon and then we have something called as image over here so guys instead of having the submit button we can have the image as well that can help help us in order to submit this form so we are going to use the Type image in this case so we need to provide the values for these attributes over here one is the SRC which is the source attribute for which we need to provide the directory path of the image that we want to display so guys over here we have a sample image that we can use in order to display it inside the form as the submit button so I'm going to provide the name of that file that is sample image now guys since this HTML that is test HTML is already present in this particular directory as you can see this is the file that we are editing right now and that is the reason why we can simply provide the name of the PNG file that is the image file over here in case your image is present in some other directory then you need to provide the entire directory path in order to access that image and to be displayed on the web page so guys over here we have provided the name of the file and apart from this we will also give it the alt attribute as submit over here so that in case the image is not being displayed for some reason then we can at least have the submit text being displayed inside of the image that was supposed to be displayed on the web page now guys by default the size of the image that will be displayed will be based on the image that you are providing but let's say if we want to provide the width and the height of the image so over here we can simply provide width attribute and let's say we provide the width as 150 pixels over here so we Prov provide 150 PX and in the same way we have to provide the height attribute as well so in this case let us say we provide the height attribute as 100 pixels over here so guys this is the way that we can provide the width and the height of a particular HTML element specifically we use it for the images whether it is the IMG tag or the input tag along with the Type image over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see below content is in H HML form and then we have the input field that is the first name over here after which we have this image that is being displayed over here so this image over here is acting like a submit button in this case guys it depends on your requirement based on what height and width you want to display the image that will act as a submit button so over here let's say we provide the first name as John in this case and when we click on this image that is acting as a submit button so as you can see inside the URL F name parameter is being passed over here and the value is drawn in this case and also guys it is very important to note that we also get the X and Y attributes over here which is the coordinates on which the user has clicked on this particular submit image over here so guys this is the very simple way in order to adjust the height and width of the image you can set the height and width based on your requirements so let's say we provide the width as 100 pixels over here and for the height part let us say we provide the height value as 60 pixels let me just save this F file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the image width and height is adjusted now based on the height and width that we have provided inside our code so now we will see input attribute list in input field so guys basically the input list attribute refers to the data list element that contains the predefined options for an input element so basically in case you want to have the list of elements to be displayed with the help of the input element then you can have the input along with the list attribute over here and you can provide the ID of the data list element that you can Define later on so guys basically this input tag will now have the list of dropdown items from which the user can select one of the items so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so previously we had defined the input tag with the type text over here which was having the F name that is the first name that the user wants to Define and also we had the submit button in the form of the image so guys what we will do is after this first input tag we will have another input tag over here so this time we are not going to Define any type over here but instead of this we are going to have the list attribute so guys basically the input tag along with the list attribute will help us in order to have the drop down list in this case so over here let's say we provide the value as list one so guys basically this should be the ID of the data list tag that we are going to Define now so basically after this input tag we can Define the data list tag as well so in this case we Define data list tag and then inside this data list tag we can have the ID in this case so the ID must be equal to the value of this list attribute that we had defined so I'll just simply copy this and paste this over here as the ID attribute of the data list tag and then guys we can have the list of items that we want to display So currently if we check the web page there will be no items that will be displayed so let me just check this I'll save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this input field being displayed over here there are no values that is being displayed right now inside this input field guys what we will do is we will replace this particular image with the submit Button as well so over here after the data list we will have coup of line breaks in this case and then instead of having the input tag along with the Type image over here we will simply have the input tag along with the type submit in this case so that a simple text value can be displayed with the help of the submit button so over here we have the value as submit so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see we have the submit button but the important thing is we need to have certain drop down values over here so that the user can select one of the values from this list so guys over here what we have to do is inside this data list tag we need to Define our options with the help of the option tag so over here simply we will have the option tag in this case we can remove the ending tag over here so I'll simply remove this and then we can have different options inside the value attribute of the option tag so let's say we have the label for this input tag as the mode of Transport so over here for the input part we will also have the ID as well and then we will say transport in this case and the same ID we can provide it as the value for the four attribute over here and then we can say select your mode of Transport so guys basically we are asking the user to select the mode of transport and then we will have the list of options from which the user can select the mode of Transport so let's say we provide the first option as bike in this case and some more couple of options over here so we will say car and the third third option is bus in this case so guys we have three options over here that is bike car and bus so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see select your mode of Transport label is being displayed and if you see over here there's a drop down that is getting displayed right now inside this input field and when we click on this drop down option as you can see bike car and bus options are getting displayed over here so we can simply select one of the options so let's say we we Select Car in this case so basically this particular option is getting selected and then simply we can click on submit button over here so that the parameter gets submitted to the server but guys in this case we are only able to see F name over here that's because for the input field we have not provided the name attribute and it is very important that whenever you are passing any of the values from the HTML form then you should have the name attribute as well so in this case we will provide the name attribute as the value that is same as ID in this case so let me just provide the transport value over here guys what if we provide the ending tag for the option in this case so let me just provide that as well to all the three options and then we will also provide the value in between the option tags over here so we will say buy and then we have car and then we have bus over here as all the three options being displayed as text over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we go and select the mode of Transport over here in this case so let's say we select car as the option and first name as John and then let me just click on submit button so as you can see F name is getting displayed over here as John which is getting passed as the part of URL that's because we have provided the method as get request over here for the form tag and then the second parameter that is transport is being displayed with the value of car that the user selected While submitting the form so guys in this way you can easily have the drop down options with the help of of the input tag and along with it you can provide the list attribute which will have the value of the ID of the data list element that you are going to Define just like how we have defined over here that is the data list element and inside the data list element you can have different options over here along with their values in this case from which the user can select one of the values so now we will see input attribute autocomplete in input field so guys basically the input autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or the input field should have autocomplete on or off so when we say autocomplete on when the user starts typing he or she will be provided the list of values that was already typed by him or her previously and when the autoc complete is off there will be no suggestions that will be provided by the HTML form or the input field so basically the autocomplete allows the browser to predict the value and when the user starts to type in a field the browser should display the options to F in the field based on the earlier typed values so guys basically whatever suggestions is being provided by the browser it is the OWN users value that was provided to the browser in the previous sessions and there will be no new values that will be provided by the browser so the autocomplete attribute works with the form and the following input types such as text search URL telephone number email password date Pickers range and and color so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so previously we had the first name as the input field now what we will do is again we will have the last name as well so we will simply copy these lines of code and paste it after the first name input field and then over here we will say l name in this case which will stand for last name over here so we say last name and then we will again copy the L name value to the name attribute and the ID attribute as as well so guys basically we will ask the user to provide the first name and the last name as well and we had also provided the drop down list item with the help of the input tag and the data list tag over here so we will keep those options as it is so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the first name and last name over here apart from this we also have the drop down list in this case now guys by default the auto complete will be on for this input type that is text over over here so if we simply go to the first name input field over here and click on this text box as you can see John and programming these were some of the values that I had provided previously to the text boxes and for the last name as well as you can see we have beginners and do that was provided to the last name input field that we had seen in the previous examples so Guys these are the autocomplete suggestions that we can see now guys what if you don't want to see the autocomplete suggestions over here so simply we we can come to this last name in this case the input field and then after this we can have the auto complete attribute so as you can see this is the attribute that we are going to use and then this should be off in this case so when we say autocomplete is off then the browser will not provide any suggestions to the user for this particular input field so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now if we go and click on this last name over here as you can see there is no suggestions that is being provided in this case and if we click on the first name input field we can still see the suggestions that's because by default the autoc complete is on over here so again we can provide the autocomplete attribute and we can provide the value as off in order to turn off the suggestions so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we go and click on this input field there are no suggestions that is being displayed by the browser so guys this is the way that we can provide the auto complete or the auto suggestion feature to the user and based on the browser history of the user the suggestions will be provided by the browser to the user so now over here we have kept the autoc complete on for the first input field that is f name over here and let me just reload this page once again on the browser so now if we come and click on this input field so now we are able to see the values as the suggestions by the browser so now we will see input attribute form in input field so guys basically the input form attribute specifies the form the input element belongs to so we will check this with the help of examples as well in vs code so we have something called as form attribute that you can specify inside the input field when you have that input field outside the form tag so guys the value of this attribute must be equal to the ID attribute of the form element it belongs to so guys let us check this with the help of examples to make it more clear so over here inside the vs code what we have is the first name label along with the input field that is first name and the last name as well apart from this we also have the drop down list with the help of the input tag and the list attribute that we had seen previously with the help of the data list tag so guys over here for the Simplicity purpose we will remove these lines of code that is displaying the drop down list of items in this case and then we will also remove the line brakes over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have first name and last name over here and when the user clicks on submit button the first name and last name attributes will be submitted to the server now guys what if we also want to include the email of the user who is trying to submit the form so let's say if we have the email input field outside this form tag over here so after this form tag we will have the input field in this case with the type email so as you can see we have the input tag along with the type email over here and the same value that is email we will provide it as the value of the name attribute and the ID attribute as well and before this we are also going to have the label and for the for attribute we will say email over here and we will provide the label as email so as you can see we have the label as email followed by colon and then we have the input field in this case let me just provide couple of line breaks over here after this input tag and also after the submit button so that the next input field can be displayed on the next line so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see after the submit button we have the email input field as well but guys if you remember when we click on the submit button only the elements of the form that is the first name and the last name will be provided to the server so let us check that so if we provide John in this case and let's say we provide the last name as to and when we click on submit so so as you can see F name is equal to John and L name is equal to do these two parameters are getting submitted but apart from this let us say we want to also submit the email attribute over here so when the user provides his or her email over here inside this input field and clicks on submit button we want that particular email data as well to go to the server for further processing so in this case what we can do is when we have the input field outside the form tag and we want that in input Fields data to go to the server with the help of the other form attributes we can have the ID for this form so basically we are going to define the ID in this case and we can simply say form one over here and then guys the same value of the ID that is form one we need to copy and paste it as the value to the form attribute for the input tag so the data from this particular input tag that is email is what we want to be passed to the server so we can simp simply come over here to the input tag and provide a form attribute in this case and this value should be same as the ID of the form itself with which the input data should go to the server so over here let me just paste this value that is form one in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser guys previously we had seen that only first name and last name were getting submitted to the server with the help of the URL now let us say we Pro provide John in this case and do in this case and let me just click on submit over here without providing any data to this email input field so when we click on submit as you can see we have the F name and L name but apart from that we also have the email attribute which was not being passed previously since we had not linked this particular email input field with the form which is containing only these two elements over here but now since we have linked the email input field with the form that is form one one the parameter that is email is also getting passed over here so when we provide John in this case and let's say we provide some email ID in this case so we provide test at gmail.com and when we click on submit button over here as you can see John do and the email that is test gmail.com is getting submitted to the server for further processing and we can see this as part of URL that's because the method value is get request over here for the form tag in this case so guys this is the way that we can link any particular input field which is present outside the form tag with the form so that the data inside that input field can be passed with the help of the other data which is being passed with the help of the submission of the form so now we will see input attribute form action in input field so guys basically the input form action attribute specifies the URL of the file that will process the input when the form is submitted so basically the file must be present on on the server site for which we need to provide the URL to the form action attribute so guys if you remember inside the form tag we have the action attribute which specifies the file on the server site it can be any PHP file or any other file which is responsible to handle the request that is coming from the client side now guys if you have some other file that will handle the request that is coming from the client side like for example if you want the request to be handled in a different way when it is coming from the admin so we can have the form action attribute that is attached to the submit button which is separately displayed for the admin over here so it is important to note that this attribute overwrites the action attribute of the form element so even if we have the action attribute inside the form element but the form action attribute that we are going to specify inside the input field is going to override the action attribute that is present inside the form element so guys the form action attribute works with the following input types that is submit button and the image type as well which X has a submit Button as we had seen previously so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so previously we had written certain text boxes that is first name and then last name and then we also had submit button over here and outside the form tag we also had the input type email in this case which we tried to link to that particular form by providing the input tag outside the form so guys what we are going to do is I'm going to remove these lines of code over here since we don't need input tag in this example and we are also going to remove the ID attribute from the form tag now guys over here the form tag is having the default action attribute and let's say we have something called as action 1. PHP so guys this is the file that is responsible in order to handle the request that is going from the client side which is having the dat data that is the first name and the last name over here now guys let us say we want some other file to handle the same data over here with the help of another submit button so what we will do is we will have another submit button in this case so we say input colon submit and then as you can see this input tag is of the type submit and then what we can do is the value we can set it as submit as admin over here so guys basically this normal submit button is for the normal user and when the admin logs into the application then admin must click on this particular submit button which is having the value as submit as admin over here so when the normal user clicks on this submit button the server side file that is action 1. PHP will be called along with the required data that will be passed to the server now guys when the admin clicks on this particular submit button we need some other file to handle this particular data that is going to the server so what we can do is we can provide the form action attribute over here so we say form action attribute inside this input tag that is of the type submit in this case so we say form action and then we need to provide the file name in this case that will handle the request that is going from the admin so over here slash and then let's say we say action uncore admin.php so guys basically when the user clicks on this particular submit button that is submit as admin this particular particular file that is action uncore admin will be called and not this file that is action 1. PHP and this is the main functionality of the form action attribute that allows us in order to overwrite the name of the file on the server which will be responsible in order to handle the request that is being passed by the client side so guys let me just save this file now Ander try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have two buttons that is submit and submit as admin over here guys when the user provides any data in this case so let's say we provide John and the last name is do over here and when the user clicks on the submit as admin the request will be passed to this file that is action admin.php and not action 1. PHP and when the user clicks on this simple submit button the request will be passed to the action 1. PHP which is being provided as the action attribute inside the form tag so guys this will be the main difference so if we click on this submit as admin over here it says your file couldn't be accessed that's because it is trying to find that action uncore admin.php file as you can see this particular file is getting the values of the parameters that was set by the user so you can see the values as well that is f name is John and L name is do over here now guys if we go back once again in this case and we provide the same data that is John do and when we click on this normal submit button now so when we click on this as you can see action 1. PHP file is being called on the server site and this is the main functionality of the action attribute and the form action attribute that we have just seen so in case you want some other server side file to be used in order to process the data that is being passed by the user you can provide some other file with the help of the form action attribute that will be linked to the submit button inside the form so now we will see input attribute form ENC type in input so guys basically the input form ENC type attribute specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitted and it is only applicable when the forms are with the method is equal to post value so guys basically over here ENC stands for encoding and what type of encoding is done when the data is being submitted by the form with the method post is defined by the form ENC type over here it is very important to note that this attribute overrides the ENC type attribute of the form element so by default we have certain value that is assigned to the ENC type attribute which will be overridden by this form ENC type attribute and this particular attribute works with the following input types that is submit and image so guys basically the submit button or the image button that we have inside the form in order to submit the form data will have the attribute that is form ENC type for which we will have certain value so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so basically I'll remove previous lines of code that we had return and we will only keep the paragraph that is below content is in HTML form so guys now we will Define the form with the post request over here so we have the method with the post value and then inside the form what we will do is we will have the field with the first name so we will Define the input with the type text over here and then we will have the name attribute as F name in this case and the same value we will paste it inside the ID attribute as well and before this we will also have the label that is having the for attribute as F name and then we will say first name in this case followed by colon so guys we have a single field over here after which we are going to have couple of line braks in this case now guys simply we will have the submit button over here so input colon submit in this case and we will keep the value as submit so that this particular value is displayed on the submit button so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the first name label and then simply we can provide the first name inside this input field and since the method is of the post value over here inside the form we won't be able to see the parameters being passed as the part of URL when we click on submit so guys when we click on submit in this case there is no change in the URL that is happening but the value is going to the server based on the post method over here but but guys currently the encoding type of the data that is going to the server is the default value what if we want the data to be encoded in a different way so what we can do is inside the submit button we can have the form ENC type over here so as you can see this is the attribute that we can use in this case and it has three values so by default it is text/plain data that is being passed to the server and we can also select multiart / form data over here so if we select this so basically this will be the encoding that will be done to this particular data that is being sent to the server so guys currently we won't be able to see any change but when we are going to learn about the server side scripting and handling the data that is coming from the client side over there we will be seeing the difference between the various values of the form ENC type attribute over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we provide some data over here so let's say I provide the first name is on and click on submit button so basically the data is getting encoded with the help of this particular value and it is passed to the server so guys in this way you can easily provide the value to the form ENC type and based on your requirements you can select one of the values of this particular attribute and handle the data accordingly that is being passed to the server so now we will see input attribute form method in input field so guys basically the input form method attribute defines the http method for sending the form data to the action URL so basically we have two types of HTTP method one is get and another is post so basically the get request helps us in order to send the data by enclosing the data within the URL itself and the user can see what are the different values of the parameters that is being passed to the server and the other HTTP method that is post request does not allow the parameters to be displayed inside the URL and Guys these are the two types of HTTP methods that we can use while we are sending the form data to the server so whenever you are sending certain sensitive data such as password or any other personal information it is recommended that you use the post method of the HTTP request so that it is not being displayed inside the URL when the user clicks on the submit button now guys it is very important to note that the attribute overrides the method attribute of the form element so BAS basically inside the form tag we have the attribute that is Method attribute which can be the get request or the post request but explicitly if we provide the form method attribute inside the submit button inside the form then that particular value will override the value that is being provided to the form tag over here so basically the form method attribute works with the following input types that is submit and image so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so previously we had written certain lines of code in this case we have a paragraph that is below content is in HTML form and then we have a form tag over here inside which we have the method of the post request so guys in this case the values of the parameters that is this input field having the name that is f name will not be displayed inside the URL when the user clicks on submit button so I'll just remove this attribute that is form ENC type that we had seen previously so so basically we have the value of method as post request over here so we should not be able to see the value of the first name inside the URL when the user clicks on submit button let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have below content is in HTML form and we have the label that is first name over here so let's say we provide the first name as John in this case and when we click on submit as you can see we are not able to see the F name parameter inside the URL that's because we have provided the post method over here so guys similarly we can also have the password input in this case so let me just copy these lines of code and paste this over here after the first name and in this case we will have the password as the input type and the name attribute we will update it to password in this case and the same value we will set it to the ID of the input tag as well and for the four attribute of the label we will set it as password and and in this case we will change the label to password over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we provide the first name as John and let's say we provide password as password in this case and click on submit so basically the values are getting submitted to the server and it is also not getting displayed inside the URL and that is how you should be using the post request in order to send certain sensitive data in this case it is the password which is a sensitive data which should not be visible to other users now guys how we can use the form method attribute inside the submit button So currently as we have seen the method type is post request but can we override this method type yes we can do so by using the form method attribute inside the submit button over here so inside this particular input tag that is related to submit button we can have the form method in this case and for this form method attribute we can simply set it as get request so guys basically what we are telling the form to do is pass these values that is the first name and the password as the get request so that those values can be seen inside the URL so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we try to provide the first name and password let us see what happens so when we provide John as the first name and password as the password value in this case and when we click on submit button over here as you can see F name is equal to John and password is equal to password is getting displayed over here inside the URL and this is the functionality of the get request which is the HTTP method inside the form so guys basically we were able to override this value of the method that is equal to post with the help of the form method over here which we set it as get in this case inside this particular submit button let us now do the reverse of this I'll remove this particular attribute that is the form method and simply we will have the get request as the method attribute inside the form tag over here so guys basically by default we will be sending the labels as the part of URL now so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we provide the first name that is programming in this case and password as pass in this case and when we click on submit button by default the first name and the password are getting passed as the part of the URL that's because we have set the method type as get request over here and what if we provide the form method over here once again so we provide the form method with the value as post this time that's because we don't want the password to be displayed as the part of the URL while sending the data to the server so this time we are setting the form method attribute as post value so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and now if you provide the first name that is programming and password as pass in this case let me click on submit so as you can see the data is being submitted to the server and we are no longer able to see the data as part of the URL that's because we have set the form method as post inside the submit button so basically this particular attribute is overriding the value of the method attribute that we had set while defining the form tag in this case so now we will see input attribute form Target in input field so guys basically the input form Target attribute specifies a name or a keyword that indicates where to display the response that is received after submitting the form so in short this form Target attribute will be used in order to display the response that is coming from the server site in the same window or the new window so guys we will check this with the help of examples as well it is important to note that this attribute overrides the target attribute of the form element so guys basically inside the form tag we have the target attribute as well by default it is set to one particular value and that value will be overridden by the form Target attribute that we will Define so this form Target attribute works with the following input types that is submit and image so we can mention the form Target attribute inside the submit or the image buttons that are being used in order to submit the form data so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here here so previously we had written some lines of code it is having the paragraph with the help of ptag and it says below content is in HTML form and then guys we have the form with the method that is get request over here and then the first label we are having as the first name for the first name and then we have another label that is password along with the input type that is password in this case in order to allow the user to provide the password and then guys we have a submit button over here I'll remove this particular attribute that is form method which we had seen previously so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have first name and the password fields in this case so if you provide certain data that is programming in the first name and let's say we provide a password to the password field as well and when we click on submit as you can see both these parameters that is first name and password are getting sent to the server with the help of URL now guys this is not one of the best practices in order to send some sensitive data to the server with the help of the get request that's because anyone can see that data inside the URL over here so whenever you are sending certain sensitive data like in this case we are sending some password over here we should be using the post method but in order to understand this particular example we are setting the method type as get request over here so that we understand the form Target attribute so guys basically by default we have a Target attribute over here for which the value is already set to underscore self in this case so guys this is the default value that the form behaves While submitting any form over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser we will see how the submission of the form Works in this case when we have provided the target attribute over here so let me provide the first name is John and let us say we provide pass as the password and when we click on submit Button as you can see we have the F name and the password parameters important point is over here when the response will come from the server it will be displayed on the same tab that is the same window of this particular browser what if we want the response to be displayed in the new window over here that is the new tab so guys what we will do is in such a case instead of setting the target attribute over here we will set the form Target attribute inside the submit button so in this case we will have the the form Target attribute and in this case simply we can have underscore and the blank value so guys basically when we set the underscore blank value for the form Target the response will come to the new window that is the new tab of the server and it is going to overwrite the current value of the target attribute as well that we have defined inside the form tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we provide the first name let us say say we provide programming as the first name and password as password field and when we click on submit button now so as you can see there is a new window that is opened right now and using that new window we will be receiving the response from the server so guys basically this is the main difference the first window or tab over here is still having the data and the moment we click on this submit button a new window will be opened and the server response will be displayed inside the new window so let me just show you that once again over here I'll close this window right now and we are having just one tab opened on this browser and when we click on submit in this case so as you can see the second tab is opened right now and the response will be displayed on this particular window so guys this is the main functionality of the form Target attribute that we can use While submitting the form and we can provide the value inside the submit button in this case so now we will see form attribute no validate in form tag so guys basically the no validate attribute is a form attribute and when it is present the no validate specifies that all of the form data should not be validated when submitted so guys previously we had seen the attribute that is required which makes the user to provide certain value inside the input field that's because that particular input field is mandatory with the help of the required attribute but guys when we provide the no validate attribute inside the form tag then it overwrites any of the input fields that is having the required attribute and this is what we are going to see with the help of examples as well so guys let us move to the vs code over here and we have a very simple statement that is below content is in HTML form inside the paragraph tag so what we will do is we will provide the form with the method type that is get request over here and inside the form we will have two Fields the first field is the first name so over here we will set it as input colon text and for the name attribute we will set it as F name and the same value we will copy to the ID attribute as well and then before this we will also have the label tag and for the for attribute we will have the same value that is f name and we will Define the label as first name in this case followed by colon so guys basically we have the input field that is the first name over here and then after this we are going to have couple of line breaks in this case now guys similarly we will have the email address as well as the second input field so we'll simply copy these lines of code and paste it over here and instead of type text we will have email in this case and for the name attribute we will copy the same value that is email and for the ID attribute as well we will keep the value as email over here for the for attribute of the label tag we will keep the value as email and instead of first name we will have the email label over here followed by colon we are asking the user to provide the first name and the email address and in this case we will make the email address input field mandatory so what we have to do is inside this input tag that is of the type email we will provide the required input field so guys basically this attribute is responsible in order to make the user to provide some data before submitting the form so guys after these couple of line breaks over here we will again have the submit button in this case so input colon submit which is going to define the submit button and for the value attribute we will have the submit value for this button so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the below content is an HTML form paragraph being displayed over here and then we have two fields that is first name and the email address over here now guys if we simply try to submit this form then as you can see we are getting the message that is please fill out this field that's because we have kept this input field that is email address as mandatory with the help of the required attribute over here so guys only after we provide certain data to this email input we will be able to submit this form so let me just provide some test data over here so as you can see we have provided test gmail.com now let me just click on submit button so now as you can see the F name and the email parameters are being displayed inside the URL over here which is being passed to the server so guys in this way the required field works now guys what if we don't want any of of the validations inside the form when the user wants to submit this form so what we can do is we can use the no validate attribute that can be used inside the form tag so over here after the method that is get request we will simply provide no validate in this case so this is the attribute that is responsible in order to remove all the validations from the input Fields set are present inside the form so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now if you notice without providing any data we will be able to submit the form that's because we have provided the no validate attribute inside the form tag so let me just click on submit button over here so as you can see the F name and the email parameters are being passed to the server with the help of the URL over here because we have kept the method type as get request so if you notice we have not provided any data inside the email address even though we have kept the email address as required over here that's because we have provided the no validate attribute inside the form tag and the moment we remove this no validate attribute from the form tag let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if we try to submit without providing any data to the email address it should through the validation message over here so when we click on submit Button as you can see it says please fill out this field this is the way that no validate Works in order to remove all the validations from the the form Fields over here we have set the no validate attribute once again and when we refresh this page once again over here and when we click on submit as you can see now we are able to submit the data to the server without any validations so now we will see input attribute form no validate in input field so guys basically input form no validate attribute specifies that an input element should not be validated when submitted and the form no validate attribute works with the foll input types that is submit button over here so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code so previously we had seen that inside the form tag we had two fields that is the first name and the email address now for the email address we have kept the attribute that is required which means that the email address is required right now and previously we had also seen what is the functionality of the no validate it will allow us to disable all the validations so guys I'll remove this no validate attribute over here and simply we will have the form tag along with the method that is get request so that all the parameters can be seen inside the URL so we have the first name without the required attribute and we have the email with the required attribute which means the user should provide certain data inside the email field over here before submitting the form so guys after this we have the submit button in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have have the first name and the email Fields over here and simply if we click on the submit button without providing any data so as you can see we have the message that is please fill out this field that's because we have provided the required attribute to this email input field so guys let me just provide certain data over here so as you can see we have provided test at gmail.com in this case so let me click on submit once again this time so as you can see the form is getting submitted and we are not having any value for the first name that's because we have not provided any data and moreover it is not having the required attribute as well which means the field is not mandatory before submitting the form but the email data was provided and the same can be seen over here email is equal to test at gmail.com so guys in this way the required attribute is working but guys let us say we want to disable the validations on all the input fields at are present inside the form tag so simply we can come to the input field over here that is related to the submit button and we can provide the form no validate attribute so as you can see we have this form no validate attribute in this case which will help us in order to disable all the validations that are currently present for all the input Fields inside the form tag over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the first name and the email and this time without providing any data I will we will be clicking on the submit button and we will see what will happen so when we click on the submit Button as you can see the data is getting submitted to the server and we can see F name and email are getting passed to the server over here without any values that's because we have not provided any values to the input Fields over here but guys the important thing in this case is even though email address was marked as required field over here still it is not throwing the validation that's because we have provided the form no validate attribute inside the input button that is representing the submit button in this case for the form tag so guys in this way based on your requirements if you want to disable all the validations for the input fields that are present inside the form tag you can either use the form no validate attribute that is linked to the submit button over here or simply you can use the no validate attribute as well inside the form tag in this case so now we will see canvas Graphics using HTML canvas tag so guys basically the HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics on the fly with the help of the JavaScript so guys we are going to check this with the help of examples as well the canvas element is only a container for the graphics and inside the container we can draw different elements we will be using the JavaScript to actually draw the graphics so basically the HTML element is not sufficient in order to draw the graphics but inside this particular particular container we need to use the JavaScript code in order to draw the different Graphics which can have several methods for drawing the parts boxes circles text and adding some images as well so guys we will check the examples for drawing a line in the canvas so let us move to the VSS code over here in order to see how you can draw the canvas and draw a line inside the canvas so guys basically over here for the title of this document we will say HTML canvas in this case and then after this inside the body we will have a P tag that is the paragraph tag and then we will say below is a HTML canvas element so guys basically we are just having a simple statement that is below is a HTML canvas element and after this we are going to have the canvas tag over here as you can see this is the Mt abbreviation that is provided by the vs code so we have the opening canvas tag and the closing canvas tag and inside this we can have the height and width as well and along with it it is very important that we should also have the ID for this canvas so basically first of all we are going to define the ID and we are simply going to say it as my canvas over here and we will Define the width as 200 pixels in this case and also the height parameter we are going to Define it as 100 pixels so guys basically we have defined the canvas with the ID my canvas over here so that we can use this ID inside the JavaScript code and the width and the height are 200 and 100 pixels respectively now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have a paragraph that is below is a HTML canvas element and we cannot see anything on this page after this guys over here there is an invisible canvas element that is being displayed so if you right click over here and click on the inspect element as you can see the blue area on the web page is the canvas that is being highlighted now guys in order to see it normally without the inspect tool what we can do is we can have the border for the canvas element so we will move to the vs code over here and after this title tag we are also going to define the style tag in this case and simply we are going to use the canvas tag in this case and we are going to have the Border property over here we will set the Border as 2 pixels that is the width of the border and then we are going to make the Border style as solid and the color of the Border as black in this case so guys basically we have the two pixels solid black border color so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see the canvas element is being displayed over here and this is the width and the height of the canvas now guys let us move to the first activity over here how we can draw a line in the canvas so basically we are going to draw the line from the top left section of the canvas that is from this portion to the bottom right portion that is over here here so we are going to draw a diagonal line in this case from top left to bottom right so guys over here the coordinates is 0 0 and this particular coordinate since we know that the width is 200 so the xaxis is going from left to right so if you have learned mathematics we have the xaxis that goes from left to right and the y axis as well that goes from bottom to left but in this case the positive area of the white axis goes from top to bottom over here so this particular point in this case will be at the x coordinates which is equal to 200 and the y coordinate will be equal to 100 that's because the height is 100 pixels over here so we have to come from 0 0 coordinates to 200 and 100 coordinates in this case so guys what we have to do is we need to add certain JavaScript code over here so after this canvas element at the end of the body section we are going to have the script tag as well and inside the script tag we can use the ID of this document in order to identif ify the canvas element and draw the line inside that canvas so guys basically we are going to use the document do get element by ID so over here you can see there's a get element by ID method that we can use so this is the method that we will be using and inside the parenthesis inside the double codes we are going to provide the my canvas ID which we have set to the canvas element over here so guys this particular code is responsible in order to identify the HTML ele element that we have already defined and we are going to assign it to a variable so in this case we will have the variable that is C in this case which stands for canvas over here and then after the statement we are going to have the semicolon in order to end that statement now guys we are going to use this C variable in order to get the context so in which context we want to draw the line we need to draw the line inside this canvas so we say C followed by Dot and then we say get context over here so basically this is the method that is being used in order to get the context and we want the context in the twodimensional format so we simply say 2D inside the double codes and then guys this particular function will return a value which we will store it in the context variable so over here simply we are going to Define another variable that is CTX which stands for context in this case so we are using the short form that is CTX over here and from now on we are going to use this variable that is CTX X in order to draw the line from 0 0 coordinates up to 100 coordinates so guys what we have to do is after semicolon simply we have to use this CTX that is context followed by Dot and then we have to say move two in this case so that we can move to a point that is the coordinates 0 0 so guys basically with the help of this move to Method over here we are getting the cursor to the 0 0 coordinates and then we need to draw the line up to 2 200 and 100 coordinates over here that is the bottom right so what we have to do is we will use CTX variable once again followed by Dot and then we have something called as line two in this case so guys basically line two method will be helping us in order to draw the line up to a particular coordinates which we are going to Define so over here we are going to define the xaxis as 200 and Y AIS as 100 in this case so this is the coordinates that we are pointing to and then then guys after this simply we have to call the stroke method so over here again we call CDX followed by Dot and then we have the stroke method followed by semicolon so Guys these three lines of code is responsible in order to draw the line along these coordinates that we have defined that is 0 0 up to 20000 so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see after reloading this page the line has been drawn inside the canvas from 0 0 coordinates up to 100 coordinates in this case so guys this is the most basic example in order to draw the line inside the canvas now guys similarly we can draw a circle in the canvas as well in this case we will be using the method called as Arc so over here what we will be doing is I'll simply remove these lines of code in this case and then first of all we are going to call the begin path method so CTX followed by Dot and then we have something called as begin path in this case so that the context comes to know that we are going to draw a path that we are going to Define with the help of the upcoming statements as well so after this particular line of code we will say context that is CTX followed by Dot and then we have something called as Arc now guys this particular Arc method takes five arguments the first argument is the xaxis so over here what we will be doing is we want to draw the circle at the center of the canvas over here so the xais should be at the center of this particular entire width of the canvas so guys basically the first parameter should be in terms of xais and it will be located at the center of the circle so we are going to define the circle over here at the center and what will be the center point of that Circle it will be the halfway of the width which is 200 ided 2 which gives us 100 pixels so over here we will say 100 pixels in this case followed by comma and then we want the Y AIS so for the height part we have 100 pixels as the height so we want it at the center so it will be 50 pixels over here so we say 50 in this case which will be the Y coordinates and then guys it will take the radius of the circle that we want to draw so let's say if we provide 40 in this case and then after that it is going to take two angles that is the starting angle and the ending angle so guys initially we want to start from the zero angle and then draw it towards the 3 60th angle which will be the complete circle so in this case we will give 0 followed by comma and then 360 so this is the starting angle and this is the ending angle over here so after this we need to provide semicolon and then guys the last statement is going to be the context do stroke method which will help us in order to draw this particular Arc so over here we will say CDX followed by Dot and then we have the stroke function in this case followed by semicolon so guys using these three lines of code we will be able to see how a circle can be drawn inside the canvas so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are successfully able to draw the circle inside the canvas by using these parameters now guys if we want the center of the circle to be at the extreme left that is at the zero the xaxis so what we can do is instead of having this value that is 100 at the xais we can simply provide zero which means the center of this circle will be at this particular line for which xais will be zero so let me just save this fin now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see Center is over here where xaxis is zero and we are able to see a semicircle over here okay similarly let's say we want the Y AIS to be at the zero position which means the center should be over here so we will be able to see only the quarter of this circle so let us try that as well so so instead of this y AIS which is 50 we will simply provide it as zero let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see Center is over here and it is drawing a circle which is going outside of this canvas but we are able to see only this particular Arc which is just the quarter of the circle so guys in this way you can play around with these numbers and see where the circle is getting displayed inside the canvas now guys apart from this we can also write some text in the canvas as well so how we can do that I'll simply remove these lines of code that is required in order to draw a circle over here now guys we are simply going to call the font property so in this case we will say context followed by Dot and then we have something called as font and let's say we want the font size to be 26 pixels so over here we say 26 pixels and the font family to be aial in this case followed by semicolon so guys first of all we need to define the font of the text that we want to write inside the can element and then after that we are going to f that text using the context followed by Dot and then we have something called as fi text in this case and then after this we are going to have a sample text so let's say we say Hello World in this case followed by comma and then we want to define the position as well so let's say if we want to write this text at the coordinates 50 pixels which is at the xaxis and 50 pixels from the Y AIS so over here simply we will say 5050 followed by comma and then 50 so guys basically this is the text that we want to write and these are the coordinates from where we want to start that particular text and then after this we are going to have semicolon let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see Hello World text is getting displayed inside the canvas and it is starting from the coordinates that is 50 pixels from the xaxis and 50 pixels from the Y AIS over here so Guys these are certain operations that you can carry out inside the canvas element you can achieve a lot with the help of the canvas element and in the upcoming videos as well we are going to learn a lot about this canvas element and how we can make the elements animate inside this canvas element so that we can create some kind of games as well and apart from that we are also going to see how we can interact with the elements inside the canvas element so guys make sure that you subscribe to this YouTube channel that is programming for beginners because we are going to learn a lot about canvas element in the upcoming videos as well and apart from this if you want to know more about the different functions that can be used inside the canvas element we have this developer. mozilla.org website where you can know the different apis that we can use in order to render the canvas so as you can see canvas rendering context 2D so inside this page we are having multiple functions that can be used by you in order to achieve your requirements so when we go to this particular page as you can see there are multiple property and the functions that you can call in order to Define your own designs inside the canvas element and apart from this it is also having the basic elements as well that you can try from your own side so now we will see video tag in HTML to display a video so guys basically the HTML video element is used to show a video on a web page so in case you want to display a video which is already hosted on a server on which your website is hosted so you can easily use a video tag in order to display that particular video on your web page now guys we are going to see the controls attribute that adds video controls such as how to play pause and increase or decrease the volume of the video and we are also going to see how we can use the muted and the autoplay attribute in order to let your video start playing automatically but it will be muted so guys let us check this with the help of examples in VSS code over here so I'll simply remove the previous lines of code that we had written in this case and we will update the title to HTML video over here so guys the very first thing is we will have the paragraph that is below is a HTML video so we'll update this content to video over here and then after this paragraph simply we are going to have the video tag so as you can see inside the starting video tag we have something called as SRC element for which we need to provide the name of the video that we want to include on our web page so guys over here I have kept a Sample video inside this particular directory in which we are having the test.html web page that we are currently editing right now so simply we can use the sample video. MP4 which is the extension of this video that we want to show on the web page now guys if you have the video on some other directory then you have to provide the entire directory path so that the video can be successfully displayed inside the web browser so guys after providing the value to this SRC attribute which is the name of the video that we want to include it is best practice to provide the width and the height attributes as well so that the particular video that we want to display is properly displayed on the screen so over here we will say width of 400 pixels in this case and let's say we want the height of this particular video to be 250 pixels so over here we say height is equal to 250 pixels now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see based on the width and height of the video element that we have defined inside our code we are able to see the video that is being displayed over here but guys we don't have any controls over here so when we take the cursor on this particular video it is simply looking like a image and we cannot click on this particular video as well in order to start this video so what we have to do is we need to use the controls attribute inside this video tag in order to display the play pause and the volume buttons over here so guys simply after this particular height attribute inside the starting video tag we will say controls in this case so as you can see this is the attribute that is being suggested by the vs code as well so we are going to use this controls attribute let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see we have this play button along with it we also have the duration of this video and we also have the speaker which will handle the volume of the video and we can also expand this video to the full screen screen and apart from that we have some more options as well you can see playback speed can also be adjusted from here and we can also select the picture in picture option in this case so guys let me just click on the play button over here so that we can play the video Welcome to another video in which we are going to learn html text that you can use in the HTML so guys basically so as you can see the video was playing right now when we clicked on this play button below are some of the basic HTML Texs that we have already seen in the previous we can also mute it by using this speaker icon over here and it is still being played at the background in this case so guys this is one of the ways in which you can provide the video tag and provide certain video that is being hosted on your website server over here now guys apart from this we also have some other options we can also use the muted attribute along with the autoplay attribute as well so let's say when the user comes on this web page you want this particular video to be autop played so what we can do is simply we have to come over here after the controls option we can provide autoplay attribute as well and apart from this we also have to provide the muted attribute that's because some of the web browsers do not allow autoplay without the muted attribute so if we provide the autop play let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the autop play is not working right now the video is not getting autop played that's because we we have not provided the muted attribute so both the attributes needs to be provided in order to successfully autoplay the video so over here let me just provide the muted attribute as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the video has already started playing itself but it is in mute right now that's because the autoplay feature will only work with the muted attribute so guys this is one of the ways in which you can provide a video on your web page and also provide the different controls in order to pause or play the video or make this video full screen over here as you can see we have expanded the size of this video so that the user experience is better in this case so now we will see how we can display the YouTube video in HTML so guys the easiest way to play videos in HTML is to use YouTube and in this case the video will be hosted by the YouTube but you will be able to display it on your web page by using the if frame tag so over here the logic in order to use the YouTube video is to make use of the video ID to display the video on the HTML web page so guys over here I have the sharable link of a particular video from the YouTube so as you can see this is the video that we want to display and out of this link we only want this particular ID of the video that we want to display on the web page so we need to have a prefix that is https followed by code Lear and then two * forward slashes and then we are going to have youtube.com followed by forward slash and then embed and then after this forward slash we are going to have any ID of the video that you want to display so guys basically this is the prefix that we are going to use so guys let us check this with the help of example and vs code over here so I'll simply remove the previous lines of code that we had WR and we will have the paragraph that will display below is a HTML video from YouTube so guys we have a very simple statement inside the paragraph over here and then we will use iframe Tag over here and this iframe starting tag will have the SRC attribute inside which we need to have the value of the YouTube video that we want to display so guys over here simply we are going to copy this particular link that is the embedded Link in this case and paste it inside the SRC that is the source attribute and then guys it is very important that we should also have the width and the height of this particular if frame so simply we are going to have the width that is 400 pixels in this case and height as well that we are going to Define with 250 pixels in this case so guys basically this is the width and the height of the video that we want to display on the web page and always remember that we should have this particular prefix before providing the ID of the video that we want to display on the web page now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see below is a HTML video from YouTube and this particular if frame is successfully able to display the video from the YouTube in this case so based on the ID of the video that we provide the video will be displayed over here on the web page and simply we need to click on this particular icon that is YouTube in order to play the video so when we click on this welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about the basic html text as you can see it has started playing the video and it is also showing the different controls from the YouTube in this case so we have the closed captions as well and then we have the more settings icon as well so guys the advantage in order to host the video on YouTube and Link that particular YouTube video ID to your web page is that you don't have to store these long videos which is going to take more memory on your web server but simply you can link the YouTube video to your web page and display it to your audiences and apart from this it is also going to have the controls from the YouTube as well which your users can use in order to have the better user experience and in case if you want to change this particular YouTube video Simply you have to come to the source code in this case and inside the SRC attribute you simply have to change the video ID over here so that the video is updated on the web browser so we have come to the conclusion of this HTML tutorial video hopefully you have got enough knowledge about HTML and how you can use different tags in the HTML in order to make different websites based on your requirement s comment in the comment section below if you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like
