so now we will see a simple loading animation in CSS with the help of example over here so guys let us move to the vs code in this case and simply we are going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys we need to create a diff tag that will help us in order to create a circle with the help of the Border CSS property and then we are going to rotate the diff tag in order to create a simple loading animation with the help of C CSS properties so guys first of all we will provide the diff tag with the help of the loading CSS class over here so basically we have used the diff tag with the class name that is loading in this case and simply we are going to use this class name over here inside the style. CSS file so guys we are going to paste this class name with the help of the dot character over here so that we can provide certain CSS properties for this diff tag so first of all we will provide the withd S 200 pixels in this case and also the height of 200 pixels so that we get a square box out of this diff tag over here and then apart from this we will also provide certain background color to the body tag over here so let's say we have a dark background color in this case so we have provided the dark background color and let's see the color of the text is white over here now guys apart from this we also want the background color of this diff tag to be displayed so let's say we have the background color for the diff tag as white color in this case and then apart from this let us get this div tag at the center of the screen so simply we are going to provide the margin CSS property with the value as Auto over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the diff tag that we have included on the HTML file now guys we are going to make a circle out of this diff tag so how do we do that so first of all we will provide the Border radius over here which should be 50% in order to make the diff tag as a circular diff tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see with the help of this border radius equal to 50% we have converted the square box to a circle over here now guys we only want the border of the circle to be displayed so what we will do is simply I'm going to comment out this background color in this case and let's say we provide the Border as 10 pixels with the color that is white and the Border style will be solid in this this case so guys basically we have provided the 10 pixels solid white color border over here instead of the background color so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have provided the Border over here for this particular Circle let us increase the width of the border to 20 pixels so that we can see the loading animation properly so as you can see this is the circle that we have drawn over here and this is just the border that we have included now guys simply we can rotate this circle in order to see the simple loading animation and in order to do that we need to have one side of the Border have a different color so what we will do is we will divide this values for the Border CSS property so first of all we will say border width of 20 pixels that we had defined and then the Border style should be solid so over here we will Define the Border style as solid in this case and then guys for the Border color we will provide the color as white so simply we will say border color in this case so all these are CSS properties that you can Define separately let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see there is no change right now we want the top border to be of the different color so simply we will Define the first color which will be corresponding to the top border over here as gray color so let's say we provide the gray color as the value for the top border and then for the left and right border we want the white color and then for the bottom side we also want the white color to be displayed so guys basically the first border color will be top color followed by the right hand side and Then followed by the bottom side and then we have the left hand side so over here the gray color will be at the top side and then this white color will be at the right side followed by the white color at the bottom side and then again since we have not provided the fourth color the left color will be taken from this particular white color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can you can see this is the gray color at the top of the circle over here now guys simply we want to rotate this circle with the help of the animation so what we will do is we will simply Define the key frames over here and then we will say loading as the name of the animation so what we want to do is simply at the 0% we are going to provide the CSS property that is transform over here and simply we are going to say rotate and initially it should be 0° in this case and then after this for the 100 % what we are going to do is we are going to Define this as 100% over here we are going to still use the transform CSS property and this time we want to rotate it by 360° over here so guys as you can see we are going from 0° to 360 Dee as far as rotation of the HTML element is concerned and now guys we are going to link this animation to the diff tag over here so basically for this particular block of CSS properties we are going to provide the animation name over here so simply we are going to provide the loading that is the animation name we have provided in this case after the key frames keyword and also we need to provide the animation duration which we can say 2 seconds in this case so guys basically within 2 seconds the animation should complete let me just save this file now and try reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see the circle is rotating itself and only once it has rotated itself so guys basically we can also use the iteration count as well for the animation so over here we will say iteration count equal to infinite so that it loads infinite number of times so let me just reload this page so as you can see the diff element that is the circle is rotating itself continuously within the span of 2 seconds over here now guys if you notice the speed of the animation is decreasing at the end of the animation over here so what we can do is simply we can provide the speed as linear in this case so we need to use the animation timing function in which case we are going to provide the value as linear so let me just save this file now and try reload this page once again on the browser so as you can see the speed of the loading icon is linear over here and this is the way that you can easily create the loading animation icon with the help of the HTML and the CSS properties so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like
