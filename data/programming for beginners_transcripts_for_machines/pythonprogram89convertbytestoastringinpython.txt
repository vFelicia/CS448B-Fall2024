welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to convert bytes to a string so guys basically we can easily convert the bytes to string using the decode method and we are going to check this with the help of example as well now guys we are going to take this example that we have the keyword that is yes and then followed by some bytes over here so I'm going to Simply copy this and we are going to convert it into the string using the decode method so let us move to the vs code over here now guys what we will do is simply we have the print statement and inside this in order to represent the bytes we have to use the b letter over here and then followed by double quotes inside which we need to provide the bytes in this case so let's say we have the string that is yes and then the bytes that are being represented in this format and then guys what we can do is after this double quote we can use Dot and then we have something called as decode function so guys over here we will be using the decode method and inside this we will will be providing the utf8 so basically this is the format into which we want to convert this by so guys this is a very simple way in order to convert the bytes into the string let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got yes and then we have this tick mark over here in green color and that is what is being represented by this series of characters now guys what if we don't provide P letter in this case so what will happen so let me just remove that and let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got the error that states Str object has no attribute D code basically since we are enclosing this entire string into double quotes it is being taken as a string format and we don't have decode function that can be used on a string value so in this case we need to use this P letter so that this content inside the double quotes is being interpreted as the bytes and then those are converted to string so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got this tick mark once again over here on the terminal so guys next time if you have any bytes over here and if you want to convert it into string so this is the simple statement that you can use in order to achieve your task please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program for string slicing examples so stay tuned
