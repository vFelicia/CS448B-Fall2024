so now we will see string in JavaScript so guys basically string is a text that can be assigned or stored inside the variable and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so this is the syntax that you can define a particular string so as you can see we have used the const keyword over here followed by the name of the variable that is Str Str now guys this particular variable will be a string when you provide the value on the left hand side which is enclosed in between the double quote over here so as you can see this particular value that is programming for beginners is enclosed in between the double codes and that is why the data type of this particular variable will be string over here now guys you can either use the double codes or the single code or you can also use the back take so all these we are going to check with the help of examples as well so let us move to the vs code over here so first of all let us Define the variable by using the const keyword so let's say we provide the variable name as Str Str that is string over here equal to and then we need to provide the value inside the double codes over here so guys basically we provide the value that is programming for beginners that is the name of this YouTube channel that you should subscribe if you have not done so we have provided the value that is programming for beginners in between the double Cotes over here let us print the type of this particular string variable so simply we can use the type of operator over here and then followed by the name of the variable that is Str Str so guys basically this particular log statement will help us in order to print the data type of this particular variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code by using the node command on the terminal so we provide node followed by space character and then the name of the Javascript file that is test.js so when we press enter as you can see we are getting the string data type over here that's because we have provided the value in between the double code over here and simply in order to print the string what we can do is again we can provide the console. log statement and this time we will provide the name of the variable that is St Str so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see the data type is string and then we are getting the value of the string that is programming for beginners over here instead of using the double codes simply we can use the single quote as well so instead of providing double quote we are providing single Cote so over here so when we run this code once again we are not going to see any change as far as the output is concerned that's because it is same whether you provide the double codes or the single code when you are defining the string value now guys apart from this you can also concatenate two string by using the plus operator over here when you're using numbers the plus operator is used in order to add two or multiple numbers but when you're using string data type the plus operator will be used in order to join the two strings so guys let us Define another string over here so let's say we provide const and then Str str1 it is equal to and this time we provide YouTube channel over here so we have YouTube channel as the string and before the YouTube key word we provideed the space character since we are going to join both the string that is Str Str and St str1 so guys what we will do is simply I'm going to comment out this line of code over here and then again we are going to provide the console. log statement this time we will say St Str and then we will use the plus operator in order to join both the strings so guys basically this is the concatenation of two strings meaning we are joining two strings with the help of the plus operator and then on the right hand side we provide Str str1 the number of variables is not limited to two over here you can use as many times the plus operator as you want based on the requirements and provide the variable names that are having the string values so guys over here we are joining the Str Str and St str1 let us see what will be the output so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the browser as you can see we are getting programming for beginners YouTube channel so guys basically we have joined these two string values over here with the help of the concatenation operator that is the plus operator over here and in this way you can join two or multiple number of string values now guys apart from this you can also provide the codes inside the codes in a string over here so basically we are using single code over here in order to enclose the entire string let us say we want to provide double codes inside this string which is enclosed with the help of the single code so let me just comment out this line of code over here so what we will do is let's say we provide programming for beginners and then over here we want to provide YouTube channel within the double codes inside the first string over here so simply we provide the double codes over here and then we provide YouTube channel as the string value so guys basically the entire string value is enclosed within the single code over here and this time we can use the double code since the main string is enclosed within the single code let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the browser so we have not provided any log statement over here so I'll just uncomment this line of code so that we are able to see the value of the string variable so let me just run this code once again as you can see programming for beginners and then the YouTube channel is enclosed in between the Double C code and in this way you can provide the double code inside the single code now guys can you provide double code inside the double code no in this case so if you try to provide double codes as the main special character that is enclosing the entire string so basically as you can see we are getting the error over here so in this case you have to provide single code over here so basically instead of double code for the YouTube channel we are providing single code over here so this time instead of having double code for this YouTube channel we will will get the single codes so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting programming for beginners and then single quote over here since we are using the double quote as the main special character to enclose the entire string value over here now guys apart from this you can also use the template strings with the help of the backt so when you're using the back te you can provide the single quote and double quote inside the string value over here so let us check that as well so guys over here what we will do is let us say we provide backt over here that is the starting and the ending backt and then we will say programming for beginners but guys over here we want the programming for beginners to be present inside the double code so simply we can provide the double code which will enclose the programming for beginner string over here and then we have the YouTube channel which must be present in between the single code so over here we provide two times single codes and then we provide YouTube channel over here so basically this backt which is enclosing the main string over here will help us in order to provide both that is double quote as well as the single code this time so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see we are getting programming for beginners between the double codes and then inside the single code we are getting the YouTube channel over here so guys you can also use the template string over here which means by using the back tap you can represent the string value this back tap also helps you in order to include the value of the other variable as well so what we can do is let us say we provide certain number over here with the help of the X variable and let us say we provide the number as one in this case so guys basically we want to append this number that is one inside the strings so what we will do is programming for beginners YouTube channel and then after this we want to provide hyphen and then the value of this number so how do we provide the value of the X inside this particular string so basically since we are using back Teck over here simply we can use the dollar symbol and then inside the open and close curly braces we can use the name of the variable that is x in this case so guys basically this is going to print the value of the variable that is X so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see programming for beginners YouTube channel and then we are getting the value that is one over here so guys in this way it becomes very important when you use back tap in order to represent the Str Str value now guys apart from this you can also find the length of the string by using the length property over here so basically what this length property will do is it is going to print the number of characters that are present inside a particular string so guys let me just change the string value over here to test in this case so basically it is having four characters over here I'll also remove this line of code since it is not required for now so guys basically we are printing the test string over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting the value that is test now let's say we want to find the number of characters that are present inside this string value so what we have to do is we need to make use of this Str Str variable over here followed by Dot and then we have something called as length over here so guys basically this length property will help us in order to get the number of the characters that are present inside this particular string value so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting number four as the length of the string so in this way you can get the number of characters that are present inside the string value let's say we provide more string value over here as the test data so as you can see now there are nine number of characters inside this particular string let us verify that with the help of this length property over here so when we run this code once again so as you can see we are getting 9 as the length of this particular string variable now guys apart from this you can also use the Escape characters inside the string value so guys over here what we had seen previously is inside the double codes you cannot provide more double quotes over here so if we try to provide a double quote in this case so as you can see we are getting the error but let's say if you want to provide the double quat within this main double quat over here which is enclosing the entire string so what you can do is simply you can use the Escape character which means you need to provide an additional back slash character over here here before the special character that you have provided so guys this is nothing but the Escape character that will help you in order to print the special characters which cannot be printed normally so let me just run this code once again we will print the value of the string variable over here so when we see the output as you can see test and then followed by the double quote over here and then we have the data in this case similarly we can have other special characters as well so we have the single code over here so again again in between the test data there will be single code that will be printed over here let's say if you want to print a back slash character so simply you provide a back slash character once and then again you provide the backs slash character so the first back slash character is the escape character over here let me just save this file now and only once the back slash character will be visible over here which is the second back slash character in this case so guys in this way you can use the Escape characters as well we can also compare the strings as well so what will do is let's say we have the string character that is a over here and we want to see whether a is greater than another character that is B so guys over here we are using the two string values that is having this one character that is a and b over here so is a greater than b no in this case so let us see what will be the output so when we run this code over here as you can see we are getting false in this case but let us say we change the value of the left hand side string to C over here so is C greater than b yes in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting true as the output so guys we can use any of the comparison operators in order to compare the two string values as well now apart from this we can also access the string by using the open and close square brackets over here so guys let us say we have the string value that is test data and let's say we want to access the first character over here so we only want the first letter that is T to be printed on the console so so guys what we will do is simply we use the St Str that is the name of the variable and then inside the open and close square brackets this particular T is being represented by the zero index over here so the count starts from zero and then the next letter that is e is represented by one and then we have two which represents the S character and then we have 3 4 5 and so on simply we need to provide the index number that is zero over here so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the console so as you can see we are getting the first letter that is T over here in order to access the second letter that is e over here simply we need to change the index number to one so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see we are getting e letter printed over here on the terminal now guys what will be the output if we provide St Str and Then followed by the index number that is five over here so comment in the comment section below what will be the output of this particular log statement when we have this string value that is test data over here let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you
