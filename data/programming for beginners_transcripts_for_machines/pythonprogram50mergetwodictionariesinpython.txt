hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to merge two dictionaries so guys there are multiple ways in order to merge dictionaries over here as you can see we are going to check three ways in order to merge dictionaries so the very first way is using the or operator over here so guys let us check this using the Python program in vs code over here so the very first thing that we will be doing is we will Define two dictionaries that is dictionary one it is equal to and then we have the key that is one and then colon we can say a and Then followed by comma and then we have another key that is to colon and then the value of this key it is equal to P so guys let us say we have this as dictionary one over here and then let's say we have dictionary 2 as well and inside this we will again have the key over here is 2 followed by colon and then this time we will provide the value as C and then comma and then let's say we have the key as fourth and then go learn and then over here we have the value of this KSD so guys this is the way that we can initialize the dictionary which is having the key value page over here the key is the integer data type in this case and the value it is of the character or the string data type over here now guys when we are merging which means we are making both these dictionaries combined into one dictionary over here as you can see it is having the same key that is 2 which is having the value of B in the first dictionary and the key that is 2 it is having the value as C in the second dictionary so guys always remember that whenever we are merging the two dictionaries if the same key is present in both the dictionaries then the value of the latest dictionary will be taken for that particular key so guys we will check this with the help of example as well when we are printing the merging of these dictionaries so the very first way in order to merge the two dictionaries is to using this or operator so how we can use that we can simply put provide the print statement and inside this we will provide dictionary 1 that is the ICT one over here followed by our operator in this case and then we have dict2 that is dictionary two so guys this is as simple as you can see over here in order to merge the two dictionaries when we save this file now and try running this code as you can see we have got one dictionary having all the key value pairs so the key that is one it is having the value as a and then the key that is 2 is having the value as C from the second dictionary and this proves that the latest value of the same key will be taken whenever the keys are present in multiple dictionaries and we are merging them and then as for the key that is 4 we are having the value as d as well because this is one of the ways in which we can merge two dictionaries over here now guys there is another way in order to merge the dictionary by using this double star operator so how we can do that simply again we will be using the print statement over here so I'll just comment out this line in this case and then we will have another print statement over here what we have to do is we have to use the open and close curly braces this time and then we have to use two time star characters and mention the dictionary variable name so dict1 followed by comma and then again 2 times star characters and then we have dict2 that is dictionary two so guys both the dictionaries needs to be mentioned with these double stars as the prefix and then both of them should be present inside the open and close curly braces in order to merge them now guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got the key value page that is all the key value passed from both the dictionaries over here and we have successfully merged both the dictionaries guys the Third Way is to use the copy and update method over here so what we can do is simply I'll just comment out this line once again and what we will will be doing is we will be creating a third dictionary so we will say dict3 in this case it is equal to what we will do is first of all we will copy the first dictionary inside this dictionary three so we will be using dict1 followed by Dot and then we have something called as copy so guys this is a method that will help us in order to copy the content of dictionary 1 into dictionary 3 over here so guys the content of dictionary 1 is present in dictionary three right now so if you simply provide a print statement with this variable name that is dictionary 3 so we provide dict3 it should have the same content that is present inside dictionary one so let me just save this file now and try running the score so as you can see we have got the key that is 1 which is having the value a and key 2 is having the value of p and this is the same content that is present inside dictionary one now guys how do we get the content of dictionary 2 inside this dictionary 3 over here so simply we can use the update method at this time so over here we will provide dictionary 3 followed by Dot and then we have something called as update method and then this update method will take the parameter that means another dictionary over here so I provide dictionary 2 this time because we need to update it with the dictionary 2 in this case so guys this is the copy and update method that can help us in order to merge multiple dictionaries over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got the key that is 1 it is equal to a key 2 is equal to C and key 4 is equal to D so guys over here the key that is 2 it is equal to C is being included over here and key 4 with d is also included basically all the keys and values we have already got inside dictionary 3 which is being printed over here on the Domino so Guys these are the three ways in order to merge multiple dictionaries and print them according please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and
