so now we will see input type password in HTML form so guys basically we can have the input tag and we can set the value of the type attribute over here as password so that whatever content you type inside this particular input field will not be displayed on the UI and the main use case over here is when you are logging in into a particular website you are providing your username and when you type the password you don't want someone else to see while you're typing it on the screen and that is where we use the input type password over here which defines the password field in this case so guys let us check this with the help of examples in VSS code over here so previously we had checked the input type that is text which allows us to provide certain kind of input with the help of a text field and this is how we can see the text field over here so guys what we will do is we will make some changes in this case so we will remove the second input field over here we will keep the first first label as username in this case so we will change the label to username over here and the input type will be text and we will set the name as username which will be used by the server in order to refer to the value provided into this text field and the ID that we provide over here will be username in this case and as I've told you the ID of this input must be set as the value for the for attribute over here for the label so that when the user clicks on this username label the cursor for this text field will be activated so we change this to username in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have a simple text field over here with a username label and when the user clicks on this username this particular text field will get activated and we can simply provide the username for the login purpose now guys what we will do is we will have another field over here which will be the password field but we want that field to be of the type password so that whatever we type inside that particular text field will not be displayed over here since password should be secret so what we will do is I will simply copy and paste these lines of code over here that is label and input and for this input that is the second input over here we will change the type to password in this case so as you can see the type is equal to password and the name we will change it to password over here and then the ID as well we will change it to password in this case now guys this particular ID should be linked to this label so I'll copy this ID and paste it inside the for attribute over here and the label should be password in this case so we have changed the label as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got the password text field as well now guys because we have set the type as password over here whatever we type inside this password text field will not be displayed to the user so when we start typing over here inside this text field so over here we are not able to see the characters that I am typing right now but the same thing when we type over here in the username you can see that we can type anything that we want and we can see it inside the text field over here so guys this is the main functionality of the input type password over here it doesn't allow anyone else to see what exactly you are typing inside that text box now guys when we are working of sending of this data that is username and password it is recommended that we use the post request over here so for example let's say we have another input that is the submit button over here so we will say input type submit and then the value that we provide is submit in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have provided submit button in this case so guys when we click on this submit Button as you can see user name is equal to so some data will be sent over here that's because by default the method for this form tag is get request so we have another attribute over here that is method for which there are two values that we can use the get request which is by default the value that is set for this method attribute and that is what we are using right now over here and the post request which will help us in order to hide this data so by default the get request is being called over here so what exactly is happening I'll show you once again over here we will reload this page and let's say for username we provide use username over here and for password we provide simple password in this case but guys when we click on submit over here as you can see the username is equal to username that was provided and password is equal to you can see that what I have typed over here is being displayed inside the URL so we should avoid this whenever we are dealing with submission of the form and that form contains some sensitive data so how we can avoid it is by using the post request over here so when we provide the post method and the request goes to the particular file that we defined in the action attribute in such case the username and password data will be sent as part of the HTTP request so guys it won't be displayed inside the URL over here so let me just save this file once again and try reloading this page on the browser so now if we provide the username in this case and then let's say I provide some password over here and click on submit as you can see the URL is not displaying the user username and password over here but it will be passed to the server as the HTTP request so in such cases when the passwords needs to be validated or if there is any sensitive data that is supposed to be sent on the server site we must use the post request over here by mentioning it to the method attribute of the form tag so that our sensitive data is protected from any other viewer who is trying to submit the form so guys this is the way that we can create the password text field using the HTML form for comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video
