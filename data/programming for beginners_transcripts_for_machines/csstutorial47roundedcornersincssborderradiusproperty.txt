so now we will see rounded Corners in CSS so guys basically in CSS the Border radius property can be used in order to provide the rounded Corners to the HTML elements and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well remember that we can easily use the Border radius property and provide certain length unit in order to provide the rounded Corners to the HTML element so guys let us check the example with the help of the div element that is having the background color over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines from the style. CSS and the HTML file over here now guys what we will do is simply we are going to have the diff tag and inside the diff tag we are going to say this is a sample HTML element so guys basically we have this very simple statement that is this is a sample HTML element over here now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this is a sample HTML element which is inside the diff tag now guys let us provide certain CSS properties over here to the diff tag so inside the style. CSS file we will be having the diff tag over here and for this diff tag we are going to have the background color so let's say we are going to set the color as yellow over here and then apart from this we will also set the border so border width will be two pixels over here apart from this the Border style will be solid and the color will be black in this case and let us also provide certain paddings so let's say we provide five pixels of padding over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the yellow background color and also the border that is getting displayed for this particular div element now guys since the div element is the Block Level element that is why it is taking the entire width of the screen so guys what we can do is simply we are going to say display it is equal to in line so that the div element only takes the width that is required by the content of this Dev element so over here we will say display it is equal to in line so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the div element that is taking only that much width which is required by the content of the div element now simply we can use the Border radius property over here in order to provide the rounded corners for this HTML element that is the diff tag so simply we can provide the length unit of let's say 5 pixels over here so guys border radius is the CSS property that we can use and the length unit that we are using right now is 5 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have certain rounded Corners over here let me just zoom in little bit so as you can see these are the rounded Corners that are implemented for this particular Dev tag if we remove this border radius property let me just save this file now so currently there are no rounded corners but when we provide the Border radius CSS property along with certain value over here so when we reload this page as you can see these are the rounded Corners let me just increase the value to 10 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see these are the rounded Corners that can be displayed for this particular HTML element so guys in this way you can easily use the Border radius CSS property in order to have the rounded Corners over here guys apart from this we can also use the value in terms of percentage for the Border radius so guys let's say we provide 10% of Border r radius in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the 10% border radius that you can see over here similarly if you provide 50% of Border radius what will happen so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the 50% value for the Border radius that we have provided now guys you can also make a circle over here for a particular div element in this case now guys you can also create a circle by using the B radius with the help of the diff tag over here but in that case you need to provide the width and height of the diff tag in such a way that both the width and the height must be equal so guys let us check that as well so what we are going to do is simply we will say width it is equal to 100 pixels and height it is again equal to 100 pixels over here and apart from this we will remove this property that is display it is equal to inline right now and then let us decrease some text over here so simply we are going to say the word that is div in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is a circle that is getting implemented right now let us remove this text from the diff tag over here and guys this circle is Possible only when you provide the Border radius it is equal to 50% when you make it as 40% it won't be the perfect circle let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see it is not a perfect circle right now when we remove the Border radius there will be no rounded Corners right now and it will be simply a square since we have provided the width and height which is having the same value that is 100 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is a square that is getting displayed right now with the help of the div tag but when we provide the Border radius of 50% it will be the circle that will be displayed on the web browser so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the circle that is getting displayed on the web browser so guys in this way if you want a circle or the rounded corners for the HTML elements based on your project requirements you can use the Border radius property inside the style.
