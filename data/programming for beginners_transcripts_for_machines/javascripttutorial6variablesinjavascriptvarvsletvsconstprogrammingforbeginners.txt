so now we will see variables in JavaScript and we are going to see what is the difference between where let and const keywords in JavaScript so guys basically variables are containers in order to store the data in JavaScript and basically these JavaScript variables can be declared in four ways so first of all the variable can be automatically declared when we don't use any of these keywords over here and by default behind the scenes the where keyword is used internally in order to declare that particular variable a able so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so we have the test.js file that we have already created and let us say we provide the variable name as X over here followed by equal to operator and then let us say we provide the number that is 10 in this case so guys in this way we can define a variable which is storing the value that is 10 over here and basically we can use the variables in order to complete different arithmetic operations as well and many other functionalities can be achieved so guys over here the variable name is X so what we can do is simply we can access this variable inside the console. log statement so over here inside the parenthesis simply we are going to have the ptic and then we are going to say the value of x is and Then followed by dollar and then after this we are going to say open and close curly braces inside which we can provide the name of the variable that is x in this case so guys basically this is the format that we use in order to print the value inside the console.log statement inside the back Tex over here now guys remember that this particular format will not work when you use the double quotes or the single codes inside the console.log statement so let me just save this file now and let us open the terminal over here and let us run this Javascript file with the help of the node keyword in this case so guys basically when you are running the Javascript file as a standalone file over here you need to use the node keyword and you also have to install the nodejs software in this case but in case you are running the Javascript file along with the HTML and the CSS files in order to achieve some functionality on your web page then nodejs is not required so guys always remember in order to run the JavaScript as the backend program you need to have the nodejs installed on the machine and this is the way that you can run the Javascript file in this case so when we press enter as you can see the value of x is 10 in this case and this is the way that you can assign certain value to a variable inside JavaScript now guys always remember it is very important that you have some sensible name over here so simply we can say number one in this case which is having the value that is 10 so instead of having the variable name that is X over here simply we can have number one in this case and the strings can also be updated over here so as you can see this is looking more decent over here any other programmer who is going to review your code will find it helpful in order to read these variable names in this case so guys this particular string will be displayed on the console so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see the value of number one is 10 now guys this is as far as the automatic variable declaration is concerned in which case behind the scenes the we keyword is being used internally guys whatever value we provide over here that value will be provided to the variable so instead of having the number we can also have another string over here so let us say we provide programming for beginners that is the name of this YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe so guys over here we have provided the string in this case as the value to this particular variable that is number one so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see the value of number one is programming for beginners so guys whatever value we provide on the right hand side of the assignment operator that value will be provided to the variable on the left hand side that we have declared so you don't have to provide any of the data types such as string or integers like how you provide in the c or C++ programming language also if you're using Java you have to provide the data type over there but in JavaScript you don't have to provide any of the data type now guys apart from this you can also use the we keyword over here which is going to have the global scope in this case so guys what we will do is instead of having the number one variable name before that we can simply have the wear keyword over here so guys this is another way in order to declare the variable by using the wear keyword in JavaScript so guys if you print the same statement once again it is not going to change anything so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see the value of number one is programming for beginners so guys basically this is another way in order to declare the variables in JavaScript now guys there is a difference between this wear keyword and the other two keywords that we are going to see so guys basically this where keyword is having the global scope in this case now what is the meaning of global scope so guys over here sometimes you are going to create some functions inside the JavaScript or you are simply going to have the block scope in this way in which case you are going to have the two curly braces over here inside which you are going to have some more variables that is x y and then let us say we have Zed in this case so guys whatever variables you define by using the wear keyword those variables can be accessed within this particular curly braces and outside of these curly braces as well and that is the meaning of global scope so guys over here this XY Z variables will be accessed inside the curly braces when we are going to print them and also outside of these curly braces when we are going to print them by using the console.log statement but guys that is not the case with the other two keywords that is let and cons so guys basically the let keyword was added in 2015 which is going to have the block scope over here what is the meaning of blog scope so guys let us say we have this particular block that is from the line number four up to line number six and when we Define the variables by using the let keyword over here so these XY Z variables will only be accessed within these particular curly braces you won't be able to access them outside of these curly braces and that is the meaning of blog scope in this case and similarly if you are defining them within the function they will be accessible within that function itself and not outside of that function but this limitation is not present with the we keyword when you decare the variables and similarly you can use the con keyword over here which is again going to have the block scope which means when you define the variables by using the const keyword in this case they will be accessed within this particular block scope only and not outside of this block scope so guys what is the difference between the let and the const keywords over here when you declare the variables so guys basically whatever variables you define by using the let keyword can have another value and you can reassign another value to that particular variable but this is not the case with the const keyword over here so guys basically const meaning constant in this case and whatever value you provide with this particular variable it cannot be changed throughout the code so we will check the example of this const key keyword as well so what we will do is in order to understand the difference between the where let and const keyword let us take certain examples over here so guys let us say we have the we keyword in this case and we provide the variable that is X and it is having the value that is 10 in this case and then we are going to have another scope by using the curly presses and let us say we Define another variable once again that is variable y this time and we are going to have the value that is 20 in this case so guys let us try accessing the value of y over here so so simply we are going to have the BX in this case and we will say y it is equal to we will say dollar and then inside the curly braces we will say Y in this case and then apart from this again we are going to access the value of y over here outside of the curly braces over here we will make certain changes so let us say we provide outside y over here and in this case we will say inside Y in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see inside y it is equal to 20 and outside y it is equal to 20 once again so guys what does this mean so basically the variable that is y it is being declared by using the Vare keyword over here which means it can be accessed within this particular curly braces and it is happening over here that is this inside Y is getting printed over here on the terminal but it can also be accessed outside of these curly braces and that is the reason why we are also able to see outside y it is equal to 20 once again now guys what will happen if we provide the let keyword over here instead of where keyword so when we say let y it is equal to 20 we have already discussed that it is having the block scope over here which means this particular y variable can be accessed only within this particular block scope which means the inside y will be printed but when we come over here that is outside y this particular y variable is not present outside of these curly braces we are having X over here but not y this time so when we save this file now and run this code once again over here as you can see we are are getting the error so first of all we are getting the string that is inside y it is equal to 20 so this thing is getting printed over here but when the control flow comes over here outside of the block scope that is the curly braces it is throwing the error it says why is not defined that's because we have provided the Y variable inside of this curly braces and we have used the let keyword over here which is not allowing this particular variable name to be accessed outside of these curly braces and guys that is the difference between the leg and the wear keyword in this case and then apart from this let us also provide the const keyword over here so when we say constant y it is equal to 20 so again we will be getting the same output so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting the inside y it is equal to 20 but it says outside y y is not defined over here that's because we have defined the Y variable with the cons keyword in this case which is again having the block scope over here now guys the difference between the let and the const keyword in this case is basically we cannot reassign the value to the variable which is defined with the const keyword over here so what we will do is simply I'm going to comment out this line of code and we will say let's say why it is equal to 30 this time so basically we are assigning another value to the variable y over here which is being declared by using the constant keyword and this thing is going to throw the error that's because we cannot assign it another value once we have assigned the value to the constant variable for the first time so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the terminal so as you can see again we have CAU the error over here why it is equal to 30 assignment to constant variable so basically this is the error that we are getting so instead of having the const keyword over here simply we will say let keyword this time and let me just save this file now and if you want to reassign a variable with some other value so that is the time that you should use the let keyword over here so when we run this code once again so as you can see inside y it is equal to 30 first of all we had assigned the value of 20 to the variable that is y and then again we have reassigned the value of 30 to the variable y so it is having the latest value as 30 and that is the value that is getting printed over here inside the console.log statement so guys in this way you can use the be keyword or the let keyword or the con keyword in order to define the variables so guys it is a good practice in order to always declare the variables before you use and it is always recommended that you use the con keyword in in case you are defining any of the variables and let's say if you want them to change the values in future then you should use the let keyword over here it is always recommended to avoid the we keyword because it might lead to unexpected results so guys what can be the unexpected results so what we will do is let us say we provide the variable that is X once again over here and we provide the value of 20 this time so let me just provide the inside X it is equal to the value of x over here and then similarly we will say outside X X once again outside of this block this time so guys over here we have the variable that is X outside which is having the value of 20 and inside the block as well we are having the variable X which is having the value 20 over here both these variables are using the rare keyword over here now guys what do you think will be the output as far as the inside X and the outside X is concerned so guys let us check that so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see inside X it is equal to 20 which is correct over here that's because we have provided the variable X in this case inside the curly bra and the same value is getting printed over here but guys the same variable X is being used outside of this particular block scope and we are again having the outside x value as 20 this time so guys this is the unexpected result we were expecting that this particular value that is 10 which was assigned to the variable X over here outside of the blog scope must have been printed over here when we said outside X but that is not the case this particular value was taken and that is why when we use the wear keyword it might lead to unexpected results when your JavaScript code is becoming more and more complex so guys there are certain important points that you should know when to use where let or con so guys it is very important to note that you should always declare the variables apart from this always use cons if the value should not be changed and then always use cons if the type should not be changed such as the arrays and objects which we are going to check in the upcoming videos as well only use let if you cannot use cons keyword and only use wear keyword if you must support the old browsers so guys currently there are certain old browsers which are still supporting the wear keyword in which case you have to use the we keyword in order to declare the variable so these are some of the best practices that you must follow while you are declaring the variables so guys comment in the comment
