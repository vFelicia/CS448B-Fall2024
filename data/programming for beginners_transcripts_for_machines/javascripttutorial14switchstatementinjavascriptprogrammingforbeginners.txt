so now we will see switch statement in JavaScript so guys basically the switch statement is used in order to perform the different actions based on the different conditions over here and instead of using the if else conditional statements that we had seen previously you can also use the switch statement if you have multiple different actions to be performed based on the Expressions value so guys over here this is the syntax that you can use first of all you have to use the switch keyword over here and then inside the open and close parenthesis you need to provide the expression it can be a Boolean value over here or a simple number as well that is being passed to the switch statement in this case this expression can be any number over here or the string as well and based on the value of this particular expression the control flow will try to match the number or the string over here inside the block of code so guys over here if this particular expression is equal to X so basically the case keyword is used followed by the value that is X over here so if the expression is equal to X so this block of code that is matching the case X over here will be getting executed so basically this code block will be executed after which we have to provide the breake statement so that the control flow comes out of the switch statement over here and then if the expression is equal to Y so basically the control flow will come over here it will check that Y is not equal to X this time but the next case that is case y will get match over here and then this particular code block will be EXE execute it and then we have the break statement once again and then guys after this in the end we should also have the default case over here which will help us in order to execute this code block when there were no matches for these particular cases inside the switch statement so guys let us check the working of the switch statement in JavaScript over here let me just remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the vs code so over here what we will do is let us say we provide the variable name that is option in this case and we provide the value as one over here now guys after this we will provide the switch statement over here so we have the switch keyword and Then followed by open and close curly braces and this time we are passing the variable name that is option and then after this we have the open and close curly braces now guys inside the switch statement that is inside the curly braces we need to Define different cases so let's say we have the first case over here we use the case keyword followed by the space character and then what kind of values can be present inside this option so we have the very first option that is zero in this case and then after the colon we have to provide the block of code over here so simply we are going to provide the console.log statement this time and then we will say option zero is selected so guys basically we have started the options from the zero number over here and then after this console.log statement you can have more number of statements over here after which you need to provide the breake statement so guys basically this is very important for the control flow to come out of of the switch statement so over here after the break statement we will Define another case so let us say we move to the case one this time and simply we will provide the console. log statement once again and this time we will say option one is selected over here and then again we will provide the break statement now guys similarly I'm going to copy paste this line of code over here and again we are going to provide case two this time and then we will say option two is selected so guys basically we have defined a different options over here that is case Zer case 1 and then case 2 and based on the value inside this particular option the console. log statement will be printed over here now guys in the end what we will do is let us say the option value is some other value apart from this 0 1 and two numbers that we have provided so simply we are going to provide the default keyword over here in which case whatever other values that are provided to the option variable will get match with the default case over here since it is not matching with the other case that we have already defined so guys over here again we are going to provide the console.log statement and this time we will say some other option was selected so guys basically this will tell the user that some other option was selected apart from option zero option one and option two in this case and then guys after the default case it is not necessary to provide the break statement over here that's because that is the last statement inside the switch statement that we have already defined so guys let us see what will be the output of the this particular switch statement that we have defined over here in JavaScript so let me just save this file now and try running this code that is test.js file in this case so as you can see option one is selected is getting printed that's because option value is one over here and when the control flow comes inside the switch statement in this case first of all case z is getting checked so is option equal to zero no in this case so the control flow goes to the next case that is case one so is option equal to one this time yes in this case so basically option one is selected is getting printed over here similarly if the option is zero then this particular statement will be printed so guys let us check that as well so when we set the value of option as zero over here at the start of this particular program so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see option zero is selected is getting printed over here similarly in order to print this option two is selected we have to set the option value as two over here and when we run this code once again you can see that option two is selected is getting printed over here and what if we provide the option equal to three value so let us see what will be the answer basically none of the cases will get mashed over here and finally the control flow will come to the default case in this case and basically this is the statement that must be printed so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see some other option was selected is getting printed over here so guys in this way the switch statement works you can also provide any of the string values as well to the option varable table and the same string values must be provided for these cases in order for them to match when the control flow is checking the values now guys apart from this not only the variable names over here but you can also provide the expression so let us say we have provided the option is equal to three and we do option minus one over here this time so basically what is getting passed to the switch statement over here option minus one which means 3 1 it is equal to 2 so basically case is equal to 2 this particular line of code should get printed over here let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see option two is selected is getting printed over here now guys very important thing what happens if we don't provide the break statement over here so I have commented this particular break statement let us see what will be the output so when we save this file now and try running this code once again you can see that option two is selected is getting printed which is correct over here but the control flow after printing this particular statement is not going out of the switch statement this time and it is print printing the default case as well you can see that some other option was selected is also getting printed so guys for this reason it is very important that you provide the break keyword over here after each and every case and you can ignore the break statement for the last case that is the default case that's because that is the last statement to be checked over here after which we don't have any other cases to be checked so guys always remember to provide the break statement after each and every case that you have provided inside the switch statement and when we provide option my 2 over here when the value of option is equal to 3 the option will be equal to 1 so what will be the output in this case comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not

in which we are going to learn about an exercise in order to greet based on the time in JavaScript so stay tuned
