hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about Tuple in Python Programming so guys a tuple in Python is similar to a list basically the difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of our list so previously in the examples of the list that we have seen we were able to change the elements inside the list but the same thing cannot be done with the elements that are present inside the Tuple so how do we create a tuple a tuple is created by placing all the items that is elements inside the parent asset so we have this open and close parenthesis whereas in the list we were using open and close square brackets now these are supposed to be separated by commas over here the parentheses are optional however it is a Code Practice to use them so a tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types that is integer of load list string Etc so guys let us check this with the help of example now over here as you can see we have my Apple which is the name of the variable that we have given and one two three these are the elements that is present inside the Tuple if you notice we have this open and closed parenthesis instead of the square brackets and that is the difference between the list and the Tuple over here so let us move to the vs code and simply we will provide a tuple one as the variable name over here equal to followed by open and close parenthesis and let's say we Define five elements one to five over here so this is nothing but we have defined the Tuple and we can simply print this Tuple by using the variable name Tuple one over here so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting all the elements that is one two three four five and in this way we have easily created and printed the Tuple elements over here now guys an important thing over here let's say you want to create a python Tuple with only one element so in this case what happens is let's say if you provide where one that is variable one over here and you provide double quotes that is hello with this open and close parent synthesis in this case this will be considered as a string whereas in the variable 2 what you do is after this hello you provide a comma so in this case it will be considered as a tuple so this is very important thing if you want to create a tuple with just a one element you have to use the comma after providing that element over here let us check this with the help of examples now over here let's say I provide where one in this case and then open and close parenthesis and then let's say we have hello over here and then I'll just copy this line of code and paste this and I'll simply provide comma after this element so what we will do is I'll just name this variable name as where2 so let us now confirm the data types of both the variables so we will say print and then inside this we will use the type function in order to find the data type of where one so we provide where one over here and I'll simply copy and paste this line of code and we provide where 2 over here so let me just save this file now enter try running this code so as you can see first one it is showing us that it is a string and the second thing is showing us that it is a tuple now in case if we simply remove this comma from this Tuple so what happens so let me just save this file and try running this code once again as you can see it has become string now both are strings right now if we provide comma over here and comma over here as well so both the variables will be turned to the Tuple data type so guys this is very important if you want to have only one element inside the Tuple make sure that that element is followed by a comma over here in order to make that data type as a tuple now guys moving to next section how do we access the python Tuple elements so there are multiple ways in order to access the elements over here first of all is indexing so this we have already seen previously by using the index number we can access the elements of the Tuple so let's say we have Tuple one over here and we have five elements one two three four five so how do we access these elements by using the indices so we simply have to provide the couple one that is the variable name and Then followed by open and close square brackets this time and let's say we want to print the element that is 3 over here every time remember guys that the index it starts from zero so this first element that is number one it is at the index 0 and then the second element that is number two it is at the index 1 and then the third element that is number three it is at the index 2 over here so we provide the number that is 2 which is the index number in this case so this will tell the python interpreter to access the element that is at the index number 2 for this variable that is Tuple one so over here what will happen is the index number 0 is this and then index number one is this and then we have index number two which is 3 over here and this element should be printed so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 3 is getting printed similarly let's say if you want to print this number two which is at the index 1 in this case so we have to provide 1 inside this open and close square brackets so let me save this file and try running this code now so 2 is getting printed this time so guys this is one way in order to access the elements by using the indexing we also have something called as negative indexing so let's say if you don't know the number of elements that are present inside the Tuple whereas there is a way in order to find the length of the Tuple but in case you want to access the last element of this Tuple over here so you already know that the first element is at the index 0 so let me just print that so over here we provide Tuple 1 followed by the index number that is 0 in this case I'll save this file and try running this code so one is getting printed now let's say you want to print the last element but you don't know at which index it is so we have something called as negative indexing in which case before the zeroth index the index that is minus 1 it will point to the last element of this double that is 5 over here so when we provide minus 1 in this case this element that is 5 should get printed so let me save this file and try running this code now so 5 is getting printed similarly if you want to get the second last element of this Tuple you can simply provide minus 2 over here so when we provide minus 2 and run this code so 4 is getting displayed which is the second last element so this is like a cycle over here when you use the negative indexing the last elements of this Tuple will start getting printed over here and then guys you can also use the slicing functionality as we have already seen with the list so basically let's say if you want to print the subset of this Tuple between 2 to 4 so what you can do is what is the index of this element that is 2 it is 0 and then one so at the first Index this 2 is present so we will provide one over here followed by a colon and then what is the index of the element that we want that is 4 so the index is it is 0 1 2 and then this index is 3 but we don't want to specify 3 because this is excluded so the next index which is 4 we have to specify that index which will be not included in our slicing operator so when we provide 4 over here always remember that this index on the left hand side will be considered but this index will not be considered the fourth index will not be considered but before this that is the third index will be considered while printing the statement so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 2 3 and 4 is getting printed the last index it is 4 which is having the element 5 this will not be considered because it is not included in the slicing operator so these are some of the ways that you can use in order to access the python Tuple elements over here now python Tuple methods there are two methods only that is count and index over here what is count so basically in order to get the number of occurrences of a particular element you can use the count method so over here while using the count function we have to use the variable name followed by I taught and then as you can see count and index these are the only two methods the other methods such as appending or removing or deleting the elements are not present that's because as I have already told you the Tuple inside python are not mutable which means we cannot change the elements once they are assigned over here so when we provide count we have to provide one of the elements inside that Tuple so let's say we want to find the occurrence of the element that is 2 over here in this case that means how many times this number 2 is occurring so let me save this file now and try running this code so as you can see the count is 1 over here that's because only one occurrence of number two is present let's say I provide some more occurrences over here so I provide the number 2 2 times over here so the total count becomes 3 in this case over here we have 2 and then two more twos are present so basically the total count is three let me just run this code once again so number of tools that are present over here inside the Tuple is three and that is what we are getting over here and this is the main functionality of the account function now the another function that is index so if you want to get the index of a particular element you can use the index function so after this dot we have something called as index and then inside the open and close parenthesis we have to provide the element for which we want to find the index so let's say I want to find the index of this element that is number 5 over here so it is 4 basically let me just save this file and try running this code and confirm so as you can see 4 that is the index of this element is getting printed over here so Guys these functions you can use based on your requirements as far as Tuple is concerned now one very important thing iterating through a tuple in Python so we can use the for Loop to iterate over the elements of a tuple so basically we have seen this in the previous video as well so far we have printed the elements of the Tuple by using the variable name in this way so let me save this file now and try running this code as you can see all the elements are getting printed but there is a problem over here we are getting this open and close parenthesis also while printing these elements what if we only want to print single element at a time so we can simply use the for Loop and iterate through all the elements over here inside the Tuple so we use the for keyword followed by let's say the temporary variable as the item and then we have the in keyword and then the name of the variable that is the sequence which is Tuple 1 in this case and then we simply have to print this item that is item variable now what will happen is all the items will be printed on separate lines over here because by default the end parameter of this print function is having the slash n character so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see all the elements are getting printed on the new line what if we want all the elements to be present on the same line separated by comma over here so we simply have to provide comma and then there is something called as end parameter for this print function so we use that and inside the double quotes we provide the comma over here which will be kind of a separator for all those Elements which will be printed on the terminal so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see all the elements now are getting printed on the same line and they are separated with a comma if you want a space character after comma that can also be done you provide comma followed by the space character let me just save this file now and try running this code so all the elements are separated with a comma character and then a space character additionally for a better readability so guys this is another way you can use the for Loop in order to iterate through all the elements of the Tuple now let us understand what are the different advantages of a tuple over less than python so we generally use tuples for heterogeneous that is different data types and list for homogeneous which means similar data types so in a tuple you can have the different data types as well so basically the Tuple is being used for that purpose only and we cannot change the elements inside the Tuple so since tuples are immutable which means you cannot change the data inside the Tuple once they are assigned iterating through a tuple is faster than with a list so behind the scenes what is happening is the program already knows that the Tuple elements will not be changed and for this reason the Tuple is little bit faster compared to the list so there is a slight performance boost over here now tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary as well with the list this is not possible so inside a dictionary as you must be knowing that a key value Pairs and the elements of the Tuple can be considered as keys for the dictionary if you have data that doesn't change implementing it as a tuple will guarantee that it remains right protected so nobody can change the elements of a tuple if you want some data to be fixed whenever you are implementing the list of elements that should be present in a sequence and that must not be changed so Guys these are certain advantages of a tuple over a list in Python Programming please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as
