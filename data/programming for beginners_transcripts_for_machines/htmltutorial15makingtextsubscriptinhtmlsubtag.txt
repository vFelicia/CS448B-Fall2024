welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about making text subscript in HTML using the sub tag so guys basically the content within the sub starting tag and the ending tag will be written in the subscript so the font size used is the same as the characters surrounding it but is displayed half the character's height beneath the other characters so let us check this with the help of example now in the vs code over here what we will do is we will have another statement inside the paragraph tag so over here we will have the P tag in this case and then we will say this text is subscript over here in this paragraph So guys this is a single statement that we have included inside the paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here so as you can see this simple statement is being displayed as a paragraph now what we will do is this particular word that is subscript we want to display it as the subscribe inside this paragraph So guys what is the difference between the subscript and the superscript so previously we had seen that the sup tag can be used in order to display the subscript in this way which is displayed on the top now similarly we will be using the SUV tag in this case in order to display the subscript word on the bottom right of this is word over here so guys let us make these changes in the vs code so what we have to do is so we need to enclose this subscript word between the sub starting and the ending tag so we will simply have the less than symbol and then we will type sub and then we will have the greater than symbol over here and then what we have to do is I'll just cut this ending tag and paste this over here after this subscript word so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the subscript is being displayed so it says this text is and then we have the subscript in this paragraph now guys this is the example with one word we can have multiple words as well being displayed as the subscript so what we have to do is we need to include those words within the surf starting and the ending tags so over here we say subscript on bottom so basically we have three words over here as subscript when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see subscript on bottom is being displayed as the Subscribe guys the height of this subscript is half the height of the other characters that is being displayed normally in this paragraph but the font size is same whenever the superscripts and subscripts are being displayed in the HTML so guys comment in the comment section below if you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is inserted text in HTML so stay tuned
