so now we will see mask image property in CSS so guys basically the CSS mask image property specifies a mask layer image and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well the mask layer image can be a PNG image or an SVG image a CSS gradient or an SVG mask element so guys out of all these we are going to check the CSS gradient example over here in which case on top of the original image we are going to create a mask image over here now guys it is very important to note that most browsers only have partial support for CSS masking you will need to use the webkit preix in addition to the standard property in most of the browsers so this testing part you have to handle while you are implementing the mask image property based on your project requirements so guys let us move to the examples over here so in the vs code what we are going to do is we will remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys what we are going to do is we will simply create a diff tag with the class container over here and then after this we are going to create the IMG tag inside this diff tag over here and then we will set the sample image that we already have inside the directory where the HTML and the CSS files are present and then for the alt attribute we will set the text as test image now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the original image over here let us set the width and and height for this particular image so we will use the IMG tag over here and let's say we have the square image in this case so we will set the width as 300 pixels and also the height as 300 pixels over here so guys basically we have set the width and height of this image in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see this is the square image that is getting displayed now guys in order to display the mask image on top of this particular original image simp we can use the linear gradient or the radial gradient as well apart from the other images that you can set as the mask image so guys let us check the example of linear gradient first of all so inside the style. CSS file over here for the diff tag which is having the class container we are going to set the CSS property so guys over here we have the dot character followed by the class name and then the property that we are going to use is mask image over here and then we will set the value as linear gradient and then we need to provide the color so guys basically one side of the image need to be transparent in this case so what we will do is let us say we want the top side of the image to be transparent and the bottom side to be having the original colors so guys what we will do is first of all we will set the value as transparent in this case followed by comma and then we have the black color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see some kind of transparency is added as a m over here on top of the original image so guys this is the functionality of the mask image CSS property it helps us in order to create a mask on top of the original image let us say we want this transparency at the bottom of the image so simply we need to revert the changes that first of all we need to set the color that is black over here and then after this the second parameter can be transparent in this case let me just save this file now and notice that the transparency is at the top right now but it will come at the bottom when we reload this page so when we reload this page as you can see at the bottom there is a transparency that is added to this particular original image with the help of the Mask layer now guys apart from this we can also set the radial gradient value for the mask image so let us check that as well so what we have to do is instead of having the linear gradient over here simply we will use the radial gradient and in this case let us provide the shape as Circle over here and then let us say we have the black portion of 50% and Then followed by the rgba component in which case we will set the alpha component over here so guys we have 0 0 and then 0 once again for the RGB value and then we will have 0.5 over here and let's say we have the percentage as 50% in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the mask layer that can be displayed with the help of the radial gradient so guys over here we can decrease the percentage of the black component over here so let's say we set it as 30% and also we will increase the width of the image so let us say we set it to 500 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so to some extent we can see the radial gradient over here and then after setting the black component as 20% and rgba component to 10% over here we can see that there's a radial gradient as a mask layer on top of the original page and we can see this circle at the right side of the image so guys in this way you can provide the mask layer for any of the original images based on your project requirements so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is button styling in CSS so stay tuned
