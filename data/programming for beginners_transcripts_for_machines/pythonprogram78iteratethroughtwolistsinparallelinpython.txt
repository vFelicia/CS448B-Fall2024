welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to iterate through two lists in pathlon so guys we can iterate through two lists in pattern in two ways so as you can see the first way is by using the zip function over here which is available from Python 3 plus version and the second way is by using the eater tools module that we are going to see which is available from python 2 plus versions over here so let us check both these ways in the vs code so the very first thing that we will be doing is we will be defining two lists over here so let's say first list is list one and then simply we have four numbers over here one two three and then four now guys in the second list we will have certain alphabets over here so we name it as list two and the alphabets are a b c so we are going to keep only three alphabets that is a b and then C over here so as you can see we have four numbers in this case that is four elements in list one and three elements in list 2 we are going to see what is the main difference between the zip function and the ETA tools module when we are going to iterate through two lists in parallel so guys over here what we will be doing is we will use the for Loop and then we will have two variables that is I and J which will be iterating through the elements of the Tuple that will be returned by the zip function over here so i j n and we are going to use zip over here so as you can see it yields tuples until an input is exhausted so inside a zip we are going to provide two lists that is list 1 and list two so as you can see we have provided both the parameters that is list one and less 2 and simply what we will be doing is we will print the I and J values over here so we will say I comma J in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got one a then 2B and 3C using the zip class over here so it is not a method it is a class that is being suggested by the vs code now guys what we will be doing is we will also see how iter tools works so basically we are going to import this module so basically this is the module over here which we are supposed to import so we say import and then we have it tools over here now guys inside the ETA tools we have certain methods that we can use so again we will be using the for Loop and we will go through the inj variables and then we have n and this time we will be using The Ether tools module inside this we have a class that is called as zip longest so as you can see this is the class zip underscore long list which returns a zip longest object whose next method returns a tuple where the ith element comes from the I the terrible argument so basically this will also return as the Tuple and we can iterate through the two variables it is I and J over here inside this also so we are supposed to provide list 1 and list 2 so we are going to provide first parameter is list one and second parameter is list two over here and again we will be printing the I and J values so I'll simply copy this and paste this over here the only difference that we will be making over here is we will be providing The Hyphen in this case between the two values over here of the two list so that we can identify that these values are coming from the ETA tools whereas these values without the hyphen is coming from zip class over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see I'll just expand this terminal so basically we are getting 1 a 2 B and 3C once again which is coming from the zip class over here and then we are also getting 1A then we have 2B and then we have 3C and also we have got the fourth element and it says None over here on the right so guys the main difference over here is the Ziplocs will help us in order to iterate through the list that is having the less number of elements so over here we have only three elements in the list two and that is why we have got only three combinations over here while we are iterating both the list whereas the ETA tools will help us in order to iterate through the longest list over here which is list one in this case so all the elements of list one will be appearing on the left hand side since we are providing I on the left hand side over here and the J that is representing the list 2 it is only providing us the three elements and then the fourth element is being represented as none over here so guys this is the main difference and these are the two ways using which you can iterate through two list over here in parallel as what will be the output if we provide more two elements over here so let's say we have D and then we have e over here as well so what will be the output if we use just the zip class in this case comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not so please make sure that you practice on your own so that you get the correct answer and you can comment
