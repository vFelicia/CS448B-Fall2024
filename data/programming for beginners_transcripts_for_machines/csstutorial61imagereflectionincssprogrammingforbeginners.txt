so now we will see image reflection in CSS so guys basically the Box reflect property is used to create an image reflection and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well the value of the Box reflect property can be below above left or right so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply we are going to include an image inside the container so guys we have the div tag over here and the class that we are going to set is the container in this case and then then inside this we are going to have the IMG tag over here so guys basically we are going to create an original image and we are going to create a reflection of that original image so for example we are going to have the sample forest image that is present in the same directory where we have saved this index.html file so we are going to select this particular JPG file over here that is the image file and we are going to set the alt attribute as test image over here let me just save this file now and let us see how how it looks like on the browser so when we reload this page on the browser as you can see this is the image that is getting displayed over here now guys we can set the width and height of this particular image in the CSS file so over here in the vs code we are going to move to the style. CSS file in this case and simply we are going to set the IMG tag and set the width and height CSS property for this particular image so guys let us say we have 400 pixels as width and 300 pixels as height over here so basically we have we are going to set these width and height parameters let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the image let us reduce the size little bit so that we can see the reflection properly so we are going to set the width as 300 pixels and height as 200 pixels over here so as you can see this is the image that is getting displayed which is the original image in this case now guys we want the image reflection to be displayed on the right of this image so what we can do is simply we can use the Box reflect CSS property so let us move to the style. CSS file over here and we are going to set the Box reflect CSS property in this case so guys basically this is the CSS property that we are going to use and we can set any of the four values as you can see we have above below left and right guys it is very important to note that some of the browser versions does not support this box reflect CSS property so you need to test on different versions of the browser if you are implementing this box reflect CSS property on production environment so let us say we want the reflection to be present on the right hand side so we select this right value over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser you can see that this is the original image and the right hand side of the image is somewhere over here but when we reload this page as you can see this is the reflection that is occurring of the original image now so guys this is the image reflection that we can see for the sample image that we have display played on the browser over here on the left hand side you can see that there is a tree in the image and the same thing can be seen over here on the right hand side in the reflection of the image now guys we can also set the Border radius for this particular image so let us say we set the Border radius to 50% so that the image is displayed in a circular shape so let us provide the Border radius of 50% in this case for this particular IMG tag let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have a circular shape image it is not exactly the circle since the width and height of this particular image is not having the same value and it is looking like an ellipse shape over here but guys the main thing is this is the way that you can display the reflection of any of the images that you want to display on your web browser now guys apart from this we can also display the image on the bottom of this particular original image so let us check that as well what we are going to do is we will decrease the width and height so let's say we have 200 100 pixels of width and 150 pixels of height in this case and then what we are going to do is instead of having the Box reflect as right we are going to say below as the value over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have this original image on the top and then at the bottom we have the reflection of this image now guys similarly you can also set the reflection to be displayed on the left and above the original image so I'll leave this up to you as has a homework for you so that you can practice on your own in order to check the image reflection on the left you need to get the image at the center or at the right of the screen so how you can do that basically the display property of the image is set as in line by default so you can set it as block element and then simply you can provide the margin equal to Auto property over here and then simply you can set the value of margin CSS property as Auto so guys this will help us in order to display the image at the center of the screen let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the image is now getting displayed at the center of the screen and in order to get this image reflection on the left of the original image what we can do is simply instead of below we can set the value as left let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the image reflection that is appearing on the left so guys similarly you can set the value of above as the image reflect CSS property as the Box reflect CSS property so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is object fit property in CSS so stay tuned
