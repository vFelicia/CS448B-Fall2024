so now we will work on an exercise in order to greet the person based on the time in JavaScript so guys basically in this particular exercise we will get the current time of the system using the JavaScript date object and then we will greet the person with the good morning or the good afternoon message over here so guys let us move to the vs code in this case so what we will do is first of all we will Define the variable that is date over here so simply we are going to get the current system date in this case so we have new keyword over here as you can see after the equal to operator we use the new keyword followed by the space character and then we use the date class in this case so basically this is the date class that is responsible in order to get the current system date over here and then after this what we will do is let us verify what we are getting inside the date variable so simply we are printing the date variable over here let me just save this file now and try running this code using the node keyword over here followed by the name of the file that is test.js so guys as you can see we are getting the year followed by the month and then we are getting the date as well and then we are getting the time as well over here so guys as you can see we are getting the complete date and time by using this particular date class over here now guys what we have to do is we need to extract the hour using this particular date that is getting printed so simply we will Define another variable that is r in this case and Then followed by the equal to operator this time we will use this particular variable that is is date inside which we already have the current date and time of the system and then followed by Dot and then as you can see we have multiple methods over here we have the get date method then we have get day get full year get hours get milliseconds and so on we have multiple methods that you can use so guys currently we are concerned about the hour of this particular time so what we can do is simply we can use the get hours over here and then followed by the open and close parenthesis since it is a method so guys now let us see what will be the the hour that is getting printed over here so simply we will provide the console.log statement and then we will print the hour let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see the hour is converted to the local time over here and we are getting the 17 hour in this case so guys this is the way that we can get the current hour over here of the system now guys what we will do is we will provide our logic in order to print whether it is a good morning message or the good afternoon message that is supposed to be printed so what we will do is first of all we will will check whether the hour is it less than or equal to 12 so guys over here since we are following the 24hour format if it is morning then the hour must be less than or equal to 12 over here so basically after the 12th hour the afternoon will start so simply we will say hour is it less than or equal to 12 if yes then simply we will provide the console.log statement and then we will provide good morning message in this case so guys basically we have this particular message that will be printed if the hour is less than or equal equal to 12 and if not then the good afternoon message must be printed so over here simply we will provide the else part in this case and then we will say console.log and this time we will have good afternoon that is getting printed over here on the console so guys basically this is the message that is getting printed over here let us save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see good afternoon message is getting printed that's because the current hour it is 17 over here let us also print the current R in this case so simply we will have the console. log statement and then we will say current R it is equal to and then simply we will provide dollar followed by open and close curly presses and then we will provide R in this case let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see current R it is equal to 17 and then we are getting good afternoon message over here now guys let us say if the r is 12 so what will be the output so simply what we will do is we will override the value of R in this case so even after getting the r over here as the value of 17 we are changing the r value over here so what we will set it as we will set it as 12 in this case in such a way that the good morning message must be displayed so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see current hour it is equal to 12 in this case and then we have the good morning message that is getting printed over here so guys based on the date time and the hour during which you execute this particular JavaScript program the good morning or the good afternoon message will be printed over here let us put another condition in this case so let us say if the hour is less than 16 over here so basically we are setting another parameter in this case so we have less than or equal to 16 this time and if the r is greater than 16 which means whether it is 17 or 18 we want to print the good evening message over here so simply we will have the lse part and then we will say console. log statement and then inside this we will say good evening message so guys over here the good morning message will be printed when the r is less than or equal to 12 then when the r is less than or equal to 16 the good afternoon message will be printed and if the r is greater than 16 over here the good evening message must be printed so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see current R it is equal to 17 this time which is the evening time so basically we are getting good evening message over here on the console so guys in this way you can get the current system date and time by using the date class over here and then you can print the greeting message based on the project requirement so guys comment in the comment section below what is the current date and time currently when you are running this code over here while you're watching this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches
