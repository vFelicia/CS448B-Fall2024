hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to find the numbers divisible by another number so guys over here we are going to have a list of numbers and we are going to see which are the numbers inside this list that will be exactly divisible by another number so as you can see this is the list that is having these numbers over here and we are going to see in the output section which of these numbers are divisible by 13 so as you can see numbers divisible by 13 are and then we are going to display those numbers that are divisible by 13 from this list of numbers now guys how do we achieve this so here is the hint we can use the anonymous that is the Lambda function inside the filter function so guys previously we have seen that filter function is used in order to filter out certain values from the list so basically we are going to use that filter function in order to find which are these numbers that are divisible by 13 and we are going to print those numbers and this filter function is a builtin function to find all the numbers that is divisible by by 13 in the list so guys let us check this with the help of the vs code over here so the very first thing that we have to do is we have to define the list that is my list over here and we will simply copy these list of numbers so I'll simply copy this and paste this over here now guys how do we use the filter function simply we have to provide the filter function over here and the very first parameter will be the anonymous function so we will provide Lambda that is the anonymous function and this Anonymous function will take one parameter for now so let's say we name it as X and then what we have to do is we have to divide this number that is X by 13 so X percent 13 whether it becomes a 0 or not so this is the logic so if this number that is X is perfectly divisible by 13 then the remainder will be 0 in this case and this expression will return true and that x value will be returned by this filter function over here so after this we have to provide comma and then the second parameter will be the list object over here so I'll simply copy this and paste this that is the my list variable now guys we can store it inside another result variable over here so whatever results are coming from the filter function these will be stored inside this result object and then we can simply print these results so basically we can have print statement over here and then we can simply say number divisible by 13 R and then colon and then because we have to convert this result variable into the list variable so we can simply have the list function and inside this function we can simply provide the result variable over here as the parameter so that it gets automatically converted to the list and is printed after this string so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see number divisible by 13 are 65 39 and 221 and that is the result that we are expecting that is 65 39 and 221 which are the numbers that are exactly divisible by 13. now guys we see another number that is 12 over here so let us see which are the other numbers that are divisible by 12 at least one number we have that is divisible by 12 which is the 12th number itself so let me just change this logic over here x person 12 is equal to 0 this should be the logic in order to find which are the numbers that are divisible by 12 over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see only one number we are getting that is number divisible by 13 are 12 over here I just forgot to change the label so it should be numbers divisible by 12 or 12 in this case so I'll just run this code once again so it is showing numbers divisible by 12 are 2L now guys let us see which are the even numbers out of all these numbers that are present inside the list so in order to find that we can simply provide X percent 2 over here equal to equal to 0 that will help us in order to find which are the even numbers because whenever we divide a number by 2 and if the remainder is 0 that means a number that we have provided is an even number so over here numbers divisible by 2 in this case r and then we can get the list over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see 12 54 and 102 all these numbers are divisible by 2 and the other numbers that is 65 that is not divisible then we have 39 again it is not divisible 339 and 221 these are also the numbers that are odd numbers and they are not even numbers so guys this is the way we can easily use the filter function in order to find what are the numbers inside the list that is divisible by a specific number that you want to try so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this
