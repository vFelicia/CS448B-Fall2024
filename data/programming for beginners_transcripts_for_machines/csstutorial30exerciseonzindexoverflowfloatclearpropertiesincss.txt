so now let us work on this exercise on Zed index overflow float and the clear properties in CSS so guys you can pause this video and practice on your own and complete all these task in this particular exercise so that you get the better understanding on all these CSS properties so we are going to follow the below steps to complete the practice exercise first of all we will create the two div elements that is div 1 and div 2 IDs with the background colors and some padding so guys let us move to the vs code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here and simply we are going to create the two div elements with the ID div 1 and div 2 so guys over here we have the div 1 and we are going to provide the text that is div one over here and similarly we will have the ID with the div 2 for another div tag and we will say that the text is div 2 in this case and after this we are going to move to the style. CSS file file over here simply we are going to provide the ID that is div 1 by providing the hash character followed by the ID that is div 1 over here we will provide the background color so let's say we have the background color as yellow and guys for all the div tag we want the padding so let's say we simply provide the diff tag over here and inside the curly braces we will have the padding of 5 pixels in this case so guys basically this padding of five pixels will be applied to all the diff tags over here and and the background colors will be separately applied based on the ID of the div tag so over here we have the second div that is div two over here and then again we will have the background color and let's say we have the background color of aqua let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have div 1 and div 2 getting displayed on the web page now guys let us move to another task over here we have position the div 2 above div 1 with relative position and applying left and bottom properties so guys basically we have to move the second div above the first div over here by using the relative position so guys what we can do is for this diff 2 we will set the position as relative this time so over here we say position is equal to relative and we will say left it is equal to 20 pixels so guys basically we want certain spacing from the left and the bottom as well so that this second div element can be displayed on top of this first div element over here so let's say we provide the left property with the spacing of 30 pixels so we say 30 pixels and from the bottom as well we provide some spacing so let's say 20 pixels of spacing is provided over here from the bottom let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the div 1 now getting displayed behind this particular div 2 element so guys this happened because from the normal position of the div 2 we have slightly moved it or positioned it from the left and the bottom with these numbers that we have specified in the CSS file over here and apart from this since we have defined the second element after the first element and that is the reason why div 2 is getting displayed on top of the div 1 so guys we have completed the second task as well that is position the div two above div 1 with relative position and applying left and bottom properties now guys we need to get the div 1 above div 2 using the Z index proper so guys over here what we have to do is at the same position we want to display div 1 on top of this particular div 2 so what we can do is simply inside the style. CSS file for this div 1 we can provide the Z index property so over here when we provide the Zed index by default The Zed index of div 2 is zero so we want to provide a number that is greater than zero for this Zed index of the first div element so over here we will provide the Z index of one let me just save this file and now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there is no change right now we were expecting that div 1 should come on top of div 2 so guys why there is no change because we have not provided the position property for the first div so guys Z index property will not work for the position is equal to static value which is the default value for the position attribute and by default the position value is now having the static value for this first development so simply we can say position is equal to to relative this time so that we are positioning this particular first div element as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser now to see whether the Zed index is effective this time so when we reload this page as you can see div one with the yellow background color is now getting displayed on top of the diff to which has now gone behind over here so guys let us reduce certain spacing from the bottom for the div 2 element so that we can see certain text over here for the second div element so let's say we provide the 12 pixel spacing from the bottom let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see div 2 is still getting displayed behind of this particular div one element so guys in this way we have used the Zed index property always remember that it should have the position property as well whenever you are using the Z index property and the value of the position property should be anything other than static value now guys apart from this let us create div 3 with 40% WID and 100 pixels height with random text that will overflow so guys let us check this as well so over here after the second D let us create another div over here with div 3 ID and let's say we create some generate text over here by using the lurm M abbreviation so over here we have generated certain random text so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have another div element over here now guys in the same task we want this div element to be having the width of 40% and height of 100 pixels so let us set that as well so inside the style. CSS file we will say d three which is the ID of this third div element and for this third div we want the width of 40% this time as per the task over here so we have the width of 40% and height is 100 pixels so over here we will say height it is equal to 100 pixels this time and apart from this the random text Will overflow so guys we will also have the background color so Let's see we have the background color of coral value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the 40% width for this third div element and the height of 100 pixel but guys by default we have the Overflow value as visible this time so basically the text is going outside of this container so guys we have completed the task but the text is still going outside of this particular container that is the diff tag so what we will do is we will move to the the other task that is use the Overflow property to create scroll bar for this diff 3 element so guys what we will do is since this particular text is going outside of the container simply we can use the Overflow property and have the scroll bar on this particular container so that entire text is limited to be displayed within this particular container so guys let us provide this overflow property over here inside the style. CSS file so over here we will say overflow property and this time we will say scroll over here so basically a horizontal scroll bar will be displayed we can also use the value of Auto over here for the Overflow property let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have the vertical scroll bar over here and this is the way that we can use the Overflow property in order to make the extra text fit inside the container that is having the limited width and height over here now guys apart from this let us move to the other task that is to create create the diff four and five that should float left and right respectively so guys what we will do is we will create more two diff tags over here inside the HTML file so after this div 3 we will have div four so let's create the fourth div with the ID div 4 over here and we will say div 4 this time and again we will create another div with the ID that is div 5 over here so we have created diff 4 and div 5 as well we will also apply the background colors for this diff four and D five so let us do that as well so we say d four with the background color so let's provide some background color over here so we will provide the color as yellow green and for D five as well we will provide some other color this time so guys over here we use the background color and let me just see what can be the value so we will use some light value over here so let's say we use this particular color for the background color let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have both both the divs that are getting displayed but guys we want both these divs to be displayed on the left and on the right respectively by using the float property over here so both the div should float on the left and the right side of the screen so guys what we can do is simply we can provide the float property for the div Four Element so over here we will say float it is equal to left and for the div Five Element we can say float it is equal to right this time let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have div four on the left and div five on the right and that is how we can use the float property in order to make the HTML elements position on any side of the screen on the left or the right of the screen now guys let us move to another task we will create another div that is div 6 that should be displayed below div 4 and div 5 so let us create another diff tag over here so basically we are going to create another diff tag for which the ID should be six this time and and the value will be D 6 over here let us see how this will be displayed by default without providing any position so in the style. CSS simply we are going to provide the background color for this sixth div element so over here we will say div six and then let's say we provide the background color and we will use this particular color over here as the background color this time let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see diff 6 element by default is getting displayed to the right of diff 4 and to the left of diff 5 but guys based on our task we want to display the diff 6 below the diff 4 and the diff 5 Element so how this can be done we can use the clear property since we have already used the float property for the diff four and div five so since the div 6 element is the next element to the div four and div five elements we need to use the clear property over here in order to get this sixth div element on the next line so guys what we can do is simply we will say clear and then we will have the value as both so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now as you can see diff 6 is getting displayed below this diff 4 and diff 5 respectively and this is how we can use the float and clear properties as well if we provide the left value over here let us check what will happen so when we save this file now and try reloading this page so there is no change right now and with the value that is right as well probably there will be no change over here so guys basically the important thing is to make use of this clear property after we have used the float property on any of the HTML elements to make the other that is the next HTML elements appear on their original positions so guys in this way we have completed all these task in our exercise over here so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is horizontal and vertical align in CSS so stay tuned
