so now we will see how we can display tables in HTML with the help of examples so guys HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns and we are going to check this with the help of examples as well in the VSS code so guys it is very important for you to understand what are the different tags that you can use in order to display your tables in the form of rows and columns so basically we have the very first tag that is the main tag which is called as table over here so again we have the less than symbol and then we have the table keyword and then greater than symbol and this is the start tag we also have the corresponding end tag for this table inside which all the content of the table will be defined and then guys inside the table first of all we are going to define the rows which can be defined using the TR tag over here so TR stands for table Row in this case and it defines a horizontal row in a table and then next we have the table header so in case your requirement is to display the headers in the table you can use the th tag which stands for table header over here which defines the header for the table in this case and then guys we also have something called as TD which refers to the table data over here so TD tag helps us to define the content or data in one cell of a table so guys when we talk about HTML table over here it is similar to Microsoft Excel so if you have used Ms xcl anytime you must have noticed that we have multiple cells over here in Excel and this can be treated as one table over here so we can have the header in this case so let's say we have the numbers over here as the header and their string representation so guys this is nothing but these are the headers that are defining what will be the content of these particular columns over here so we can have them in the Bold formatting so we app apply the Bold formatting over here and we can make them display at the middle of the cells and then guys what we can have is we can have the numbers over here so we have 1 2 3 4 5 and the string representation says 1 2 3 4 and then we have five so guys this is nothing but this is a table over here and this is what we are going to see in the HTML as well we are going to Define this as a table and these are the rows so as as you can see this is one row over here and this is second row then this is third row and so on these are the rows and these are the columns so guys this row is being defined by the TR tag and the data inside each cell is being defined by the TD tag over here which stands for the table data and guys this header is being defined by the th tag which is the table header over here and outside all these tags we also have the main tag that is the table tag in order to Define the entire table so guys with this knowledge let us move to the VSS code now over here in order to create the table so first of all we will have a simple paragraph and then we will say below content is defined in a table so guys we have a very simple paragraph that is below content is defined in a table and now on the next line we are going to define the table over here so when we type table as you can see vs code is suggesting us this particular tag and when we press enter you can see that we have the starting tag and the ending tag so guys this is the shorthand format we can simply type the name of the tag and press enter in order to get the starting and the ending tag in the HTML now in between the starting and the ending tag what we need to Define is first of all we are going to Define this row which is going to have the table header so guys over here we will have the TR tag so when we type TR over here and press enter as you can see TR starting and the ending tag is being dis displayed over here and then inside the TR tag we will have the th tag over here since these are the headers that we want to Define so we have the th tag and when we press enter as you can see the starting and the ending tags are being displayed now we can simply have numbers which is the text for this header tag over here and then guys we are going to have another tag so again we are going to type T and then we will say string representation so guys as you can see inside the table starting and the ending tag first of all we have one row so inside this row we are having the two headers that is numbers and string representation we can also have one header over here or two headers or any number of headers based on your requirements that you want to Define so guys over here we are only taking two columns in this case so based on your requirements you can either increase or decrease the number of rows and columns in the HTML table now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page to to see how the table appears over here so when we reload this page as you can see we have the numbers header and the string representation as the header which is being displayed with the Bold formatting over here now guys let us Define certain data as we have seen over here how we have defined the data in the Excel similarly we will Define the data in the HTML as well so again we are going to have another row over here so guys basically this is the first row as you can see now we need to come on the next line that is after this first row we are going to define the second row over here and inside that as well we are going to have two columns with this particular data that is 1 and o1 so guys we come over here to the VSS code we again say TR in this case and this time we will use TD that's because it is not the header that we want to Define now we want to define the data inside a particular cell of the table so guys we use the table data that is the TD tag in this case so so we use TD over here and then we simply provide one that is the number one over here and what is the String representation it is o1 so again we Define another TD in this case and then we say one over here now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see another row has been added inside the table and it says one and then one over here now guys similarly let us add remaining data that is 2 3 4 and five number in this case so let us move to the VSS code simply I will copy this TR data which is having the row with the first number in this case so I'm copying this and we will paste it four times over here in order to cover the remaining numbers so guys over here we will change two and then string representation will be two and then over here we will have three and then again we have the three word and then we have four and then a string representation that is four and then over over here we have five and then again we have the string representation that is five so guys basically we have defined multiple rows over here and inside each row we are having the table data that is the TD tag and inside the TD tag we are having the actual data that needs to be displayed inside the cells of the table now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser once again so as you can see all the data is being displayed now in the tabula format so guys you can see under the headers that is numbers over here all the numbers are getting displayed in the left aligned format and in the string representation as well all the string representations of the numbers are getting displayed in the left aligned format so guys this is the main purpose of using the table that is it allows the web developers to arrange the data into rows and columns guys we can also use the border for this table so that it actually looks like a table for you so what we can do is we come over here to the vs code and then inside the head tag we can simply provide the style tag over here and for this style tag we can say table in this case and let's say for this table tag we need to provide the border the Border will be of 1 pixel size and it will be of the solid type and then let's say we want to give the color as black in this case so guys this is one of the ways in order to define the Border along with the width of the Border then this is the Border style like what type of border we want to display and then this is the color of the border so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got the border now to the table guys we can also have the border to this table data in the table headers as well over here so we can include the th and TD tags over here to the same styling in this case that's because we want the styling to be common so guys after table we can provide comma and then we can also provide th comma TD tags over here so guys this particular styling will be applied to all these tags that we have defined over here in the HTML body so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see it is being displayed Now using the borders over here all the celles are having their own borders guys also we can align the text to the right in this case by default it is on left so what we can do is we can simply come over here and we say text align in this case so this is the property that can be used in order to align the text and we say write as the value so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the content of the entire table is being displayed on the right now so guys this is the very basic way in order to display the table content inside the HTML so to summarize we need to have the main tag that is the table tag and then inside that individually we need to define the rows of the table the first row can be a head if you want to define the header and if you don't have any headers you can start with the TD tags as well the only difference between the TD that is the table data and the th that is the table header tag is that the content in the th tags will be displayed with the Bold formatting over here as you can see whereas the content with the TD tag will be displayed normally without the Bold formatting but you can apply the formatting based on your requirements to the TD tag as well using the internal or the external sty sheets guys apart from this you can also have the table cell that can contain all sorts of HTML elements that is it can have text which we have seen just now with the help of examples instead of text you can also have the images list links and other tables as well so guys you can check out the images and the links as the content of the table data and this activity I'll leave up to you as a homework for you so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out
