so now we will see multiple columns in CSS so guys basically the CSS multicolumn layout allows an easy definition of the multiple Columns of text just like the text inside the newspapers so guys this we are going to check with the help of examples as well it is very important to note that some of the older browser versions might not support the column properties so it is very important that you test the implementation of these column CSS properties on the various browsers when you are going to deploy your code on production so guys first of all we are going to see what is column count over here which is one of the CSS properties in order to apply the column layout in CSS so let us move to the vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here simply we are going to create a diff tag with the class newspaper over here and above that we are going to have the H1 heading tag and we can say that below is the newspaper so guys over here here we are creating the layout similar to a newspaper over here which will have multiple columns and then inside this let us say we have some random text that is getting generated so over here we are going to create the random text in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser to see how it looks like so as you can see this is the random text that is getting generated over here we are first of all having the H1 tag that is displaying below is the newspaper statement and then we have the simp simple random text that is generated now guys if we want this random text that is generated to be divided into multiple columns in the same web browser so what we can do is simply we can provide the column CSS property to this diff tag so what we have to do is we will use the class name over here and inside the style. CSS file we will provide dot followed by the newspaper that is the class name and simply we can use the column count CSS property so guys this particular column count CS property helps us to specify how many columns we want to divide this particular diff tag to so let's say we want three colums out of this entire text over here so simply we provide the value of three to this column count let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see these are the column numbers that is three columns can be displayed over here out of the diff tag that we have created now guys apart from this you can also increase the column count so let's say if you want four columns to be displayed let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see this is First Column second column third column and fourth column so the more the number of columns that you are going to increase the Lesser will be the width of each column and that is how the column CSS property will work now guys apart from this there is another column property that is column Gap over here which means the Gap in between both these columns in this case so guys by default we have certain Gap that is provided in between all the columns but but you can modify it with the help of the column Gap so in this case what we will do is simply we are going to provide the column gap of let's say 10 pixels over here let me just save this file now you will notice that this particular Gap in between all the columns will get updated over here when we reload this page as you can see the column Gap got updated in this case let us increase the column Gap to let's say 30 pixels over here let me just save this file now the column Gap will increase now in between all the columns so when we read load this page as you can see the gap between all the columns is increased and in this way you can simply use the column Gap CSS property as well apart from this we have something called as column rule style so guys let us check that as well so just like border style CSS property we have something called as column rule style CSS property which will help us in order to provide multiple values over here so as you can see similar to border style values we have the values such as Dash dotted double Groove and so on so simply we are going to provide the solid column rule style over here so guys basically what will happen is a simple line will be displayed in between all these columns over here when we say column rule style that is equal to solid so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is a simple line that is getting displayed over here and in this case we have provided the solid value apart from this we can also provide the dashed value as well let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can you can see these are the dashed lines that are getting appeared in between the columns so guys this is the way you can set the column rule style over here apart from this you can also set the column rule width and the column rule color so let us check that as well so simply we can say column rule width in this case and let's say we want only the width of one pixel to be displayed as the line in between the columns so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so there is a very thin line that is getting displayed over here let us increase the width to 10 pixels and when we reload this page as you can see these are the dashed lines that are getting displayed over here in between the columns and let us change the color as well so for color we will have column rule color in this case and simply we will set the color as dark blue over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the dark blue color that is getting displayed over here we can also display some other color so let's say we want yellow color to be displayed so as you can see this is the yellow color column rule that is getting displayed over here now guys apart from all these we can also have the shorthand property that is column over here so instead of providing the style width and color separately we can have the simple column rule CSS property in which case we can provide the width first of all followed by the style that is solid in this case and let's say we want the color to be displayed as gray color over here so simply we can provide the gray color for the column rule let me just save this file now now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see these are the column rule that is the lines that are getting displayed in between the columns based on the CSS property values that we have provided over here and this is the shorthand property for all the column rule CSS property now guys apart from this we also have something called as column width so guys basically what we have done so far is we have provided the column count over here in which case it was four right now so you can also provide the column in such a way that the number of columns will be calculated automatically so in this case we need to comment out the column count over here and simply what we will do is let's say we want each column width to be only of 100 pixels in this case so when we say column width equal to 100 pixels all the column width that are getting generated over here will have the width of 100 pixels in this case and it depends on the content that how many columns will be generated so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have set the column with as 100 pixels over here and due to which there are six columns that are getting generated and if we increase the column width over here so let's say we change the column width to 150 pixels so each column will have the additional width and that is why the number of columns will decrease now so when we reload this page as you can see now we are getting four number of columns and when we increase the withd more so let's say we provide 200 pixel of column width and when we reload this page as you can see now we are getting three columns since the entire content can be displayed within three columns when we have the column width of 200 pixels over here so guys this is the way that you can use the column width as well and the other CSS properties related to column based on your project requirements so guys comment in the
