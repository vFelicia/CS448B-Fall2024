hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to display the powers of 2 using the for low so guys let us check this with the help of the vs code over here we can simply find the power of the number that is 2 by using the for Loop so over here we will be using the four keyword followed by I and then we will give the in keyword followed by this range now this range let's say we want to go up to the number that is 10 that is 2 raised to 10 over here so what we have to do is inside this for Loop we will simply have print statement and then we will say to raised to the number that is going to be I since this range it is going to go from 0 up to 9 we are going to print this statement each time the number that is I is incremented by 1 so over here 2 raised to the very first number will come as 0 and then we will have the number that is 1 2 3 and so on so 2 raised to this number and Then followed by is and then the result that is 2 raised to that number so after this we are going to have the dot format in order to replace both these curly braces we have to provide two numbers over here the first variable it will be I and Then followed by comma and then we need to find the Power of 2 raised to this I number over here so what we will be doing is 2 2 times multiplication symbol and then I so guys this expression is used in order to find the power of the integer that is 2 over here now guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting the output over here that is 2 raised to 0 it is 1 that's because any number raised to 0 is 1 and 2 raised to 1 is 2 then 2 raised to 2 is 4 and then so on 2 raised to 3 is 8 then we have 16 32 64 128 and the last number that is 2 raised to 9 it is 500 and 12. now guys whatever number that we give to this range it is excluded so basically in order to find 2 raised to 10 in this entire list we have to provide 11 over here inside the range function so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again now this time we are getting 2 raised to 10 as the last number for which the result is 1024 which is correct let us verify this in the calculator as well we give 2 raised to the number that is 10 over here when we press equal to as you can see we are getting 1024 so guys just by using a for Loop and one line of statement over here we are simply getting the power of the integer that is 2 over here and in similar way you can get the power of any number that is entered by the user using this logic please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to display powers of 2 but this time we are going to use the anonymous function using the map function as well so stay tuned
