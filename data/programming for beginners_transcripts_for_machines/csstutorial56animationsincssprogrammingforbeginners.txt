so now we will see animations in CSS so guys basically an animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another style and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well you can change as many CSS properties as you want and as many times you want so guys basically in order to use the CSS animation you must first specify some key frames for the animation so what are these key frames so guys basically the key frames hold what styles the element will have at certain times and the Styles will transition from one particular style to another style for the element that we are going to select so guys let us check the examples of the animation so first of all we will see at theate Key frames keyword that we can use in the CSS file over here so guys let us move to the vs code in this case and let me just remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys what we are going to do is simply we will have the div tag over here and we are going to create a square box out of this div tag so guys over here in the style. CSS file simply we are going to provide certain CSS properties to this div tag so let us say we have the width of 100 pixels over here also the height of 100 pixels in this case and let's say we have the background color of aqua over here so guys basically we have a diff tag which is a square box with the background color that is aqua so guys let me just save these files now and let us see how it looks looks like on the web browser so as you can see this is the square box that we have included on our HTML page now guys let us have the Border as well so over here we will have the Border CSS property with two pixels width and the Border type as solid and the Border color will be black in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so we have the border for this square box over here now guys let us say we want to move the square box from left hand side to somewhere over here at the middle of the screen so how we can do that so guys basically we can use the animation that is with the help of key frames keyword in order to animate the square box and move from one position to another so guys let us check that as well so over here what we have to do is first of all we will have to use the at theate character and then we need to use the key frames over here so guys basically this is the key frames keyword that will be used in order to provide the animations in CSS now guys after this key frame we need to provide certain name to the animation so let us say we provide the animate name over here and then after this inside the curly braces we need to define the animation inside the from and two keywords so guys let us say we want to move from left to right over here so simply we can use the left CSS property in order to mention the position of the box so guys over here first of all we need to define the position equal to relative property so that we can use the left CSS property over here so inside the from keyword we need to first Define the left it is equal to 0 pixels over here and then guys after this we have something called as two keyword so over here we can simply provide the left s 300 pixels so guys basically what exactly is happening over here is the initial position of this particular div should be left equal to 0 pixels and then it should move to the left which must be equal to 300 pixels now guys we need to link this animation name that is animate with this diff tag over here so simply I'm going to copy this animate name and then inside the diff tag we need to use the animation name CSS property so guys basically we need to provide the animation name CSS property the value must be equal to the value that we have provided for this key frames over here so we have provided the animate as the value for the animation name and apart from this we also have to set the animation duration over here so let's say we want to move this box within 2 seconds so simply we can provide the value as 2 seconds over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so when we reload as you can see the box is moving from left to right over here so guys in this way we can simply provide certain animations that we have seen over here with the help of the key frames keyword now guys apart from this you can also use the percentages instead of from and to keyword which is the starting and the ending position so instead of from we can provide 0% which is the starting position and instead of of two keyword we can provide 100% that is the ending position of the box over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there is no change in the animation the box is still moving from left to right over here now guys apart from this since we have provided the percentages we can also provide the 50% or any other number that we want to provide so let's say for the first 50% we want to move from left to right over here so we have provided 50% in this case and then we want to define the 100% as well in which case we want to move the box from top to bottom over here somewhere at the center of the screen so guys what we will do is instead of 50% over here we will provide 100% so from 0 to 50% the box is moving from left to right and then for the 100% we want the top CSS property to be provided so guys over here simply we can provide the top CSS property and let's say we want 200 pixels value from the top so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the box is coming from left to right but guys it is not going from top to bottom properly so let us Define the top property for the 0% and the 50% parameters as well so over here the top CSS property must be zero and for the 50% as well the top CSS property must be zero in this case now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the box is now moving from left to right and then it is going from top to bottom over here so guys in this way we have completed this particular animation as well let us complete the entire cycle let's say now we want the box to move from left to right and then from right to bottom and then from bottom back to the original position over here so guys what we have to do is we need to make this as 33% over here and then the next step will be 66% and then the last step should be 100% in this case for which the Box should come at the original position over here so guys simply we will Define this particular position for the 100% as well so I'm going to copy this same line of code over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see it is coming from left to right and then going from top to bottom and then from bottom to top as well at the top left position over here so guys in this way we have completed the animation we can also increase the duration to let's say 4 seconds over here so that the speed of the animation is little bit slow so as you can see this is the animation that you can do with the help of the key frames keyword over here now guys there are some more CSS properties that you can use we have already used the animation name and the animation duration over here we can also provide the animation delay in this case so guys basically what is the mining of Animation delay over here so let us check that as well so when we provide the animation delay of let's say 2 seconds so there will be a delay of 2 seconds first of all after which the animation will start based on the CSS properties that we have defined inside this particular block of code so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there will be delay of 2 seconds after which the box has started to move over here so guys in this way you can use the animation delay as well apart from this we also have the animation iteration count which will help us in order to rep delete the animation so guys by default the animation iteration is just one count over here so we can make it as two count as well so the animation will occur twice so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser over here so as you can see after the delay the animation has started so it has completed one round over here but since we have given the count of two it is completing the two rounds over here after which it will stop itself so guys basically you can also use the iteration count as infinite in order to continue the animation on the web browser let us comment out the delay part over here so that we can instantly see the animation in action so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the animation has started and it will continue infinitely until and unless you close the page or you want to change the animation iteration count CSS property so guys in this way you can use the animation iteration count as well apart from this we also have animation Direction so guys basically this is the default direction that the box is moving over here so guys we can also Define the direction of the animation so let's say we provide the animation Direction in this case now guys what are the values the normal is the default value over here but when we provide the reverse value the animation will be in the reverse Direction so let me just provide the reverse Direction over here and let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see animation is in Reverse Direction now first it is moving over here at the bottom Direction and then to the top over here and then followed by to the left Direction in this case which is the reverse Direction over here apart from this we also have the alternate value as well so first it will go in the normal Direction and then in the second iteration the Box will move to the reverse Direction and Then followed by the normal Direction and then reverse Direction and so on the alternate directions will be used so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the normal direction of the box that is moving and then it is moving in the reverse Direction right now based on the animation direction that we have provided over here with the value as alternate now guys apart from this we also have something called as animation timing function so guys let us check that as well so basically it will Define the speed of the box that is moving over here so guys we can use this animation timing function over here and by default and we can provide the speed as linear in this case which means the speed will be same throughout the animation so let me just save this file now if you notice currently the speed is decreasing when it is moving towards the end of the animation over here but when we provide the linear timing function over here the speed will be same throughout the animation so let me just reload this page once again so as you can see the speed is linear over here and it is not increasing or decreasing at the end or at the start of the animation so Guys these are some of the animation CSS properties that you can use apart from this we also have something called as animation field mode which can help us in order to define the status at the start or at the end of the animation so guys I'll leave the CSS property as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own we can also decrease the line of code over here since a 0% and the 100% is having the same CSS properties and the values as well so simply I'm going to remove this 100% from here and then we will provide comma after the 0% and provide 100% in this case which means the 0% and the 100% state is going to have the same value over here let me just provide the animation direction as normal in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the original animation that we have provided and with 0% and 100% that is having the same CSS properties over here now guys apart from this while this box is moving we can change the background color of the box as well so let's say initially we have the background color as aqua color over here and then at the 33% State we want the color to be blue color so simply we will provide the background color as blue color over here at the 33% State and then for the 66% State let's say we have the color as yellow over here so guys basically we are changing the background colors as well as the box is moving based on the different status of the animations so let me just save this file now andent by reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see from Aqua the box is changing its color to blue color and then when the box is moving down the color is changed to yellow color over here so guys in this way we can change the background color or any other CSS properties based on your requirements while you are providing the animations in CSS so guys
