so now we will see 2D transform property in CSS so guys basically the CSS transform allows you to move rotate scale and skew the HTML elements that we Define inside our web page and this we are going to check with the help of multiple examples over here so guys before moving towards the examples let us understand the basic of the xaxis and the Y AIS that is going to be very important when you are going to use this transform property values so guys over here if you have already learned about the xaxis and Y AIS previously in your mathematics class basically we have the xaxis in the horizontal Direction over here so basically we have the xaxis in this way so this is the horizontal line that you can see which is xaxis over here simply we are going to provide the text box that is xaxis in this case so guys basically we can move the HTML elements in this particular direction when we provide the value as a positive value then the element will move towards the right in this case on the xaxis and when we provide the value as negative then the HTML element moves towards the left of the xaxis over here now guys similarly we have the Y AIS as well which is displayed in the vertical Direction so let us provide the y axis as well so over here we have the Y AIS in the vertical Direction in this case so guys basically this is the Y AIS now guys it is very important to note that during our mathematics class we were told that the positive y AIS is on the top over here and the positive xaxis is on the right hand side so this is the first quadrant and Then followed by this is the second quadrant in which case the xaxis have the negative values and the Y AIS have the positive values but guys when we deal with the web browser what happens is our web browser is present inside this fourth quadrant over here so what will happen is when we provide the positive xais number the HTML element should move towards the right but when we provide the Y AIS as the positive number then the HTML element should move down in this case so guys basically this is the screen over here so I'll simply draw the screen as well in this case so this is the screen that we will be dealing with in our examples so guys now let us move to the different values that we can provide to the transform property so over here the first value that we can provide is the translate which will help us in order to move an element to the specified position so guys over here we can see that the translate is a function which will take parameters over here that is the first parameter will be the xaxis that is the length unit you have to provide in order to move the element towards the xaxis over here if it is positive then the element will move towards the right direction and if the value is negative then the HTML element will move towards the left Direction so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the style . CSS files now guys over here what we are going to do is simply we will have the div tag and it is going to have a specific width and height over here so simply we are going to say width of let's say 100 pixels this time and then the height as well of 100 pixels guys apart from this let us have certain border as well so let's say we have the border of two pixels and with border style as solid and the color is black color in this case and apart from this we will also have the background color of yellow so guys over here we have a simple diff tag and then guys apart from this let us have the diff tag at the center of the screen over here so right now the diff tag is at the top left what we want is we want to get the diff tag somewhere over here at the center of the screen so what we can do is simply we can provide the margin and we can say Auto so basically this is going to provide the automatic margin from the left and right and simply let's say we provide the 10% for the top and the bottom margin as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so from the left and right we have the equal margin with the help of this Auto Value and from the top we are providing the 10% margin over here so it is somewhat at the middle of the screen let us increase this percentage to 15% let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have the div element at the center of the screen now guys let us check the first example that is the translate function inside the transform property so guys what we will do is over here we are going to have the H effect for this particular div element so simply we are going to say div followed by colon and then we have the codo class that is over so guys what exactly we are going to do is when the user is going to get the cursor on this particular diff tag then we are going to see the different transform property values that we are going to Define so first of all we will see how this translate Works which means it moves an element to the specified position so guys let us check this so over here what we have to do is simp simply we have to use the transform CSS property and as you can see there are multiple methods that you can use these are nothing but the CSS functions that can be used over here and based on the project requirements you can use your own functions that are listed over here so the first function is the translate function which will take two parameters the first parameter is the xaxis so let's say we want to move the HTML element by 20 pixels on the right hand side so simply we can provide the value as 20x pixels so in this case what will happen is when we get the cursor over here on the diff tag this particular square box should move to the right and side by 20 pixels that we have defined over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that this is the original position of the diff tag and the moment we get the cursor on this diff tag as you can see it has moved to the right hand side so if you see when we get the cursor back it is going back to the original position over here so guys in this way the translate property Works basically since we have only provided the value for the xaxis that is why it is just moving on the right hand side if we want to get this particular diff tag down as well so we will be providing the length unit for the second parameter as well so after this we need to provide comma and let's say we provide 50 pixels so by 50 pixels the diff tag should come down from the center of the screen so let me just save this file now andent TR reloading this page once again on the browser so when we get the cursor on this particular diff tag as you can see it is coming down as well so by 50 pixels the diff tag is coming down over here so guys in this way you can use the translate function inside the transform CSS property in order to move a particular HTML element to the specified position over here guys apart from this we also have something called as rotate which rotates an element clockwise or counterclockwise according to the given degree so guys let us check this as well with the help of example so over here instead of translate what we are going to do is on over of this particular diff tag simply we are going to use the rotate function over here and then guys what it is expecting is it is expecting the angle in terms of degrees so let's say we have 20° over here by which this particular HTML element that is the diff tag which is a square box should rotate and it will rotate in the clockwise Direction by default so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so when the user user gets the cursor on this particular box as you can see it has rotated on the right with the help of the 20° that we had provided inside the rotate function so guys in this way the rotate function works over here let us increase the angle as well so if we increase it by 45° let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see it is rotating by 45° over here in the clockwise Direction guys we can also change the direction that is we can rotate it in the counterclockwise Direction direction as well so what we have to do is instead of having the positive number we should have the negative number and provide the angle so let's say this time we provide 20° so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so if you notice it is now rotating itself in the counterclockwise Direction over here with the help of the negative angle that we have provided guys apart from this we also have something called a scale function which increases or decreases the size of an element so guys let us check this as well so again inside the over Udo class over here we have to use the scale function in this case so guys basically this is the function that we are going to use and simply we need to provide the number by which we want to increase the width and height of this particular HTML element so guys simply if we provide 1 comma 1 so over here there will be no change because this is the original scaling of the HTML element let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see when we get the cursor over here on the div element there is no change right now but the moment we increase this number so let's say we increase it to 1.5 over here as the width and 1.5 is the height of the HTML element so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and when we get the cursor over here as you can see it has scaled to 1.5 * the width and the height of the original diff tag that we had defined so guys in this way you can scale up the HTML element that you want to scale by using this particular C SS function guys apart from this you can also decrease the size as well so any number lower than one in this case will decrease the size of the HTML element so let's say we change the number to 0.8 over here as the width and height in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so now if we get the cursor on this diff tag as you can see it is decreasing the size and the width and height is decreasing over here if you simply want to decrease the width so what we can do is we need to keep the height as zero in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this so guys based on your project requirements you can scale up or scale down the HTML Elements by providing the units that you want to provide inside the CSS function that is scale in this case guys apart from this we also have something called as scale X and scale Y which will be scaling the width and height respectively for that particular HTML element so guys I'll leave this up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own and understand these CSS functions more clearly guys apart from this we have something called a skew as well so it skes an element so basically it skes an element along the X and the Y AIS by the given angles so guys let us check this as well so over here what we have to do is instead of the scale function we will use the skew function this time and let's say we provide 10° as the xaxis first of all let us check how the xaxis Q will work so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the original position of the diff tag and the moment we get the cursor as you can see it has changed its position so this is the functionality of the skew function that we have provided and the angle is 10° over here by the xaxis and then guys again if we want the skew to be applied on the y axis as well simply we are going to say 20° for the Y AIS component over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser and when we get the cursor over here as you can see the xaxis is having this que of 10° in this case and the Y AIS as you can see from this top left to the right over here this particular direction this is the skew of the Y AIS in this case and it is 20° in terms of angle so guys in this way you can provide the skew CSS function based on your project requirement guys apart from this you have something called as skew X and skew y as well which will skew along the xaxis and Y AIS respectively which we have already discussed with the help of this particular diagram previously so this is the xaxis in the horizontal Direction and this is the y AIS in the vertical direction as far as two dimensional directions are concerned now because apart from this we also have something called as Matrix function which will help us in order to provide the numbers for all the functions that we have seen so far so guys this is the sequence that you must follow first of all we can provide the scale X number that we want to mention based on the requirements and Then followed by skew Y and then skew X and then we have the scale Y and then we have to translate X followed by Translate Y so guys let us check this example as well so we have the example Matrix function over here so the first parameter is one which means the scale X will be one in this case so basically it is not going to scale since we have provided one number over here so simply we can increase the scale value to 1.2 this time and then we have q y which is negative number SK X will not be implemented since it is zero and then again we have scale Y which we should increase over here to 1.2 once again and there is no translate X and Translate Y since we have provided the numbers as zero over here so guys let me just copy this line of code and paste it for this particular transform CSS property so what will happen let us check this as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that we have provided the scale X and scale y values and also the skew X is in negative Direction over here so when we get the cursor on this particular diff tag as you can see the size of the diff tag that is a square box is increasing and this Q value of the 0.3 is helping us in order to tilt the square box in a particular direction over here guys apart from this we can also have the translate X and Translate Y numbers as well so what we will do is let's say we provide 100 pixels over here as translate X and 100 pixels as Translate Y so basically the Box should come somewhere over here on the bottom right so let us check that as well so when we reload this page and when we get the cursor over here as as you can see the square box is coming down over here on the right hand side in this case so guys in this way you can provide the metrix CSS function in order to provide the multiple values for all the functions that we have discussed so far which belongs to the transform CSS property so guys comment in the
