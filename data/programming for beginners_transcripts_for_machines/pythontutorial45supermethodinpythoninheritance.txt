hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about super method in Python inheritance so guys basically in Python inheritance we can use method overriding to call the method of a subclass but if we need to access the superclass method from the subclass we can use the super method so this is what we are going to check with the help of examples now over here first of all we are going to check that how method overriding works and then we are going to see how we can use the super method in order to call the method of the superclass so let us check this with the help of examples in the vs code so first of all we are going to have the parent class let's say we have the animal class as the parent class and basically we are going to have one function inside this class that is 8 and this function is going to take one parameter by default which is the object and we are going to name it as self over here and simply we can print the statement that is I can eat so we have I can eat statement over here so basically whenever we are going to call this method of the animal class it is going to print I can eat guys before this we can also provide the prefix that is animal so that we can identify that this is the method from the animal class now guys let us say we have another class that is the dog class which inherits the attributes and the functions of this animal class which is the super class so we have the class dog over here and inside the parenthesis we have animal and this is how we achieve python inheritance by using the parent class inside the parenthesis while defining the child class over here followed by a colon and then what we will do is first of all we have the past statement so that we don't have any code inside this so what we are going to do is since we are inheriting the animal class inside the dog class so basically we have access to this function that is 8 over here so we are going to create the object of this dog class as dog one it is equal to dog over here and then open and close parenthesis and for this dog one followed by dot as you can see each method is getting suggested by the vs code so we can use this function in order to call it followed by open and close parenthesis so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see animal I can eat so this statement is getting printed that's because we have provided the statement inside the eat function of the animal class but guys for this dog class this statement that is animal I can eat is not very specific let's say we want to be little bit specific over here and we want to say that the dog likes to eat bones over here so what we can do is simply we can have the same method name and we can change the print statement inside that method name inside the dog class so what I will do is I'll just copy these lines of code and instead of the pass statement I'll provide certain code over here that is the copied code from the animal class so over here we have the same method with the same name but inside this what we will do is instead of animal over here we will provide dog and over here we will say I like to eat bones so guys basically this statement is little bit more specific it says that this is the talk and it likes to eat bones so we have provided the method with the same name similar to that of the method that is present inside the animal now guys we need not have to change anything over here this dog one object will call the eat function and due to Method overriding this function of the dog class will be called and not this particular statement will be called over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see dog I like to eat bones so basically this print statement is getting executed which proves that this eat function is being called which belongs to the dog class and this is what we call it as a method overriding now guys there is a requirement where do we use the super method over here as we have seen the super method can be used in order to access the superclass method so let's say before printing the this statement that is dog like to eat bones over here what we want is we also want to print this statement that is animal I can eat so what we can do is while calling this eat method when the control flow goes over here we can go inside this function and we can use the super keyword so basically this is another method followed by open and close parenthesis so internally what is happening over here is this super will refer to the parent class that is animal over here so what we can do is while referring to this animal class we can access this function that is each function of the animal class so after the Super method we can provide dot followed by as you can see it function is being suggested by the vs code over here so we can use this eight function followed by open and close Parent Access so basically this is the way in order to access the method of a superclass from the subclass over here by using the super method so guys whenever you are dealing with method overriding over here the method of the subclass will be called by default and in case you want to also call the method of the superclass you can use the super method followed by that method name in order to call the method of the superclass so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the
