so now we will see functions in JavaScript guys it is very important to note over here that functions is a very important subject in JavaScript and you are going to use a lot of functions when you're are going to create real world assignments in the projects as well so guys basically a JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and this JavaScript function is executed when something invokes it or calls it so guys inside the JavaScript function we can have the block of code which will be executed whenever we call that particular function so in short basically the functions are used in order to execute the same line of code multiple times whenever we want to execute them on different instances so guys over here as you can see this is the syntax first of all we have to declare the function so this is the function definition syntax over here we use the function keyword which is reserved by the JavaScript followed by the space character and then we have the function name and then guys inside the parenthesis we have the optional parameters that we can provide so guys basically this is nothing but the name of the variables that we have to provide while passing the parameters and we can use these parameters inside the body of the function so over here after the closing parenthesis on the right hand side we have the open and close curly braces so as you can see this is the open curly braces and then we have the closing curly braces in between both these curly braces we have the entire code to be executed so guys basically this is the function definition and then simply we can use the name of this function that we have defined in order to call it so as you can see this is the function call basically we provide the name of the function using which we have defined the function over here followed by the open and close parenthesis so if we have not provided any of the parameters for this function definition then we don't have to provide any of the parameters over here so simply we have to provide open and close parenthesis so guys let us check how we can use functions with the help of examples so first of all we will see the example without the function parameters over here so let us move to the vs code in this case and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written so first of all we will Define the function so as you can see we have to use the function keyword over here so simply we will type function keyword followed by the space character and let us say we want to add two numbers by using this function so simply we will name name the function as ADD over here and then we provide the open and close parenthesis now guys inside this parenthesis we can provide the parameters which are optional so first of all we will check the example of the functions without parameters so after these parenthesis over here we need to provide the open and close curly braces now inside these curly braces we have to provide our lines of code so guys what we want to do is we need to Define two numbers over here so let's say we provide a that is the variable it is equal to 10 over here and let us say we provide another variable that is B it is equal to 20 and then what we want to do is simply we want to add both these numbers so over here we will provide console. log statement and we will print the addition of both the numbers so let's say we provide a + b that is the expression which is simply going to add the values of both these variables that is a and b and it is going to print the sum of both these numbers on the terminal so guys in this way we we have successfully defined the function by using the function keyword followed by the name of the function that is ADD over here and then we don't have any parameters so simply we have provided the open and close parenthesis and within the open and close curly braces we have the lines of code that we have return now guys simply after defining this function will it work let us see let me just save this file now and try running this code using the node keyword over here on the terminal so as you can see we don't get any output in this case that's because currently we have only defined the function the second part in order to make these lines of code execute is to call this particular function so as I have told you we need to call the function by using the name of the function followed by the parenthesis over here and inside the parenthesis we can provide the optional parameters so in this case we are not working with any of the parameters over here so simply we will provide the name of the function that is add in this case followed by open and close parenthesis so guys basically the control flow is coming over here it came to know that we have a function definition in this case and then over here on the seventh line we are having the function call so when this particular line of code is executed the control flow goes to that particular function definition and then line by line all the statements will be executed over here so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the terminal so as you can see we get 30 as the output that's because the A and B are having the values of 10 and 20 and the sum of both these numbers is 30 so guys in this way we can call the function in order to execute the lines of code now guys if we want to call this function once again then similar to this particular line of code we can simply provide another function call over here that is add in this case so again the function will be called and these three lines of code will be executed let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting the result 32 times in this case that's because we have called the function two times over here so guys in this way you can define a simple function and then call it by using the name of the function let us move to the next example over here we will check the example with the function parameters so guys basically so far we have checked the function definition without the parameters that we have not provided so guys what we will do is we will provide certain parameters over here while we are calling the function and those parameters or the values will be passed to the parameters over here on the function definition so what we want to do is let us say the two numbers that we want to add is five and six so basically we provide the first number that is five followed by comma and then we provide another parameter that is six in this case guys you can provide any number of parameters over here currently we are providing two parameters and basically the parameters must be separated by using the comma in this case so basically in this way this particular add function is being called by using these two parameters that is five and six but guys in the function definition also we want a certain variable to take these parameters as values so over here what we will do is simply we will provide the variable name that is a followed by comma and then B so since we are providing two parameter values we must have the two variables that must receive those values over here inside the function definition and then guys simply we can remove these lines of code over here that's because now we are not having the fixed values inside the function body but the values are getting passed when the function is getting called from here so basically five and six will be assigned to these variables that is a and b and then again we will add these A and B that is a plus b over here will be executed and the sum will be displayed on the console similarly on the second call as well simply I'm going to provide 15 as the first number followed by comma and let's say we provide N9 as the second number over here so guys by using parameters we can provide any of the values which will be assigned to the variables that we have provided for this function definition in this case and those parameters or the variables will be used inside the body of the function in order to execute certain lines of code so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see the output that we are getting is for the first call it is 11 that's because 5 + 6 it is equal to 11 over here and then for the next call that is 15 + 9 it is returning us the 2 four as the sum of both these numbers so guys in this way if you want to pass the parameters with different values in order to add two numbers then you need to use the parameters while calling the function so guys this is as far as the example with the function parameters are concerned now guys another thing that we can have is we can also return a particular value from the function so we have something called as return statement over here so guys instead of printing the sum of both these numbers over here that is a and b what we will do is we will print the result outside of this function so let me just comment out this line of code over here so instead of providing the console. log statement we will provide the return statement over here so basically we have provided the variables that is a and b while we are calling the function we will keep it as it is but over here we will return the addition of both these numbers so simply we have to use the return keyword in this case which is the return statement and then we will provide the expression that is a a plus b in this case so guys basically what we have done is instead of printing the addition of both these numbers we are returning the sum of both these numbers over here now guys it is very important to note that when we are returning something from the function there must be a variable outside of this function which will be able to take that particular value which is getting returned from the function over here so simply I'm going to show you the example with just one call over here of the add function so what we are doing is the control flow is calling the add function in this case so five and six numbers are getting passed as parameters to A and B and then we are returning a plus b over here now if we don't have any variable in this case on the left hand side of the add function that we are calling then what will happen let us check that as well so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see nothing is happening that's because we are not doing anything about the a plus b that is the sum of both these numbers which are getting returned from the function so what we have to do is we have to provide the variable name so let's say we provide the let keyword followed by the variable name that is result over here and then followed by the equal to operator so what exactly is happening over here is we are having the function getting called in this case that is ADD function with the values five and six over here and then this particular function is providing the expression that is A + B in this case and the sum is getting returned over here and this this particular value of sum will be assigned to this result variable and simply we can provide the console. log statement over here and then we can say the sum of these numbers is result so as you can see we have used the string literal over here we have provided the statement that is the sum of these numbers is and Then followed by the dollar symbol in this case and inside the open and close curly braces over here we are having the variable name that is result in this case so guys basically the addition of these two numbers will be done by the function and it is going to return the value which is going to be printed with the help of the result variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see the sum of these numbers is 11 so this is the way that we can use the return statement as well whenever you are going to return something from the function we need certain variable over here in order to assign the value that is being returned by the function in this case simply we can change the numbers again so over here let us say we provide the number that is 50 and another number is 25 over here when we save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see the sum of these numbers is 75 now guys what will be the output when we have the two numbers that is 50 over here and 100 in this case so basically we have these two parameters comment in the comment section below what will be the statement that will be printed over here along with the correct value of the result let us see whether your answer is correct or not now guys why do we use functions so basically with functions you can reuse the code as we have seen already simply we have to call that particular function with the required parameters that is expected by this function definition in this case apart from this you can also write the code that can be used many times and apart from this you can also use the same code with different arguments to produce different results so we had already seen the calling of the add function over here multiple times with the help of different parameters for the first set of parameters we were getting the sum as 11 and for the second set of parameters we were getting the sum as 24 Guys these are certain important points to note
