so now we will see text color and Alignment property in CSS so guys basically the color property is used to set the color of the text and apart from this the text align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text so we will check this with the help of examples as well in vs code so the very first property that we are going to see related to the text in HTML is the color property so guys let us move to the vs code over here and I'll simply remove the previous lines of code in this case and basically we are going to have a simple heading that is with the tag H1 over here and we will say this is heading one so basically we have the statement that is this is heading one inside the H1 heading tag over here let me just save this file now and we will also clear the lines of code that we had return previously inside the style. CSS so let me just save these files now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this is heading one over here now guys by default the color of this text is black color so what if we want to provide the different text color to this heading so let me just go to the style. CSS file over here since the HTML file is linked to the style. CSS by using the link tag in this case so guys over here we will provide the tag name that is H1 and simply we are going to provide the color property over here so as you can see this is the property that we are going to use and we can provide any color color in this case in order to be reflected as the text color for this heading that is H1 over here so guys what we will do is simply we are going to provide the color that is red color in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the color of this heading is being updated as red color so this is the way that we can use the color property in order to update the text color for a specific HTML element now guys apart from this you can also use the hex color or the RGB values as well for the color value so let's say we want to provide the hex value over here so we provide hashtag followed by the red color component that is double F and then the green color component that is 0 0 and then we have the blue color component that is 0 0 over here so this will be the red color what if we want to mix the red and green color over here so simply we have to provide the 2 * f for the green component as well so it will be updated to this particular color that is the yellow color over here which is the mixture of red color and the green color so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the yellow color that is being displayed on the UI it is not going so well with the white color background over here so let me just change the background color as well so in this case we will provide the background color as black in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the background color is black and the text color is yellow yellow now so guys this is the way that you can define the color value using the hex value or the color name or the RGB values as well now guys apart from this in order to align the text you can use the text align property as well so by default over here as you can see on the UI the text is being aligned on the left hand side let's say we want this text to be displayed at the center over here of this particular screen so what we can do is simply we can use the text align property so over here we have text hyphen align so this is the text align property that we will be using and it is having multiple values so as you can see Center is the value we also have and justify left right so basically by default this is the value that is left value for the text align which is getting applied on all the HTML elements so over here let's say we want the text to be displayed at the center so simply we provide the center value to the text align property let me just save this file now and try reloading this this page once again on the browser so as you can see the text is getting displayed at the center of the screen now with the help of the text align property similarly if we want this text to be displayed on the right hand side of the screen so what we can do is instead of having the center value we can have the right value over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are having this particular text on the right side of the browser so this is the way that the text align prop property works for a particular text element which is the part of the HTML element now guys apart from this we also have something called as text align last so basically this reflects the alignment of the last line of a particular paragraph so let us check that as well so guys in order to understand this we need to have a paragraph which is having multiple lines over here so let's say we have the P tag we can also have the text inside the Dev tag as well and over here we are going to Simply generate the random text by using the lurm M abbreviation so over here we have the simple random text that is getting generated let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the text that is generated inside the paragraph tag over here now guys what is the meaning of the text align last property so basically the last line over here inside the paragraph will be aligned based on the value that we provide to this text align last property so let us check that as well so over here since since we have used the paragraph tag in the style. CSS property we will be defining the P tag over here and for this tag we are going to provide the text align last property so as you can see this is the property that we are going to use and let's say we want the last line to be at the center of the screen so simply we can provide the center apart from the center we also have many other values as you can see we have justify left right and so on so basically we are going to apply the center value do in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the last line of this paragraph is now getting displayed at the center of the screen now guys if we want to display it on the right hand side of the screen so what we can do is simply we can provide the right value to this property over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the last line of the paragraph is now getting displayed on the right of the screen and apart from that we also have something called as justify value so let us check what happens let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see every word on this last line is now getting separated with the help of equal spaces in between them so guys if you want the last line of the paragraph to be displayed in this way you can use the justify value for the text align last property inside the CSS file so this is the work working of another text align property that you can apply for the last line of a particular paragraph or the div element now guys apart from this we have something called as direction as well so basically this will Define the direction of text which will be displayed on the browser so by default it will be left to right so over here as you can see the direction of the text is from left to right let us check this with another example over here so let's say we have another div tag in this case so simply we are going to have the div tag and we will say this is a test div element so guys basically we have a simple this is a test div element over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is a Dev element now guys what is the meaning of Direction CSS property so let us provide that property in the style. CSS file over here so inside this file we are going to provide the diff tag in this case and simply we are going to provide the directions CSS property so guys basically we have the values that is LTR which stands for left to right which is the default value which means the letters will be displayed from left to right and that is the standard way in order to display the letters and apart from that we also have other value that is RTL which stands for right to left so guys let us check what happens in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the text is getting displayed on the right but in order to reverse this text we have another property so we can use that as well so we have the property that is uni code hyphen BD so guys over here we are going to use this property and we say the value that is BD override so in this case what will happen is the letters will be displayed from the right to left Direction so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if you see the letters are reversed so basically you need to to read from the right to the left in order to understand the statement that is being provided inside this Dev element so guys in this way if you want to reverse the direction of the letters that are being displayed on the UI you can use the combination of these two CSS properties that is direction should be RTL and the Unicode BD should be BD hyphen override in this case so Guys these are certain CSS properties as far as the text color and the text alignment is concerned comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is text decoration property in CSS so stay tuned
