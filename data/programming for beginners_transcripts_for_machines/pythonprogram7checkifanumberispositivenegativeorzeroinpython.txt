hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to check if a number is positive negative or zero so guys in this example you will learn to check whether a number entered by the user is it a positive or A negative number or else if it is a zero so this problem is solved using the if alif and L statement so guys let us move to the vs code in order to check this program so basically the very first thing that we have to do is take the input from the user so this will be an integer so what we will do is we will take the integer function over here and inside this we will take the input from the user since the default input that will be taken by the user will be in the form of the string data type we need to convert it into the integer so that is why we have provided the inter prefix over here as the function so guys over here we will ask the user to enter the number so user will enter this number and it will be assigned to this number as an integer now we need to check whether this number that is entered by the user if it is a positive number if it is a negative number or else if it is 0 and accordingly we will print the output so the very first thing that we have to do is we use the if condition and we say number is it greater than zero so when a number is positive then it will be greater than 0 in this case what we have to do is simply we print that entered number so we say entered number that is we use the curly braces because we are going to use the dot format function over here in order to print the number over here and then we say is a positive number and then what we will do is after the string we will use dot followed by format and then we will provide this variable that is number so that it is printed inside this early braces over here so we say number over here now guys what if the number is not greater than 0 so we will come in the alif part and then again we will check whether number is less than 0 so we say number is less than 0 and if the number is less than 0 then it is a negative number so I'll simply copy this line of code and paste this over here but this time we will say enter number and then these curly braces will be replaced by this number is a negative number this time so we will say negative number over here if it is less than 0 or else it will be equal to 0 so basically we have checked whether the number is greater than 0 or else if it is less than 0 if no condition is getting satisfied after these two conditions and the number will be equal to 0 so we will simply print that the number is zero so over here we say number is 0 in this case so guys this is the way that we can easily write the Python program in order to check whether the enter number is a positive number negative number or else if it is a zero so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so the very first thing that is being asked by the program is to enter the number so let's say we provide the number that is 12 over here when we press enter as you can see entered number 12 is a positive number so basically this condition is getting satisfied because a number is greater than 0 and we are getting this statement being printed on the console now guys let us run this code once again this time what we will do is we will provide a number that is less than zero so let's say we provide minus 1 in this case and then when we press enter as you can see enter number that is minus 1 is a negative number why so because the very first thing that is number greater than 0 was not satisfied and then the control flow goes over here and it checks whether the number is less than zero so the condition that is number less than 0 is true in this case and that is the reason we are getting this statement being printed on the console that the entered number minus 1 is a negative number now guys let us check for the last statement that is number is zero so we have to provide the number from the user as 0 so let me just run this code once again over here we provide 0 as the number so when we press enter as you can see number is 0 in this case so this thing is getting printed over here now guys can we provide the float numbers as well so let's say when we run this code once again we want to provide a positive number that is a float number so we provide 2.13 in this case and when we press enter as you can see we are getting an error that is invalid literal for INT with base 10. so over here we are getting the error when we provide the float integer so what we need to do in order to avoid this error so basically since we are expecting of load number to be taken by this number variable but we are providing the int function over here we need to change it to a float number in this case is so that a float number gets stored in this number variable so now let us check this code once again I'll save this file and try running this code now so again we will provide the same number this time so let's say we provide 2.13 in this case when we press enter as you can see enter number 2.13 is a positive number so guys in this way we can also use the float numbers in order to check whether they are positive negative or zero let us take another input now I'll run this code once again we will say minus 0.01 so guys take this as a homework for you what will be the output of this particular number that is entered by the user whether it will be a positive number a negative number or else whether number is 0 will be printed comment in the comment section below let's see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output make sure that you like this video so that it

number is odd or even so stay tuned
