so now we will see comparison operators in JavaScript So Below are some of the comparison operators in JavaScript that you can use in order to compare the two numbers or the two strings or the two variables as well so guys basically we have two times equal to operator in order to check whether the two numbers or the two strings are equal and when we provide the three times equal to operator as you can see it is going to check whether the value is equal and also apart from that it is also going to check whether the type type of both the variables or both the values are equal or not on the left hand side and the right hand side of this particular operator now guys it is very important to note that whenever you are going to use these comparison operators it is going to either return true or false so basically only one output will be provided out of these two values that is true and false over here we also have not equal to in this case and then again when we provide exclamation mark followed by two * equal to operator it is not equal value or not equal type in this case apart from all these operators we have more basic operators over here that is greater than symbol then we have less than symbol then we have greater than or equal to or less than equal to and then we also have the Turner operator that we can use as far as the comparison operators are concerned so guys let us check all these with the help of examples in vs code over here so what we are going to do is let us say we provide the two variables so we provide the const keyword followed by the first variable that is a so let's say we provide the variable that is 10 over here as the value of the variable and another variable that is B in this case we provide the number that is 11 over here now guys let us say we want to check whether both the numbers are equal so simply we can use the two * equal to operator over here so inside the console. log statement simply we can say the first variable that is a in this case followed by two * equal to and Then followed by the other variable that is B in this case so guys basically this is the expression which is helping us in order to check whether both these variable values are equal or not please note that these values will be compared over here and it will return true when both the values are same and it will return false when both the values are not same so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code on the terminal over here so let me just change this directory so basically we are under the JavaScript folder in this case so now we will run the node command over here followed by the name of the JavaScript file so guys as you can see we are getting the output that is false in this case which means a is not equal to B over here so guys what we will do is simply I will change the value of B now to 10 so that both the variable values are equal now and this expression must return true in this case so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see we are getting the output as true this time because we have made both the values as same over here now guys what is the importance of using three times equal to in this case so guys what we will do is let us say the first variable is having the value that is 10 as a number and for the second variable that is B we want it to be in the form of string over here so guys basically we will say double quotes in this case and then inside this we are going to provide the number that is 10 now guys this a value that is 10 is different from this B value which is 10 because the type of this particular B variable is string over here now in order to confirm this simply we can use the type of operator in this case so we will say console. log statement over here simply we can provide the type of operator which is used in order to check the type of a particular variable which means what kind of value that particular variable is holding so guys basically we say type of followed by the space character and then the name of the variable so let's say when we provide the variable a we want to check the type of this particular variable a let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting the output as number over here so this thing is telling us that the variable a is having the value of the type number over here and that is correct because we are having the number 10 in this case but guys for the variable B since we have provided the value inside the double Cotes over here whenever we are using the double quotes or the single code the value is represented as a string value so basically when we check the type of this particular variable that is B over here let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see it is now telling us that the B variable is having the value of the type string in this case so guys basically a is having the value of the type number and B is having the value of the type string over here so let us now check whether both these variables are equal or not to basically when we use 2 * equal to operator over here the values of the variables will be checked and the data type will not be checked over here so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting the value as true that's because the values for both these variables are same but the data type is different so in order to check the data type as well you have to use the three * equal to operator in which case the type will also be checked so guys over here we will provide another equal to operator so we have a equal to equal to equal to and then B over here so basically let us see what will be the output so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see this time we are getting false that's because even though the values are same for the variable A and B but the data types are different for a we have the data type as number and for B we are having the data type as string so guys always remember whenever you are working on any project it is very important that you compare the values as well as the type of the variables that you are comparing so three * equal to operator is recommended compared to the two times equal to operator as it might give you unexpected results as we have seen since it compares the number and the string and the output can be true in that case so you should also check the type of the variable that you are comparing now guys similarly we have the not equal to operator as well so let us say we provide the number that is 11 over here so simply we will provide a followed by exclamation mark over here followed by the equal to operator this means we are asking whether this a is not equal to B yes in this case because 10 is not equal to 11 so this particular expression should return true over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting the value as true that's because a is actually not equal to B and when we make them equal to so let us say we provide the value as 10 for B in such a way that a is now equal to B so is a not equal to B no in this case because both are equal so this particular expression will return false over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting false in this case and then guys similarly we can compare the type as well by providing the two * equal to over here after the exclamation mark So in this case let us provide 2 times equal to so is a not equal to B this time no because both the values are equal so so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting false over here let me just change the value to 11 in this case and when we save this file now and try running this code as you can see we are getting true because both the values are not equal and behind the scenes it is also checking for the type as well so when both the values are same that is a and b are having the values as 10 over here and also the data type is number let us see what will be the output in this case as you can see we are getting false over here here but if we provide this B value as a string value in this case and keep the value same so let me just provide the double codes over here and we have provided the value as 10 over here so this time the data type is not matching so even though the value is matching over here but the data type of both the variables are not matching and that is why this particular expression should return true in this case so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting the output is true in this case so guys in this way you can use the not equal to operator as well apart from this we can also see whether a number is greater than the other number so let us check that as well so this time let us provide the B value as 15 over here and we will check whether a is greater than b so when we provide the greater than symbol it will check whether this particular a value on the left hand side is it equal to B no in this case because 10 is less than 15 over here so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting false that's because a is not greater than b similarly on the reverse side we can use a is less than b over here it will give us the result as true this time because a is actually less than b this time over here so guys when we provide a less than b let us see what will be the output when we run this code once again as you can see we are getting the value as true now guys let us say both the values are same over here so we provide the value of a as 15 as well so a is equal to B this time so what will be the output of a is less than b over here so let us check that so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting false that's because a is not less than b it is exactly equal to B so guys if the value of B is 15 over here the maximum value of a must be 14 in order for this particular expression to be true so guys let us check that as well when we provide the a value as 14 so this time the a is less than b over here so we will get the result as true over here so as you can see we are getting the result as true and if you want to check whether a is less than b but you want that particular expression to return true even if both the values are same so let's say we have the value of a as 15 and B also has 15 over here and you want this particular expression to be true this time so we have to use a less than or equal to B this time so guys basically it is going to check whether a is less than b if not then it is going to check whether a is equal to B so if one of the condition is satisfied so basically it is going to return true over here so when we save this file now this time we will get true over here since a is equal to B so as you can see we are getting true over here but if we remove this equal to operator this will return as false because both the variable values are same so as you can see we are getting false over here so guys similarly the greater than or equal to operator will work in the same way so let me know in the comment section below what will be the output if we provide a greater than or equal to B over here whether it will be true or false when both the values of the variables that is a and b is equal to 15 over here let us see whether your answer is correct or not now guys apart from this we have another very important operator that is called as Turner operator over here in which case we use the question mark operator so guys let us check that as well so what we have to do is we need to provide certain condition over here so let me just change this condition to a is less than or equal to B this time so guys basically we are using this particular operator a is less than or equal to B we have provided the values as 15 and 15 so basically what exactly is happening over here is this particular expression will return true over here so let me just confirm that so when we run this code once again you can see that the result is true but guys what we can do is we can print some other string over here when the result result is true and if the result is not true we can print something else so after the condition that we have provided over here this particular expression is called condition in this case so after this we have to provide the question mark as the Turner operator and after this question mark we have to provide something to be printed on the console when the condition is true over here so let us say we want to print one when this particular expression is true and if this particular expression is false we want to print two on the console so after we provide the true statement we provide colon over here and then we provide the other statement that is two which will be executed when the expression is false so guys let us check this as well so when we save this file now so currently a is less than or equal to be yes it is since both the values are same so it is going to return true over here so basically for the true statement this particular number that is one will be printed on the console so when we run this code on the terminal as you can see we are getting one over here but guys let us say we provide the value of a as 20 over here in which case this particular expression will be false since a is not less than or equal to B over here so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see we are getting the number as two because we are getting the false output for this particular expression now guys instead of providing the numbers we can simply provide the string as well that will be more sensible so we can say a is less than or equal to B so guys basically within the double codes over here we have provided the statement to be printed on the console similarly for the false expression as well instead of two we will provide another string over here inside the double code so we will say a is not less than b over here so guys when a is less than b it is going to print this statement and when a is not less than b it is going to print this particular statement for the false expression so when we see this file now currently a is not less than b over here so let us see what will be printed on the terminal so when we run this code once again as you can see a is not less than b is getting printed over here but let us say we want this particular expression to be true so in this case we have provided the value of a as 10 and B is 15 over here so this time a is less than b so when we run this code once again you can see that a is less than or equal to B this time so guys in this way you can use the Turner operator remember that first we have to provide the expression by using some comparison operators that we have used so far and then after that we have to use this question mark operator which is called as tary operator as well and then the first expression will be the true expression and Then followed by the colon we will provide the output to be provided when the expression is false over here so guys comment in the comment section below
