so now we will see fonts in CSS so guys basically there are multiple properties related to fonts in CSS and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so basically the first property is the font family which will help us in order to specify the font of a text so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous line of code that we had return from the HTML and the CSS files as well so in the HTM ml file we are going to have the div element in this case and let us generate some random text over here so as you can see we have generated the random text using the lurm M abbreviation let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the text that we have written inside our Dev element now guys this is the default font family over here we have not provided any font family in our external CSS file so how do we provide the font family in the style. CSS file over here so simply we are going to go inside the style. CSS file and for the div element we are going to set the font family in this case now guys when we provide the font family property as you can see there are multiple values in this case to be provided as the font family now guys what is the meaning of these multiple values that are separated by comma so over here let us say we want to provide the aial font family so when we select this as you can see the first font family is aial and Then followed by comma we have something called as helvetica and then we have s s so guys basically this is nothing but a fallback mechanism that will work in such a way that first of all the web browser will check whether the aial font family is being installed locally on that particular browser and if yes then the text will be applied this particular font family and if not then the helvetica will be checked whether whether it is present or not and if it is present then helvetica will be provided and if this is also not present then s siif is the generic font family name that will be applied which is having the group of different values for the font family over here so guys basically the last name for the font family CSS property will be the generic font family so as you can see it specifies a prioritized list of font family names or generic family names so some of the browser versions might not have the first for the second font family value and this is the fallback mechanism that is being used over here now guys let us check how this font family will be displayed on the UI so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see the font has been updated now with the help of the font family CSS property similarly if we provide some other font family over here so let's say we provide Times New Roman font family in this case so first of all this Times New Roman will be checked whether the browser is having this particular font family if not then this times font family will be checked and if this is also not present then the siif generic family will be applied to the text over here so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page before reloading you will be seeing that the font family will be updated over here to Times New Roman so when we reload this page as you can see this is the text that is being displayed with the font family of Times New Roman over here let us update to some other font Family Value in this case so let us select Verana over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the font family has been updated over here and this is how you can apply the font family to your text based on your requirements now guys let us move to another property over here so we have something called as font style in this case which will specify whether the text needs to be displayed as it so guys let us check that as well so over here simply we can Pro provide font style CSS property and for this style we have multiple values that is ITC or normal or obli so guys basically by default we have the normal value so let us see how the text will be displayed when we provide the value as italic for font family CSS property so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the value of ITC is being provided over here as the font style CSS property now guys let us move to another CSS property we have something called as font weight over here so let us check that as well which will help us in order to specify the weight of the font so guys over here simply we will say font weight property and we have multiple numbers that we can provide also we can provide the value that is bold over here or Bolder or lighter so by default we have the value that is normal so what if we provide the Bold value in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the meaning of bold font weight in this case and based on your requirements if you want to display the text in this way you can provide the font weight over here now guys let us move to another property we have something called as font size in this case which sets the size of the text and we can use the various units which is pixels and EM over here so guys let us check this with the help of example in VSS code so let us have another paragraph in this case so we will have the P tag over here and then simply we will say this is a paragraph So guys we are going to apply the font size property on this paragraph let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is a paragraph text is getting displayed so guys how do we provide the font size property to this paragraph so simply we are going to come in this CSS file we are going to provide the P tag and we are going to say font size in this case so guys by default the font size is 16 pixels on most of the browsers and let's say we want to provide 22 pixels as font size so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the size of this particular font has increased to 22 pixels let us inspect this element so when we right click on this HTML element and click on the inspect option you will be seeing all the CSS properties that are being provided to this paragraph tag over here when we uncheck this font size as you can see this is the default font size for the paragraph tag and when we check it with the 22 pixels value the text is getting displayed with the help of font size of 22 pixels if we increase the size to 26 pixels so over here when we change it to 26 you will notice on the UI that the size will increase over here so when we make it as 26 pixels as you can see the size of the paragraph has increased more so in this way you can provide the various font size to the text let me just reload this page once again on the browser so that the changes that we have made on the CSS file is getting reflected on the page and guys apart from this we have something called as em unit as well so basically 1 em is equal to the current font size and by default the current font size that is the text size in the browsers is 16 pixels so when we provide 1 em as the font size over here it will be the default font size of the browser so let us check that as well we provide 1 em as the font size in in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is by default 16 pixels over here if you want to double this size that is 32 pixels simply we can provide 2 em in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so this is the 32 pixels font size that is getting displayed over here now guys what if we want to make the size as 28 pixels so simply we can come to calculator over here and for this 28 pixels we are going to divide it by 16 since 1 em is equal to 16 pixels so we need to get a number that is corresponding to the EM unit for which the pixels unit is 28 so let me just check that as well so it is 1.75 em so guys basically the EM unit also allows you to provide the numbers in decimal so let us check this as well when we provide 175 em over here what will happen so we have provided 1.75 em let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the size has been updated to 1.75 Em which is equivalent to 28 pixels over here and if we want to make it as 24 pixels simply we will say 1.5 Em which will correspond to the 24 pixels if you calculate this so when we say 24 / 16 it will give us 1.5 s the EM unit so guys let me just save this file now and try reload in this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the 24 pixels or 1.5 em font size for this particular text now guys it is very important that we use the text size that is the font size with the help of the EM unit so that on different browsers the text is automatically scaling up or down and it is recommended in order to use a combination of percent as well in the body tag along with this em so guys inside this style. CSS file simply we can say body and then for the font size property over here so simply we are going to say font size as 100% so guys what will happen is the font size for all the HTML elements inside the body will be set as 100% and whenever we are going to use the font size as the EM unit for the other HTML elements it will properly scale up or scale Down based on the browser and the device size on which the user is using the web page so guys this is one of the best practices that you must follow while providing the CSS property of font size to the different text element now guys we have something called as font Shand property that will help us in order to provide the values of all these CSS properties related to font in just one CSS property that is font in this case so guys I'll leave this up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own and use the different values for the different font properties that is related to text so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is icons in CSS so stay tuned
