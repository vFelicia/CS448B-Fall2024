welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about displaying smaller text in HTML using the small tag so guys basically the content of the small starting and the ending tag is displayed one font size smaller than the rest of the text surrounding it so guys basically whatever text we enclose within the small starting and the ending tag will appear smaller compared to the rest of the text so let us check this with the help of the example in the VSS code over here so the very first thing that we will do is we will have a simple paragraph using the P tag and then we will say this text is small in this paragraph So we have a very simple statement that is this text is small in this paragraph in the P tag that is the paragraph now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page over here so when we reload this page as you can see we have a paragraph this text is small in this paragraph now guys what we will do is we will enclose these three words that is text is small in between the small tag so over here in the vs code we have to enclose it in between the small tag so we will have the small starting tag over here and then we have the ending tag as well which we will put after the small word in this case so basically text is small these three words are being enclosed now in between the small starting and the ending tags over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again to see how it appears so when we reload this page as you can see text is small these three words are appearing one font size smaller compared to the other text in the same paragraph now guys if we see what is happening behind the scenes we can simply right click over here and select the inspect option so after this we have under the elements tab we have this P tag over here inside which we have the this text is small in this paragraph statement and then guys you can see for this small tag we have the font size that is smaller over here so we can also use the CSS property that is font size with the value smaller in order to make the text appear in the same way just like how we have done for the text is Big over here so if we check the code for this text is big in this vs code you can see we have used the span tag and then we have used the style attribute over here for which we have used the property that is font size and the value is larger in this case so guys either we can use this CSS property using the span tag or we can simply use the small tag over here which is supported by the latest version the big tag that we have seen previously is not supported with the latest versions of the browser and that is why we had used the font size property inside the style attribute so guys please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel CH so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Mark text in HTML using the mark tag so stay tuned
