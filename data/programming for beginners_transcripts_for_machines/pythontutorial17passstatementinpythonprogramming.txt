hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about pass statement in Python Programming so guys in Python Programming the pass statement is a null statement which can be used as a placeholder for future code so basically let's say you have a certain function or you have something else like you can have a while loop or the if condition as well and you want to implement the logic inside this Loop or the if condition later on in the future so you can use the pass statement in this case so as you can see suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet but we want to implement it in the future in such cases we can use the pass statement but now you will ask me we can also put the command inside this block that is inside the for Loop or the if condition as well so why do we use the pass statement so guys let us understand this with the help of example so first of all we will understand the past statement over here so let's say we have the eyes value as 1 over here and then we have the if condition so inside the if condition what we are doing is we are just checking whether I is less than or equal to 10 and then we have a colon and let's say we have the print statement over here and then we say yes less than 10 so we put yes less than 10 over here and then what we will do is we will have another print statement and I will say outside if statement so guys this is a very simple code first of all we have initialized the variable I to the value equal to 1 and then we have the if condition I is less than or equal to 10 and we are Simply Having the print statement over here and then after this if condition we have printed that we have come outside the if Loop let me just save this file and try running this code now so it says yes less than 10 and it also says yes outside the if statement now let's say I have some plan in order to implement some logic over here but I don't have the exact logic right now so something else will be replacing this line of code over here so let's say I simply put a command and say that to the implemented in future so we have the statement over here that is to be implemented in future now remember guys this is a command that using the hash character over here we are putting the comment inside the if statement so let me just save this file and try running this code before running this code you can already see that with this print function we are getting the red underline but still we will go and run this code now so as you can see Line 6 print outside if statement so expected and intended block after if statement on line three so basically the root cause is over here that is inside the if condition so what it is saying is inside the if condition we have not provided any block of code that is there is no logic inside the if condition that we have provided previously we had simply provided the print function which works already but this thing is not working so what we can simply do is instead of providing the comment we can simply provide the pass statement so guys what happens with the pass statement is The Interpreter understands that there is no block of code right now inside the if condition and it needs to be ignored for now as far as execution of the code is concerned but with the command the code doesn't understand such comment and basically it throws the error and that is what we have got previously so let me just save this file now and try running this code hopefully we should not get this error now so I'm just running this code once again so as you can see outside if statement is getting executed and basically this pass statement has helped us in order to make the control flow understand that there is no logic that is being implemented inside this if condition for now but in the future we will be implementing such a logic and for now you can just ignore it and pass to the upcoming lines of code over here so guys this is the main functionality of the past statement you can use it whenever you have the requirement of implementing some logic in the future inside the if condition or the for Loop or while loop or even in the defined functions as well which we are going to see in the upcoming videos so guys that's it in this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is functions in Python Programming so stay tuned
