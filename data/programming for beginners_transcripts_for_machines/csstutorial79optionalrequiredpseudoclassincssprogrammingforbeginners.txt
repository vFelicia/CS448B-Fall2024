so now we will see optional and required pseudo class in CSS so guys basically we will see how to style the HTML form elements using the optional and the required Pudo class so let us move to the vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines that we had return in the HTML and the CSS files over here now guys what we will do is first of all we will Define the diff tag with the class container inside which we are going to have the form over here so before having the form we will have the header tag that is the h2 tag and we will say Feld below form in this case as a heading now guys after this we are going to have the form tag over here and we will have the ID as form in this case and simply we are going to have three Fields over here first of all we will have the username field so we will have input colon text over here so basically it is the input tag with the type text in this case and we will have the name as username and ID as the username value apart from this we will also have the placeholder attribute and we will say enter username so guys basically this is the text that will be displayed by default as a placeholder and then we will make this field as required so that user has to feel this particular field in this case and after this we are going to have certain line braks over here so that the next input is displayed on the next line so I'm going to copy paste this line of code and this time we are going to have password as the text field and again we are going to have the ID as password and we will say enter password over here and it is again a required field in this case and instead of having the type equal to text we will say the type is equal to password over here and then guys apart from this we will have the email field as well so again we will have the type as email over here and we will set the name and the ID as the email values and we will say enter email in this case which is not required over here so we will remove the required attribute from this particular input tag so guys basically we are going to provide the CSS properties with the help of this required or the optional attribute over here so whatever fields we have marked as required will be provided a set of CSS properties and the other fields which are by default optional which means user is not required to provide the data inside those optional field such as the email field over here those will be having the set of other CSS properties and then apart from this we will also have two buttons over here the first button will be the submit button in this case so we will have the input type is equal to submit and the value will be submit over here and also we will set the ID as submit in this case and then apart from this we will also have another button which will have the value as clear over here so guys this is simply for the displaying purpose we are going to have two buttons that is submit and clear inside the form so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the way the form is displayed over here we have the heading first of all Feld below form over here so we need to change this keyword to below form in this case so we have field below form as the header over here and then we have the three fields at is username password and the email Fields over here let us have certain background color for the container class as well in this case so what we will do is we will copy this class name over here and inside the style. CSS file we will have the container class name and what we will do is let's say we have the background color as aqua color over here also we will provide the padding of let's say 20 pixels in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the container that is having the background color over here now guys we will reduce the width of the container to the width of these particular text boxes so what we can do is simply we can set the width it is equal to Min content over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see now now the width is set in such a way that it is only taking up the required space over here apart from this we also want to Center align this particular container so what we will do is simply we can provide margin it is equal to Auto over here so as far as horizontal alignment is concerned we are getting the diff tag at the center of the screen over here now guys how we can provide the CSS properties to these required and the optional attributes that are present inside the form so simply what we have to do is we have to Pro provide the input tag and then we can use the Cudo class over here so let's say first of all we want to provide certain CSS properties to these required fields at a username and password so over here inside the style. CSS file we will say input tag followed by colon and then simply we can say the required keyword so guys this is the way that we can use the Cudo classes over here so basically we need to provide the single colon and then the name of the sudo class so in this case it is the required sudo class class that we are using and whatever CSS properties that we will be including inside this required Pudo class will be applied to all those fields that are marked as required over here inside the form so guys let us check that as well so what we will do is first of all we will provide the padding of five pixels over here let me just save this file now you will notice some kind of spacing inside these username and the password text boxes so when we reload this page as you can see there is extra space that is added over here apart from this we will also provide certain background color so that we can identify the changes that are happening inside those two text boxes that is username and password so what we will do is we will set the background color as green over here and let us change the green color to some lighter version of green color over here so we have this very light green color in this case with the help of the RGB values let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the light green background color for these required text boxes over here that is username and password apart from this we can also have some more CSS properties that is let's say we have the Border radius of 5 pixels over here so basically the corners of these text boxes will be having the rounded corner so this is the 5 pixels border radius that we have applied over here so in this way based on your project requirements you can provide any CSS Properties by using the required pseudo class in this case now guys apart from this the other field that is enter image which is the email field over here is not having the required attribute so basically by default it is the optional field inside the form so guys what we can do is simply we can Define the input tag followed by colon and then we can have the codo class that is optional over here so whatever CSS properties that we Define inside the optional hudo class in this case will be applied to all the fields that are marked as optional or not having the required attribute so let us provide the same CSS properties in this case that is padding is equal to 5 pixels and Border radius is equal to 5 pixels but this time we are going to change the background color so we will have the version of the red color over here as the background color so let me just change the red color to some lighter version of this red color in this case as you can see this is the RGB value that we have set over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the lighter version of the red color to this field which is not marked as is required but it is the optional field in this case guys if you notice we also have this red color to the submit and the clear button so what we can do is we can provide the CSS properties of username and password to the submit button by using the ID of the submit button so what is the ID of this button it is submit in this case so what we will do is the CSS properties for the required fields are present over here so simply we are going to provide comma and then we will provide the hash character followed by the ID of the input button that is submit in this case so guys basically these CSS properties will be applied to the submit Button as well as the fields that are marked as required over here and in this way we can also provide the multiple CSS selectors so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the same CSS selectors that are provided to the required fields are now provided to the submit Button as well and the clear button can have the CSS property that is provided to the optional field over here so guys in this way you can use the required and the optional Cudo classes over here and based on your project requirements you can provide any of the CSS properties inside the codo classes so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well I'll see you in the next video till then stay tuned
