hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about with open syntax to read the file in Python Programming so guys in Python we can use the with open syntax to automatically close the file and as you can see in this example we have the syntax that is first of all we have the with keyword followed by the open function and then we have the path of the file along with the file name and then the second parameter is the read mode of the file and then we have the as keyword over here followed by the variable name and then after this colon we can read the content by using the read method and then we can simply Print it Now guys the advantage of using this with open syntax in order to read the content of the file is that it automatically closes the file so previously we had seen that by using these four lines of code we can simply open the file read the content and print the content over here and this fourth line over here that is close method was used in order to close the file that we had opened but this is not required if we are using the with open syntax so let us check this with the help of example now over here I'll just clear these lines of code and simply we will provide the width keyword first followed by open function and then we have the open and close parenthesis and inside this we have to provide the path of the file that we want to read so we are going to read the same file that we had used previously that is the test file so first of all we have to provide the directory paths over here I'll just copy the directory path over here and paste this over here and then we have the file name to be read so I'll just copy this file name and paste this over here followed by dot txt now guys it is very important that we have the double slash characters in order to avoid any of the issues that might occur due to the Escape characters so over here I am just providing the double backslash characters at every instance inside the directory path and then after this this is the first parameter which is the path of the file that we want to read and the second parameter that we have is the mode in which we want to open the file so we provide R in this case so this means that we are opening the file in the read mode and then guys after this after this open function we have the as keyword and Then followed by the variable name so let's say we provide file 1 in this case now this file one that is the variable name can be used in order to read the content of the file so after this colon we can go to the next line and then we can have another variable that is read content in this case followed by equal to and then we can have file 1 followed by Dot and then we have the rear method so guys this line of code is responsible in order to read the content of the file and store the content inside the read content variable name and then guys we can simply have the print function in order to print the content of the file so guys that is the way that we can use the with open syntax along with this we are using the read method in order to read the content and printing the content over here now it is very important to note that we need not have to provide this line of statement that is file one dot close in this case that's because when we are using the with open syntax the file will be automatically closed after the read operation is completed so I'll just remove this line of code since it is not required so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting all the content of the file that is all the four lines over here that is present inside the test file so we are getting this is a test line in a test file and then we are having the this is another test line so whatever content is there we are getting it over here inside our program let me just remove these third and fourth line over here and then I'll just save this file now inside the test file and then what we will do is we will run this code once again this time we should only get the starting two lines that's because we have removed the third and fourth line from the test file so I'll just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting this is a test line in a test file and the second line this is another test line so only two lines over here are getting printed so guys this is the way that we can use the with open syntax in order to read the content of the file print it on the console or do whatever based on the requirements of your project now it is important to note that we need not have to close the file explicitly after carrying out the operations with the file that we have opened so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is file writing in Python Programming so stay tuned
