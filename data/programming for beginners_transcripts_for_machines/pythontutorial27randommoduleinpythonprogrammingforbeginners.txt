hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about random module in Python Programming so guys python offers the random module to Generate random numbers or to pick a random item from an iterator so we are going to check this with the help of examples now over here so first of all we are supposed to import the random module in this way and then as you can see we are printing a random range over here we are using the random module followed by the dot operator and then we are using the Rand range function in order to find the random range over here so let us move to the vs code over here in order to check the examples so first of all we will be importing the random module so we have import followed by random over here next let's say I want to print the random range so what we will do is we will have the print function and inside that we will be using the random module that we have just imported followed by Dot and as you can see vs code is suggesting us many other variables and the method names as well that we can use so we are going to say random range over here and the range it should be between 10 and 20. so we provide 10 comma 20 as the range so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting 12 over here which is the part of this random range that is 10 and 20. let's say we want the number to be between 100 and 200 over here so let me save this file and try running this code now after making changes as you can see we are getting the 178 similarly let's say if you want to throw the dice and only numbers that are present on the dices between one to six so you can use this random range function inside the random module and provide one comma 6 as the number in order to get the number so as you can see we are getting 4 over here next time when we run this and then we are getting 2 over here so you can use this function in order to develop your next game as far as throwing a dice is concerned now similarly we can also have the list as you can see we have the list one and then we have five characters over here let let's say out of these characters we want to select one of the characters so you can use the choice function inside the random module so let us check this with the help of example now over here so let's say we have the list of the programming languages so we name it as the list one as the variable name and then what are the programming languages so one is Python and then let's say we have Java as another programming language then let's say we have C plus plus and then let's say we have Swift as another programming language so these are certain programming languages now let's say out of all these four values we want to select one of the values randomly so what we can do is we can have the print function and then we can use this random module name followed by Dot and then we have the choice function name and inside this function we have to provide the list variable so we provide list one over here so basically we are passing this list one to this Choice function and asking the choice function to select one of the values from this list of values so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting the Swift value as the random value if we run this code once again we will get some different value so as you can see we are getting Java this time then we run again we are getting python this time and then if we run again we are again getting Java so every time we will get a different value whenever we are using this particular function now let's say we want to print this list so what we will do is I'll just remove this part of the print statement and I'll simply provide a list one that is the variable name for that list let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting this list of values now before this what we can do is we are saying original list over here as the label so we say original list now exactly what we want to do is we want to shuffle this list let's say this sequence of data that we have inside the list we want to shuffle it so what we can do is simply we can use the random module name over here followed by Dot and it also has something called as Shuffle function so this will help us in order to shuffle all the values of this list that we provide so Shuffle followed by inside the open and close parenthesis we provide the list one variable name and then after that what we can do is we can simply print this list content once again and then we can simply put shuffled list over here instead of original list so before shuffling we are printing the original list over here which will print the values in this sequence and then after shuffling it will print the shuffled list over here where the values will be shuffled in this case so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see original list we are getting python Java C plus plus and Swift and then shuffle list it is Java Swift C plus plus and then python so we have just shuffled the list the values were completely shuffled inside the list and were printed on the screen now guys let's say very randomly you want to generate some kind of a element so what you can do is simply have the print statement over here and simply use the the random module in this case so I'll just remove this part of this line and then we can have the random followed by dot we have something called as random function over here this line of code will generate any element over here so let me just save this file and try running this code so as you can see we are getting a float number 0.1004 and so on and then let me just run this code once again as you can see we are getting another number over here and then let me just run this code 0.99 so this line of code is helping us in order to generate the random numbers over here in this case so guys this is the way that you can use a random module over here in this case in order to randomly generate some numbers or randomly Shuffle the values inside the list that is present please make sure that you like
