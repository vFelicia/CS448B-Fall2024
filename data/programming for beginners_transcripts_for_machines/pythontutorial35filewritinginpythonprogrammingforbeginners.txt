hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about file writing in Python Programming so guys in Python a file operation takes place in the following order so basically first of all we have to open the file then secondly we can write into the file that we have opened and the last step is to close the file so these are the operations in this order in which we have to follow while writing the content into the file now there are two things we need to remember while writing to a file so first of all if we try to open a file that doesn't exist so a new file will be created in this case so guys we are going to check this with the help of example as well and in the second case if a file already exists then its content is erased and new content is added to the file again so Guys these are the two important things that you should know while writing into the file if the file is not already present then a new file will be created and if the file is already present then the existing content will be most and the new content will be added into the file so guys the first operation is opening the file over here in which case we can use the open method to open the file and this is the example we have the variable on the left hand side and then we have the open method followed by the name of the file over here along with the entire path if it is present in some other directory and Then followed by the second parameter that is W which stands for the right mode so guys let us check this with the help of example now over here so what we will do is we will say file 1 which is the variable name followed by equal to and then we have the open method in this case so we have to provide the name of the file along with the directory path inside the parenthesis and the double quotes over here so what we will do is we are going to use this directory over here in order to create a new file and write the content into the file so guys over here there are only two files that is Python tutorial and test file we are going to create a third file that is out Port dot txt in which we are going to write the content by using the code over here so basically I'm going to paste the entire directory path and in order to avoid any errors I'll just use the double backslashes over here since these are the Escape characters so we provide the double backslashes and then at the end we have to provide the name of the file so I'll simply provide output dot txt in this case and then guys the second parameter needs to be the writing mode so over here inside the double quotes we can say w which means we are opening the file in the right mode in this case now guys we have completed the first step now what is the next step writing into the file so basically writing in a file in a python so after we open a file we use the write method to write the content in the file and this is the way as you can see in this example we have the variable name that is file 1 followed by Dot and then we have the right method and then the content that we want to write into the file so guys basically what we will towards on the second line over here we will say file 1 followed by Dot and then we have the right method this right method can be used in order to write the content into the file and it takes certain parameters the parameters will be the string or the integer numbers that you want to print or store inside the file so guys let's say I want to provide this is first line in output file so guys this is the content that we want to write into the file and this is the way that we can use the write function in order to write the content into the file and it takes the parameter as the string which you want to store inside the file now after writing what we have to do is we have to close the file so when we are done with performing operations on the file we need to properly close the file closing a file will free up the resources that were tied with the file it is done using the close method in Python so as you can see in this example we have file one dot close so over here we can simply provide file 1 Dot close in this case and then open and close parenthesis it doesn't take any parameters over here so guys let me just save this file now before running this code I'll show you the directory once again we have only two files over here that is Python tutorial and test file we are going to have a third file over here that is the output.txt that will be created after execution of this code so before running this code what I will do is I'll have the print statement so that we get the confirmation that the code is executed so we will say file created successfully so this is the statement that will be printed after all the lines of code are executed so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting file created successfully and if we go inside the directory now as you can see we are getting the third file over here that is the output in this case so if we open this file as you can see this is first line in output file and this is what we have printed by using our program this is first line in output file the same statement is being printed over here it is being stored in our output file and guys this is the way that we have created a new file by using the python code in a particular directory that we wanted and also return the content into the file by using the two methods that is first of all we have used the open function in order to open the file in the right mode and then we have used the write function in order to write the content into the file now guys let us say we have another scenario in the same file we want to update the first line to this is first line and I'll just remove this in output file content over here so we have the short message that is this is first line and then what I will do is we have another statement so again we will have the file one dot right and then we can say this is second line in this case so guys we are having the two lines over here now and this will act as a kind of update now that's because we already have this output.txt file in this directory and now what we are doing is simply we are opening it once again and these lines will be stored in the file and guys remember that while you are opening the existing file what we already saw is the content is erased and the new content is added to the file so basically these two lines will be printed inside the output.txt file and now what we will do is for this print function we will say file updated successfully so guys let me just save this file now before running this code I'll show you that file once again over here we we have the output file I just open this file we are having this is first line in a output file so let me just close this now and what we will do is we will run this code so as you can see file updated successfully we are getting this message will go to the directory to check what is the content so as you can see both the statements are getting printed over here this is first line and Then followed by this is second line now guys what happened is both the lines have continued on the same line but we can have them on the separate lines as well so what we can do is in our code we can simply provide the slashing character at the end of the first line over here so that the control flow goes to the next line while printing this statement that is this is second line so guys let me just save this file and try running this code now once again so it says file updated successfully we come back over here in the directory we open the output file now as you can see this is first line and then we have on the other line This is second line over here so guys in this way we can easily write the content in the file we can also have the multiple lines of content being stored in the file that we opened by using the Python programming language guys this concept of reading and writing the files are very important as far as your project requirements are concerned so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output apart from this can we use the with open syntax in order to write a file so you can try this as a homework for you you can watch my previous video as well in which I have explained you how we can use the with open syntax in order to read the file and in which case we don't have to close the file that's because it is automatically handled by this with open syntax for us so please treat this as a homework for you and comment in the comment section below whether you were able to use the with open syntax in order to write into the file please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is there directory in Python Programming so stay tuned
