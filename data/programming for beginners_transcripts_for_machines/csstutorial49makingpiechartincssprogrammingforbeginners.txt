so now we will see how we can make a pie chart in CSS so guys basically we can easily make the pie chart in CSS using the conic gradient for the background image CSS property so guys previously we have seen how we can use the conic gradient and apart from that we have also seen the linear gradient and the radial gradient for the background image CSS property if you have not watched that video you can check the playlist of the CSS tutorial the link I have given in the description section below so guys basically we have seen that the conic gradient help us in order to have the gradient color being rotated from the center point so guys over here we are going to use that property of the conic gradient in order to make the pie chart in CSS so guys this is the example that we are going to make use of different colors and we will be providing the angle for those colors as well so let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here let me just remove the previous lines of code that we had written and then guys inside the HTML file what we are going to do is we are going to have the div tag over here which will be a square div tag in this case so we are going to Define certain CSS properties over here so let's say we provide the width as 300 pixels in this case also the height as 300 pixels since we want to have the Square D tag over here out of which we are going to make a pie chart in CSS so guys we have the width and height over here in this case let us also have the background color for now which we are going to comment out later on so let's say we have the color as Aqua over here also we will provide the border of let's say 2 pixels solid border with the color that is black in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the diff tag with the width and height that we have set over here so guys what we have to do is instead of using the background color over here we have to use the background image so let me just comment out this line of code and simply we are going to say background image in this case so guys for this background image we we have to use the conic gradient over here so we say conic hyphen gradient in this case and Then followed by open and close parenthesis so guys using the conic gradient will help us in order to provide the gradient color from the center point and rotate it in the clockwise Direction so guys let us check the example of that so let me just set the first color as blue color over here and second color as the yellow color the third color is the green color and fourth color is the red color over here so guys we have the four basic colors blue yellow green red let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are starting from this particular point over here the first color is the blue color and then we have the smooth transition towards the yellow color over here and then again we have the transition towards green color followed by the transition towards the red color so it is the sequence in which we have provided the colors over here inside the coric gradient now guys how do we make a pie chart out of this Square shaped div element so first of all we need to convert the square shape to the circle shape so what we can do is simply we can use the Border radius over here and if you have seen my previous videos we have the Border radius equal to 50% that will help us in order to have the HTML element in a circle shape only when the width and height values of that particular HTML element are same so guys basically we need to have the width and height to be same in order to have the circular shape with the help of the Border radius equal to 50% let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the circular shape over here for this particular Dev element now guys we don't want this particular smooth transition that is happening between colors so what we can do is simply we can provide the starting and the ending point for these colors so first of all the blue color it is starting from 0° and then it is ending at 45° so we need to provide comma and then simply we have to provide blue again and then we we will say 90° over here so guys basically it is 90° and not 45° so basically it will be the 1 quarter of this particular Circle over here right now and Then followed by again yellow color which is starting from 90° from where the blue color got over and then followed by once again the yellow color which should get over at 180° right now so we have 180° in this case let me just save this file now and see how the changes will look like so when we reload this page so there are no changes right now let me just complete this code over here we have the green color which should start from the 180° right now so we have 180° for the green color and again we have green color over here so we will say green color followed by 270° so we have 270° and then we have the red color over here so we need to have comma as well so we have red color followed by 270° from where it should start and then it should end at 360° so we have red color followed by 360° things over here so let me just save this file now guys over here we have done a mistake we have provided the space character over here so always remember that when we are providing the angles we need to provide the space character after the color but not in between the value and the D string over here so you need to remember this let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the perfect pie chart and all the colors are taking the 1/4 area for this particular Circle we have the blue color followed by the yellow color then we have green color and then we have the red color so guys no longer we are having the smooth transitions over here in between the colors because we have provided the strict angles over here the starting and the ending angles right now so guys we can change these angles as well so instead of having the 90° for the blue color we can end it at 45° which should be somewhere over here that is the half of the quarter of this particular pie chart and then we can start the yellow color from that particular point so we have 45° over here from where the yellow color should start so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the blue color is starting at the 0o Dee and then it is ending at the 45° and then the yellow color is starting from the 45th Dee and then it is ending at the 180° over here so guys in this way based on your requirements you can provide the different angles for the different colors that you want to set inside your pie chart so guys in this way you can can easily create the pie chart by using the conic gradient for the background image CSS property apart from this you can also display the Legends for this particular pie chart along with the different values that those Legends represent so guys comment in the comment
