so now we will see text transformation property in CSS so guys basically the text transform property is used to specify the uppercase and the lowercase letters in a text so guys let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so simply I'll remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS file over here and in the HTML file simply we are going to have a tag which is representing the heading two with the help of h2 tag in this case and we will say this is heading two so guys basically we have simply defined the text that is this is heading two over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the h2 tag with the text that is this is heading two now guys let us say we want all the characters that is all the letters inside this heading to be uppercase letters so what we can do is simply inside the style. CSS file we have to define the tag in in this case we will Define h2 tag over here and simply we have the text transform property which is a CSS property that can help us in order to provide the uppercase or the lowercase letters for the text inside the HTML elements so as you can see it has multiple values we have capitalized then we have lower case we have none and then uppercase so guys by default the none value is being applied to all the HTML elements but in case we want all the letters to be uppercase simply we can provide the uppercase value over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see all the characters over here in this case are uppercase and this is the way that we can use the text transform property with the help of the value that is uppercase in this case now guys apart from this let us say we want all the letters to be lower case so what we can do is let's say we have another paragraph over here so simply inside the HTML we will say P tag in this case and we type this is a simple paragraph So guys if you notice we have typed all the letters in the uppercase over here so that we can see how the lowercase value for the text transform will work for this paragraph tag so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see by default all the letters are uppercase over here so what we can do is let's say we want all the letters to be lowercase for this P tag so simply we will provide the P tag over here inside the style. CSS property and again we will be using the text transform property in this case and this time we will be using the value as lower case so when we say lower case all the letters for this text inside the HTML element that is the P tag will be converted to lower case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see all the letters are being displayed as lowercase letters now guys apart from that we have another value that is capitalized so let us check that as well so inside the HTML file in this case let us say we have the div element and this time we will type all the letters in lower case so simply we will say this is a test Dev element so guys over here all the letters are in lower case so this is a test Dev element is the text that we have written inside the dev element let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see all the letters for this div element is in lower case now so what we can do is simply we come to the style. CSS file and for the div tag we want to apply the text transform property so over here we say text transform and this time we select capitalize value so guys what will happen when we say capitalize as the value for the text transform let us check that so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the first letter of of all the words are now being converted to the uppercase letter now so the word that is this is having the first letter as uppercase and then we have this I as the uppercase then we have a as uppercase t is also uppercase and then this D inside the div is also uppercase and the last word that is element is also having the e letter as uppercase letter over here so guys this is the meaning of capitalize value for the text transform which means the first letter in all the words words will be converted to the uppercase letter and it will be displayed on the web page based on your requirements so guys we have seen all the values of the text to transform this is the uppercase value then we have the lowercase value and then we have the capitalized value and in this way you can set the text transform value based on your requirements comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well well the next video that we are going to talk about is text spacing property in CSS so stay tuned
