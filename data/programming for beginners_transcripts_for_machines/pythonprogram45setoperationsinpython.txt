hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to illustrate different set operations so guys python offers a data type called set whose elements must be unique so we cannot have duplicate elements inside the set data type in the Python programming language now it can be used to perform different set operations such as the union of the two sets then we have intersection difference and then symmetric difference so guys all these set operations we are going to check with the examples as well so as you can see these are the certain operators that will be used in order to carry out the set operations the union operation help us in order to get all the elements inside both the sets so as you can see this is the or operator that we can use as the union operator and we have the intersection operator as well which uses the Ampersand operator over here the difference operator as well which uses the hyphen operator over here and then the symmetric difference operation as well which uses this Ray H2 operator so guys let us check this with the help of example as well over here in the vs code so what we will be doing is we will Define the two sets over here the very first set will be the even numbers so over here we will have the even as the variable name followed by equal to and the way that we Define the elements inside the set is by using the open and close curly braces so over here this defines the set so what are the even numbers we will start from 0 and then we have to 4 6 and then eight so guys five number of elements we are going to have inside the one set and then let's say the second set we have the natural numbers over here which starts from 1 up to five so again we will have open and close curly braces and then one two three four five so Guys these are the two sets that we have defined on the other hand if you want to define the list we use the open and close square brackets but in order to define the sets we use the open and close curly braces over here and that is the difference between sets and list now guys simply we can have all these four operations being printed over here so what we will do is simply we will have the print statement and then we will say Union in this case followed by colon and then what we can do is we can use the first variable that is E1 followed by this or operator and then the name of the second set that is natural over here so guys this will help us in order to find the union of these two sets which will have all the numbers that are present inside both the sets and it will not repeat which means let's say this number 2 is common in both the sets but it will be displayed only once while printing this particular statement and that is the meaning of union having all the elements that are present in both the sets over here now similarly we will have the other operations as well so I'll simply copy and paste this line of code multiple number of times so over here we will have intersection so we will say intersection in this case and then we will have the difference as well so I'll just copy this from here and paste this over here instead of Union and then we also have symmetric difference over here so I'll simply copy this and paste this over here now guys the only change that we have to do is we need to change the operators so for intersection we need to use the Ampersand over here so even Ampersand and the natural and then for difference we need to do even minus natural so in the case of intersection operation whatever elements are common in both the sets those elements will be displayed for the difference part only the elements that are present in the A1 but not present in the natural set will be displayed for this even minus natural statement over here and then for the symmetric difference the common elements in both the sets will not be included but all the other elements will be included over here so over here in this case for the symmetric difference we need to use the Rays to operator over here so A1 raised to Natural so Guys these are certain set operations which are very basic so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got the union it is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then eight so basically all the elements that are present in both the sets are being displayed but there are no duplicates over here all the unique elements are being displayed and then in the intersection only the common elements are being displayed which is two and then 4 in this case so 2 and 4 is being displayed the difference means all the elements that are present in the A1 but not in natural so over here we have 0 and Then followed by 6 and then eight so these are the certain elements that are present in the difference operation and then in the symmetric we have 0 1 3 5 6 and then eight so basically whatever common numbers that are present that is 2 and 4 will not be displayed for the symmetric difference operation over here so Guys these are certain set operations that you can carry out while performing the requirements of your project so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and so subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on
