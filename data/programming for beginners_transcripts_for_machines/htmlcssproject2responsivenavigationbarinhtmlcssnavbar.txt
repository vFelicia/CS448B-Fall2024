so guys we are going to create a responsive navigation bar that will look like this that is a horizontal navigation bar over here along with some background color when we get the mouse cursor on this Nave bar items and then when we decrease the width of the screen over here which means when we view this on smaller devices the navigation bar will be converted to the vertical navigation bar over here so guys we will check this with the help of the HTML and the CSS code so guys over here inside the HTML CSS projects folder we are going to create another folder that is navigation bar in this case and then inside the navigation bar folder we are going to have the index.html file and the style. CSS files over here so guys let me just create the style. CSS file as well so guys we have created both the files over here so inside the index.html we are going to have the HTML code so let me just use this Mt abbreviation that is exclamation mark in order to have the default HTML template and then guys for the title part we are going to have the navigation bar as the title of this page and also we are going to link this style PSS file with the help of this link tag over here now apart from this inside the body tag we are going to define the HTML elements so what we are going to do is let's say we have the diff tag with the class Nave bar over here so simply we are going to create the diff tag with the class that is na bar in this case and then guys inside this we we are going to have more diff tags that are going to have the navigation bar item so guys simply we are going to create the diff tag with the class item over here inside which we are going to have the a tag with the hge character s the hre and the first element that we have for our navigation bar is the home so basically this is the first item inside the navigation bar and similarly we are going to have multiple items over here so let's say we have the second item as Blog then the third item as videos and then the fourth items say languages that are programming languages over here let me just save this file now and click on this go live icon that can help us in order to display the web page on the browser so guys this can be done with the help of the live server extension on the vs code so if you see on the web browser over here these are the four items that we want to include inside a navigation bar now Guys these are looking just like simple links on the web page but we want to convert it into to a horizontal navigation bar and when we reduce the width of the screen over here the navigation bar should be updated to a vertical navigation bar so we will check that as well with the help of the media queries over here so guys simply we have to go inside the style. CSS file in order to actually make this Nave bar class look like a navigation bar so over here what we will do is simply we are going to provide certain CSS properties for the class name that is naar so we need to provide a DOT character followed by the class name that is Navar over here and then guys inside this let us have certain background color first of all so we will have a dark background color that is black color over here and then apart from this we also want to make the display equal to Flags so that all the items inside the Nave bar class that are these tags over here must be displayed in a row by default guys when we provide the display equal to flex over here by default the flex direction is and all the elements will be displayed in one row over here so when we save this file now and check the changes on the browser as you can see we have the black color as the background color in this case and also we have all the links over here that are getting displayed with the blue color over here guys we are going to make certain changes for these diff tags so what we have to do is simply we will use the class name that is item since the item class name is representing all the diff tags over here that is individual item inside the flex container so guys simply we have to provide this item class over here and first of all we will provide the padding of 10 pixels in this case and then apart from this what we want to do is all the a tags inside this item class must have some CSS properties so we are going to define the item class and then all the a tags inside the item so we are going to use the a selector over here first of all we will have the text decoration as none so that we don't don't have any underline for any of the text that are getting displayed apart from this we will also change the font color to white color so instead of the blue color that is getting displayed over here the white color must be displayed for all these characters so guys let me just save this file now and check the changes so as you can see these are the changes that are getting displayed over here so guys basically this is a very simple navigation bar that we have just created now what we will do is when we get the mouse cursor on any of these diff tags over here we want to change the background color for that particular diff tag that is the navigation bar item so since the diff tag is represented with the help of this item class over here I'm going to copy this item class and then we need to provide the hover sudo class over here for which we want to change the background color so guys we will change the background color to red color in this case when the user gets the mouse cursor on the diff Tex with the class item so let me just save this file now and let us see the changes so as you can see when we get the mouse cursor over here the background color for the diff tags are now getting updated to the red color and this is how the user will be able to get the feedback that he or she will be able to click on that particular navigation bar item now guys you will notice there is certain space on the left hand side and on top of this navigation bar that's because by default certain margin is provided to the body tag over here so simply we will provide the body tag tag in this case and then let me just provide the margin is equal to Auto and also padding is equal to Auto and then apart from this we will also provide the Box sizing CSS property as border box over here so guys it is a best practice in order to provide these three lines of code at the start of the CSS file so that there is no margin and padding that is provided by default to any of the HTML elements that we are going to Define on our web page and then apart from this when we say box ing equal to border box so any of the padding or the Border spaces that are included for the HTML elements the width and height that is taken by those parameters that is borders and padding will be also included as part of the width and height of the HTML elements so guys that is one of the important aspect when you are designing your web page so when we save this file now you will notice that there is no space on the left hand side and on top of this particular navigation bar right now so guys if you want to add more navigation bar items over here simply you have to come inside the HTML file and you can simply copy paste these lines of code in this case and then guys simply we can provide some more items as far as navigation bar items are concerned so let's say we provide the contact tab over here and then apart from this we will also provide about us option in this case and let us also provide certain programming languages so over here we can provide Java for which I have created a separate playlist if you want to learn more about Java Java tutorial and the Java programs as well I have provided the links to the playlist in the description section below apart from this I have also created the playlist for the Python programming language so you can watch out those videos as well the links I have given in the description section below so guys when we save this file now if you notice there are more items that are getting displayed over here on the navigation bar so guys in this way we can simply create a navigation bar using the display equal to flex and the other CSS properties that we have just seen now guys the problem in this particular navigation bar right now is it is a horizontal navigation bar and when we decrease the width of the screen so let's say I have opened the console section over here and when we decrease the width as you can see some of the items are now going on the right hand side and now at the bottom of the screen we are getting the horizontal scroll bar over here guys this is not one of the best practices as far as designing web page is concerned so what we can do is simply we can see what is the maximum width so as you can see over here we are decreasing the width and somewhere over here around 550 pixels the horizontal navigation bar is looking fine in this case and then guys after this when we reduce the size more you can see that it is trying to reduce its size let's say at around 500 pixels or less we want the navigation bar to be displayed as a vertical navigation bar so guys what we can do is simply we can use the media query over here so how do we do that so inside the style. CSS file we we will use media query in this case so we use media screen over here and after this we use the end keyword and then inside the parenthesis we use the max width in this case so guys we need to provide the max width of 500 pixels and then inside the curly braces what we have to do is since we have provided the display equal to flex for the Nave bar over here simply I'm going to copy these lines of code in this case and paste it inside the media screen and then guys we want want this Nave bar to have the flex direction as column so by default the flex direction is Row in this case so simply I'm going to provide the flex Direction instead of the other CSS properties and we are going to change it to column over here so guys whenever the width of the screen is 500 pixels or below the flex Direction equal to column will be implemented for that particular naar class over here which is the navigation bar so let me just save this file now and when we decrease the width of the screen now so as you can see below 500 pixels the navigation bar is looking like a vertical navigation bar right now so guys in this way we can easily use the media query in order to convert the navigation bar from horizontal to vertical or visce Versa and then apart from this we have already implemented the other hover properties and the background color changes as well guys based on your requirements you can provide your own CSS properties in the the same code in this case so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well I'll see you in the next video in which we are going to create more HTML and CSS projects so stay tuned
