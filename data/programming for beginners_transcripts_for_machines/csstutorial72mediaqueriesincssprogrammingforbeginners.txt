so now we will see media queries in CSS so guys basically the at media rule introduced in CSS 2 made it possible to define the different style rules for different media types and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well there are different types of media over here as you can see the first type is all which is used for all media type devices apart from this we also have the print value which is used for the print preview mode and then the most commonly used that is the screen value which is used for the computer screens tablets smartphones Etc so guys basically we are going to check the examples with the screen media type over here and basically the important implementation of this media queries is used in such a way that when you want to provide different CSS properties for smaller screen devices such as smartphones or the tablets you can use the media queries over here which we are going to check with the help of examples now guys the commonly used media features are orientation then we have have Max height and Min height apart from this we also have the max width and Min width over here so guys let us check the examples of the media queries so let us move to the vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files in this case now guys what we are going to do is when we are going to reduce the screen width that is towards the tablets or towards the smartphone screen with we are going to change the background color with the help of the media rule over here so guys let us check this feature over here so inside the body tag we are simply going to have the diff tag over here and simply we are going to have some random text in this case with 10 words over here so guys basically this is the Mt abbreviation that helps us in order to Generate random text let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have the diff tag with the simple text over here now guys we are going to provide a different background color for the body tag in this case originally so let us have the background color CS this property and let's say we have the value as equa for the body tag over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we have the background color for the body tag in this case now guys let me quickly open the console over here so when we are going to increase or decrease the width over here in this case as you can see these are the numbers that is the width and height that are getting displayed over here for this particular screen so guys by default we have this particular background color that is aqua over here but we are going to decrease the screen width and let's say below 500 pixels of the width we want to change the background color of the body to yellow color over here so we can simply use the media query in this case so let us check that as well so inside the style. CSS file we are going to use at theate character over here and simply we are going to use the media so guys this is the keyword that we are going to use and Then followed by the space character we can simply omit this particular option that is screen option over here or we can provide this value so that the media query is applied only to the computer screens tablets and smartphones and other types of screen so guys basically we are going to provide the value that is screen over here and then followed by the end keyword and then inside the open and close parenthesis we want the max width to be 500 pixels over here so guys below 500 pixels we want the background color to be updated which is not updating right now so currently it is 601 pixels that we can see so simply we are going to set the max width it is equal to 500 pixels so guys inside this we are going to provide the body tag over here for which we are going to set the background color as yellow color over here so guys what is the meaning of this media query so simply we are using the media keyword after the etherate character and Then followed by the media type that is screen over here and then followed by the end character and the meaning of this Max width is basically 500 pixels is the maximum value for the screen width over here so any screens that are below 500 pixels should have the background color as yellow for the body tag over here so let's say we have any of the smartphone in this case or the tablet which is having the width below 500 pixels for that particular screen the background color will be displayed as yellow and the screen width which is more than 500 pixels such as for the desktop computers for that particular device we are going to have the background color as Aqua so guys let us check this let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that currently we have the default value that is equa but when we reduce the screen width as you can see we have moved to 572 pixels over here and then we are reducing it towards the 500 pixels slowly so we are reducing it so currently it is 5.67 and when we reduce it next as you can see the background color is now updated to yellow color so guys simply in this way we can reduce the screen width and test this particular met query over here and whatever device is having the width below 500 pixels will have the background color as yellow for this particular page that is getting displayed and when we increase the width over here above 500 pixels again the background color is updated to aqua color over here so guys this is the main functionality of having the media queries it helps us in order to provide the certain CSS properties to different devices that are having different screen width or the screen height as well so guys the other parameters that we can use is orientation then we have the height as well which involves Max and Min height and then we also have width which is Max width and Min width in which case we are currently using the max width over here apart from this we can also have another condition over here so let's say we want the max width to be 300 pixels and Below 300 pixels we want some other background color so let me just copy these lines of code over here and we are going to have similar media query but this time we are going to have the max width equal to 300 pixels in this case so whatever devices that are having the screen withd lesser than 300 pixels should have some other background color so let's say we have this chart reuse background color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser So currently we have the aqua color that is the default color which will be displayed on the desktop computers and then let's say when we reduce the screen width to below 500 pixels it is having the yellow background color which will probably correspond to the tablet screen size and then let's say we have Max withd equal to 300 pixels which might correspond to some of the smartphone devices so let us say we go beyond the 300 pixels which means we are reducing the screen width to lesser than 300 pixels over here so as you can see we have a different background color over here now guys let us say when we move towards this particular width that is below 300 pixels we want to hide this particular diff tag so what we can do is simply in inside the same media query we can have the diff tag that will help us in order to identify this particular diff tag inside the body tag over here and simply we can provide the display property equal to none so guys basically what this will do is when the screen withth is below 300 pixels the diff tag will be hidden over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see we are below 300 pixels that's why we cannot see the diff tag over here so currently we have the screen width of more than 500 pixels over here let us reduce it to below 500 pixels as you can see we have the yellow color and the diff tag is getting displayed now let us reduce to less than 300 pixels over here as far as the screen width is concerned so as you can see when we move from 305 over here to 298 this the background color is updated to the Chart reuse color and the diff tag is getting hidden over here so guys in this way we can simply use the media queries in order to provide the different CSS properties as far as as far as the screen width orientation or the height is concerned so guys comment in the comment
