so now we will see assignment operators in JavaScript so guys below are some of the assignment operators in JavaScript and basically we have the very simple operator that is equal to in order to either assign the Direct Value to a variable or to copy the value from one variable to another variable so as you can see X is equal to Y this is one example over here now guys apart from this we also have another operator that is plus equal to so this time what will happen is as you can see this is the way that we can use plus and equal to operator over here so this is same as x = x + y so guys over here let us say we want to add two numbers that is X and Y and we want to store the result in the first variable that is X so simply what we do is X it is equal to x + y over here so on the right hand side we find the addition of the two numbers and on the left hand side we are assigning the value of the addition to the first variable itself that is X now guys there is a shorthand method in order to achieve the same task that is by combining the plus operator and the equal to operator and the same thing we are doing over here so we say x it is + equal and then y over here which is going to have the same effect that is X is = x + y and then similarly we have minus and equal to operator that is x y it is going to be assigned to X over here so simply we can say x equal to Y over here and similarly we can find the values by using the other operators as well so guys let us check all these with the help of example in vs code over here so what we will do is let us simply have the variable that is X this time and we will say xit is equal to 10 over here we will have another variable that is y it is equal to 20 this time and let us add both the numbers and assign it to the first variable that is X so simply we are going to say x it is equal to x + y over here now guys let us print the value of x this time so simply we are going to have the console. log statement over here inside which we are going to have the back text and then we will say value of x is equal to followed by dollar and then we have the open and close curly braces and then we will have the variable name that is X this time so guys basically we have done X + Y which is 10 + 20 which is equal to 30 and the value 30 is being assigned to this variable X so this statement must print the value of x which is equal to 30 this time so when we save this file now and try running this code on the terminal over here so as you can see value of x it is equal to 30 this time so this is the very basic arithmetic operation that we have covered now guys what we can do is we can use the shorthand method over here so I will comment out this line of code and again we will rewrite this particular line of code over here by using the shorthand method so what is the shorthand method we first write the X variable in which we want to store the result followed by the space character and then we have the plus operator followed by the equal to operator this time and then followed by the space character and then we have the Y variable over here so guys basically this is nothing but X is equal to X + Y which we have already commented out over here so basically the meaning of this is X it is equal to x + y but this is the Shand method that we are using so when we save this file now and try running this code once again on the terminal so as you can see value of x it is equal to 30 This Time by using this particular shorthand method now instead of having the plus operator we can have the minus operator as well so over here we say xus it is equal to Y over here so this is nothing but X is equal to x Y this time which means 10 20 which is equal to 10 when we save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see value of x it is equal to 10 over here and in this way we can use the shorthand method as far as the subtraction of two numbers are concerned similarly we can do the multiplication as well so if we want to do X is equal to X * by y simply we can do x * y equal to Y over here when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here so you can see value of x it is equal to 200 because 10 * 20 it is equal to 200 over here apart from this we can also use the division operator over here so if we want to do x / y over here and store it inside the X variable simply you can say x / equal to Y over here so when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see value of x is equal to 0.5 because 10 / 20 it is equal to 0.5 this time similarly we can find the remainder of two numbers as well so if we want to do x per Y in which case we are going to do x / y this time and we are going to find the remainder so simply we can say x% equal to Y so 10 ided by 20 the quotient will be zero and the remainder must be 10 and the value of 10 must be displayed over here on the output so as you can see value of x it is equal to 10 and then we have another operator over here that is exponentiation which means X ra to the power of Y over here so guys basically if we want to do X ra to the power of Y this time and store it to the variable that is X over here so simply we can say x followed by space character and then 2 * star character over here followed by equal 2 and then we say y over here and the result will be stored on the left hand side variable that is X this time so let just save this file now let us see what will be the result for 10 ra to the power of 20 this time so when we run this code once again over here as you can see 10 to the^ of 20 we are getting the result over here now guys when we change the values in this case let us say we have X it is equal to 3 and Y again is equal to 3 so what will be the output of X ra to the power of Y over here when both the values are three over here so guys comment in the comment section below what will be the answer of this particular operation over here and what value will will be present inside the variable X let us see whether your answer is correct or not so please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and
