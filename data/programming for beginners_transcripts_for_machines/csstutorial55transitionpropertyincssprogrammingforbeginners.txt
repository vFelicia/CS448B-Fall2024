so now we will see transition property in CSS so guys basically the CSS transition allows you to change the property values smoothly over a given duration so guys so far we have seen how we can transform a particular HTML element with the help of the translate rotate or the scale functions inside the CSS but guys those changes were made in such a way that there was no smooth transitioning over here so guys for example if I show you over here if we see the translate X function and let's say we provide 50 pixels of translate X over here so basically what will happen is it is directly moving on the right hand side by 50 pixels and there is no smooth transitioning that is happening from the original position to the Target position over here so guys we will check the entire HTML and the CSS code with the help of example and we are going to make the smooth transition that will work over here so guys what we do is simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the CSS files over here we are going to start from scratch and we are going to see how the transitions will work so basically in order to create a transition effect you must specify two things so what are those two things so the very first important thing is the CSS property you want to add an effect two and the second important thing is the duration of the effect so guys we will check the example now over here we are going to increase the width smoothly in 2 seconds for a particular HTML element so guys over here inside the body tag simply we are going to have the diff tag over here and for this diff tag let us Define certain CSS properties so let's say we have the width of 100 pixels and the height as well of 100 pixels over here so basically we are going to have the square box with the help of this drift tag and apart from this let us also provide the border of two pixels with the black color in this case so basically we have the Border style is solid and the Border color is black now apart from this let us also have the background color as yellow color this time and also we will get this div HTML element at the center of the screen so basically we are going to use the margin equal to Auto so this will get the diff tag at the center of the screen as far as the horizontal direction is concerned and for the vertical Direction let's say we provide the top margin as 15% over here so let me just save this now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the square diff tag that we can see right now so guys what we will do is let's say we want to rotate this particular diff tag by 45° so simply we can use the transform property that we had used previously and we can say rotate by 45° over here so basically the value that we have provided is 45 D which stands for degrees let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see it is rotated by 45° what we will do is we will apply the CSS property on Mouse over so basically we want to use the div tag followed by colon and then we will use the codo class that is hover so we are going to paste this transform property so when the user gets the mouse that is the cursor on this particular diff tag then only the transform property should be applied so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is the original position and when the user gets the mouse on this particular diff tag it is rotating itself but guys if you notice there is no smooth rotation over here basically from the original position it is getting the target position that is rotated at the 45° over here without any smooth transitioning so we are going to apply the smooth transition with the help of the transition property inside CSS so we must have the two important things so first of all the CSS property that we want to use so in this case we are going to have the transform CSS property and Then followed by the duration of the effect so guys basically how do we do that so inside the diff tag over here simply we have to use the transition CSS property this time and the very first parameter will be the CSS property that we want to use so in this case it is going to be transform over here and then followed by the space character and let's say we want to rotate it in 2 seconds and not instantly as it is happening by default so guys over here simply we have to provide 2 s which stands for 2 seconds over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again over here so with the help of this particular CSS property what will happen is this diff tag that is the square box will rotate itself with the help of the 45° but this will happen in 2 seconds so it will look like a smooth rotation over here so let me just reload this page once again and when we get the mouse cursor on this sff tag as you can see it is a smooth rotation that is happening over here and when we get the mouse cursor away from this diff tag again it is a smooth transition that is rotation towards its original position over here so guys in this way this is the transition CSS property that we can use in order to provide the smooth rotation or any of the properties that we want to implement in a smooth way so guys let us check another example over here we can also add the multiple properties to the transition so guys notice that we also have another property that is width over here which is 100 pixels so let's say during this transform that is the rotation we also want to increase the width to 200 pixels over here so what we can do is simply we can provide comma after this 2 seconds and we have to provide the CSS property that we want to change that is width in this case and let's say with that same duration of 2 seconds we want to increase the width now guys how much we want to increase the width that we need to provide on this hover property over here so basically we want to change the width to 200 pixels this time which is the double value of this 100 pixels which is the original width of the square box so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now when we get the cursor on this particular square box what will happen is the transform will happen in 2 seconds which will rotate the box and also it is going to increase the width within 2 seconds over here to 200 pixels simultaneously so both these things will happen simultaneous L over here in the span of 2 seconds in this case so let me just reload this page once again on the browser and when we get the cursor over here so as you can see in 2 seconds the square box got rotated to 45° as well and apart from that the width also increased to 200 pixels and now it is a rectangle that we can see and when we get the mouse cursor away from this HTML element as you can see it is coming back to its original position over here so guys in this way we can apply the multi mle transition properties over here and we need to provide the values to these CSS properties over here on the hover or any other condition that you want to implement based on the project requirement so guys apart from this we can also have the transition timing function property which is another property that you can mention over here so guys basically when you type transition as you can see this is the CSS property over here that is the timing function so we have multiple values that you can use over here so basically when we we provide the value of e it will start slowly and then in between it will move faster and then in the end the transition will end slowly so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser when we get the cursor over here as you can see in the middle it was very fast and at the start and at the end it was very slow over here so guys this is the meaning of E's value in this case we can also provide linear in which case the speed of the transition will be same throughout the span so guys over here there will be no slow start or slow end so let us check that as well so when we reload this page as you can see this is the linear transition that we can see over here so guys you can check out the other values for this particular transition timing function as you can see these are the list of suggested values over here and then guys apart from this we also have something called as transition delay which will help us in order to delay the transition so guys let us check that as well so over here what we are going to do is simply I'll comment out this line of code and basically we are going to have this transition delay CSS property so guys basically it is going to delay the transition so let's say we provide 2 seconds of DeLay So basically the transition is not going to start up to 2 seconds and then after that the transition will start that we have already mentioned over here so let me just save this file now and when we reload this page once again on the browser and let's get the cursor over here so 1 2 so after 2 seconds the transition is happening over here here and when we get the cursor away again after 2 seconds the transition will occur in such a way that the HTML element will go back to its original position so guys in this way you can also provide the transition delay based on the project requirements where you want to delay the transition for that particular HTML element guys while doing so can we change the background color as well so let us check that as well so what we will do is over here let us remove the delay as well and after this width we are going to Pro provide the background color property as well and within 2 seconds we want to change so the original color is the yellow color over here let us change the color to some other value so let's say we have the background color as aqua color this time so guys we are moving from yellow color to the aqua color and within the span of 2 seconds over here the color should change so guys let me just save this file now it will be a gradual change if you can see so let me just reload this page once again on the browser so when we get the cursor over here as you can see the color is also changing to Aqua gradually from yellow to Aqua and then when we get the cursor back from this particular rectangle right now that is the HTML element the color should change back from Aqua to Yellow so guys over here as you can see gradually it is also changing the background color so guys whatever CSS properties that you want to change you need to provide inside the transition CSS property and then apart from that you have to provide the time du duration during which the CSS property should get updated over here and the final value should be applied and when that CSS property will update its value the transition will be applied to the HTML element we can also have the different timings over here as well so let's say we want to finish the background color transition within 1 second so we have provided 1 second over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so now if you notice the aqua color has completed its transition within 1 second over here and this is the way that you can provide the different times for the transition that you have applied for the transition CSS property so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that
