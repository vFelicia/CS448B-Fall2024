welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about making text bold in HTML using the B tag so guys basically you must have used bold formatting feature of the word processor now similarly we can have such formatting in HTML documents as well so in order to make the text as bold over here anything that appears between the B tag as you can see it is the less than symbol followed by the B character and then the greater than symbol and then we have the same ending tag over here which is having the forward slash before the character and in between both the starting and ending tags we have certain content now in between both these tags whatever content is present it will be appearing as the Bold text which means we want to get certain attention of the user while showing this content over here now guys we can also use the strong tag in the HTML 5 for bold appearance which shows importance so guys let us check this with the help of examples now in the VSS code I'll just remove these lines of code that were written previously and inside the body tag we will have a simple paragraph using the P tag we will see this text is bold in this paragraph So guys this is a simple paragraph and it will be displayed normally on the browser I'll just change this title to formatting over here since we are going to see the formatting examples in HTML so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the web browser so as you can see it is saying this text is bold in this paragraph now guys so far we have not used the B tag over here and this is a simple paragraph now let's say we want to make this highlighted text that is text is bold to appear as bold text so what we have to do is we need to enclose this text within the starting and the ending B tag so before this text we are going to have the less than symbol and then we will say B so as you can see the B element represents a span P of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate Voice or mode so guys basically it doesn't show any extra importance but only to draw the attention to this particular phrase we can use the B text over here and then after this character we can have the greater than symbol and then the same ending tag I'm going to cut this and paste it after this bold word over here so guys basically text is bold these three words are enclosed inside the B tag over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again before reloading you can see that this is a simple paragraph now after reloading we will check what happens so when we press on reload this page you can see text is bold appearance is changed now it is drawing the attention of the user by showing it as bold over here and guys this is the way that we can use the B tag now guys similarly we can also use the strong long tag over here let me just copy this line of code and paste this over here and what we will do is instead of using the B tag we will use the strong tag so as you can see the strong element represents strong importance seriousness or urgency for its content so we are going to use this tag over here and then I'll just cut this ending tag and then paste this over here instead of the ending tag of the B I will say text is bold so guys basically the content of both the paragraphs is same but we are having the strong tag over here instead of the P tag so let us see how it will be appeared so we will just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see it says this text is bold in this paragraph So guys there is no difference as far as appearance of both the paragraphs is concerned it's just that the meaning behind the scenes for this text is bold is not that important compared to what we have used over here in the this text is strong over here so basically we will have to change this text to this text is strong since we are using the strong tag guys it depends on you what text you want to make bold or strong but this is the main importance that to seek users attention to certain keywords on your web page we can either use bold or strong text based on our requirements so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is making the text itally sized in HTML so stay tuned
