so now we will see ordered list in HTML so guys HTML ordered list is used to group a set of related items in list and they will be having a particular order in which we Define them now guys an ordered list starts with the o tag over here so we have the less than symbol followed by o which is ordered list and Then followed by the greater than symbol and then inside the list each list item starts with the Alli tag in this case so guys the list items will be marked with numbers by default so let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so guys previously we had return the unordered list items in this case and this is how the unordered list items looks on the web browser now guys what we will be doing is we will Define the ordered list as well below this unordered list so simply we are going to have a paragraph and then we will say below content is in ordered list we have a very simil simple statement that is below content is in ordered list now guys we can simply use the o tag over here so when we type O as you can see this is the starting o tag and the ending o tag so in between these o tags we will be defining our list items so we can simply have the Ali starting and the ending tag over here and then guys let's say we want to have the list of programming languages over here in a particular order so let's say we Define the first list item as python and then we copy and paste this line of code to the remaining lines and then let's say we have another programming language that is Java and then let's say we have C++ over here and then let's say we have dot in this case guys we have taken these programming languages just for the example to show how the list items will be displayed in the ordered list it doesn't mean that python is ranked number one over here and Java is ranked number two over here this is just for the example purpose and all of the programming languages have their own advantages and disadvantages so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the paragraph that is below content is in ordered list and then we have all the programming languages that we have listed python Java C++ and Dot so guys as I have told you this is not the rankings that we are giving to the programming languages you can learn based on your interest and each and every programming language have their own advantages and disadvantages an ages and if you want to learn more about Python and Java programming languages I have created lot of videos related to the tutorials of these programming languages along with it we have also covered multiple Python and Java programs with the help of examples so guys you can watch all those videos which I have added in the playlist the links I have given Below in the description section so guys this is a way in order to display the ordered list in this case wherein by default we get the numbers that is 1 2 3 4 and so on based on the number of list items in this case now guys we can also have the type attribute inside the o tag in order to mention how the list items should be displayed so by default as you can see over here the numbers are being displayed in this case but we can also have letters over here so let's say if you want to display all these programming languages with the help of the upper case characters so what we have to do is inside the o tag we have something called as type attribute so as you can see it indicates the numbering type so it can be a lowercase letter or the uppercase letter or it can also have the Roman numerals as well so over here right now we will be using the uppercase letter in this case so let's say we provide capital A over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the programming languages are being numbered with the uppercase characters that is a b c d D and so on so guys similarly we can have the lowercase characters as well over here we need to provide the type that is lowercase a in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have a b c d and so on the lowercase letters are being displayed and these are used as the numbers for the ordered list we can also have the Roman numbers as well so let's say we provide capital I over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see these are the Roman numbers 1 2 3 4 and so on based on the number of the list items all the Roman numbers will be displayed over here in the ordered list now guys apart from this we also have the start attribute of the o tag so guys let us move to the default numbering system over here so we will change this type value to one in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so we are getting 1 2 3 4 and so on but guys let's say if you want to start with some other number let's say we want to start with the fifth number over here so what we can do is for the o tag we have the start attribute so over here we can provide the start attribute as you can see this integer attribute specifies the start value for the numbering of the individual list items so we can say that whatever value we provide to this start attribute from that value the list items will start so let's say provide the number five in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the numbering is starting from the number that is five and then we have 6 7 8 and so on so guys in this way we can easily use the start attribute as well in order to start the ordered list from a particular number now guys we can also have the nested ordered list as well so inside one of the list items we can have another ordered list so let's say inside inside the Java list in this case we want another ordered list over here so what we can do is after the ending tag of this Java list item we come over here and then we provide the ordered list tag that is O and then we again Define the list items and then let's say we want to define the Java versions 19 and 20 so over here we will say Java version 19 and then we will have another list item and then we will say Java version 20 in this case as the second list item inside the nested ordered list over here within Java list item so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see inside this Java list item we have two more elements that we have defined which is again an ordered list over here that is being numbered as 1 and two and it is saying Java version 19 and Java version 20 in this case so guys in this way we can also have the the nested ordered list over here and based on our requirements we can also have images and other links over here inside of the simple text that we have defined in this ordered list and if you want to have the unordered list over here we can do that as well so instead of using the o tag in this case we can use the UL tag over here which defines the unordered list so we have changed the starting and the ending tag to the unordered list in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now a small circle is being displayed instead of the numbers over here which is the unordered list that we have defined inside the nested order list so Guys these are certain ways in order to display the ordered list and the nested ordered list as well comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that
