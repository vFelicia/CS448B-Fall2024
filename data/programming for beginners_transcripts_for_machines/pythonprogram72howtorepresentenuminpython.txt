welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to represent enum so guys we can easily represent enum in Python using the enum module and the class as well so let us move to the vs code over here the very first thing that we will be doing is from the enum module we will be importing the enum class so we import enum over here so guys basically this is the way in order to import one particular class from a module so as you can see we use the from keyword followed by the name of the module that is enum in this case and then we are importing just one class that is enum over here and then guys let's say we want to Define our own enum so we will say class over here and let's say we want to define the list of days so over here we will give the name of the class as day and then inside the open and close brackets we will provide this enum class over here and then guys after colon we need to define the name and value page over here so let's say we have the name as Monday which is one of the days in the week and the value that we give to this particular name that is Monday it is 1 over here and then guys we can have another name that is Tuesday which is another day of the week and the value that we gave is 2 in this case and then we have Wednesday over here and then the value that we gave is 3 and so on we can have the name value page over here in this case guys you can have any name where you pass based on your requirements over here but this is one of the ways in order to Define enums in Python now guys how do we access this so basically we can simply use the print statement over here so we say print and then in order to print one of the members of the enum we can simply use this day variable over here so we say day followed by Dot and then we have let's say if we want to print the member that is Monday over here so we will simply use Monday in this case so this is the expression that is the name of the class and then followed by Dot and then the name of the enum over here in order to print the inner member so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see it says day dot Monday that is being printed over here now guys let us say we only want to print the left hand side that is the name of the enum over here so what we will be doing is again let's say we have another print statement and then we will say day followed by Dot and then Monday that is one of the names over here followed by Dot and then we have something called as name in this case so guys this is the attribute that can be used in order to print just the value of the name of the enum over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting Monday that is a name of the enum which is Monday over here now let us say we want to find the value of that particular name that is Monday so what we can do is instead of having the name we can have the value so what we will do is over here only we will have comma and then we will have hyphen over here so on the same line we will give the value as well so we will use a day again followed by Dot and for the my Monday name we want to get the value so after Monday we specify dot followed by value in this case so guys basically this value will help us in order to get the right hand side value of this particular inner member so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got a Monday and then followed by hyphen and then one that is the value of this enum which is having the name value pairs as Monday and 1 respectively so same way we can get the name value page of Wednesday as well so over here instead of Monday we can simply provide Wednesday over here I'll simply copy and paste this for the value as well so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got the name as Wednesday and the value is 3 this time so guys this is the way that we can represent e num in Python programming language please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video you that we are going to talk about is Python program to return multiple values from a function so stay tuned
