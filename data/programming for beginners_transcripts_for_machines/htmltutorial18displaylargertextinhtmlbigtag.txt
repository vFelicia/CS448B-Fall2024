welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about larger text in HTML using the big tag so guys basically the content of the starting page and the ending big tag is displayed one font larger than the rest of the text surrounding it so guys let us check this with the help of example now in the vs code so what we will do is simply we will have another paragraph over here using the peak tag and then we will say this text is big in this paragraph So guys we have a simple statement in this new paragraph over here this text is big in this paragraph so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this text is built in this paragraph now guys what we will do is we will have the text is Big that is these three words appear one font size larger than the rest of the text so what we have to do is we need to enclose these three words within the big tag over here so we will move to the vs code and then and we will say big in this case so this is the big tag that we can use so basically as you can see since the font color of this tag is red the stack is deprecated in the newer versions of the browser but guys still it can work in certain browsers so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so as you can see the text is big it is being displayed as one font size larger compared to the other text in the same paragraph now guys if we see what exactly is happening behind the scenes we can simply right click over here and we can use the inspect option so when we use the inspect option you can see under elements the paragraph is being displayed over here using the P tags and inside this we have this text is big in this paragraph now these three words are being enclosed within the big tag over here and the big tag is being given the font size as larger and this is what is happening behind the scenes the larger value for the font size is making these words appear bigger than the other text in the same paragraph now guys since this tag is deprecated it is recommended that we use the style attribute over here now how do we use the style attribute only for these three words so we will remove these tag first of all and then we can have this pen tag over here so instead of the big tag we can have the span tag so we say spam and then we have the closings pen tag over here after the backward in this case and then we say this text back so guys basically what we have done is we have enclosed the text is Big these three words within the span tag now what will happen after this let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see this is a normal paragraph now but since we have used the span tag it is used in order to group certain words and apply certain styles to these words over here so what we can do is insert this pen tag we can have the style attribute in this case and the style can have the font size so guys what we have seen is the font size value was larger so over here we will again provide larger value for the font size and then let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again so now we can see that text is big is appearing as one font size larger compared to the other text in the same paragraph So guys this is the replacement of the big tag that we have seen just now either we can use the big tag or in the newer versions of the browser we can also use the span tag and along with that we can use the style attribute over here we are going to learn more about the style attribute and what are the different properties and the values that we can have inside the style attribute in the upcoming videos as well so please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is smaller text in HTML using small tag so stay tuned
