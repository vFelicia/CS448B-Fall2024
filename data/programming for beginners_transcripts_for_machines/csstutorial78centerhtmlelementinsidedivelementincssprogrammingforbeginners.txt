so now we will see how to center the HTML element inside the diff tag in CSS so guys basically one of the problems of centering the HTML elements inside the div elements can be solved by using the flexbox layout and we are going to check with the help of example as well so let us move to the vs code over here and simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had return in the HTML and the CSS files so guys over here first of all we are going to define the diff tag with the class container in this case and then inside this we are going to have a simple diff tag that will say this is a simple diff tag so guys we have a very simple statement over here inside the container class let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is a simple diff tag is getting displayed over here now guys let us have certain background color for the container class and also the diff tag that is the child tag over here so we are going to copy this class name and then inside the st. CSS file we are going to provide the background color over here so let's say we have the yellow color is the background color apart from this we will also provide the padding of let's say 20 pixels in this case and then guys for the child tag over here inside the container class we are going to define the diff tag in this case and then we will say the background color of let's say aqua color over here and again we are going to provide the padding of let's say 10 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the container tag that is having the yellow background color is going from left to right and it is taking the entire width of the screen over here apart from this the child tag that is having the aqua background color is also going from left to right and it is taking the entire width of the screen now guys what we will do is we will reduce the width of this child tag over here and we will set it only up to this required width that is required by the content of this D tag so ins this diff tag that is the child tag over here simply we are going to provide the display property and we will say inline block as the value so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see only the required width is now being taken by this particular diff tag that's because the default value of the diff tag as far as display CSS property is the block value so when we say block which means it is going to take the entire width that is from left to right over here but we are limiting that width by using the inline block value for the display property now guys what is the scenario over here is we want to Center align this particular diff tag as far as the container is concerned so we need to get this child diff tag at the center of the container let us have another situation over here we will also have the height of this container so let's say we provide the height as 300 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the height of the container is 300 pixels over here so how do we get this particular diff tag at the center of the container somewhere over here so let us try that so what we will do is first of all let us provide the text align CSS property we will check out different scenarios how we can achieve our task of getting the child diff tag at the center of the container so when we say text align equal to Center let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see now this diff tag is present at the center as far as the horizontal alignment is concerned but how do we get it at the center as far as the vertical alignment is concerned another CSS property that we can use is using the line height over here and we can set the value equal to the height of the container that we have set over here so simply we will set the value as 300 pixels so that the line height of the container is exactly the same as the height of the container over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have provided the line height of 300 pixel the text is also coming at the center of the container now but we can see that there is a background color that is running from the top to the bottom of the container which is not required in this case so guys this is a limitation of using the line height over here along with it we have also used the text align CSS property so we don't want it in this way so let me just comment out these two lines of code over here so now we are back to our original position that is top left over here so guys we can simply use the flex boox layout in order order to Center align the diff tag over here so let us try that so for the container class what we are going to do is simply we will set the display property as Flex over here now guys since we have set the display property as Flex all the child items inside the container will be the flex items now and they will be running from left to right by default because the flex direction is row by default for any of the flex container so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the background color is now going from top to bottom over here in this case let us provide another CSS property that is justify content for this Flex container which will Define the horizontal alignment as far as Flex items is concerned so guys we will set the value as Center because we want the flex item that is this particular diff tag at the center as far as horizontal alignment is concerned so when we reload this page now as you can see the flex item is now at the center as far as the hor horizontal alignment is concerned now as far as vertical alignment is concerned we can use the Align content CSS property which will help us in order to align the flex items across the cross AIS over here so guys since the flex direction is row by default the justify content will help us in order to align the items on the main AIS which is going from left to right over here and the Align content will help us in order to align the items across the cross AIS which is going from top to bottom botom or the vertical AIS over here so we have just set the value as center for the Align content over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see there is no change right now that's because we have done a mistake instead of using the Align content it is align items that we must use so because basically align items will help us in order to align the flex items as far as the cross AIS is concerned in which case it is the vertical AIS over here so when we save this file now ENT reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now we have perfectly aligned the diff tag at the center of the container and this is the way that you can Center align the HTML element inside the container by using the flexbox layout over here so Guys these are the three important CSS properties that you must use that is display is equal to flex and then justify content is equal to Center and the Align items is equal to Center over here inside the flex container
