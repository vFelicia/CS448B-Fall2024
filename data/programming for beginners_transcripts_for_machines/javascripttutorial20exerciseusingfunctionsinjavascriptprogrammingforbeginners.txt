so now we will work on an exercise using the functions in JavaScript so guys basically you have to follow the below steps in order to complete this exercise on functions in JavaScript so let us start with the first task over here so basically you have to create the function with the name add in this case taking two parameters that is a and b so guys you can pause this video and practice on your own and complete this task one by one and if you are getting stuck anywhere then you can check how I am doing on the screen so guys basically let us move to the vs code over here so first of all we will use the function keyword in order to define the function with the name add in this case and then we will provide two parameters inside the open and close parenthesis so let us provide the parameters that is a and b over here and then after this we are going to provide the open and close curly braces so guys we need to calculate the addition of A and B and return the result over here so what we will do is let us provide the variable that is sum in this case and then it is equal to a + b over here so basically we are just adding these two numbers that will be passed as parameters during the function call with the help of the function name that is add in this case so guys basically A+ B will be assigned to the sum variable over here and then we have to return this sum so basically we are going to use the return statement in this case and we are returning the sum variable over here and then after this we need need to call this function five times with different parameter values so guys let us call this function five times over here so before calling the function five times we need to display the results of all calls to function with proper statements to be displayed on Console so guys over here let us provide the proper statements inside the console.log statement so what we will do is simply we will say result of addition of two numbers is and then we have to provide dollar symbol and then inside the open and close curly braces simply we are going to call the add function in this case with two parameters so let us say the first function call is having two numbers that is 1 comma 2 in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code on the terminal so simply we will say node followed by the name of the Javascript file that is test.js so as you can see result of addition of two numbers is three in this case since we have provided the two numbers as one and two so similarly we will call this function five times over here with the help of the required string that we have provided inside the string literal so guys over here what we will do is let us provide some other parameters so let's say we provide 5 and four and then we provide 10 and then 12 in this case and then for the fourth call let us provide 8 followed by 12 in this case and then in the end let's say we provide 10 and then we provide 23 in this case so guys let us see what will be the output of all the these additions of numbers so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see 1 + 2 it is equal to 3 over here then 5 + 4 it is equal to 9 and then 10 + 12 it is equal to 22 and Then followed by 8 + 12 it is equal to 20 and then 10 + 23 it is equal to 33 over here so guys whatever numbers we have provided to this add function it was successfully able to find the sum of both the numbers that were provided as parameters to the add function in this case so basically we have completed all the four task inside this particular exercise now the last task is to convert the function to an arrow function over here now guys in order to convert this regular function into an arrow function simply we have to remove the function keyword over here and we have to define the variable that is add in this case so simply we say let as the keyword in this case and Then followed by by the name of the function that is ADD over here followed by equal to operator and then guys inside the open and close parenthesis we are taking the two parameters that is a and b in this case and then after this we need to provide the combination of characters that is equal to and the greater than symbol so guys basically this is nothing but the arrow function over here and then after this we have the open and close curly braces inside which we are going to have the lines of code that is going to complete certain operation that is addition of two numbers in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again on the terminal to see whether the output that we are getting is same as compared to the previous output so let me just run this code once again as you can see we are getting the sum of all these numbers that we had entered on the console. log statement now guys since we are only returning a plus b over here we can make this function definition more shorter over here so what we have to do is simply I'm going to return a plus b in this case so I'm going to remove the sum variable over here and then after the curly braces we have A+ B and simply we can use the return statement as well and then close this curly braces in this case and remove this particular lines of code so guys over here as you can see we are simply returning a plus b which is the sum of these two numbers which are getting passed as the parameters to this Arrow function so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see we are getting the same result over here now guys again we can remove the return statement as well since it is only having one line of code over here so guys always remember when we are having the arrow function if you just have one line of code to be executed then return statement is not required automatically the value of this particular expression will be returned so simply I'm going to remove this return statement and also these curly braces are not required when you are not using the return statement in this case case so as you can see we are simply passing A and B as the parameters to the arrow function and returning the expression that is a plus b which is going to return the value of the addition of these two numbers over here for all the console. log statements so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see we are getting all these results as the sum of the two numbers that we are passing with the help of the add Arrow function over here so guys what will be the out when we call the add function with the two numbers that is 5 and six over here so what will be the sum of these two numbers when this particular add function will be called so comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this video so that
