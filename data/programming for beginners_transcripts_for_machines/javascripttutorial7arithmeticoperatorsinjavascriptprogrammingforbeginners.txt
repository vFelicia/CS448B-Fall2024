so now we will see arithmetic operators in JavaScript so guys basically the arithmetic operators are used to perform the arithmetic on numbers in JavaScript and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so guys basically all these are arithmetic operators in JavaScript so first of all we have this plus operator which means it is going to add two numbers over here apart from this we also have the minus operator for subtraction and then we have this multiplication exponentiation which means one number raised to the power of another number and then apart from this we can also divide two numbers by using this division operator we can also find the remainder by using this percent operator over here and then we have the Plus+ which is the increment operator which means it is going to increase the number by one and we also have the minus minus which is the decrement operator which means it is going to decrease the number by one over here so guys let us check all these arithmetic operators with the help of examples in vs code in this case so guys what we will do is let us Define certain variables over here so simply we are going to use the const keyword this time and we will say number one it is equal to two over here so guys basically we have this num one variable that is having the value two and it is not going to change since we have declared the variable with the const keyword over here apart from this we will also have another constant so let us have num two this time and we will have the value three over here guys simply we are going to use all these other arithmetic operators in order to find the results so guys over here let me just provide the console.log statement and then this time we will say addition it is equal to and then over here simply we can provide dollar after which we can provide open and close curly braces over here and then simply we can say num one followed by plus operator and then num two over here so guys basically this is the expression that is num one that is the first number followed by the plus operator and then we have the num two that is the second number so this will help you in order to add two numbers this time so let me just save this file now and let me just run this code on the terminal so simply we will say node followed by space character and then we have the test.js that is the name of the file over here when we press enter as you can see addition it is equal to 5 this time so the addition of these two numbers that is 2 + 3 it is equal to 5 and that is what we are getting over here as the output so guys this is the way that we can add two numbers over here apart from this we can also store this result in another variable over here so guys simply let me just copy this particular expression this time and then what we will do is again we are going to have third constant over here and this time we are going to name it as result and Then followed by the equal to operator so guys what we are doing is we are having the third variable by using the const keyword you can also use the let keyword over here and you can provide your own variable name followed by the equal to operator and then in order to add two numbers that is num one and num two you can have this expression and then while printing in this case we can simply replace this with the third variable that we have used that is result over here so guys when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see there is no change the addition of two numbers it is 2 + 3 it is equal to 5 this time so in this way you can add the two numbers by using the plus operator over here apart from this you can also provide the minus operator in order to subtract the two numbers so what we will do is result it is equal to num one minus num two this time so we have used the minus operator over here and simply while printing the result we can say subtraction this time so basically we are going to say subtraction it is equal to result which means 2 3 it is equal to min1 and that is the result that we must get on the terminal so when we run this code once again over here it says subtraction it is equal to minus1 this time so guys in this way you can subtract the two numbers as well let us also multiply the two numbers so what we will do is simply instead of having the minus of operator over here we can say multiplication this time and then over here on the console. log statement we can say multiplication equal to result so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again as you can see multiplication it is equal to 6 which means 2 * by 3 it is equal to 6 this time let us move to the next operator over here we have something called as exponentiation which means one number raised to the power of another number over here so guys this time we have to use two times star operator over here and that that is how we are going to get number one which is equal to 2 ra to the power of number two which is equal to 3 this time and 2 to 3 is equal to 8 and that is what we should get over here so simply we will say exponentiation this time and let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here so as you can see exponentiation it is equal to 8 which means 2 to the^ of 3 it is equal to 8 this time so guys in this way you can find the one number ra to the power of another number by using this particular operator apart from this let let us also use this operator which is the Divide operator so when we say num 1 divided by num 2 over here let us see what will be the result since we are using two divided by 3 this time so can we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see division it is equal to 0.66 and so on so guys basically 2 / 3 it is giving us the number in terms of fraction over here and that is why we are getting this particular result we can also verify the same result on the calculator as well so when we say two divide by three over here as you can see we are getting this particular number and the same number is getting printed over here as far as the division operator is concerned similarly we can use the modulus operator in order to find the remainder of the division so let us check that as well so instead of having the Divide operator simply we can say num 1 person num two which means 2 ided 3 will be done and whatever remainder is there that remainder will be displayed over here so we say remainder this time so 2 / three the quotient should be zero and the remainder must be two so when we run this code once again over here as you can see remainder it is equal to two that's because the quotient it is equal to zero this time apart from this we also have something called as increment and the decrement over here so guys let us check that as well when we say increment simply we can provide the increment statement and then over here let us use one of the numbers instead of the result so let us say we provide num one and then guys how do we use the increment operator so simply we can provide this plus operator two times after num one or before num one over here now guys there is a difference when you provide the increment operator after the number so when we say num 1 ++ over here the same number that is two will be displayed so let us check that so when we save this file now and try running this code once again so we are getting the error over here it says assignment to constant variable so guys over here we have done the mistake and mistakes are very important because it helps you to learn while you are making those mistakes so guys basically we we have to provide the let keyword over here since we are changing the number by providing the increment operator so let me just save this file now andent try running this code once again over here so as you can see increment it is equal to two so basically we have not got the number three this time that's because when you provide the num 1 ++ over here this particular number will be incremented after the log statement is executed so if you print this num one number once again over here after this particular statement so what we will do is we will provide second time as the string over here in order to identify that this is the second time that we are going to print this number and we say num one this time so guys since we have incremented the number over here the second time that you are going to print the number one it is going to add one to this particular number that is two and it will display the value as three for this number one so when we save this file now and try running this code once again as you can see increment it is equal to two and second time when we print that number that is num one it is equal to three this time guys that is the difference when you provide the Plus+ operator after this particular variable name that is num one so during that particular execution you won't be able to see that change but after this particular line of code the number one will be having the value that is three over here which was incremented now guys instead of having the Plus+ operator after the variable what if we provide the Plus+ operator before the variable over here so this is the second way in order to provide the increment operator that is before the variable name so this time what will happen is first the increment will happen that is one will be added to this particular number that is two and we will get the value as three over here for the first statement and again we will get the value as three for the second statement over here so when we save this file now and try running this code once again as you can see increment it is equal to three this time and previously when we had provided the Plus+ operator after the variable name the increment was providing us the value as two and second time it was three but this time time over here the increment is three and again the second time it is three over here that's because only once we are incrementing the variable so guys basically that's a difference when we provide the Plus+ operator before the variable name that particular statement will have the updated value but when we provide the same operator after the variable name then the updated value will be provided in the upcoming statements when you are using the console. log statement similarly you can use the decrement operator as well so over here we have the minus minus operator in order to reduce the number by one over here so when we use the minus minus after the variable name so that particular statement will not show any change and we will get the value as two but the second time the value will be one over here that's because we are reducing the value by one when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see increment it is equal to two and second time the number has become one over here but similarly when we provide the minus minus operator before the variable name so this time we must get in increment equal to one over here and second time also should be one this time so when we save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see increment is equal to 1 and second time it is equal to 1 so guys we have done the mistake over here instead of increment we must have the decrement over here because we are decreasing the number so when we save this file now as you can see decrement is one and second time it is equal to 1 so guys in this way you can use the arithmetic operators based on your project requirements and you can either store the result in another variable over here and use that variable or simply you can use the backs in this case and provide the dollar symbol followed by the open and close curly braces inside which you can have your arithmetic expression so guys
