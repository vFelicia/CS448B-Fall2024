so now we will see color gradients in CSS so guys basically the CSS gradients let you display the smooth transitions between two or more specified colors and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well and there are basically three types of gradients that we will be seeing in the CSS so the very first gradient type is the linear gradient over here for which the directions can go from top to down or up left right or diagonally as well apart from this we also have the radial gradient that we can use which is defined by their Center and then the third gradient is the conic gradients which is rotated around the center point so guys let us check all these with the help of examples in VSS code over here so simply I'm going to remove the previous lines of code that we had return in the HTML and the style. CSS file in this case now guys let us simply provide the diff tag over here and for this diff tag we are going to provide certain CSS properties so inside the style. CSS file we will have the diff tag that is the CSS selector and inside the curly braces let us say first of all we provide the simple background color so guys basically this background color is the solid color that we are providing and it is not a mixture of two or more specific colors over here so let me provide the width and height of this diff tag as well so in this case let us provide the width as 500 pixels and also the height as 300 pixels right now so guys over here we have provided the width and height properties as well apart from this letter us also provide certain border so let's say we have two pixels border width and then the Border style is solid and the Border color is black right now so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have this diff tag that is having the background color yellow it is also having the border and specific width and height that we have defined so guys this is the solid background color that we have seen so far so basically what gradient colors allow you to do is have multiple colors and there will be smooth transitions in between those two colors so guys basically we can have two or more colors in this case so let us see how linear gradients can be used so guys in this case what we have to do is we need to comment out this background color CSS property since in order to use the gradient colors we need to use the background image CSS property so guys over here we will say background image so guys this is the CSS property that you have to use in order to provide the gradient colors and then over here simply we are going to say linear gradient in this case so you can see this is the method that we have to use and inside the linear gradient we need to provide the colors so guys let us say we provide yellow color as the first color and followed by comma and then let's say we provide green color as the second color over here so guys basically these are the two colors that we want to be present as the background color for this diff tag and basically the default direction will be top to down down in this case so guys you can see that we can go in any direction we are going to see that how we can set the direction but first of all the default direction will be top to down and that we are going to check with the help of these two colors that is yellow and green so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see on top we have the yellow color and then as we go down the yellow color component is getting reduced and then the green color component is getting increased over here and at the end that is at the bottom of this particular Dev element we have the complete green color over here so guys in this way we can create the linear gradient from top to bottom which is the default direction we can also make the direction from left to right as well so how we can do that simply before the first color we can also set the direction from left to right in this case so how we can do that simply when we provide the first color over here before that we need to provide the direction that is to right in this case so guys basically we have this direction that is to right we can change it to left up down so basically by default we have two down over here so since it is the default value so we don't have to provide it but in case if we want to change the direction so simply we can say to right so basically in this case yellow color will start from the left and then it will end with the green color on the right of this div tag over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see yellow color is starting from the left and it is ending with the green color on the right now guys apart from this we can also have multiple colors over here we have just used yellow and green color right now we can also provide the third color after providing comma so let's say we provide blue color in this case so blue color is the third color let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the yellow color on the left and then when we move to the middle of this diff tag we are getting the green color and then when we move to the right of this div tag we are getting the blue color over here and this is the smooth transition that you can see so there is no sudden green color after a particular point on this div tag and there is no sudden blue color after this point over here so guys basically this is the smooth transition that is happening between the colors that we have provided and you can provide any number of colors over here so guys in this way we can use the linear gradient over here so this was the simple example in this case we can also use the angles instead of directions so guys over here what we have done is we have provided the direction to right or we can also say to left over here so basically the yellow color will start from the right and the blue color will end at the left so let me just save this file now so basically the colors will reverse themselves in terms of directions the yellow color will come on the right and the blue color will go to the left whereas the green color will stay at the middle so when we reload this page as you can see the direction is to left over here now guys how do we provide the angles so basically when we say 0° over here so let me just provide 0 d G so in this way you can provide the angle over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser the color is starting from the bottom so as you can see we have the yellow color at the bottom and then the blue color at the top and when we say 180° over here let me just change it to 180° this will be the default behavior when the yellow color is coming from top and the blue color is ending at the bottom over here so as you can see this is 180° right now so guys what will happen when we provide 90° over here let us check that as well so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see it is coming from left over here right now so in this way you can also provide the angles as far as the degrees are concerned as the first parameter before providing the first color and what is the default behavior when we save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see the color is coming from the top which means it is 180° by default so if we check that when we provide 180° over here so let me just save this file now and by reloading this page so there is no change right now over here so by default it is 180° now guys apart from this we can also have the rainbow colors over here so before checking the random colors we can also check how we can set the colors diagonally so guys let us go from top left to right bottom over here so how do we do that so basically simply we have to provide two right bottom in this case so we say two right bottom so guys when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the yellow color is coming from the top left and then we have the green color the direction is diagonal right now and then in the end the bottom right is now having the blue color and that is how you can set the gradient color as diagonal in this case now guys let us check another example that is how we can create the rainbow colors so what we can do is simply we have to go from left to right so over here we are going to keep to right in this case and then we are going to define the colors of the rainbow so guys first of all the first color is violet in this case and Then followed by Indigo and then we have blue and then we have green followed by yellow and then we have orange and Then followed by red so guys this is the sequence of the rainbow color so we have violet indigo blue green yellow orange red so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so remember that we have set the direction as to right so basically it will go from left to right in this case so when we save this file so as you can see these are the rainbow colors that you can see on the this particular diff tag over here so guys in this way we can easily use the linear gradient function for the background image property so guys it is very important to note that we are using the background image CSS property instead of the background color property now guys apart from this let us move to the next gradient that is radial gradients over here which is defined by their Center so guys let us check the example of the radial gradient in this case so instead of using the linear gradient simply we have to provide the radial gradient over here so so inside this radial gradient what we have to do is let us provide certain color so we will provide yellow and then green color in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so guys this is the radial gradient actually it is the size of the ellipse over here in between you can see that it is the yellow color and then the outside of this particular div element is the green color over here when we provide more colors so let us provide the blue color as well as the third color let me just reload this page so as you can see the ellipse is getting displayed on this particular web browser which is the default shape when we use the radial gradient so guys in this way if you want this kind of gradient to be displayed on any of the HTML element you can use the radial gradient and apart from this we can also have the circle shape as well instead of the ellipse shape so guys by default this is the ellipse shape but before the first color simply we can provide the keyword that is circle over here so guys what will happen is instead of of ellipse we will have the circle shape for this particular radial gradient that will be implemented so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see this is the circular shape of this particular radial gradient that is getting displayed inside this div element over here so guys in this way you can use the radial gradients as well apart from this we also have conic gradients which is rotated around a center point so guys let us check this with the help of example over here so simply what we have to do is iner of radial gradients we can say conic gradient in this case so we have conic hyphen gradient and let us use some color so again we will use the yellow color and the green color for this conic gradient and Then followed by semicolon over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so guys as you can see this is the rotation that is happening from this particular point over here first of all we have the yellow color which is making a transition over here as we move in the clockwise Direction and then we go towards the green color over here and then in this way the Corning gradient can help us in order to display the HTML element with this particular gradient color let us provide some other color over here so let's say we provide the third color as the aqua color let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we are making the transition from the yellow color and then we are moving towards a green color and then again we are moving to the aqua color over here so guys you can use the conic gradient as well if this is the requirement apart from this we can also mention the angles with the degree so guys over here by default the angles that are provided to the different colors are equal over here but we can mention the degrees as well so let's say we provide certain angles in this case so let's say we want the angle of the yellow to be 45° in this case so simply we can set the 45° over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the yellow color is now spread towards W the 45° angle over here right now so based on your project requirements you can mention the degree of the colors as well and then apart from this you can also have the starting point over here so guys simply we can use the from keyword in this case so basically you can see that this is the starting point from where the colors are starting but you can provide the angle from where you want those colors to start so let us check that as well so before the first color what we can do is let me just remove this angle over here so before the first color simply we use the from keyword and let's say we provide 90° as the starting point from where we want to start this color that is yellow followed by green and Then followed by aqua color let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser notice that we have the start point over here right now but when we reload this page as you can see the start Point has changed over here from the right hand side the yellow color is starting now so guys in this way if you want to change the starting point you can use the from keyword over here followed by the angle that you need to provide inside this conic gradient and Then followed by the colors that you want to set so guys in this way you can use the conic gradients as well so these are some of the gradients that you can use in the CSS so we have the linear gradients that we have seen radial gradient and also the conic gradient as well so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this
