so now we will see unordered list in HTML so guys HTML unordered list is used to group a set of related items in list and we are going to check this with the help of examples as well now an unordered list starts with the UL tag over here so as you can see we have the less than symbol and Then followed by UL which stands for unordered list and then we have the greater than symbol over here and this is the starting tag of unordered list we have the ending tag as well now each list item starts with the lii tag over here so we have the less than symbol followed by the lii and then greater than symbol in order to define the list item inside the unordered list and then guys the list items will be marked with bullets that is the small black circles by default so guys let us check this with the help of examples now how we can Define the unordered list in the HTML page so guys over here I have defined the title as the unordered list in HTML simply we will have the paragraph inside the body and this paragraph will say that below content is an unordered list so we have defined a very simple paragraph having the statement below content is an unordered list now guys we will use the UL tag over here so when we type UL as you can see vs code is suggesting us this UL tag and we have created the starting tag and the ending tag in this case now guys inside this UL tag we need to Define the list of items so we will be using the LI tag over here so when we use the LI tag it is also having the starting tag and the ending tag over here and inside the lii tag we can Define the name of the item so let's say we Define coffee as one of the items over here and then similarly we will have more items so I'll copy this and paste this over here in the next lines and then let's say we Define another item as tea and then one more item as milk in this case so guys we have three items over here inside the list which is being defined as the unordered list now guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser to see how the list items will be displayed so as you can see this is the list items I'll simply zoom in so that you can see the content properly so this is the way that unordered list items are being displayed with the help of the circular bullets over here in black color so guys this is the default appearance of the UN ordered list we can have any number of list items in this unordered list so over here let's say we create more items so we can simply copy and paste these list items in this case and let's say we say CocaCola over here is another drink and then let's say we have another list item as Pepsi so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see now we have five items in this case and all the items are having the prefix in this case it is a circular bullet over here which is defined as the unordered list which is not having any order now guys we can also change this appearance of the bullet in this case so as you can see we can use the list style type over here as the CSS property for the unordered list tag so what we have to do is inside the UL tag we need to define the style attribute so inside the style attribute we can say list style type over here so this is the property that we can use and it is having multiple values that you can see and the disk value is the default value that is being seen right now so what we can do is we can change the value to Circle in this case so when we set the value to Circle it will be a circular appearance instead of a bullet appearance for the unordered list so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see small circles are being displayed now for each and every item inside the unordered list and that is the main meaning of the circle value for this list style type another value can be a square value as well so we can have the Square value let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the squares now that are being displayed for this unordered list items now guys we can also have the nested list as well so let's say we want to describe more items inside this T that is we want to Define black T as well as green te in this case so we can have another unordered list inside this list item so what we have to do is we have to come over here and for this list item that is T in this case we can Define another unordered list by using the UL tag over here and inside the UL tag again we can have the lii tag in order to define the list item so let's say we have black T in this case so we Define black te and then again let's say we have another list item and this time we say green tea so over here we have defined green te in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser to see how it looks so as you can see black te and green tea are being displayed inside this list item that is T with a circular appearance over here so guys in this way we can also have the nested unordered list apart from this this list item can also be an image or a link as well which is pointing to another web page over here so guys you can try those things as well as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own so comment in the comment section below whether
