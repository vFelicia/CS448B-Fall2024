hey what's up guys welcome to another video at which we are going to learn about iterator in Python Programming so guys iterators are methods that iterate collections like list tuples Etc using an iterator method we can Loop through an object and return its elements so we have already seen how we can iterate through the list and tuples as well using the for Loop but we can also have our custom iterators in order to iterate through the different elements inside the list so that we are going to check with the help of examples as well now we can use the iter method which represents the iterator to initialize the iterator and the next method to go through the iterator so guys let us check this with the help of example now over here in the vs code so what we will do is let's say we have the list that is named as list one and then let's say we have the list of numbers in this case so we have one two three four and then five so guys how do we get the iterator to this particular list over here so what we can do is simply we can have the name of the variable that is iterator it is equal to and then we can use the function name that is iter this is one of the functions that will return us the iterator over here and inside this function it will take one parameter which will be the list one in this case so basically the list or Tuple it goes as the parameter to this function that is iter and it Returns the iterator over here and then we can use this iterator in order to get the elements of this list so what we will do is let's say we have the print function and then we can use the next function in this case inside the print so as you can see vs code is suggesting us this next function over here which will take the iterator as the parameter so we provide the iterator as the parameter so what will happen is this thing will point to the first element to the list over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting 1 in this case now what we can do is again we can have another print statement in order to print the second element so over here I have just copied and pasted this line of code and then let me just save this file now on the next line we should get the second element that is 2 so as you can see we are getting 1 and then we are also getting 2 over here so similarly we can get all the elements in this case by using the iter method we have got the iterator over here and by using this iterator as the parameter to the next function we have got the element itself so guys this is the very basic way in which we can use the iterator along with the next function now guys let us check this with the help of the for Loop working or for loop with the iterators so what we can do is instead of printing these statements multiple times we can simply use this iterator inside the for Loop so over here we can have 4 and then element n and then we can provide this iterator so this iterator is having all the elements right now and we are going to iterate through this iterator and one net the time all the elements will be assigned to this element variable and inside this for Loop we can simply provide the element over here so we can provide element and in order to have all the elements on the same line when we are providing the print statement we can have the end parameter over here which is slash n by default which means a control flow goes to the new line so in this case we want it to be on the same line so we will separate all the elements by using one space character over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting one two three four five on the same line we can also separate them by using a comma and a space character so I've just provided comma in the end parameter I'll just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting one two three four five separated by commas so guys this is the way that we can use the for Loop along with the iterator in order to go through all the elements inside the list we can also do this directly by using the list one as well so when we provide less just one which is containing all the elements over here so instead of having the iterator as well we can use the list one so let me just save this file now and try running this code so the same output will be displayed that is all the elements of the list now guys where this iterator becomes important is whenever we are creating the custom classes and we want to iterate through the custom iterator that we want to create so guys let us check it with the help of example now so guys what are the important points while building the custom iterators so building an iterator from scratch is easy in Python we just have to implement the double underscore iter followed by double underscore method so this is one of the custom methods that we have to implement inside the class along with this we also have to implement the double underscore next Double underscore method over here inside the same class so these are the two methods that are important which needs to be implemented inside the class while building the custom iterators so this iter method it Returns the iterator object itself if required some initialization can be performed in this method and the second method that is the next method over here it must return the next item in the sequence on reaching the end and in subsequent calls it must raise stop iteration so guys let us check this with the help of examples as well so over here what we will do is we will implement the power of two class over here which means we are going to find the results of the power of the number that is 2 so we are going to have the class which is going to be named as power 2 in this case and what we will do is we will have the Constructor over here so we have the init method in this case and init method it will take the maximum number up to which we need to find the Power of 2 over here so basically apart from self we will have the max value as well so over here we will say self dot Max it is equal to Max so while creating the object of this class we will be providing the max number up to which we need to find the Power of 2 and then guys as we have seen in order to build the custom iterator we need to have the two functions so first of all we will have the iter function over here so we have iter function and Then followed by open and close parenthesis this will again take the parameter as self and what we will do is the initial value that is self Dot N so we have the variable that is n which is equal to 0 right now so we will find the powers of 2 starting from 0 up to the number that is Max that we have provided while creating the object of the power 2 class over here so what we are going to do is self Dot and it is equal to 0 and this thing is going to return a iterator which is going to be the self itself so over here we are returning the iterator that is the self itself and then guys we are going to also Define the next method over here so we have def followed by double underscore and then we have the next method followed by double underscore and then again we are going to have the self as the parameter so over here what we will do is first of all we need to check whether the value of n is it less than or equal to the value of Max that we have provided so over here we will provide the if condition and inside the parenthesis we will say whether self dot m is this less than or equal to Max that is self dot Max in this case so we have self dot Max and if yes then we are going to have the result what is the result it is equal to 2 raised to the power of n so it will be 2 multiplied by multiplied by double times and then self Dot N in this case so over here we are getting the current value of n we are checking whether it is less than or equal to Max and if yes then we are finding 2 raised to that number that is n over here and the result will be stored in this result variable next what we are going to do is we are going to increment the value of n by 1 so it is going to be self Dot N plus equal to one so we are incrementing the value of n by 1 so that the next time the control flow comes over here it will find that the value of n is incremented by 1 and then after this we simply have to return result in this case for which we have already found the result over here so guys this is the case when n is less than or equal to Max but what if the N is incremented in such a way that it becomes greater than the maximum number which we have already provided for which we don't want to find the Power of 2 so over here inside the else part what we will do is we will raise the stop iteration so over here we can simply provide arrays stop iteration so we have this exception that is raised top iteration over here which is one of the builtin exceptions now guys what we can do is simply we can create the object of this power to class over here that we have created so what we can do is let's say we provide the object name that is I it is equal to power 2 over here and the maximum number for which we want to find the power of 2 is 3 right now so what this will do is when we create this object I the control flow it sees that for this particular power to class we have a Constructor that is in it and it will take the number that is Max so over here we have provided the max S3 so self dot Max that is this particular variable will have the value S3 over here and then guys in order to find the iterator we will name it as the iterator variable it is equal to iter this method and then inside this method we need to pass this object that is I so what exactly will happen is the control flow will see that for this particular class we have the user defined iter method so it will come over here and initially the value of n will be set as 0 in this case so we have 0 to start with and at the end we have Max that is the value of 3 and then guys what we have to do is we have to iterate through this iterator over here so we already have the iterator next time when we call this next method the control flow comes over here it will see that the value of n it is 0 right now and it is less than or equal to Max so 2 raised to 0 the first result it will be equal to 1 and that same result will be passed over here as the return statement and before that n will be incremented and the updated value of n will be 1 in this case so over here we can simply provide the print statement and we can say next over here and inside the parenthesis we will have the iterator as the parameter so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting the result as 1 and next time what we will do is again we will copy paste these lines of code three times over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see we are getting 1 2 4 and 8 which is equal to 2 raised to 0 is 1 2 raised to 1 is 2 2 raised to 2 is 4 2 raised to 3 is 8 and next time when we print the value once again over here so what will happen is 2 raised to 4 will be found and in this case since n value is not less than or equal to Max so raise stop iteration will be called over here and we will get some other statement being printed on the terminal so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got one two four and eight and after this as you can see raised top iteration was called while calling the next function over here so guys this is the way that we can build our custom iterators whenever we are dealing with our custom classes we just need to Define two methods over here that is iter which stands for iterator which will return an iterator over here and then we also have to define the next method which will return us the next element to be used as far as our requirements are concerned in the Python program so guys you can have any logic over here this is just an example that we have taken that is in order to find the Power of 2 you can have any logic based on your requirements and raise the exception in any manner that you want based on your requirements so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs
