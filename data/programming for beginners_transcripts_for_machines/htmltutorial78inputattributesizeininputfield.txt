so now we will see input attribute size in input field so guys basically the input size attribute specifies the visible withd in characters of an input field so basically the size attribute is responsible in order to specify the visible width of the input text box the default value for the size that is the width of the text box is 20 that we have seen so far and it is very important to note that the size attribute only works with following input types that is text search telephone number URL email ID and password so guys basically these are the only input fields on which the size attribute can be implemented and you can simply increase or decrease the width of that input field as far as UI which means user interface is concerned so let us check this with the help of examples in BS code over here so previously we had seen the different attributes that are value then we had also seen read only at attribute and the disabled attribute as well now let us have another input and this time we will have the input field of the type search over here so that we can increase the width or decrease the width of this particular input field so we are going to have the input tag along with the type search and over here for the name part we will provide the value as search and for the ID as well we will provide the value as search in this case let me provide the label as well before the input feed and for the for attribute we will provide the value as search over here and the label that we will provide is search your term or phrase so we have a very simple statement over here that is search your term or phrase which is the part of the label and the user can simply provide a term or a phrase as well having list of words based on the requirements so guys by default the size of this particular input field will be 20 so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have got search your term of phas and then we have this input field over here for which the width is 20 right now by default let me just provide couple of line breakes over here after this input field so that the submit button is displayed on the Le line so let me just reload this page once again on the browser after providing the line brakes so as you can see the width of this particular input field is 20 right now by default so let us say we want to increase the width so that the user is able to search for some term over here so let's say programming for beginners which is the name of this YouTube channel that you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so basically when we provide programming for beginners over here as you can see not the entire phrase can be seen within this particular width of the input field which is 20 by default so let us say we want to provide the size as 40 in this case so simply we can provide size and then provide a number that is 40 over here by default it is set to 20 in other input Fields wherever we don't provide the size attribute so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the width of this input field is increased now and we can say programming for beginners so this phrase we can easily see without actually scrolling horizontally and again we can provide more characters over here on the right so we can say please subscribe so as you can see the entire phrase can be seen right now and then further we can type more content over here HTML tutorial so the longer the phrase the characters on the left hand side will code on the extreme left over here so that it is not visible right now within the same input field so guys this is the main reason to use the size attribute in order to increase the width of a particular input field where the user is expected to provide the large input inut in the form of text phrases we can also decrease the size of this input field so let's say we make the size as 10 over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the size of this input field is now smaller compared to the default size which is 20 right now which can be seen on the other input Fields as well so guys in this way you can easily set the size attribute to any of the input Fields provided the type of the input Fields belong to text search telephone number URL email and password so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is input attribute max length in input field so stay tuned
