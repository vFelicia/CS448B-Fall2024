so now we will see box shadow in CSS so guys basically the CSS box Shadow property is used to apply one or more Shadows to an element and this we are going to check with the help of examples as well we can specify a horizontal and a vertical Shadow to the Box in which case we can have any of the HTML element have the horizontal and the vertical Shadow so guys over here the default color of the Shadow will be the current text color and as you can see this is the syntax we we have taken the dev HTML element over here and simply we can use the Box Shadow CSS property and provide the horizontal and the vertical Shadow based on our project requirements so guys let us move to the VSS code over here and simply we are going to use the div tag in this case that is going to have the box Shadow over here and then we will say this is a simple diff tag so guys basically we have a very simple statement that is this is a simple diff tag over here let me just save this file now and over here inside the style. CSS file we are going to provide certain CSS properties to this div tag so guys first of all let us provide the width and height of this diff tag over here so let's say we have the width of 100 pixels in this case and also the height of 100 pixels and then guys apart from this let us have certain background color for this D tag so let's say we have the yellow color is the background color for this particular HTML element let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see we have a simple Square in the form of the diff element over here let us provide certain padding as well so in this case we are going to provide the padding of let's say 10 pixels and also we will provide the border of black color over here so guys let's say we have the Border width of two pixels and the Border style is solid and the color is black color in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have a good good looking div tag over here which is having the background color along with it we have the Border as well now guys how do we use the Box Shadow so over here as we can see the syntax is box Shadow CSS property followed by the horizontal and the vertical shadow that we can provide so guys inside the vs code simply inside the style. CSS file we will say box Shadow CSS property and over here let's say we provide five pixels of horizontal Shadow and five pixels of vertical shadow over here so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the shadow can be displayed over here as far as the 5 pixels length is concerned guys what we will do is we will remove the border from this particular original diff tag so that we can see clearly that it is a black color shadow so we are going to Simply comment out this line of code over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see it is a black color shadow right now and the shadow Shadow color will be the text color by default which is black color over here can we change that color so let us try that as well so simply we can set the color as some other color so let's say we provide the color as blue color over here let me just save this file now Ander try reloading this page so as you can see the text color is changed to blue color now and also the text Shadow color is changed to blue color over here now guys apart from this you can also provide the shadow color Inside the Box Shadow CSS proper property so how we can do that simply after the vertical shadow that we have provided we can provide the color of the shadow that you want to show so guys let's say we have the aqua color that we want to display as the Box Shadow over here for this particular diff tag so simply we can provide the color that is aqua let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see it is a aqua color that is getting displayed over here let us change it to some dark color in this case so let's say we provide a dark blue color as the Box Shadow color for this particular diff tag let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the dark blue color as the shadow color over here now guys apart from this we can also have the blur effect over here for this particular box Shadow so we have specified the color for the shadow already as the third parameter but the blur effect can be provided after this vertical shadow that we have provided over here so guys after this vertical Shadow and before the color that we have provided simply we can provide the length unit for the blur effect so guys what this will do is instead of having the solid color as you can see this dark blue color is the solid color that you can see right now we will be having certain blur effect for this particular solid color so let us check that as well we have provided the length that is 10 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now it is having some blur effect for this particular dark dark blue color and in this way it gives a good look as far as this particular Dev HTML element is concerned guys apart from this you can also design your cards based on your project requirements that you want to display on the website that you are building in this way and it gives a kind of a 3D look over here which means that this particular card is coming up and we can see the shadow behind this particular card in this case so guys this is the way that you can provide the blur effect Inside the Box Shadow over here apart from this we also have something called as spread radius of the Shadow which increases the size of the Shadow so guys let us check that as well so over here instead of having the 10 pixels blur effect let us have five pixels of blur effect let us check the changes over here so as you can see this is the five pixels blur effect now guys you can increase the size of this particular Shadow simply by providing another length unit after the blur effect which we call it as the spread radius so guys let us check that as well so if you provide two pixels of spread FL radius let us see how the changes will look like let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see to some extent the shadow size has been increased for this particular diff tag over here and in this way you can provide the FL radius as well so to summarize first of all we have the horizontal radius and Then followed by the vertical radius and Then followed by the blur effect that we have seen already and Then followed by the spread radius that you want to optionally provide and then apart from that we also have the color that we have displayed over here guys we can provide any other dark color as well so let's say we provide dark green color over here so you will see the dark green color as the Box Shadow for this particular diff tag let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have the dark green color as the shadow for this particular diff tag over here now guys apart from this we also have something called as insert parameter which changes from the outer to the inner Shadow so guys if you not notice over here we are getting the shadow on the right hand side and at the bottom of this particular HTML element what if we want the shadow on the other side that is on the left as well as on the top as well so guys simply we can reverse the Shadow by using the inser value for this particular bag so guys simply we can provide the shadow on the left and the top by using the inser value for this particular CSS property that is box Shadow so after the color simply we can say insert over here and let let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see now the shadow is getting displayed on the other side of this particular Dev tag so guys in this way you can easily use the inser value as well and apart from this you can also have the multiple Shadows which are separated using comma so guys let us check this as well so I'm going to Simply remove this inset property also we are going to remove the spread radius over here and simply what we are going to do is we will set the Box Shadow as blue color over over here and in this case we are going to increase the blur effect to 20 pixels so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the blur effect of 20 pixels and the shadow color is blue right now guys we can have more darker version of the blue color so over here we are going to set another color that is dark blue in this case so how we can do that is we can provide comma after this blue color and then provide the horizontal and vertical so let's say this time we don't want to provide the length units for the horizontal and vertical direction for the Shadows but simply we want to provide the blur effect so over here simply we can say five pixels of blur effect and the color that we want is dark blue in this case so guys this is the darker version of the blue color that we have already applied so let us see how the changes looks like so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see the dark blue color is also getting highlighted over here as the Box Shadow for this part particular D teag and in this way you can provide your own box Shadow based on your requirements if you want to provide multiple box Shadows for a particular HTML element in this case so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that
