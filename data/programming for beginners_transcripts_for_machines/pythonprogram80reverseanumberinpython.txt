welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to reverse a number so guys we are going to see two ways in order to reverse a number as you can see the first way is by using the while loop so over here we will be using the logic in order to reverse the number by using the remainder and the Divide operator and the second way is by using the string slicing which we can easily use in order to reverse the number so guys let us check both these methods in the vs code over here so the very first thing that we will be doing is we will Define the number it is equal to let's say we have the number that is 123 over here and we want the reverse of this number which will be 321 so what we will be doing is we will Define another variable that is reverse number over here and initially we will initialize it as zero now after this we will use the while loop over here so while we need to check whether this number is not equal to 0 so we will say num is not equal to 0 in this case so during the first iteration the num is not equal to 0 since it is equal to 123 over here so next what we will be doing is we need to get the last digit from this number which we can get by using the remainder operator so over here we will say digit it is equal to we will use this num variable over here percent 10 so basically when we say num person 10 we will get the last digit from this 123 number which will be equal to 3 over here now this number that is 3 it will be stored in the digit variable so we can use this digit variable in order to set the Reversed number so this time reverse the number it is equal to we will say reverse number once again multiplied by 10 and then we will say plus this digit over here now guys what is this logic why we have included reverse number multiplied by 10 so basically in the first iteration the Reversed number is 0 right now so 0 multiplied by 10 it will be equal to 0 and then plus a digit will give us 3 over here so reverse the number will be 3 this time next time what will happen is the digit number should store the second number from behind that is number 2 over here so this reverse number currently will be 3 which will make it 3 multiplied by 10 it is equal to 30 plus we should get this digit that is 2 so we will get 32 over here and then guys in the third iteration similarly a reverse number would be 32 and then we will get the digit as 1 and it will be 32 multiplied by 10 that is 320 plus 1 which will give us 321 over here and this is the logic that will help us in order to get the reverse number over here now guys the last step is to reduce the num variable so we will say num it is equal to now we need to divide it by 10 so we say divide operator and then we use the number that is 10. so guys basically we are only getting the number that is 1 and 2 over here that's because the last digit has been already assigned to the Reversed number over here we will see the explanation of all these three lines of code once again in a notepad file so let's say over here we have the number as one two three so we say one two three now guys what's happening over here is num person 10 is giving us this large digit that is 3 so we are storing it into digit over here that is 3 and then reverse number it is equal to 0 right now so 0 multiplied by 10 it is equal to 0 plus digit so we are getting reverse number as 3 in this case so reverse number is 3 now after first iteration and num person 10 will give us 2L in this case so we say num it is equal to 12 right now in the second iteration once again num person 10 will give us the last digit that is 2 so inside the digit variable we will have the number two now what do we have in the reverse number currently we have three so three multiplied by 10 will give us 30 plus digit which is having two so it will be 32 right now so we will say 32 in the reverse number and the last step that is num divided by 10 will give us 12 divided by 10 which will be equal to 1 this time and then guys again num percent time for this one it will give us 1 over here so digit will be 1 this time and reverse number is already 30 to 32 multiplied by 10 will give us 320 plus digit which is equal to 1 will give us 321 over here so reverse number will be 321 and num divided by 10 this time since num value is 1 1 divided by 10 will be 0 so num will become 0 right now and when the num is equal to 0 the control flow will come out of the while loop over here so basically after the while loop we simply have to print the statement that is reverse the number so we say reverse number over here followed by colon and then we simply have to use the reverse number variable over here so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got the reverse number S 3 2 one over here guys we can have any other number instead of 123 so we will say 145 678 so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got eight seven six five four and then one which is the reverse of this number that we have just provided so guys this is one way in order to reverse the number by using the while loop over here now what is the second way we can also use the string slicing in this case so how string slicing will work we will remove these lines of code over here once again I will set the number as 123 this time now guys we can simply have the print function directly in order to get the reverse of the number by using the string slicing over here so inside the print statement we will simply say reverse number and then colon and then guys what we have to do is this number needs to be converted to the string first so we will be using the Str class over here as you can see it creates a new string object from the given object so inside the parenthesis we will be providing the num variable so basically we are converting it into a string so 1 2 3 has become a string now and then we can use the open and close square brackets over here and inside the open and close parenthesis we can provide start stop and then step so guys the start and stop need not be provided over here we can simply provide two colons and then in the end we can provide minus 1 over here which represents a step in this case so basically this simple line of code will help us in order to get the reverse of this number that we have provided in the form of string data type and it will be printed on the terminal so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see reverse number it is 321 over here so guys instead of using any logic by using the while loop you can simply use this string slicing method in order to reverse the number or the string as well now if we provide any other number let's say if we provide 54321 so it should provide us one two three four five as the output which is the reverse of this number let me just run this code once again so as you can see we have got reverse number it is equal to one two three four five guys what will be the answer when we provide nine eight seven as the number over here comment in the comment section below what will be the reverse of this number let us see whether your answer is correct or not so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs and you are able to comment the right answer below make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as
