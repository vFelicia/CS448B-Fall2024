hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about Anonymous or Lambda function in Python Programming so guys in Python an anonymous or Lambda function is a special type of function without the function name so we use the Lambda keyword instead of Def that is defined to create a Lambda function so as you can see this is the syntax previously we had used the def keyword in order to create the normal functions but this time we are going to use the keyword that is Lambda along with the arguments which are optional over here and then followed by a colon and then we have the expression so this is one of the examples of the Lambda function over here we have the Lambda keyword followed by the colon over here and then we have the expression that is we are printing the hello world string and this entire function that is the anonymous function which is not having any name over here is being assigned to a variable that is grid and then this grid needs to be called as you can see called the Lambda over here along with the open and close balance SS so when we have this line of code over here this Lambda function will be called and hello world will be printed on the screen so guys let us check this with the help of example over here so what we will do is simply we will have the Lambda keyword first of all and Then followed by a colon and then let's say we want to print the name of this YouTube channel that is programming for beginners which you should definitely subscribe if you have not done so so we have programming for beginners over here so this is a Lambda function or the anonymous function without having any name and then let's say we assign it to a variable and we can simply provide the variable name as Str and then we have the equal to operator over here now what we have to do is simply we need to call this Str variable so over here on the new line we will have Str followed by open and close parenthesis and this is the way that we call the anonymous function so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see programming for beginners is getting printed over here and this is one of the simple examples as far as Anonymous function or Lambda function is concerned in Python Programming now guys very important thing what if you have certain arguments which you want to print so this is kind of a static function which is having a fixed string that you want to print but let's say you want to provide some string over here while calling the function so in case let's say we have this argument as this is a string that we want to print so this Str that is the Lambda function is being called but this value needs to be caught by this Lambda function over here so what we can simply do is we can take this argument after this Lambda keyword as we have seen in this syntax after the Lambda keyword we have the list of arguments that we can take and use them in the form of Expressions over here so what we will do is let's say I provide Lambda and Then followed by X so this x variable will have this value whatever we pass while we are calling this is Str function that is the anonymous function so this x we can use in our expression inside this Lambda function so let's say I provide a label over here string past and Then followed by colon and then I have comma and Then followed by this x variable which is being passed so this is a string it is one of the arguments that we are passing to the Lambda expression and the X variable will be assigned to this value and it will be printed by using this print statement so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see string past this label is getting printed and then the value of x which was passed from this calling of the Lambda function over here that is this is a string and the same thing is getting printed over here so guys this is the way that we can pass arguments or parameters to our Lambda or Anonymous functions over here now guys there is another variation can we have the multiple arguments let's say we have two or more numbers for which we need to find the sum of those numbers can we find the sum of those numbers by using the Lambda function so let us quickly check this with the help of examples over here so what we will do is again we will Define the Lambda function over here so we have Lambda keyword and this time we will take two numbers so let's say the two numbers are stored in these variables that is X and Y and Then followed by a colon and then what we can do is simply we can print the sum of these two numbers so we put X Plus y over here so this is the expression print X Plus Y and over here in the Lambda we have defined the two variables over here now what we can do is we can assign it to another variable so let's say we have ADD underscore numbers as the variable name so we have ADD underscore numbers and then Lambda keyword followed by these two variables it is X and Y and then print X Plus y over here so what we can simply do is we can call this add numbers and provide the two numbers that we want to add so we just use this add numbers over here and then let's say the two numbers that we provide is 10 and 20 so we are expecting the sum that is 10 plus 20 to be displayed by using this expression over here so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting some syntax error Lambda expression parameters cannot be parenthesized so what we can do is we can simply remove these parentheses that we have provided so when we are providing multiple arguments in the Lambda function we need not have to provide the parenthesis we can separate them using the commas over here so let me just save this file and try running this code so as you can see 30 is getting displayed we can format this string and have some label as well so what we can do is we have the double quotes over here and we say sum of numbers and then colon and then comma X Plus y so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see sum of numbers that is 30 is getting displayed another way that we can print the sum of these numbers is just by returning the sum of these numbers and printing them over here outside the Lambda function so while returning any of the Expressions we need not have to have the return keyword we can simply have the expression over here so as you can see the two numbers were passed that is 10 and 20 it will be taken by this Lambda function in the form form of X and Y X Plus y will be computed and then it will be returned to this function which was called by using the add numbers now we can simply print this so we can have the print function over here and inside the print function we call the add numbers with these two numbers let's say this time we provide some other numbers that is hand rate and let's say 150 so the sum should be 100 plus 150 which should be 250 over here let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 250 is getting printed and again we can have some labels over here in order to Define exactly what this function is doing so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output this Lambda function becomes very important which is also called Anonymous function when you don't want to define the function explicitly and you have very less number of operations to be carried out by using this Anonymous function so guys please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to
