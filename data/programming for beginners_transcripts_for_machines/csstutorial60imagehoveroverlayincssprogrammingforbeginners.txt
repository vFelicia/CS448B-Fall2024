so now we will see image hover overlay in CSS so guys basically we will create an overlay effect on image hover using CSS with the help of examples so let us move to the vs code over here and simply we are going to remove the previous lines of code that we have return in the HTML and the CSS files now guys over here we will Define the diff tag with the class container and inside this container we are going to have the image so let us provide certain sample image over here that I have already downloaded that is the sample Forest image.jpg file which is present in the same directory where this HTML file is present and then guys for the alt attribute simply we are going to say test image this text will be displayed when the image is not getting displayed properly on the browser now guys apart from this we will also Define certain CSS properties for this IMG tag over here inside the CSS file so let's say we have the IMG tag in this case and simply we are going to set the width as 300 pixels and also the height as 300 pixels over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page on the browser so as you can see this is the image that is getting displayed right now now guys what we are going to do is when we get the mouse cursor on this image we need to get another diff tag that will be displayed on top of this image with a certain background color and a sample text so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply inside the HTML file we are also going to define the diff tag with the class that is text over here and simply we will have the sample text that is Hello World in this case so guys basically this text will be displayed with the help of the background color on top of the image that we have already displayed on the web browser let me just save this file now and try reloading this page as you can see currently we are simply getting the text at the bottom of this image right now so guys we are going to set certain CSS properties so first of all we will use the container class over here for the div tag and simply we are going to use it inside the CSS file so for this container diff tag we will set the position equal to relative over here and then after this we need to have the position equal to Absolute for the IMG tag as well so over here we will say absolute and also we will set the CSS property for this diff tag as well so we will use the text class in this case and inside the CSS file we use this class name that is text for which the position must be equal to Absolute so guys we have set the position equal to Absolute for IMG tag and the diff tag that is having the class name that is text over here now apart from this we will also set the top and the left CSS property as zero over here for the diff tag that is having the class text let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see the text is now getting displayed on top of the image right now now guys apart from this we we also want to set the width and height for this particular diff tag that is text over here so simply we will set the width as 300 pixels which is same as the width of image and also the height must be same as that of the image so again we will set the height as 300 pixels over here apart from this we will also set the background color as well so let's say we have the background color as Aqua in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the diff tag is now completely covering the image that we have displayed now guys we also want the hello world text to be displayed at the center of this D tag so what we can do is simply we will use the text align CSS property and set the value as Center which will help us in order to get the text at the center of the diff tag as far as horizontal alignment is concerned so we have got the text over here and then in order to get the text at the center of this St tag we can simply use the line height CSS property so over here we can set the line height to 300 pixels which is the actual height of the diff tag so over here we have set the value of line height as 300 pixels let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have CAU the text that is hello world at the center of the diff tag now guys what we want to do is when we get the mouse cursor on the image that is behind this D tag we need to make the this diff tag visible so we can see the overlay effect so in this case simply we are going to set the opacity equal to zero right now so that by default the diff tag that is having the text class is not getting displayed so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we get the image that is getting displayed on the web browser now guys what we have to do is simply we have to use the container class over here so we will use this class in this case and we need to use use the sudo class that is over right now so when we get the mouse cursor on this diff tag we need to get the other diff tag that is having the text over here so we need to use another class name that is text in this case so we use dot followed by text so on Mouse over on this particular main container the dot text class that is a diff tag must be displayed so in this case we need to set the opacity equal to 1 so basically it is going to change from opacity equal to 0 to 1 over here and we need to make this transition within 1 second so guys basically we will use the transition as well with the CSS property that is opacity and the time period of 1 second over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page now if we get the mouse cursor on the image as you can see we are getting the overlay effect over here which is displaying the hello world text so guys in this way we can simply provide the overlay effect in this case when we get the mouse cursor on this particular diff tag over here which is displaying the image right now so guys based on your project requirements you can also create your own overlay effect on top of the image or any other HTML element as we have seen
