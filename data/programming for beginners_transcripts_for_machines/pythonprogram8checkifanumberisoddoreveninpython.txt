hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to check if a number is odd or even so guys basically a number is A1 if it is perfectly divisible by 2 which means when we divide any number by 2 and when we get the remainder as 0 that means it is an even number and if the remainder is not 0 then it is an odd number so when the number is divided by 2 we use the remainder operator that is percent to compute the remainder and if the remainder is not 0 the number is odd and if the remainder is 0 then the number must be E1 so guys let us check this with the help of the Python program so over here what we will do is we will take the number input from the user and it will be of the integer data type so we will use the int function over here and inside this we will take the input since the default input gives us the string data type we need to convert it into the integer and that is why we have provided this integer function over here as the prefix and then inside this we have has to provide enter a number so basically we are providing the instruction to the user in order to enter the number so basically when the user enters the number it will be of the string data type we are converting the string data type into the integer by using the int function over here as the prefix now guys we will have the integer inside this number variable and we can simply use the percent operator in order to check whether the integer is a odd or even number so over here we say the if condition and we say number percent in this case so percent and then 2 whether it is equal to zero so guys this is the important condition this is used in order to check what will be the remainder when we divide the number by 2 and if it is 0 then it is an even number in this case so over here what we will do is simply we will print the statement that is entered number so we say entered number and then we will provide the number that is entered by the user which will replace this curly braces over here is an even number we will say so we say is an even number and then we have to use the dot format function after the string so inside this dot format we will simply provide this number variable so that it replaces this open and close curly braces over here so guys if the entire number is even number this condition will get satisfied since a remainder will be 0 or else if it is an odd number what we have to do is simply we have to come in the else part and again we will print the statement so I'll simply copy this line of code and paste this over here and we will say entered number that is this number is an odd number this time so we say odd number and Then followed by dot format and then number so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see the user is being asked to enter a number so let's say we provide the number as 8 this time so when we press enter as you can see enter number 8 is an even number why so when we divide the number that is 8 by 2 we get 4 is quotient and 0 as the remainder and that is why it is an even number let's say we provide another number so this time we say enter a number and it is 3 this time and when we press enter as you can see enter number three is an odd number that's because 3 cannot be perfectly divided by 2 and that is why it is an odd number guys let us run this code once again and this time we provide the number that is 11 so what will be the output of this whether it is an even number or the odd number comment in the comment section below as a homework for you so guys make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output and after writing this program comment in the comment section below whether 11 is a even number or the odd number please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to check leap year so stay tuned
