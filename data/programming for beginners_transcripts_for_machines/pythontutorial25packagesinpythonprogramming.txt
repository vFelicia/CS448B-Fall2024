hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about packages in Python Programming so guys a package is a container that contains various functions to perform specific tasks so for example let's say the math package that we had seen previously it includes the square root function to perform the square root of a number and this math package we had imported previously as well so while working on big projects we have to deal with a large amount of code and writing everything together in the same file will make our code look messy and we also want our code to be readable so we cannot afford that so instead we can separate our code into multiple files by keeping the related code together inside the packages so let us check what the package model structure in Python Programming looks like so over here as you can see we have a package that is game at the outside and in order to make the python interpreter understand that this is a package we need to have a file with this name that is underscore underscore follow by in it and then 2 times underscore followed by dot Pi so this is the file that will tell the python interpreter to treat this game as one of the packages and then inside that we can have more sub packages so as you can see we have a sub package called sound inside which there are different sounds that can be present we have another sub package that is image and then we have another sub package at this level and in all these sub packages we have this underscore underscore init followed by two times underscore and then dot Pi these files must be present in order to make the python interpreter understand that these are the sub packages inside the main package that is game so guys let us check this with the help of examples how we can create the packages and how we can use them in our projects so basically this is our main code that is python code over here what I will do is I will come out of this and I'll create a new folder so let's say I have create the game folder over here and inside this folder what we have to do is we will be creating these sub packages over here but before for creating these are packages let us create this file that is the init file which will tell the python interpreter that this is a package so we will come over here we say new file and then two times underscore we have init and then underscore dot Pi so this is one of the files over here which will tell the python interpreter that this is a package and we will keep the file as blank over here for now and we will come to this game and then again we will create another folder this time it is going to be the sound package so we have sound package over here and inside this we will again create a file that is the init file so we have init file over here so we will keep this init file as it is for now so we have created game and then inside that we have a sub package that is sound let us create a file inside the sound package so what we will do is inside this we will create a new file over here and then we will say load Dot py and inside this file let's say we Define the function that is load and then we have a colon over here so what we will do is we will simply have the print statement and we will say inside sound package and load function so guys this will tell us that we are inside the sound package and inside the load function over here now guys let us say we want to create another sub package that is level and we want to create the start python file over here so what we will have to do is we again come to this game and then we create another folder and then we have this level sub package and inside this package again we will create the init file so we have this init dot p y over here we will keep this file blank for now and then what we will do is over here inside the level we will create another new file and we will say start dot py so this is another python file and what we can do is we can Define the function that is start followed by open and close parenthesis and then we can simply have the print function so guys what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy and paste this print statement from here so we print and paste this over here and I'll say inside level package and start function guys we will just rename this function name as start followed by underscore function so that we come to know that this is the function that we are calling same thing we are going to do with the load as well so underscore function over here so guys pretty much we have created some good packages over here the outer package is the game and then we have two packages that is level and sound each of those packages are having the init file over here and then they are having their own functions at a start and load.py so now we will come out of this package that is outside the game package and we already have our main file that is python underscore code so what we have to do is let's say we want to call those functions that is start.py and over here that is low dot py so what we have to do is first of all we need to import the packages so while importing what we can do is import followed by game as you can see this game is coming now this is the auto complete feature of the vs code which is very code so we can use this game followed by dot as you can see both the sub packages that we had created are also being suggested over here so what we can do is let's say we provide level over here followed by Dot and then as you can see start that is the python file name that is start.py is getting suggested so we will use this so this is the way that we can import one of the files inside the existing packages so over here we have created the user defined packages and the user defined files which are having the user defined functions as well and those functions we are going to call now we can simply provide the print function and Then followed by again we will use the package name followed by Dot and then the sub package name that is level followed by Dot and then the start that is the name of the Python file followed by dot as you can see we are getting the start function as the selection so we will use this and then after this start function we have the open and close parenthesis since it is the function over here so let me just save this file and try running this code to see what will be the output as you can see inside level package and start function so this is a string that we had provided in our start function over here that is inside level package and start function let's say we want to call this load function over here so what we can do is again we will have the print statement and Then followed by in the same way we are going to call the load function so game followed by we need to get the sound sub package so over here we are not getting the sound sub package that's because we have not imported the sound yet so again we are going to have another import and then we have game followed by dot this time we are going to import the sound sub package followed by Dot and then we have load so now this time once we provide dot as you can see sound is getting also suggested over here so sound follow file dot we have load and then load function over here open and close parenthesis let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see inside level package and start function and again inside sound package and load function is getting printed because that is the content that we had provided over here so guys this is the way that we can import different packages and the files inside those packages and call those functions as well now guys previously I have shown you what is the shorthand method so instead of typing everything that is packages and sub packages over here we can simply use the shorthand method over here while importing the library so after this we have the space character followed by the as keyword and then let's say I provide the name as the level and over here I provide the name as sound so what we can do is simply we can use the level and sound over here so let's say I provide level followed by Dot and then we have start function and over here once again this entire thing can be replaced and we can provide sound because that is the name that we have given to this package and the library hierarchy that we have imported so let me just save this file and try running this code pretty much the output will be same that is those two strings are getting printed over here once again as you can see but this is the shorthand method that we can use so guys this is the way that you can organize your code into different packages and write different methods as well inside those packages and the python files hopefully you have got enough knowledge about the packages in order to create your next big project as far as Python programming language is concerned please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output also make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is numbers type conversion and Mathematics in Python Programming so stay tuned
