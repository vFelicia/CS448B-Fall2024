hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to check whether the entered year is a leap year so guys basically in this program we will take the year as the input from the user and we will check whether the entered year is a leap year now what is the logic in order to check whether the ear is a leap year so basically a leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for Century years which is the ears ending with double zero so basically any year that is divisible by 4 and we get the remainder as 0 will be the leap year except the century years now the century here is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400 so guys what we will be doing is first of all we are going to check whether the entered year is a century year which means whether it is ending with a double zero and if it is a century here we will check whether it is divisible by 400 if so then it is a leap year and if this condition is not satisfied we will check whether the entered year is divisible by 4 and it is not divisible by a century so guys let us write this Python program in vs code so over here what we will be doing is we will take the input from the user and store it inside the ER so it is equal to we take the input and then we say enter the here so user will be entering the year now this input function takes the input from the user as a string data type so we need to convert it into the integer so what we will do is we will provide the end function and enclose the entire input within this open and close parenthesis so over here we have the prefix as the end function now we have the year inside this year variable as the integer so what we have to do is first of all we need to check whether this year is divisible by 100 so over here we will say here percent 100 is it equal to 0 and if yes then we also have to check whether it is divisible by 400 so over here we will say end and then again we will say here percent 400 is it equal to 0 this time so guys basically when the year is divisible by 100 and it is also divisible by 400 then it is a leap year so over here we will simply print the statement that is entered year so we say enter third year and then we will also print the ear that is entered by the user and then we will say is a leaf here in this case and Then followed by dot format and then we will provide this year variable inside the format function so guys over here we will get entered year and then the year that is being entered by the user is a leap year for which this condition is satisfied now guys if this condition is not satisfied we will also have to check whether the entered year is divisible by 4 so over here what we will do is we will again provide the alif condition and then we will say here percent 4 is it equal to 0 and then we will also say whether this year percent hundred so we need to check whether year percent hundred is not equal to 0 this time we will say not equal to 0 so it is divisible by 4 but it is not divisible by 100 then also it is a leap year so over here again we will print the same statement that is has entered here is a leap year so I'll just copy this and paste this over here so Guys these are the two conditions first of all if the year is a century ear which means it is divisible by 100 and if it is also divisible by 400 then only it is a leap year and if it is not divisible by 100 but it is divisible by 4 then also it is a leap year now guys for all the other conditions the entered year is not a leap year so we will say else in this case and then again we will print the same statement but we will change the labels I'll just copy and paste this over here and then we will say entered here the year will be displayed is not a leap year this time so we will say not a leap year so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see user is being asked to enter the ER so we will say 2000 and let us check whether this is the leap year or not so when we press enter as you can see entered year 2000 is a leap year why so so if we check the first condition that is year percent hundred is it equal to 0 yes in this case because 2000 can be divided by 0 over here and also year person 400 is equal to 0 because 2000 is perfectly divisible by 400 this time and that is why we are getting this as a leap year now guys let us run this code once again we will check whether 2022 that is the last year was it a leap year so let's provide 2022 so as you can see entered year 2022 is not a leap year why so because first condition is not satisfying it is not a century here secondly it is not divisible by 4 as well so this condition is also not getting satisfied so the last statement that is remaining is entered here is not a leap year and that is what we are getting now guys let me just run this code once again let us check whether 2020 is a leave here or not so when we press enter as you can see entered year 2020 is a leap year so guys this condition that is year percent 4 is equal to 0 this thing is getting satisfied because 2020 is perfectly divisible by 4 and it is not divisible by 100 and that is why we are getting this that is entered here is a leap year now guys let us check another input so let me just run this code once again we will provide 2016 as the year so guys what will be the output of this whether it is a leap year or not comment in the comment section below as a homework for you so guys you can practice on your own write this code and check for this year that is 2016 whether it is a leap year or not and comment in the comment section below let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe
