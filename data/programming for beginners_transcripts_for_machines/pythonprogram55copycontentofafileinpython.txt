hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to copy the file content from one file to another file so guys this Python program will help you to copy the content of one file to another file that is from source to destination we will use the sh util module so guys this is one of the important modules in the Python program which is having copy file function which can help us in order to copy the content from one file to another file so let us check this with the help of example now over here so what we are going to do is we are going to import the sh util module so we use the from keyword and then we have sh util in this case so guys inside this module we are going to have the copy file function so we use the import function and then we say copy file so guys this is one of the ways in order to import the function from a particular module if we don't want to import the entire module but only want to import a particular a function from a module we can use this statement by using the from keyword and Then followed by the module name and then we use the import keyword and then the function that we want to import and then guys what we can do is simply we can use this copy file function in order to copy the content from one file to another file so over here it takes two parameters the first parameter will be the source file and then the second parameter will be the destination file so guys I have two files over here that is the output file which is going to be the source file over here right now so when I open this file as you can see it is having certain statements that is this is first line and then we have this a second line and then we have this is another statement over here so this is some test content that I have written in the output file what we are going to do is all these statements we are going to copy from the output file and paste it inside the test file over here as you can see so if I open this test file it is not having any content right now so we we are going to copy the content from the output file to the test file by using the copy file function over here so let us move to the vs code right now so the very first thing is it is expecting the source file so inside the double quotes we provide the entire path of this directory over here so I'll simply copy this and paste this and then guys in order to escape this backslash we have to provide another backslash over here so I'll quickly provide the extra backslash in front of the single backslashes and then guys we again provide the double backslash and then the name of the file so which is the output.txt so I'll simply copy this and paste this over here this is the output followed by Dot and then we have txt now guys the second parameter will be the destination file so over here I provide comma and then I come to the next line so that it becomes more readable and then again since the destination file that is the test file is present in the same directory I am going to provide the same directory over here once again so I'll copy this and paste this over here and then again I'll escape this backslash character once again on all the instances now guys in the end we have to provide the destination file over here which is test file right now so we have test dot txt in this case so we have test.txt so guys basically the first parameter is the output.txt file the entire path of this file and then we have the test.txt so both these parameters are provided in the copy file right now so guys what we will do is after this we can simply have the print statement over here and then we can simply say file content copy successfully so get we get certain message about the success of this operation in order to copy the content of one file into another file so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting file content copied successfully now we have to go inside that directory and open this file that is a test file which is the destination file so when I open this as you can see we are getting the content of that file which was present inside the output so let me open that output file as well so these were the statements and then the same statements we are getting in the test file as well so as you can see we are getting this is first line and then we have this is second line and then we have this is another statement so guys in this way we can easily copy the content of one file to another file by using the copy file function inside the sh util module now guys what happens if we copy the content of another file to the same test file over here currently it is having certain content so whether it will append the new statements from the new source file or whether it will overwrite the entire content let us check this so basically as you can see we have another file that is the names file it is having the list of certain names over here so what we are going to do is we are going to use this file as the source file now so I'll simply open the vs code over here instead of output.txt we will send provide names.txt so that our source file right now is different that is the names file the destination file is same that is a test file so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see file content copied successfully if I come over here in the directory and open this test file once again as you can see we are getting the names now and the previous content of the output file has been overwritten now so guys this is important functionality whenever you are using the copy file function the entire content will be overwritten in the destination file if it is having any content and let's say if this file is not present let's say I delete this file so what will happen whether the Python program will help us in order to create that file and copy the content from that file let us check that so I'll just run this code once again over here when this file is not present right now that is the test.txt is not present in the directory that we have mentioned so when I run this code as you can see it says file content copied successfully when I come over again in the directory so test file is being created right now so if there is no file that is created a new file will be created and inside that we will get the content of the source file so guys this is the functionality of the copy file function inside the sh util so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to concatenate to list so stay tuned
