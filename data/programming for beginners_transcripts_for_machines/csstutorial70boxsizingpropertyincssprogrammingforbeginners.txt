so now we will see box sizing property in CSS so guys basically the CSS box sizing property allows us to include the padding and the Border in an HTML elements total width and height so guys this we are going to check with the help of examples as well so by default we have seen so far the width and height of an element is calculated like below so basically whatever width we provide to the HTML element that is considered and then the padding and the border is also considered in order to to calculate the actual width of the HTML element similar cases with the height attribute as well so when we have the height of the HTML element the padding and the border is also added in order to calculate the actual height of the element so guys we can simply use the Box sizing property in order to avoid the confusion and also include the padding and the Border within the width and height that is already specified for the HTML element so guys let us move to the vs code over here and simply inside the HTML file we are going to create two div tags over here the first div tag is having the class name that is div 1 in this case and then we will say this is a sample diff one over here and then similarly we will have another diff tag with the class that is div 2 in this case so basically we will have div 2 and then over here as well we will update it as div 2 over here apart from this between both the diff Texs we will have the line break so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have SIMPLE statements that is this is a sample div 1 and Sample div 2 over here now guys let us provide certain styling inside the style. CSS file so for the very first class that is d one over here we will specify the width of 300 pixels in this case and a height of 100 pixels over here and then apart from this we will also set the border so let's say we have two pixels solid border with the color that is black color over here now guys similarly we will provide the CSS properties for the second diff tag over here that is having the class name diff 2 in this case and again we are going to have the width and height that is 300 pixels and 100 pixels respectively we will have the different color border and for the Border part we will have a different color so let's say we have the Border color is blue color over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have the first diff tag which is having the width as 300 pixels and the height as 100 pixels over here and for the div two tag as well we have the same width and height values over here we have a different border color in this case that is blue color now guys what we will do is let us provide certain padding to this particular diff tag that is the second diff tag over here so simply inside the diff two selector we will have the padding CSS selector and let's say we have 20 pixels as padding so guys what will happen is apart from the width and height of this particular diff tag the padding number will also be added and it will increase the width and height of the diff tag so let us check that as well so when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser if you notice now the size of this particular diff tag that is the second diff tag over here is more compared to the first diff tag and if you notice in the code we have the same width and height value over here that is 300 pixels and 100 pixels for the div 1 and div 2 as well so as you can see the width and height of div 2 is also 300 and 100 pixels respectively so guys this is the issue as far as the width and height of the HTML elements are concerned on the same page so in order to avoid this issue simply we can use the Box sizing CSS property over here so guys when we say box sizing we have the value as border box in which case the padding attribute will also be included within the width and height that you have already specified over here within this selector so when we save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser if you see now the exact width and height of this particular diff tag that is diff 2 is 3 100 pixels respectively since we have provided the Box sizing as border box so guys basically the content and the padding will be adjusted accordingly apart from that the Border will be also adjusted in such a way that the actual width and height of this particular diff tag should be 300 pixels and 100 pixels now guys if you notice the first diff tag is little bit larger as far as the width is concerned compared to the second diff tag why so because the border of two pixels is taking the extra space over here for the first div tag so again if we provide the Box sizing CSS property for the first div tag over here and we provide the value as border box this particular issue should get resolved so let me just save this file now and when we reload this page so now if you notice the width of this particular div 1 is exactly the same as that of the div 2 HTML element over here that's because we are using the Box sizing equal to border box for both these diff tags in this case so guys in this way in order to avoid the confusion and to be consistent as far as the width and height of the HTML elements are concerned it is very important that you use the Box sizing CSS property for all the HTML elements so instead of providing it to individual CSS selectors across the multiple CSS selectors over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again without the Box sizing CSS property you will notice that the dimensions are different but simply you can have the universal selector over here with the help of the star and then in this case you can simply provide the Box sizing to all the CSS selectors over here so simply with this particular single line of code within the universal selector the dimensions of all the HTML elements will be consistent so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see the width and height of both these diff tags are same that is 300 pixels and 100 pixels respectively and apart from this the second div is also having the required padding of 20 pixels that we have provided provided over here so guys in this way you can easily use the Box sizing CSS property in order to be consistent as far as the dimensions of the HTML elements are concerned in your project this will help you in order to include the padding and the Border withd as well within the width and the height of the HTML element so
