hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to find the largest among the three numbers so guys let's say you are given the three numbers and you want to find what is the largest number out of those three numbers so we are going to see how we can write a Python program in order to find the largest number among the three numbers over here so guys let us move to the vs code now the very first thing that we have to do is we have to take the three numbers as the input from the user so let's say we provide a num1 it is equal to we take the input function in order to take the input from the user so we will say enter first number over here followed by colon now guys the number that will be entered by the user will be of the string data type since this input takes a string data type by default so what we will do is we will convert it into the float number so over here we simply have to prefix the float function so that the entered string by the user is converted into float and then it is stored in this num one variable now guys similarly we will have num2 and num3 variables as well in order to take the three numbers as the input so this time we will say num2 and then num3 and over here we will change the label to enter second number and over here we will say enter third number this time so guys user will enter three numbers one at a time for second and third number now guys we have to provide a logic in order to find which of the numbers is the highest number over here so what we will do is we will provide the if condition and we will check whether this first number is it greater than second number or not so we will say num1 is it greater than num2 and again we will also check whether this number that is first number is greater than third number as well so we will say num1 is it greater than num3 so over here what we are doing is num1 is greater than num2 and num1 is greater than num3 if both these conditions are getting satisfied that means this number that is the first number is the largest number so over here we will simply provide the print statement and we will say first number is largest so simply we have found that the first number is largest over here now guys if any of the conditions is not satisfying out of this if condition what we have to do is the control flow will come over here in the alif part and again we will provide this time we will compare the second number over here so we will say whether num2 is it greater than num1 so over here we are checking whether this number 2 isn't greater than number one and again it will be compared with the number three as well so we will provide end and we will say num2 is it greater than num3 so guys first time what we have done is the first number was being compared by the second number and the third number if both the conditions are satisfied then the first number is largest or else second time what we have done is the second number was being compared by the first number and the third number and if both the conditions are getting satisfied then the second number is largest so over here we will simply copy this statement and paste this over here and we have to change the label to second number is largest this time and then guys if both the conditions are not getting satisfied in the If part and the alif part then the third number is largest so over here what we will do is we will come to else part and again we will print the same statement and then we will change the label to third number is largest over here so guys this is the program in order to find the largest number among the three numbers that is being entered by the user so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so what we will do is first of all we will enter the first number as 1 enter second number S2 and enter third number as 3 and when we press enter as you can see third number is largest because three number that is entered third time is largest out of all the three numbers that is one two and three now guys let me just run this code once again this time we will enter the first number in such a way that it is the largest number so let me put 3 as the first number then 2 is the second number and one is the third number so this time the first number is largest and that is what we should get the response so when we press enter as you can see first number is largest we are getting as the output in the terminal now let us run this code once again this time we will put the largest number as the second number so that we get this output that is second number is largest so over here first of all we will provide 2 as the first number 3 as the second number and let's say 0 as the third number so as you can see second number is largest that's because it is equal to 3 and the other two numbers are 0 and 2. so guys in this way we can easily find the largest number among the three numbers that is entered by the user let us run this code once again over here and we will provide the first number as 10 second number is 7 and third number is 12. so guys what will be the output which is the largest number out of all these three numbers comment in the comment section below as a homework for you let us see whether your answer is correct or not please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to check whether the entered number is a prime number so stay tuned
