hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to sort words in alphabetical order so guys in this program you will learn to sort the words in the alphabetical order using the for Loop and display it so guys as you can see for example we have this my string variable and we have these words inside the string so what we are going to do is we are going to sort all these words alphabetically and display it on the console using the Python program so basically the word starting with a should come first and then followed by B and then so on all the words should be sorted and must be displayed over here so guys let us check this with the help of the Python program in the vs code so what we will do is first of all we will Define the string so I'll simply copy this line of code over here and paste this in which we have the mystr variable and this is the string that we have now guys in order to sort all these words in the alphabetical order we need to first split them by using the split function that is present with this my string variable and then store it inside the list by transforming all the words to the lower case so guys as we can observe over here we are having some capital letters as well at the start of the string since the ASCII values of the capital letters will be less compared to those of the small letters we want to trade all of them as the lowercase letters so what we will be doing is first of all we will be splitting this entire string using the space characters over here so we will use my string followed by Dot and then we have the split function so guys this will help us in order to return all these words which are separated by the space characters and then guys what we will be doing is we use the for Loop and then for each word in this my string dot split function so basically all the words are being assigned to this word over here now and then this word needs to be converted to the lower case so over here we will say word followed by a DOT and then we will say lower now guys what exactly is happening over here is first of all we are splitting this my string to individual words over here and each word is being converted to the lower case by using this word dot lower and then guys what we will be doing is we will store it inside the list so over here we are enclosing this entire line of code with the open and closed square brackets and then before this we will have words as the name of the variable so guys basically what exactly is happening is all the words over here that are present inside these strings is being converted to the lowercase letters and it is being stored in this words list now guys simply we can use the sort function inside the list over here so we will say words followed by Dot and then we have something called as sort which will help us in order to sort all the words alphabetically and then guys after using the sort method we will have all the words inside the words variable being sort alphabetically so what we can do is simply we will use the for Loop once again forward in words and then we can print all these words so over here we will say print and then print this word followed by comma and then we can have the end parameter as well which will have the space character so over here all the words will be separated using the space characters and it will not go to the next line so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting the entire string inside which all the words are being sorted alphabetically so as you can see we have a followed by C and then we have e h i and then L and then T and then W so guys basically the first character is being checked whether it is small or not followed by the second character and then so on all the words are being sorted alphabetically over here we can also print the original string as well what we can do is simply have the print statement and we can say orange null so train in this case followed by colon and then we can have my string over here this will help us in order to print the original string as well so as you can see this is the original string and this is the string after having all the words being alphabetically sorted inside that string so guys this is one of the important python programs that you can be asked while you are going for an interview as well so please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs the way that we have split the words by using the split function over here and then taking each word at a time and then converting it into a lower case just by using one line of code in Python proves that how easily we can achieve simple task in the Python programming language so make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to illustrate different set operations so stay tuned
