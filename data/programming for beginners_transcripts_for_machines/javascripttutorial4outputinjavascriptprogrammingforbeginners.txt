so now we will see output in JavaScript so guys there are multiple ways in order to provide the output in JavaScript some of them we have already seen previously so let us go through them once again so guys first of all we have something called as inner HTML so guys let us check how we can use the inner HTML with the help of example over here so let me just remove the previous lines of code that we had written in the HTML and the JavaScript files in this case now guys simply inside the body tag of the HTML web page we are going to have the diff tag along with certain statement so let us say we have programming for beginners as the statement over here inside the diff tag which is the name of this YouTube channel that you should definitely subscribe in order to learn more about the JavaScript so guys this is a statement inside the diff tag over here and let us also provide the ID for this particular diff tag and we give the value as demo over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have programming for beginners that is getting printed on the web page now guys what is the usage of this inner HTML so basically we find one of the HTML elements on the web page so let's say we have this HTML element that is having the value programming for beginners and we replace it with another statement over here inside this HTML element and this can be achieved by using the inner HTML property so guys let us check that how we can achieve it so inside the test.js file we need to provide our JavaScript code before which we need to link the Javascript file with this particular HTML file over here so simply we use the script tag along with the SRC attribute and we provide the name of the Javascript file that we are going to write that is test.js file now guys let me just provide the statement inside the test.js file over here so simply we will make use of the document followed by Dot and then we will say query selector so over here we are going to make use of the ID of the HTML element that is demo in this case so let me just copy this ID and inside the query selector inside the single code over here we need to provide the hash character since we are making use of the ID value of the HTML element and Then followed by the ID value over here so guys this particular statement will help us in order to identify the HTML element that we want to update so let us verify that by using the console.log statement over here so simply we enclose this entire statement that we had written inside the console.log statement in this case let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see on the right hand side under the console section of the web browser we can see the diff tag with the ID that is demo and then we have the programming for beginners string over here now guys we want to change the content of this particular diff tag so what we can do is simply we can make use of the inner HTML property which is one of the output statements in JavaScript so guys in this case simply inside the JavaScript code over here we are going to remove the console. log statement and then after we have identified the HTML element which we are getting over here on the console simply we are going to append dot followed by Inner HTML property so as you can see this is the property that we are going to use and Then followed by the assignment operator that is equal to operator over here and then inside the double or the single code we can provide our statement to be printed inside the def tag so simply we will say this is a diff tag updated by JavaScript so guys over here we have this updated statement this is a diff tag updated by JavaScript over here let me just save this file now and when we reload this page instead of having programming for beginners we will have this statement that is this is a diff tag up updated by JavaScript over here so let me just reload this page in this case so as you can see this is a div tag updated by JavaScript now guys in real case scenario we won't be having the inner HTML directly under the JavaScript code over here since it is updating the HTML element on the page load so basically we are going to have a button inside the HTML web page and when the user clicks on that particular button the JavaScript code that we have written over here in order to update the the statement will be called in order to update the content on the web page so guys we will check this in the upcoming sessions as well but this is a very simple example as far as the inner HTML property is concerned now guys apart from this we also have something called as document. right so over here what we can do is let me just comment out this line of code over here simply we can make use of control+ for/ as the keyboard shortcut in order to provide this particular single line command on the vs code now after this let me just save this file now we will have the original statement on the web browser so as you can see programming for beginners is getting printed over here that's because we have commented out this line of code which is not getting executed and comments are one of the best ways in order to provide certain instructions to other programmers when they are going to read your JavaScript code now guys let us try this particular statement that is document. WR now guys what is the meaning of this document. WR so guys basically it is going to add another St statement to your existing file over here inside the HTML so guys let us check that as well so over here what we will do is simply inside the Javascript file in this case we will provide document followed by Dot and then we will say write method over here and then inside the parenthesis we are going to either have double or single codes over here and then we will say new statement in this case so let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser as you can see we have programming for big us and in this case we have the other line that is new statement over here which is added with the help of this document. write method in this case now guys it is very important to note that after loading the particular HTML web page you should not call this document. write function because it will replace the entire content of the web page so in order to understand this let us have couple of more diff tags over here and what we will do is simply I'm going to remove the ID attribute from these two D tag so we have these three div tags over here let me just save this file now and try reloading this web page once again on the browser so as you can see all these three statements are now getting printed now guys let us have button over here after the last diff tag in this case so simply we will have button with the text that is Click me over here let me just save this file now and when we reload this page you can see that we have a button over here now guys it is not recommended that you should use the document. WR after the page is loaded in this case so basically the entire page is loaded now but let's say on the click functionality of this particular button you have the document. write function so basically we are going to have the onclick attribute which is one of the attributes of the button HTML element and inside this particular onclick attribute we are going to have the JavaScript code which is document followed by Dot and then we have the right function over here and then let's say we have the same statement that is new statement m in this case so guys basically what we are trying to do is when the user clicks on this particular button we are going to call the JavaScript code that is document. write and it is going to write the new statement over here so basically this JavaScript code will be executed after the entire page is loaded on the web page which is not recommended since it is going to replace the entire content of the web page so guys let us check that so when we save this file now and try reloading this page so as you can see we have all the statements over here but when we click on this particular button that is Click me so as you can see new statement is getting printed over here and all the previous statements got replaced by this particular new statement so guys this is the reason that it is not recommended in order to make use of this document. write function after the page is loaded since it is going to replace the entire content of the existing page now guys apart from this we also have something called as alert over here which will help first in order to provide the output using the windows alert so guys let us check that as well so instead of having the document. WR statement simply we can make use of the alert function over here so guys this is another JavaScript function that will help us in order to provide certain statement inside the windows alert so let us say we provide certain statement that is this is a alert window so guys basically inside the parenthesis of the alert function we have the single codes and then inside that we have the statement this is alert window so when we save this file now basically we need to click on this button once again in order to make this alert appear over here so when we reload this page once again in this case and when we click on this particular button that is Click me you can see there's a window alert that is appearing and it is having the content this is alert window so guys in this way you can also provide the alerts as well if you want to add this particular feature based on your project requirements as apart from this we have already seen the usage of the console.log that is the fourth statement as part of the output in JavaScript so Guys these are some of the statements that you can use in order to provide the output in JavaScript apart from this we also have something called as text content and inner text as well which provides the same functionality similar to Inner HTML but there are certain differences so those differences we are going to check in the upcoming videos as well so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned learn something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well I'll see you in the next video in which we are going to cover an exercise in order to find the sum of numbers that is entered by the user using JavaScript so stay tuned
