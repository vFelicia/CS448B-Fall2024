hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to convert kilometers to miles so guys easily we can convert the distance from kilometers to miles or vice versa by using the conversion rates so while converting the kilometers to miles there is a conversion rate of 0.6 to 1371 so guys this is the conversion rate so basically when we provide one kilometer it is equal to so many miles so we can simply multiply the kilometers with this particular number that we have to get the distance in miles and similarly for converting the miles to kilometers we have the conversion rate of this number that is 1.60934 so guys let us first check how we can convert the kilometers to miles over here so let us move to the vs code over here so what we will do is we will ask the user in order to enter the distance in kilometers so over here we can simply provide km as the variable name followed by equal to and then what we can do is we can provide the input function and we will ask the user to enter distance in kilometers now guys the kilometer distance can be a float value as well instead of an integer so what we have to do is this number that will be provided by the user will be of the string data type so we have to convert it to the flow data type so what we will do is before this input we will provide float function and then the entire input needs to be enclosed within the float function so what this thing will do is it will convert the input that is entered by the user to the float number and the float number will be assigned to this km variable which will be kilometers now guys what we have to do is we can simply provide miles over here it is equal to we can say km followed by multiplication and then we can simply provide this conversion rates over here just copy this conversion rate and paste this over here so basically one kilometer it is equal to so many miles over here and similarly whatever kilometer we put it will be multiplied by this convert version rate and then it will be assigned to the miles so guys what we can do is we can simply provide the print function and then we can say distance of and then we will provide the number that is entered by the user as the input which will be stored in the km and Then followed by we say kilometers over here so we have kilometers followed by S and then again the distance is miles over here in this case so we will provide this variable as the second parameter which will be displayed over here instead of this curly braces and then after this we will have miles over here and then after this ring we will provide format and we will provide both these variables that is KM for kilometers which will be displayed over here and then the miles variable as the second parameter the value for which will be displayed over here instead of curly braces so what we have to do is we provide km followed by miles in this case so guys this is the very easy way in order to convert the kilometers to miles so let me just save this file now and try running this code first of all we are going to see what is 1 one kilometer in miles so we provide one kilometer over here and when we press enter simply we will get distance of 1.0 kilometers is 0.621371 miles in this case so guys basically we are getting this number since this km value is 1 right now now guys let us say we provide the kilometers as 5 so over here I'll run this code once again and for five kilometers it is how many miles in distance so when we press enter it says distance of 5 kilometers is 3.106855 so guys basically this conversion rate is coming into picture when we are multiplying the kilometer number that is entered by the user now guys similarly we can convert from miles to kilometers that is vice versa by using this conversion rate that is 1.60934 so guys this conversion of miles to kilometers in distance I leave up to you as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own so please practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit so stay tuned
