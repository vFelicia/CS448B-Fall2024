so now we will see Turner operator in JavaScript so guys basically Turner operator in JavaScript is used in order to check for certain condition that is similar to the if else conditional statement that we had seen previously so guys basically this turn operator can be an alternative for the if else conditional statement that we had seen previously so you can use this with the help of this particular syntax as you can see first of all we have to provide certain expression over here so basically the result of this expression will be either true or false just like in the if condition we provide certain expression similarly we have to provide the expression in the tary operator as well so guys basically after this expression we have to provide the question mark And Then followed by the lines of code that needs to be executed when the expression is true so guys as you can see this is the Block in which case you will execute if the expression is true over here so if this expression is true these l lines of code will be executed or else basically we have the colon over here after which we have another set of lines of code in which case when the expression is false then these lines of code will be executed on the right hand side so guys basically we have two special characters over here first of all we have the question mark after the expression and then we have the colon over here which is provided after the line of code that is executed when the expression is true so guys let us check this with the help of example in vs code over here so basically what we will do is let us say we Define a variable with the help of the let keyword over here and let's say we provide the variable name as age so let's say your age is 21 years old so what we will do is we will check whether the age is greater than or equal to 18 years and then only the person will be allowed to vote so guys basically we will have another variable over here and we will name this variable as a result and then we provide equal to operator and then guys we will use the Turner operator in order to check whether the person based on the age will be allowed to vote or not so we will provide the expression in this case we will say age is greater than or equal to 18 so basically this is the expression that we have provided after which we can provide the question mark over here and then if this particular expression is true let us provide this expression within the parenthesis so that it looks more decent over here and the code is more readable so guys if this expression is true we have to provide the string that is eligible to vote so simply inside the codes over here we will say eligible to vote so as you can see this is the string that we are providing to the result variable and if this expression is not true then we have to provide the colon over here after which we can simply provide not eligible to vote so basically we have another string over here that is not eligible to vote in this case so guys as you can see this is the expression which will either return true or false and then based on the result of this expression if it is true then this particular string will be returned to the result variable and if it is false then not eligible to vote string will be returned to the result and then guys simply we can provide the console. log statement inside which we can simply print the result over here so guys let me just save this file now and since the age is 21 right now it is greater than 18 over here so let us see what will be the output so simply we will type node command over here followed by the name of the Javascript file on the terminal so as you can see eligible to vote is getting printed over here that's because age greater than or equal to 18 is returning us the True Value now guys let us provide another age so let's say the age that we provide is 16 over here so in this case this particular expression is not true so let us see what will be the output on the terminal when we save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see it's says not eligible to vote so in this way we can easily use the Turner operator instead of the if else conditional statements that we have seen previously now guys you can also provide more Turner operators inside these lines of code that you have provided so let's say we want to put a condition if the age is greater than 18 then the person is eligible to vote but we also want to put another condition if the age is greater than or equal to 25 then the person is also eligible to drink so guys what we have to to do over here is simply I'm going to remove this part that is eligible to vote and then again we will put another condition over here so let us say we provide age is greater than or equal to 25 so first of all if age is greater than or equal to 18 if this particular statement is true then the control flow will come over here and then it will again check whether age is greater than or equal to 25 so guys over here we will have another set of statements so after this we need to provide question mark over here so we will provide certain statement over here if this particular condition is true and if not then we will provide colon and then again we will have another statement over here in order to make this conditional statement more clear we will have parenthesis at the start and at the end so as you can see we have two conditional statements in this case first of all age is greater than or equal to 18 if it is true then this entire conditional statement will be executed and if not then this particular statement will be returned so guys over here if age is greater than or equal to 25 we will say eligible to vote and drink so guys basically we have this particular statement and for the false statement we will say eligible to vote but not to drink so as you can see I have divided this conditional statement into multiple lines over here so first of all we have this particular expression if this is true then this line of code will be executed if it is false which means we have provided a colon over here then this particular string will be returned to the result variable over here and inside the true statement over here we are having another conditional statement if the age is greater than or equal to 25 then it is going to return eligible to vote and drink and if not then eligible to vote but not to drink in this case so let me just save this file now currently the age is 16 so let us see what will be the output as you can see not eligible to vote is getting printed over here now guys let us say we provide the age is 22 so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again as you can see eligible to vote but not to drink is getting printed that's because even though age is greater than or equal to 18 but this particular statement that is age is greater than or equal to 25 is false over here and that is why this particular statement is getting returned and stored in the result variable now guys let us provide another age that is 25 over here in which case this age greater than or equal to 25 will be true so so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here as you can see eligible to vote and drink is getting printed over here that's because this particular string is getting returned and stored in the result variable so guys in this way you can use more Turner operators within a single Turner operator over here just like how we have the if else conditional statements inside which we can have the else if conditions as well so guys what will be the output if the age is equal to 24 over here comment in the comment section below below let us see whether
