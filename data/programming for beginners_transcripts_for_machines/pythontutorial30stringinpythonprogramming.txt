hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about string in Python Programming so guys in computer programming a string is a sequence of characters so for example as you can see this hello word it is the string which is the sequence of characters that is h e double l o so this is a string containing the sequence of these characters and we call it as a string now we use the single quotes or double quotes to represent a string in Python so basically whenever we are defining a string we use the sequence of characters which are supposed to be enclosed Within These double quotes or else we can use the single quotes as well so as you can see for example Str that is the variable name that we have taken over here followed by the equal to operator we have the string that is programming for beginners which is the name of the YouTube channel which you should definitely subscribe and this is enclosed within the two double quotes over here so let us check this with the help of example now we have Str it is equal to inside the double we can provide our strength that is programming for beginners over here and then simply we can print the string by using the print function so we have print followed by open and close parenthesis and then we provide this Str variable name let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see programming for beginners is getting printed now now what are the different operations how do we access string characters in Python so let's say if I only want to print this character that is p over here how can we do that so one way in order to do that is by using the indexing which means we can use the index number basically the indexes that we have seen in the list and Tuple in the previous videos are also applicable over here for Strings as well so this letter that is p can be accessed by using the index number which starts from 0 so this is the zeroth index number which defines this P character the next character that is R it is at the first index number and then the next character is at the second index number and so on so we can simply use the variable name and then in inside the open and close square brackets we can provide the index number so over here after the variable name inside the open and close square brackets as you can see we provide the index number that is 0 which will point to this character that is p over here so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see p is getting printed over here now let's say we want this o to be printed so what is the index number for this so the first one is zeroth index and then we have first index over here and then this o is at the second index number so we provide number 2 that is inside the open and close square brackets let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see o is getting printed and in this way if you want to access a single character from the string you can use the index number in order to access them now there is another variation we can also use the negative indexing which means the negative index numbers can also be used in order to access the last elements of the string so let let's say if you want to access the last element first element is having the index number 0 and the previous index number that is before the number 0 we have minus 1 in the number system so minus 1 will refer to the last element inside this sequence of characters which is s over here so when we provide minus 1 in this case inside the open and close brackets so let me just save this file and try running this code as you can see s is getting granted so minus 1 is pointing to this character that is s what will be the second last character it will be minus 2 in this case so when we provide minus 2 save this file and try running this code so as you can see this R is getting printed over here and in this way we have the negative indexing Concept in Python Programming now there is another way we can use the slicing operator in order to print the subset of this sequence of characters so let's say if we only want this programming word to be printed instead of programming for beginners that is the entire ring so what we can do is so we have to mention the indices in order to print these characters only so it starts from 0 and then we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and then we have to take extra index number that is 11th as well because at last index number is not included whenever we are using the slicing operator so the indices will be between 0 to 11 in this case so how do we provide that range we provide 0 first that is the left hand side index followed by the colon and then we provide 11 that is the second index up to which all the characters must be taken and printed over here so as you can see this is the slicing of the sequence of characters let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see programming is getting printed over here let's say we want to include the characters up to F so we have to provide the index up to O over here so basically this was the 11th index and then we have 12 and then 13 so over here what we can do is we can simply provide 13 in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see programming word is getting considered and then after that we have the space and then f is also considered which is at the 12th index there is another way we can do this instead of providing this zero index we can just remove this so by default it will take from the start of the string that is all the characters starting from the zeroth index over here so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see again we are getting the same output that is programming up to the F character over here what if we want from this o character which is at the 13th position up to the last position so what we can do is we can simply provide the 13th index number which will start the string from this particular character and Then followed by colon and there is no need to provide the last index because we want all the characters to be included so this is the slicing operator first we have the 13 index number and then colon over here let me just save this file now and try running this code so you can see after F we are getting o r over here and then we have the space character and then we have the beginners as well so this is the way that we can use the slicing in Python in order to get the substring from the entire string that we have already defined now guys very important python strings are immutable so in Python strings are immutable that means the characters of a string cannot be changed so let's say this first character that is p if we want to change that character so what we will do is we will provide Str and Then followed by 0 and then instead of this P character let's say I want to provide the character Q over here and then let me just print the string once again so we will simply print the string let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting the type error string object does not support item assignment so we cannot change any of the characters over here but there is another way to do this what we can do is simply we can copy this entire string value and paste this over here and then again instead of P we we can provide Q over here but this time we have to remove this index number so this is possible because we are providing the reassignment of the string variable so let us check this we'll save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting Q over here and all the other characters are same so basically by immutable we mean that we cannot change a particular Single Character inside the string by using the index number for that particular character but in case if you want to reassign the entire string that can be done by using such reassignments operator now guys there is another important functionality in Python multiline strings are allowed so basically we can also create a multiline string in Python so for this we use the triple double quotes or triple single quotes over here so what we will do is let's say I'll just remove these lines of code and then I'll say Str it is equal to 3 times double quotes over here we will use and then I will say this is first line and then on the next line we will say this is another line so this is basically the multiline string that we have defined so how do we print this simply by using the normal wave that is print function followed by the name of the string that is Str variable let me just save this file and try running this code as you can see the format in which we have returned the string that is the three double quotes were there over here followed by on the next line we were having this is first line and then this is another line and then we were having another double quotes over here so these double quotes followed by space characters and then between those space characters this is another line if we don't want these base characters soon after the double quotes are being mentioned we have to provide the strings over here so the start of the double quotes at the same line we are having this is first line and this is another line and then we have the three double quotes on that same line so let me just save this file now and try running this code so basically this is the format so whatever format we follow in the this three double quotes or three single quotes the same format will be followed while printing those lines on the terminal now what are the python string operations basically you can compare two strings with the equal to operator over here as you can see so let's say we have two streams over here string one it is equal to let's say we have John and then string two it is equal to let's say we have the name Theta over here so we have free talk so what we will do is simply we will print str1 it is equal to str2 so this is nothing but we are comparing two strings by using the equal to equal to operator which we have done previously as well while we were using the relational operators in order to compare two numbers we can compare two strings in the same way as well it will either return true or false based on whether they are equal or not so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting false that's because the names are different so what if we make the names same so I'll just copy this value and paste this over here now both the strings are same SDR 1 and str2 both are having the value that is John so let me just run this code now as we can see we are getting true over here that's because both the strings are same in this case now there is another operation how do we join the two or more strings so we can do so by using the plus operator so let's say we go back over here once again we provide the string to S Peter and we want to join both the strings so in this case instead of equal to equal to what we will do is we will specify the string 1 that is str1 and then plus operator and Then followed by str2 in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see we are getting John Peter over here continuously there is no space character so either we can provide a space character over here or else we can have the space character inside the print function as well so we can have the double quotes inside which we can have the space character and then again we have to use the plus operator in order to join these strings so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have getting John Peter and then there is a space character in between so we can join multiple strings as well by using the plus operator over here the same plus operator will be used in order to add two numbers if these variables are numbers but in our case these variables are strings and that is why it is being used in order to join the two strings in this case now how do we iterate through a python string so basically we can iterate through a string by using the for Loop so let us check this with the help of example now let's say we have string 1 over here we provide for followed by S which is a temporary variable and then we have the in keyword followed by str1 I'll just make this as item so that it is more user friendly in order to understand so basically str1 which is having the sequence of characters one character at a time will be assigned to this item variable and the control flow will go inside this for Loop now inside this we can simply have the item being printed so when we provide item over here inside the print function and when we say save this file and try running this code as you can see all the characters that is j o h n these are getting printed on separate lines how do we get them on the same line so what we can do is we can provide the end operator equal to we can simply provide the double quotes and we don't have to provide anything over here if we want to separate all the characters with a comma we can provide comma over here as well so let me save this file and try running this code as you can see John is getting printed but all the characters are getting separated using the comma we can simply remove this comma over here I'll save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting John over here so since we have provided this end parameter with nothing but simply double quotes we are getting all the characters or else when we don't provide this parameter by default the end parameter is having the slash n character due to which all the items will be printed on the new lines there is another important thing how do we find the python string length so basically we can use the Len method to find the length of the string so let's say we have programming for beginner string over here so I'll just type programming for beginners and we want to find the length of the string that means how many characters are present inside the string so we can simply use the Len function that is the length function in order to print the count of the characters inside the string so we can have the Len function followed by inside the open and close parenthesis we have the variable name that is Str over here so let me just save this file and try running this code so it is saying object of type type has no length so basically we have provided Str over here instead we have to provide str1 which is the variable name so that was the mistake so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see 25 we are getting that is the number of characters that are present inside this string let's say I add some more characters over here I provide one two which means I have added two more characters inside the string so that should be 27 in this case so when we just save this file now and try running this code we get 27 as the count which is the updated count of number of characters in inside the string and that is how this length function will work in order to return you one particular integer which is the count of the number of characters inside the string now guys there is another important thing string membership test so basically this we have already seen we can test if a substring exists within a string or not using the keyword in so we have already used the for loop as well and in the membership operator we have used the in keyword in order to find a particular letter is present or not inside the string so that you can take as a homework for you so that you can practice on your own you can find out whether the character X is present inside the string or not and if it is present then you should display true and if it is not present then you should display false comment in the comment section below what is the output of your program while using this membership operator that is n now guys very important thing there is something called as Escape sequences in Python now the escape sequence is used to escape some of the characters present inside a string so what we have done over here is while profile adding the string we are enclosing it using the double quotes but what if the double quotes is a part of the string let's say I want to provide a double quotes over here before beginners so as you can see after providing the double quotes we are getting a red underline over here which means there is some issue so what we can do is in order to avoid this issue and to make this as a part of the string we have to use the Escape character which means we have to use a backslash character over here just before this special character so this is the way that we use the Escape character we use the backslash character over here once and then followed by our special character which is causing the issue and in this case this double quote will be the part of the string now so let me save this file and try running this code currently we are getting the length of the string what we will do is I'll just remove this length function so that we can print the value of the string so I'll just save this file and try running this code as you can see programming for and then we are getting the double quotes over here which is the part of the string and then we have the beginner as over here so this is the way in case you want to escape certain characters or special characters we can use the backslash which is known as the Escape character in Python Programming now guys there is another way in order to print the string by using the python string formatting so as you can see for example let's say we have the name that is John and we have age it is equal to 25 so one way that we can print both that is name and age is by using the multiple objects inside the print statement so let us check this so we have name over here which is John right now and then let's say we have age it is equal to 25 and we want to print both that is name and age within one print function so what we will do is we will say name is followed by comma and then we provide a name and then again comma and then we have double quotes and then we provide and age is followed by comma and then we have age over here so what we have done is this string will be printed that is name is followed by this name value will be taken from this variable that's because we have provided it outside the double quotes over here and after providing this comma and then again there is a comma and then we have a normal string label that is and ages and then we are specifying the H so this is one way in order to print both that is name and age in the same print statement so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see name is John and ages 25 over here but guys this can be confusing since we have to use multiple commas over here as well as multiple double quotes as well so there is another way in order to print the same string so what we can do is again we can have the print function but this time what we will do is in the open and close Parent Access we provide the F character followed by single quotes over here so inside the single course we can provide the the variable name that is name and age as well so in this case if we want to get the value of this name variable we have to enclose it within the curly braces so these are the curly braces as you can see we have the open and close curly braces and inside this we provide a name over here so if we do it in this way we provide the F character and then inside the single course inside the curly braces we have the name over here it will print the value that is John so let me just save this file and try running this code as you can see John is getting printed which is the value of this name variable now we want to print the entire string that is we also want the labels so before this name that we have provided we can simply provide the string that is name is and Then followed by open and close braces and inside the braces it will be name variable name and then we can simply provide end page is followed by open and close braces and then we can provide the age variable name so guys this is the format we have the F character and inside the single quotes as you can see we have provided the string label that is name is and Then followed by open and close curly braces inside which we provide our variable name and Then followed by and ages or any other string label that you want to Define and then we can have the variable name that is age over here inside the open and close curly braces so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see we have the perfect string that we wanted that is name is John and ages 25 so this is another way we can use the python string formatting by using this F character inside the print function in order to print the string in the way that we want to print so Guys these are certain things as far as strings are
