so now we will see input type date time local in HTML form so guys basically the input tag along with the type attribute that is date time local will help us to specify the date along with the time as well as the input field with no time zone so basically whatever time is being selected by the user it will be the local time for that particular user over here now guys it depends on the browser support so you need to test this particular input tag on the different browsers in order to check whether some of the older browsers are still showing the input type with the date time picker or not so guys some of the older browsers might not support this particular type attribute but majority of the latest browsers will be able to show this date time picker so let us check this with the help of examples in vs code over here so basically previously we had seen how we can use the Color Picker by using the type that is color and also we have seen the date picker by using the type that is date this time we we will be using the type that is date time local over here so again we will be defining the input followed by colon and this time we will be using this date time local over here so when we select this as you can see the type attribute is being selected as the date time local in this case and then for the name attribute we will set it as date time over here so guys this is the name attribute and for the ID attribute as well we will set the string that is date time in this case and before this in we will also set the label as well so that the user is able to select the date as well as the time from this particular date time picker now guys for the for attribute we will set the ID of this datetime picker as the for attribute in this case so I'll simply paste this date time string and then we will say select date time over here so we have select date time followed by colon and then guys after this input tag we will also have the couple of line breaks so that the next button that is having the value click me will be displayed on the other line now let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser so as you can see we have select a date time as the label and Then followed by the date time picker over here now guys we are having the date along with that we are also having the time picker as well so as you can see we can select the time as well along with the date and the difference between the date and the date time local type is that for the simple date picker we can only select one of the dates over here but for the date time picker we can also select the time in this case so guys this is the basic difference between the type attribute that is date and the type attribute that is date time local over here so in case you have the requirement of setting the time as well you can use the date time local in this case so we can select one of the dates in this case so let's say we select 15th of December 2023 and the time is 18 over here so 18 0 0 so guys in this case we are setting the date as well as the time over here as you can see now guys let us say when we click on this button that is Click me we want to see the date as well as the time in the alert box so what we have to do is already we had return the code over here that is having the on click attribute for this button that is Click me we are calling the test function that is already written in the JavaScript so guys this is a very basic function that we have return over here what we are doing is we will be getting the value of the datetime Picker and we will show that value inside the alert function so we simply have to set the ID that is date time over here and then we have to provide the alert that is date time is and Then followed by the variable in which the date time is being selected in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try reloading this page once again on the browser I'll select the date as 10th of December 2023 and then let's say the time is 1805 over here so when we set this 1805 in this case you can see that the date and time is being selected over here and when we click on this button that is Click me as you can see we are getting the ear that is 2023 followed by the month that is 12 and Then followed by the date that is 10 and then guys we have this character that is T which is separating the date as well as the time and then after this character we have the time that is 18 which is the r and the 05 which is the minute in this case so guys in this way you can easily select the date time by using this date time picker over here let me change the timing in this case so we set the time is 2016 over here and then let's say we select the date as 20th of December so guys we have 20 December 2023 and then the time is 2016 so when we click on this button that is Click me over here you can see that we have the 20th December 2023 date as well as the time that is set as 2016 over here as the alert so guys in this way you can easily use the datetime Picker based on your requirements comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video
