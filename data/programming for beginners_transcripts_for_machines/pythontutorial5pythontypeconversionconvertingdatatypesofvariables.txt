hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about python type conversion basically we are going to learn about converting data types of variables so type conversion is the process of converting data of one type to another so for example converting string data to integer so guys it can so happen that you have got a number in the form of a string and before you add it to another number you need to convert that string data type to the integer data type so how do we do that by using the python type conversion so basically there are two types of type conversion in the python the implicit conversion which is automatically done so this is automatic type conversion so basically when this automatic type conversion happens is whenever you are converting from a data type that is of small size to the larger size let's say integer data type it takes four bytes as the memory but the float it takes 8 bytes as the memory so what will happen is over here whenever you are going to add integer along with the float the result will be stored in the float itself that's because you are going from the integer that is having the lower size to the float data type which is having the larger size over here so guys in that case automatic type conversion happens in order to avoid the data loss and there is another type of conversion that is explicit conversion in which you have to convert the data types manually so this is also called manual type conversion so guys over here what you have to do is you have to type cast from one data type to another so we will check that with the help of examples as well so first of all we will check the implicit conversion so as you can see this is the example that is example one we have the integer number as 123 but the float number is 1.23 so this float number is having decimal but this integer number is not having decimal and then the new number which is going to add both the numbers that is integer number and the float number but guys this is the integer and this is the float so what should be the result let us check this with the help of our python code execution so I'll just copy these lines of code over here and then I'll paste this over here guys what I will do is I'll simply hide this section which is the Explorer section because we are going to write all the programs in the same file over here so when we save this file and then when we try running this code nothing will happen guys that's because what we have done is we have initialized the integer number we have initialized the float number as well and what we are doing is we are just adding both the numbers and we are assigning the result in the new number but we are not printing anything so we are supposed to print something over here what we will do is we will print and first of all what do we print let us say we want to find the type of this variable that is new number so we can simply provide type function and then inside this we will provide the new number over here that is the name of the variable and then what we will be doing is we will print the value of this new number so we will simply have another print statement and we will say new number over here so first of all we will get the type so that we will come to know what data type is being assigned to this new number that's because we are adding an integer number and the float number together so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see class float so this proves that float is being stored over here in the new number that's because when we add an integer and the float number the highest data type that is the float number will be assigned to this result number that is the new number over here so that is what type of new number is being displayed as float and what will be the result of this addition 123 plus 1.23 it is giving us the result as 124.23 which is being displayed by using this line of code over here wherein we are printing this new number variable the value of this new number will be displayed now guys coming to next example as you can see example 2 we have the number string but this is of the string data type why so because we have provided this number in inside the single quotes over here as I have told you whenever we are providing the single quote or the double quote the value inside those codes are treated as the string and then we have another variable that is num integer and this is the simple number so this number is going to be treated as an integer but what happens when we add both these numbers over here that is new integer since this is the integer type so nothing will happen over here but num string so basically this is of the string data type and we cannot add a string to the integer we are using the plus operator in order to add the two numbers over here since num integer is a number over here so guys let us check what happens I'll just copy these lines of code and paste this over here and what we will do is we will simply print the value of this Num Sum so over here we have num underscore sum over here that is the result variable let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see it is giving us some error Num Sum It is equal to so this expression is being printed over here and we are getting the messages type error unsupported operand type for plus that is integer and strength so what it is saying is this plus operator it is having unsupported operands now what are the unsupported operands the first operand is integer which it is showing over here as end and the second one is Str which is string over here so guys what we are supposed to do is we are supposed to convert the string to the integer this num integer is already of the integer data type but this num string is not of the integer data type and that is why we are getting this error so guys how do we convert this num string to the integer data type we simply have to provide this variable that is num string inside the open and close parenthesis and before this parenthesis we simply have to provide the data type to which we need to convert this num string to that is the integer so we simply provide int that is the integer data type so as you can see this is the format we have first enclosed this variable that is num string inside the open and close parenthesis and then we have provide end before this open parenthesis over here and this is how this num string will be converted to the integer data type so the value will be 12 over here and this num integer is having the value is 23 which is again the integer and the sum will be stored in this Num Sum so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 35 is being displayed over here because 23 plus 12 is 35 and that is what we are getting over here so guys this is the manual type conversion so whenever we are coming from a data type that is having the high memory to a low memory such as the string to the integer we are supposed to do a manual type conversion and that is what we have done over here so Guys these were the two examples as far as automatic and manual type conversions are concerned which are also called implicit and explicit conversion wherever possible python will automatically convert the data types of the variables but wherever it is not possible it will give you the warning at least or or else it will give you the error while you are running your Python program so guys that's it in this video please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different output please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is python basic input and output so stay tuned
