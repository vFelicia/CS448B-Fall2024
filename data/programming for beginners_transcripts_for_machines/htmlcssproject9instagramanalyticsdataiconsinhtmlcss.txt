CSS file for the container class let us provide certain background color over here and this time we will provide the white version of the background color over here so guys basically we will set this particular background color this time and also we will provide the padding so let's say from top and bottom we want 10 pixels of padding and from left and right we want 20 pixels of padding let me just save this file now as you can see this is the diff tag that is getting displayed over here now guys apart from this we will also set the width as well so let's say we provide the width of 30% over here when we save this file as you can see this is the div that is getting displayed and then after this also so we will make the display it is equal to flex and also we will set the justify content it is equal to Center so that all the icons are displayed at the center as far as the horizontal alignment is concerned now guys you can see that there is no spacing in between these icons so what we will do is instead of providing the center as the justify content we will say space evenly over here so when we save this file now as you can see there is enough space over here in between all the icons now guys what we we can do is simply we can also provide the Border radius as well so we will provide the 20 pixels value for the Border radius and also we will provide the Box Shadow so let me just provide the horizontal and vertical box Shadow and over here we will provide the shadow as dark blue color this time so when we save this file now as you can see we are getting the dark blue color as the shadow for this particular diff tag now guys let us get this D tag at the center of the screen so simply we will provide margin it is equal to Auto so as far as the horizontal alignment is concerned we have got the diff tag at the center of the screen guys this is just a part of the web page in which case you can provide all these icons which is the part of the analytics and user can interact with these icons in order to like comment or share and if you new to this YouTube Channel please make sure that you subscribe to this YouTube channel so that you get the notifications for the upcoming videos in which we are going to create more HTML and CSS projects now guys so far we have provided the required CSS properties for this particular diff tag now inside the diff tag we need to provide the CSS properties for all these links which are being represented by this a tag over here so guys what we will do is simply we will provide the class name over here as link this time for the ax and then let me just copy the class names for all the ax over here so that we can provide the CSS property to this link class so guys let me just copy this link class class name over here and then inside this first of all we will provide text decoration as none so that we don't get this underline as you can see so when we save this file now there is no more underline apart from this we want to change the font color to Black by default so we provide the black color as the font color so when we save this file now you can see the changes this time now guys what we want to do is we want to change the font colors of these icons as well we will keep this heart icon as red color so in of providing the CSS properties inside the external style sheet we will simply provide the inline style over here so for this particular I class that is having the heart icon simply we will provide the style and we will say color it is equal to Red this time so when we save this file now as you can see we are getting the red color over here apart from this we will also provide the color CSS property for the other two icons as well so for the comment part let us provide the color as blue over here here and for the share part let us provide the other color that is green color this time so guys basically we have the red blue and green color for all these icons when we save this file now as you can see these are the colors that are getting displayed over here now guys when the user gets the mouse cursor on these icons we want to increase its size so what we can do is simply inside the link class we need to refer to this it tag over here so we come to this style. CSS file we provide this link class and then I tag over here and then after this we want to make use of the transform CSS property in which case we will make use of the scale function over here we will say that it should scale by 1.3 times this time so when we save this file now so if you see the changes already there is a scaling that is happening over here now guys we want the scaling on the mouse hover so we have left out the hover sudo class this time so simply we provide the colon after the it tag and then we say hover C glass when we save this file now as you can see these are the default sizes for all these icons and when we get the mouse cursor over here you can see that the scaling is happening by 1.3 times over here let us increase the scaling by 1.5 this time so that it gives a decent look so when we save this file now as you can see this is a scaling that is happening and we want the scaling to happen smoothly so simply for the link class we can provide the transition CSS property and we can say all over over here and let's say we provide 0.5 second as the timing so when we save this file now we still cannot see the transition that is happening smoothly so guys we have done the mistake over here this CSS property should belong to the it tag this time so basically we will provide the link class followed by the it tag and then over here we will provide the transition CSS property we will say all and then 0.5 seconds so since we are making the changes for this it tag the transition property should be associated with the it tag over here so when we save this file now and get the mouse cursor over here as you can see the transition is happening now the scaling of the icon is happening to 1.5 times with the 0.5 seconds timing so guys in this way you can provide your own buttons based on your requirements with the help of these icons the links I have already given in the description section below so comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well I'll see you in the next video in which we are going to create more HTML and the CSS projects so stay tuned
