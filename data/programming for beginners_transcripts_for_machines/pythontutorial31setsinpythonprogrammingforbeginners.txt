hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about sets in Python Programming so guys a set is a collection of a unique data which means that the elements in a set cannot be duplicate elements so over here you can easily create a set in the python basically in Python we create the sets by placing all the elements inside the curly braces separated by comma so guys previously we have seen that for the list we are using the open and close square brackets for the Tuple we use the open and close parenthesis and over here for sets we are using the open and close curly braces so we will check this with the help of examples as well a set can have any number of items and they may be of different types so as you can see it can be of the integer float Tuple or string data type or any other data type but a set cannot have mutable elements like list sets or dictionaries as its elements so guys this is very important you cannot have another list set or a dictionary array which we are going to see in the upcoming videos over here we cannot have these kinds of data types inside a particular set now let us check the creation of set with the help of example now over here so let's say I provide set 1 as the variable name and then we provide the equal to symbol followed by the open and closed curly braces so inside these braces we have to provide the elements of the set so let's say we have the set of integers we have one two three four and then five so guys we have five elements over here one to five which are the elements of this set and simply we can print all these elements inside the set by using the print function over here and then we can say set elements R and then colon and then we can have set one that is the variable name so guys let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting set elements are we are getting all the elements that is one two three four five and guys this is the way that we can create a set in the Python Programming now guys it is very important that we cannot have the duplicate items in this set so let's say I provide some more numbers over here which are already present in this set so let's say 2 and 3 are already present I provide this 2 and 3 once again so when we do this so right now we have seven number of elements but let me just save this file now and try running this code to see how many elements get printed so as you can see only five elements are getting printed so those two elements that is two and three will not be considered once again while printing them because we cannot have duplicate elements we can only have the unique elements inside the set and guys this is the main functionality of having the set data structure in Python Programming So based on your required environment if you don't want the duplicate elements to be present you can use the set data structure in the Python programming language now guys how do we create an empty set in the python so basically creating an empty set is a bit tricky so empty curly braces if we use then it will make a empty dictionary in Python so basically when we create a dictionary we again use the curly braces so let us check this with the help of example now over here what happens if we create the empty set so let's say we provide set 1 it is equal to open and close curly braces as you can see we have not provided any element and this is the empty set but let me just print the type of this variable over here so we will simply use the type function and then provide the set 1 as the variable name so guys what will be the type of this set one variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see it is saying that class it is a dictionary data type so this set one variable is of the data type dictionary by default when we provide are the open and close curly braces how do we make it as a empty set data type so what we have to do is instead of using the open and close curly braces we have to use the set function so there is something called a set function over here as you can see vs code is suggesting us so this set function followed by the open and close parenthesis will help us to create a new empty set over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code over here what we are trying to do is again we are trying to print the type of this set one but this time it should be of the set data type so let me just run this code now so as you can see we are getting the set data type over here previously we were getting the dictionary so in order to have the empty set in Python Programming we can use the set function over here now very important question how do we add the set items in Python so basically sets are mutable which means we can add and remove items from this set however since they are unordered indexing has no meaning so guys basically if you must have noticed there is no one order in which the set items were printed previously so let us check this once again over here we provide set one it is equal to and let's say we provide some elements that is 3 2 4 1 5 and then let me just print this set one over here so we provide set 1 inside the print function let me just run this code as you can see we are getting one two three four five this is not of the same order in which we have provided these elements inside the set so we cannot use index numbers over here as well in order to access these elements one at a time since the way in which the elements inside the set are printed are not in a particular order now guys how do we add new elements to this set so basically we cannot access or change an element of a set using the indexing or slicing but we can use the add method to add an item to a set so let us say I want to add another element over here so basically what we will do is we will say initial set and then colon and then we provide set one and then let's say we provide set one dot we have something called as ADD over here as you can see this is a function that we can use in order to add elements inside the set so let's say we provide 10 as the number to be added to this particular set that is set one and then again we want to print that set one so I'll just copy this and paste this over here and then we have updated set over here so we have updated set and then set one being printed so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see initial set it is one two three four five and then after adding this element we are getting the updated set as one two three four five and then the last element that is 10 over here which is being added by using the add method and this is the way that we can add the elements inside the set remember that the order in which they are added will not be followed while printing them so you cannot rely on the order in which the set elements will be printed it on Console now guys another important thing how do we remove an element from the set so we can use the discard method to remove the specified element from a set so let us say after adding this we want to remove the element that is 3 from this set so what we can do is we can provide set one and then followed by Dot and then we can have discard method in order to remove the element we need to provide the element which needs to be removed so over here we provide the number 3 which will be removed from the set one and then again let me just copy this line of code and paste this over here so that we can print the updated set after removing so over here we say updated set after removing three and then let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting 1 2 4 5 and then ten so the element 3 is being removed after using the discard method over here and guys this is the way that we can remove the elements from the set now guys there is another way in order to access the elements inside the set we can iterate over a set in Python by using the for Loop so this can be easily done by using the for Loop over here so what I will do is I'll just clear these lines of code and then we will say 4 and then item in set one so this is the syntax that we use while using the for Loop and then we can have the print statement over here guys notice that till now we were printing the elements of the set by using the set one variable and that is why we were getting the starting and the ending open and close curly braces over here but this time let's say we don't want those but we want only those numbers that is the elements inside the set to be printed so we can easily use the for Loop and iterate through each and every item inside the set and this is the way that we can do so we provide the print statement over here and inside the item variable one at a time all the elements will be printed over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting one two three four five now all these numbers are on a different line what we can do is we can use the end parameter of the print function so over here we provide the end parameter and then we simply provide the space character so that all the items are separated by the space characters over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting one two three four five which are the elements of this set if you want all these numbers to be separated by commas what we can do is instead of the space character we can provide the comma and let me just save this file and try running this code once again as you can see we are getting one two three four five and all the elements are being separated using the comma character now guys how do we find the number of set elements so we can use the Len method that is the length method to find the number of elements that is present inside the set so what we can do is simply we can provide the print statement over here and we can simply say that length of set is and then colon and then we can simply use the Len method and then inside this method we can provide the set one that is the variable name so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as we can see length of set is 5 so basically since five elements are present over here we are getting the length as 5 what if we provide some more elements let's say I provide 6 7 and let's say I provide some more duplicate elements over here that is 1 2 and then three so over here there are total 10 elements out of which three elements are duplicate so what is the exact length of the set so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see length of set is 7 so even though we are having 10 items in inside the set but out of those 10 items three items are duplicate items so those duplicate items will not be considered it will be considered only once and that is why we are getting the length of this set as 7. now guys very important thing about the set operations we can carry out different set operations in Python Programming one is Union of two sets which can be done by using the union method or this or a symbol over here we can also have the set intersection which can be implemented by using the intersection method and then we also have the difference between the two sets which means we can use the difference method or the minus symbol over here so guys let us check all these operations one at a time so over here what we will do is we will have two sets over here we will say set one it is equal to 1 2 and then three and then let's say we have set 2 it is equal to 3 4 and then five now guys let's say we want to find the Union first so what we will do is we will say Union and then we will simply say set 1 followed by Dot and then we have the union method followed by the parameter needs to be set to over here because that is the another set that we want to find the union of similarly we will do the intersection and difference as well so I'll just copy and paste these lines of code over here we will say intersection in this case and then we will simply change the union method to intersection over here and then over here we will say difference so difference and then instead of this Union we will say difference so guys basically what we are doing over here is these are all the set operations the union will find all the elements that are present in set 1 and set 2 and all the elements will be unique in the intersection part we will get all the elements that are common in both the sets which means 3 in this case and then in the difference we will find all the elements that are present in set one but not present in set two so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code to see what will be the results of all these operations so as you can see the union is giving us one two three four five which means all the elements that are present in set 1 and set two so we are having one two three in set one and then in set two the three is already printed and then it is printing four and five as well in intersection we are getting only three that's because the element 3 is the only element which is common in both the sets for the difference operation we are getting only one and two that's because these are the only two elements which are present in set one but not present in set two so Guys these are certain set operations that can be implemented with Python Programming apart from this there are multiple builtin methods that you can use as far as sets are concerned so when you provide the variable name that is set 1 followed by dot as you can see these are all the methods that can be used based on your requirements so guys practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and
