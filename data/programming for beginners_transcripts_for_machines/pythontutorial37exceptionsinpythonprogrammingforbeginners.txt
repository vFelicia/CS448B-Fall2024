hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about exceptions in Python Programming so guys an exception is an unexpected event that occurs during the program execution so let's say for example if we have this divided by zero variable and then we do the assignment in such a way that we divide this number that is 5 by 0 then we get divide by zero exception that's because this is a runtime exception and we cannot divide any number by zero so the above code causes an exception as it is not possible to divide a number by zero errors that occur at runtime after passing the syntax test are called exceptions or logical errors so guys basically there will be many exceptions that you will come across when you are going to write python programs and these exceptions are going to be the runtime exceptions after passing the syntax test that we have already seen in our vs code editor so basically these exceptions occur when we try to open a file for reading that does not exist that is file not found error so basically this is one of the exceptions in the Python programming language in which case if let's say you are trying to open a file which is not present in the directory then we will have file not found error over here then if we try to divide a number by 0 then we will get 0 division error and then again if we try to import a module that does not access then we are going to get the import error and so on so basically there are many builtin exceptions that we can see by using this print statement inside the directory we have this locals and then we specify this builtins in order to get the list of exceptions that is already built in in the Python programming language so this we are going to check with the help of example as well what we are going to do is we are going to see how the exception occurs in the Python program so over here let's say we have the variable that is number over here and we have the number that is 5 divided by zero so in this case we are dividing a number by zero since practically this is correct over here vs code will not throw any error but during the runtime we will get the error which we call it as the exception so over here when we print this number so we say value of number is followed by colon and then let's say we provide this number variable so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting the 0 division error division by 0 which is not possible we cannot divide any number by zero now let me show you another exception let's say we are going to open a file in this particular directory and the file name is test1 which doesn't occur inside this directory so let me just copy this directory path and we will open that file which is test one which is not present so over here we provide the variable name as file 1 it is equal to we say open and then with this we have the parameter that is the directory path we have just copied over here we will just Escape these back backslash characters so that we don't get any error over here for the backslashes and then at the end what we are going to do is after this we are going to provide test one dot txt now this file name as I have showed you over here it is not present test one is not present over here so we are trying to open that by using this test1.txt file name so now what we will do is simply we will save this file enter running this code now so as you can see file not found error is being displayed no such file or directory and then this file name is being mentioned over here what if we provide the correct file name let's say I provide this test file as the name of the file so I'll just copy this file name and paste this over here at the end instead of test one so I'll just paste this over here and then let me just save this file now and try running this code so now as you can see nothing happens we are not printing anything but there is no exception that is being printed over here on the terminal that's because this particular file name is actually present and hence there is is no file not found error that is being displayed over here like how we have seen previously with the test1 dot txt file so Guys these are certain exceptions that might occur when you are going to work with the python projects and such exceptions are inevitable we cannot avoid them but we can handle them so we are going to see exception handling in the upcoming videos as well how we are going to handle them but it is very important for you to know that these exceptions might occur when you are going to work with the Python programming language now guys let us see the list of all the builtin exceptions that are present inside the Python programming language so I'll just copy this line of code and then we'll paste this over here so as you can see this is a print statement and inside this we have the dir function and inside that we also have the locals function and then we provide the builtins attribute over here so let me just save this file now and try running this code as you can see we have got the list of all the exceptions that are present inside the Python programming language so there are multiple errors that might occur which includes arithmetic error then we have assertion error attribute error base exception so there are many errors that you can see over here file not found error this is one of the exceptions that we have just checked and then we also have the zero division error which we just saw when we divide any number by zero so guys there are multiple exceptions that might occur which are already built in inside the Python programming language and you can practice on your own to see which exception occurs on which particular input please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to this channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is exception handling with try accept block so stay tuned
