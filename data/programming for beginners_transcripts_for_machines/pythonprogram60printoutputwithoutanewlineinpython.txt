hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to print output without a new line so guys this Python program will help you to print statements without a new line at the end of the print statement so usually whenever we are using the print statement the next time when we have another print statement then the control flow will go to the next line and print that statement but let's say if we want to continue on the same line then we will be using the end parameter in the print function to avoid the new line so let us check this with the help of example now over here in the vs code so let's say we have the print statement in this case and it is a very simple string so let's say we have this is a statement so we say this is a statement over here and then let's say we have another print statement and then we again type this is another statement this time so let me just save this file now and try running this code once so as you can see we have got both the statements but both of them are on different lines over here so this is a statement is on one line and this is another statement is on the second line so what if we want both these statements on the same line so guys what we can do is we can use the end parameter inside this print statement so over here what we can do is after the string or any data that we want to print we provide a comma and Then followed by end parameter over here as you can see vs code is suggesting us this end parameter we have to use this one and then followed by a blank space or you can also use the space character or else we can also use full stop as well followed by the space character so in whatever form you want to separate both these statements at this this is a statement and then this is another statement you can provide that particular character over here inside the end parameter so guys let us say we have the full stop followed by a space character over here then what will be the output on the terminal and let me just save this file now and try running this code once so as you can see we have got this is a statement on one line and Then followed by a full stop and then we have a space character as well and then we have this is another statement on the same line itself so guys this is the functionality of the end parameter it will help us in order to print the next statement that is being provided to the print function over here on the same line now guys what if we have another print statement over here and then let's say we have this is third statement so what will happen to this third statement whether it will be printed on the next line or whether it will be printed on the same line where both these statements are printed so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have got this is a statement and then this is another statement the entire string on one line that is both the statements on one line but then when we have this is third statement over here it goes on the second line now guys why this third statement has gone to the second line over here that's because after this print statement we did not have any end parameter so the control flow assumed that the end parameter is having the new line character so the next print statement is going on the next line over here so guys after each print statement we have to provide the end parameter if you want to have the next print statement to be printed on the same line so let's say if you want this statement to be printed on the same line again so again we have to provide the end parameter over here and then let's say this time we provide hyphen as the separator so over here after this is another statement this particular hyphen will be displayed after which this is third statement will be printed so let me just save this file now and try running this code all the three statements must be present on the same line so as you can see we have got this is a statement followed by full stop and then we have this is another statement and Then followed by iPhone we have this is third statement over here so guys this is the way that we can avoid new line while we are using the print statement using the Python program so guys please make sure that you like this video so that it reaches to more people and subscribe to the channel so that you get the notifications on upcoming videos as well the next video that we are going to talk about is Python program to read a file line by line into a list so stay tuned
