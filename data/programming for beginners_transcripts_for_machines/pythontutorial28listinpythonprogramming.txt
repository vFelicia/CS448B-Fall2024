hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to learn about list in Python Programming so guys our list is a collection of similar or different types of data so for example suppose we need to record the age of five students so instead of creating five separate variables we can simply create a list so as you can see this is the way that we create the list first of all on the left hand side we have the variable name and then on the right hand side inside the open and close square brackets we have the list of elements which are separated using the commas so I'll just copy this line of code over here and then let us move to the vs code and paste this so as you can see on the left hand side it is the variable name of the list and on the right hand side we have the age of all the students over here and simply we can print the list by using the print function after this we can provide the variable name that is list so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting the list of all the elements in the sequence that that we had provided over here it is very important that all these elements are separated using the commas over here now guys the list can have the same kind of elements that is this one is having the list of integers data type only but we can also have the string as well in between so let's say we have a string called John over here in between this list of elements so this is also possible it will not throw any error while we are running this code so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting the list of all the values 17 18 and then we are getting John and then 19 and then 14. so this is a kind of a heterogeneous list whereas when we have the same kind of data type in the list then it is called the homogeneous list now how do we access the python list element so basically this is one way in order to access the list but what if we want to access only a single element by using this print statement we have accessed all the elements over here but in case we want to access our a particular element from this list then what we can do is in Python each item in a list is associated with a number so the number is known as a list index so basically all these numbers that is the elements of the list that are present inside the list so these are associated with the indices which starts from zero so this 17 number is at the zeroth index 18 number is at the first index and so on this is at the second index third index and then so on so basically these elements can be accessed using these indices so as you can see we can access elements of an array using the index number now how do we access them so what we can do is we simply come over here I'll simply change this to the number 15 that was there previously and what we have to do is let's say I want to access this element that is the fourth element so what will be the index so this is zeroth index then we have one and then 2 and then three so this is the third index so we can access by using the variable name followed by open and close square brackets and inside those brackets we have to provide the index number that is 3 in this case which represents this number that is 19. so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are just getting 19 over here previously we were getting the entire list when we don't provide this index number I save this file so as you can see all the values are getting printed but when we provide the index number let's say I want to print 18 this time which is at the index 1 after this index which is 0 so I provide list of 1 over here save this file and run this code so as you can see 18 is getting displayed and this is how it is one way in order to access a particular single element inside this list by using the index number now it is also possible that we provide the negative index in Python so python allows negative indexing for its sequences the index of minus 1 refers to the last item minus 2 to the second last item and so on so for now we know that the zeroth index is the first element over here and then the first index is the second element but what about the last element let's say we don't know the length of the list like how many elements are present inside the list and we want to get the last element over here so since the first element is at the zeroth index the previous index that is before 0 which is minus 1 it will point to the last index of this list that is 14 over here so what if we simply do list of minus 1 in this case so I'll just provide minus 1 in this case let me just save this file and try running this code as you can see we are getting 14 so basically the minus 1 index will point to the last element of the list in this case let's say we want to get the second last element so in this case we will simply provide minus 2 so after minus 1 we are having minus 2 which will be the previous element of the last element so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see 19 is getting displayed now and this is the way that we can also use the negative indexing as far as access using the last elements of the list are concerned now there is another concept of slicing in Python list so in Python it is possible to access a section of items from the list using the slicing operator which is nothing but a colon not just a single item so let's say we want to access the second and third elements inside the list so we have to use the slicing operator in this case now what is the slicing operator while providing the indices inside the open and close brackets we have to provide the indices and separate them using the colon so what is the index of the second element it is one over here since the first element is having the zeroth index we don't want that we want to start from the first index and then we also want the second index so this time we have to provide the next number that is at the third index now so after this one that is the first index we have to provide colon and then we provide 3 over here so 3 is not included in this case please remember that whenever you are providing the ending in index that element will not be included whenever you are using the slicing operator over here so the elements that will be considered in this case will be at the index 1 and at the index 2 which means 18 and 15. so let me save this file and try running this code now as you can see we are getting 18 and 15 only let's say you want to get all the elements starting from this 18 so this index is 18 right now and there is no end index that you want to specify over here so we simply have to remove this 3 and then we can simply specify one followed by the colon so this will make python interpreter to consider all the elements after the first element including the first element itself so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we are getting all the elements that is 18 15 19 and 14 starting from the first index over here so guys this is the way that we can use slicing in the python list also in order to consider all the list elements over here we need not have to specify any of the indices if we simply provide the colon over here all the elements will be considered let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see all the elements are getting considered but this thing is kind of a redundant over here that's because if we simply provide the variable name that is less still all the elements will be considered so if we run this code once again so all the elements are being considered over here only when you want to consider the subset of this list you have to use the slicing inside the python list now let us move to the next concept how do we add the elements to a python list so there are two ways to add the elements in the python list the first way is to use the append function which will help us in order to add a single item in the list and the second way is to use the extend function in order to add another list to the already existing list so let us check this with the help of examples now over here let's say we already have this list of values inside the list variable and now we want to add more elements so what we will do is we will say list followed by Dot and then we have something called as append so this is a function we which will take a single element and it will add to the end of this list so let's say I want to provide 25 as the age of another student so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see this element that is 25 it is already added at the end of the lesson now and in this way we can use the append function to add more elements inside the list now let's say we have another list over here let's say I provide a list one and the numbers I provide is 1 comma 2 comma 3 over here so three elements are there and we want to add all these elements to the original list that is list variable so what we can do is we can use the extend function in this case so we have to use this list variable which is the original list variable followed by Dot and then we have the extend function and inside the parenthesis we have to provide this argument that is list one which is another variable having the list of elements and now if we print this list it will have the updated list of values so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see after this 14 1 2 3 elements are also getting added over here since we have used the extend function in this case let us move to another section can we change the list items so basic quickly the python lists are mutable meaning lists are changeable and we can change items of a list by assigning new values using equal to operator so what I will do over here is I'll just remove these lines of code so I'll simply provide the original list over here so we will say for each null list followed by colon and then we will print the list so let me just save this file and try running this code now we have the original list over here I'll just spell this correctly so we have the original list 17 18 15 19 and then 14. now let's say the third position that is 15 we want to change this element to 10. now this is being referred to the second index over here so this is 0th index then 1 and then second index so what we have to do is simply we have to provide list followed by inside the square brackets we will provide the index number that is 2 and then equal to the new value that is 10 that we want to replace it with and then again what we will do is I'll simply copy this line of code and paste this over here and and then we will say update a list and let me just save this file now and try running this code so basically as you can see original list it is having 15 at the third position over here that is at the second index and the updated list is having the number 10 at the same second index over here and this is the way that we can update the list elements so since python lists are mutable we can change the elements of the list as well now removing an element from the list so there are two ways either we can use the Del function or else we can use the remove function as well so let's say over here we have the original list now so I'll just remove these lines of code and then we can use the Del function and Then followed by list and let's say I want to remove this fourth element that is at the index 3 which is 19 so I'll just provide list of three in this case and then what I will do is I will print the updated list once again so I'll just change this to updated list so basically we are using the Del method over here and deleting the third index in inside this list so let me just save this file and try running this code now so as you can see we are getting the updated list as 17 18 15 and 14. this element that is 19 it was removed already now instead of this we can also use the remove method so in that case we have to use the variable name first in the Del method that is the delete method we simply use the function name and provided the element from the list in order to remove from that list but over here we have to provide the variable name followed by Dot and then we can simply use the remove function and Then followed by the position so which position we want to remove so let's say I want to remove this element that is 18 over here so in this case we have to provide the value of the element that is present inside the list so in this case we provide 18. in the previous example that we have taken using the Del method we used the index number of the element that is present inside the list but in this case we have to use the value in order to remove it so I'll just save this file and try running this code now as you can see 18 was present in the original list but in the updated list we don't have 18 it is 17 15 19 and 14 and in this way we can remove the elements from the list as well now very important operation how do we iterate through a list so basically we can use the for Loop to iterate over the elements of our list so till now what we have seen is we have just used the list that is the variable name in order to print the elements of those lists now if you notice we are getting the square brackets over here open and close square brackets within which all the elements are getting printed but let's say we don't want those square brackets and one by one we want to print all the elements at a time so what we can simply do is use the for Loop and we have seen in the previous videos as well the syntax of the for Loop we have to use the for keyword followed by let's say a temporary variable name that is item followed by the in keyword and then we have to provide the sequence that is list and then after that we have the colon and then we can have the print statement over here now in the print statement if we only provide one item term that is item in this case so every time all the elements will be printed on the separate lines over here so let us just try this code so we'll just save this file and try running this code now as you can see 17 18 15 19 14 all the elements are getting printed on the separate lines what if we want all the elements to be present on the same line so what we can do is after providing comma over here we have the end parameter inside the print function and this end parameter we can have the comma as the character by which we can separate all the elements so by default this is slash n character which means the next element will be printed on the next line but if we specify this in this way all the elements will be printed on the same line so let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see all the elements are getting printed on the same line in the same sequence that is present inside this list so in this way we can iterate through all the elements inside the list that are present by using the for Loop over here now another important thing how do we find the list so we have something called as python list length so in Python we use the Len function to find the number of elements present in a list so we can have any number of elements inside the list over here so there is no limit on the number of elements that we are supposed to have inside the python list so in case if we want to find the number of elements inside the list we can simply use the length function so we can simply print this and then we can have Len which is a function and then we can provide the variable name of the list inside this Len function over here so it will return us the count of the elements inside the list so let me just save this file and try running this code now as you can see 5 that is the count of the number of elements inside the list is present over here if you provide some more elements over here let's say I have provided five more elements inside the list let me just save this file now and try running this code so we are getting the updated count that is 10 so 10 is the number of elements that are present inside the list and that is how we can easily find the length of the list in this case by using the Len function over here so Guys these were certain operations as far as list variable is concerned please make sure that you practice on your own and as a homework for you there is something called as a sort function which can help you in order to sort all the elements inside the list so you can practice on your own as a homework for you in order to sort the elements inside the python list and print on your own make sure that you comment in the comment section below what your code looks like as far as sorting the list of elements is concerned please make sure that you like this
