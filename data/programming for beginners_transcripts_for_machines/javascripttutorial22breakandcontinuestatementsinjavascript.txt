so now we are going to check the break and continue statements in JavaScript so guys basically the break statement jumps out of a particular Loop so previously we had seen how we can use the while loop in order to iterate through a certain block of code continuously until the condition is false so guys similarly we can use the Y Loop once again and then check for a particular condition and if that condition is true then simply we can come out of the while loop and that is how we are going to use the brake state statement and then guys on the opposite side we also have the continue statement in which case the control flow will jump over one iteration in the loop which means the current iteration will be skipped so guys we will check both that is break and continue statement with the help of examples in vs code over here these statements can be used in while and for Loops to either go out of the loop or skip an iteration so guys we will check the examples with the while loop over here in the upcoming videos we are also going to understand how for loops work so guys let us move to the VSS code over here so simply we will create a new file over here we will name it as 22 followed by underscore and then we will say break and continue followed by the extension that is JS file over here so guys basically we have created this particular file that is break and continue. JS so what we will do is let us say we want to print the first 10 numbers that is going from 1 up to 10 over here so simply we will create a variable that is I in this case that is going to have the initial value as 1 over here and then what we will do is let us say we want to use the while loop in this case we will check whether I is it less than or equal to 10 this time so that we can print all the numbers that is 1 up to 10 so guys simply we will provide the console. log statement over here and then we will say the value of I is and Then followed by dollar and then we have open and close curly braces over here and then inside that we have the variable that is I in this case now guys in order to increase the value of the I variable simply we are going to use the increment operator that is i++ let me just save this file now and try running this code on the terminal we will use the node keyword followed by the name of the file that is break and continue. JS so when we run this code as you can see we have the statements that are getting printed over here the value of I is 1 and Then followed by two and then so on we have 3 4 up to 10 in this case so guys in this way we can simply use the while loop in order to print the numbers from 1 to 10 instead of manually providing the those numbers from 1 to 10 in this case now guys what is the importance of break and continue statements over here so let us say we want to end this particular printing when we encounter the value of I is equal to 5 in this case so guys basically we want to tell The Interpreter that once the value of I is five it should come out of the loop after printing that particular value so let's say the value of I is five is printed over here so after this particular statement we need to check whether the value of I is five so simply we will say if and then inside the parenthesis we have I is it equal to 5 over here so guys basically we are checking for the condition whether this I value is equal to 5 if it is true then we want to come out of this particular y Loop instead of printing the other numbers that is 6 up to 10 that were printed previously so what we will do is if this condition is satisfied we simply have to provide the break statement over here so break is another keyword that is reserved by JavaScript language in in order to come out of the existing Loop so guys this particular break statement will check that it is inside this particular while loop over here and the control flow needs to come out of this particular while loop once this break statement is encountered so if we check now only the I value is equal to 5 will be printed from 1 up to five over here and the other numbers that is 6 to 10 will not be printed in this case since the interpretor comes out of the while loop and after coming out of the while loop simply we are going to provide another statement that is end of while loop over here so that we get the confirmation that we are actually outside the while loop in this case so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal and when we press enter as you can see the value of I is 1 and Then followed by the value of I is 2 3 4 and then 5 and then after the number that is five over here we have the end of Y Loop in this case because once the value of I was five the break statement helped us in order to come out of the while loop Loop in this case so guys in this way you can simply use the break statement in order to break the particular Loop that is getting executed right now now guys apart from this we also have something called as continue statement in which case what will happen is the control flow will go back to the while loop once again and not execute the remaining lines of code after the continue statement so let us check that as well simply I'm going to comment out these lines of code over here and what we will do is let us say at the value of five we don't want to print that particular statement that is the value of I is five but after the value of I is four we want to directly print the value of I is six over here so what we have to do is again we need to check for the same condition this time but over here we are going to use the continue statement so simply inside the Y Loop we will check whether the value of I is it equal to 5 this time if yes then simply we will provide the continue statement so guys what this continue statement will do is when the control flow comes over here and it realizes that the I's value is five in this case so that this particular expression is true it will encounter this continue statement and whenever this continue statement is present it will make the interpretor go back at the start of the loop over here so what will happen is the interpretor will go back once again over here I is less than or equal to 10 yes this time and then it will again check for the condition so every time the interpretor enters the Y Loop it is going to check whether the condition of I is equal to 5 is true or not if it is true then it will go back over here and if it is not true then only it will execute the remaining lines of code after the continue statement guys it is very important to note that while we are providing the continue statement over here it is not increasing the value of I in this case so simply before providing the continue keyword within this particular if statement we need to increment the value of I by using the increment operator in this case so that the value of I can be increased next time and next time when the interpretor comes over here the I's value will be six and this time the expression should be false so that the remaining lines of code should be executed so basically when the I value is five over here it is going to increment the I value so the value will be six now and then this particular continue statement will make The Interpreter go back to this while loop once again and this time the I value is six and this particular condition will be false inside the if statement and then we will have the value of i as 6 after the value of I is 4 four so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so now if you see first of all we will get the value of I from 1 and then up to four over here so you can see I is 1 followed by 2 3 4 and then we don't have five that's because we have used the continue statement after encountering the value of I is equal to 5 so the value of I is equal to 5 will be skipped this time and then followed by I is 6 Then followed by 7 8 9 and then 10 guys you can skip the other numbers as well so let's say you want to skip the number eight as well right now so currently you are printing the value of eight but you can put the other statement that is I is equal to 5 or I is equal to 8 so in both the cases the continue statement will be executed and those numbers will not be printed so let me just save this file now and try running this code once again over here on the terminal so as you can see the value of I is 1 2 3 4 and then we don't have five we directly have six and Then followed by seven and then we don't have8 we have N9 and Then followed by 10 and then at the end we have the end of while loop that is outside of the while loop that we had provided previously so guys in this way you can easily use the break and the continue statements in order to either come out of the existing while or the for Loop or else you can continue to the start of the while or for Loop if you are using the continue statement so guys comment in the comment section below whether you have learned something out of this video please make sure that you
