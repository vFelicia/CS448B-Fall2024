hey what's up guys welcome to another video in which we are going to write Python program to concatenate two lists so guys this Python program will help you to concatenate or join to list using these methods so over here we are going to check the four methods with the help of examples so the very first method is using the plus operator so let us check this with the help of example in vs code so guys let's say we have list one over here and we Define this list one as one two three and then four so four elements are present in this list one and then let's say we have list two which is having two elements over here which is 11 and 12 so over here we say 11 and then 12. so here simply we can use the plus operator in order to concatenate the list just like how we concatenate two strings over here so simply if we have the result list over here so let's say we have the variable name as a result it is equal to list one plus and then we say list two over here so guys this is the expression that we can use in order to concatenate or join two lists and then simply we can have the print statement and then we can say the result list and Then followed by colon and then we can simply have the result list over here that is the variable result in this case so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code so as you can see we have the result list over here and it is just one list which is having six elements that is one two three four and then we also have 11 and then 12 in this case so guys this is one of the ways in which we can concatenate or join to a list now guys let us move to the other approach that is using the iterable unpacking operator that is star so guys over here what we can do is simply instead of using this expression we can use another expression as well so guys simply we can have the open and close square brackets and Then followed by star and then we can have list one over here so guys before mentioning the variable that is list one we have this particular star that is being mentioned as a prefix and Then followed by comma the second variable name that is list 2 as well before which there should be a star character that must be present so over here we have star and Then followed by list two so guys this is another way that is using the iterable unpacking operator star using which we can concatenate Multiple List over here so guys the result will be stored in this result variable and we will have the result list displayed on the terminal so let me just save this file now before running this code what we can do is simply we can add some more content in the list two as well so that it differs from the result that was already printed in the previous approach so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting one list over here having eight elements one two three four and then we have 11 12 13 and then 14. so guys this is another approach in order to join or concatenate two or Multiple List now guys let us move to another approach over here here we can also concatenate multiple lists using the unique values by using the set function over here so guys what we will do is we will have certain elements that are common in both the list so let's say we have 2 comma 3 and then 5 and then 6 over here so guys 2 and 3 elements in both the list are common in this case so what we will do is we will simply have the concatenation but using the set method over here so guys as you must be aware using the set method what happens is only the unique values will be returned so in this case 2 and 3 should be returned only once and it will be stored in this result variable so the set method will take both the list over here so inside this we can provide a list one and then followed by plus and then list 2 in this case so guys this is the approach that we have already seen in the first example that is using the plus operator we are getting the result list that is list one plus list two but then it is converted to a set in which case 2 and 3 will be considered only once and then guys this set will be converted back again to the list in this case so we can provide a list and then this entire expression must be inside the open and close brackets over here so guys first of all we are concatenating both the list and then using the set method we are only getting the unique values and then after that we are converting those unique values into the list by using this list function and then storing it inside the result variable so guys let me just save this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we are getting one two three four five and then six so guys only unique values are present over here that's because we have used the set method in order to concatenate and join two lists over here now guys let us move to another approach the last approach is using the extend method so what we can do is using the extend method we can concatenate the elements of one list into another list over here here so what we can do is let's say we have list one in this case so we say list one and then followed by dot we have something called as extend method which takes another list or maybe it takes another element in order to add it into list one in this case so what we can do is simply provide the list 2 over here which is another iterable so when we provide this what happens is the content of the list one will be displayed as it is but the content of the list 2 will also be added to list one and then guys we can simply print the list one in order to get the entire content of list one over here so when we say the result list we have to provide the list one variable in this case so let me just give this file now and try running this code once again so as you can see we have got the result list as one two three four which are the elements of the list one and then guys again we have two three five six as you can see two three five six are being displayed over here which is the content of the list two which we passed to the extend method over here in order to concatenate both the list so Guys these are all the four approaches in order to concatenate and join two lists please make sure that you practice on your own so that on different inputs you get different outputs make sure that you like this video so

list into evenly sized chunks so stay tuned
