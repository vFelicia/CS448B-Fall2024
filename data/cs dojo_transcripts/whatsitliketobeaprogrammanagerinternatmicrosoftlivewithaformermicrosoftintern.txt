00:00 - 40 seconds left it's coming hey everyone
00:05 - I think I'm alive now I'm YK of course
00:08 - and welcome to CS dojo and we have
00:11 - Tanika veer as our guests today say hi
00:14 - to everyone Tana
00:16 - okay so Tana is actually a good friend
00:19 - of mine and she was formerly an explorer
00:23 - intern at Microsoft and she was also a
00:26 - program manager intern at Microsoft and
00:28 - she's currently at the University of
00:30 - British University of British Columbia
00:32 - in Vancouver pursuing a degree in
00:35 - computer science yep yep and this format
00:43 - is gonna be first of all we're gonna
00:45 - begin with about 23 minutes of interview
00:51 - or a conversation it would be like a
00:53 - need to be a slash conversation where
00:55 - I'm gonna ask Donna about what she did
00:57 - at Microsoft as an exploring turn and a
01:00 - program manager intern and what kind of
01:03 - experience she had prior to working at
01:05 - Microsoft and what her interview
01:07 - experience was like to get into
01:09 - Microsoft and after that we're gonna do
01:12 - like seven minutes of you know audience
01:14 - Q&A session so we can take your
01:17 - questions so let's get started first of
01:20 - all actually we're you know good friends
01:22 - we we knew each other before this we got
01:26 - to know each other through you know this
01:28 - project called sound vision so maybe you
01:31 - can tell everyone a little bit about the
01:34 - project that this project called sound
01:36 - business vision was an iOS app that
01:41 - transformed 3d spatial information into
01:44 - sound so pretty much it takes your field
01:46 - of vision into sound and it was to help
01:48 - those who are visually impaired navigate
01:50 - unfamiliar environments and pretty much
01:54 - use a device and the phone and we
01:56 - participated Ericsson for that the
01:59 - Ericsson Innovation Awards to help the
02:02 - future of city life right so just to
02:06 - give everyone a little bit of context it
02:08 - was sort of like a student competition
02:09 - that was held by you know this company
02:11 - called Ericsson you might have heard
02:13 - about
02:13 - and it was in Sweden and there were like
02:17 - 800 teams at the beginning and we were
02:20 - like one of the top four who actually
02:22 - got to go to Sweden so that was really
02:24 - cool
02:24 - yes definitely my first time ever being
02:27 - year so yeah and like at the end we
02:31 - didn't release the product but like we
02:34 - worked with some you know blind and
02:36 - visually impaired people and I think it
02:39 - was there anything you know new you
02:41 - learned about like that particular
02:43 - audience
02:45 - um just from someone we were making the
02:49 - app we did actually run it ourselves so
02:52 - we would actually glad for ourselves I
02:54 - walk around the campus and I think if
02:56 - anything I just got a new level of
02:58 - appreciation and also a new level of
03:02 - understanding of the importance of
03:03 - accessibility so I think that was the
03:06 - biggest learning that I got was
03:07 - accepting the importance of
03:08 - accessibility in software today yeah
03:28 - yeah sorry I think my audience audio was
03:31 - off for a little bit so I'm gonna start
03:34 - asking you about you know more about
03:36 - yourself and software development and
03:38 - Microsoft so how did you get interested
03:40 - in software development in the first
03:42 - place um I started off in old school I
03:46 - was put into a programming course
03:47 - because no the other courses were
03:49 - available all the time and I previously
03:52 - did a little bit of HTML with Neopets
03:54 - they used to have those like pages where
03:56 - you customize your profile I guess I'm
03:59 - so had a little bit experience with that
04:01 - but then when I went into a programming
04:02 - course I started to like it so I
04:04 - continued that on for 3 years throughout
04:07 - high school and after that I went
04:09 - straight into university into computer
04:10 - science so that's kind of my background
04:12 - before me before DBC though I didn't
04:15 - have any like very strong experience
04:18 - it's more just like Java the basics of
04:20 - like mmm like declaration of variables
04:23 - of stuff like nothing bad intense or
04:25 - extreme right so I'm I've heard about
04:28 - Neopets but I don't know like too much
04:30 - about how it works yeah I could game
04:33 - where are you girl pets and stuff kind
04:35 - of it's this goal it's this old game
04:37 - from like the 2000s where you have a
04:39 - bunch of pets and I guess you'd grow
04:41 - them you also make them stronger you
04:43 - also like trying to make money by
04:45 - playing games and I guess the main goal
04:49 - of it was to make money to buy a house
04:51 - to keep your pets in and buy them
04:53 - clothes like accessories and things like
04:55 - that so yeah and then with that people
04:58 - would make like profile pages to like
05:00 - highlight their pets and such and that
05:02 - had like a lot of like you can put in
05:04 - your own custom CSS and HTML to make it
05:06 - look cooler so that was like my first
05:09 - experience playing around with code
05:10 - because I want to make my page look
05:12 - really cool it doesn't really look that
05:15 - cool but you know a little kid with a
05:18 - lot of colors and everything as opposed
05:20 - to basic pH I was available right so you
05:23 - started learning HTML and CSS and maybe
05:26 - a few other things from Neopets and you
05:29 - were like I want to learn more about
05:30 - coding yeah well actually after that it
05:34 - kind of dropped off for a bit but then
05:36 - when I
05:36 - put back when I like into programming
05:39 - class back in high school it all started
05:41 - coming back and I started enjoying it
05:42 - again and we used to make up Java games
05:44 - in that class so I started enjoying like
05:47 - the ui/ux part of that as well cuz it
05:50 - brought back the Neopets days as well as
05:53 - I just enjoyed the logic and the
05:55 - mathematics behind it while I was in
05:58 - high school so that's kind of what
05:59 - started my interest okay and then when
06:02 - you went to you know the UBC in
06:04 - Vancouver you immediately choose
06:07 - computer science as your major I did yes
06:10 - I went straight into computer science
06:12 - CBC had that option so okay and so at
06:17 - some point you know you were able to get
06:19 - your first internship at Microsoft I
06:21 - think as an explorer intern so could you
06:24 - tell everyone a little bit about what
06:26 - kind of experience you had prior to
06:28 - working there sure um so prior to that I
06:32 - actually didn't have that much
06:33 - experience the Explorer program is for
06:35 - freshmen or sophomore those without much
06:38 - experience in science so I think the
06:40 - biggest thing that I had was they were
06:42 - looking for an interest in computer
06:44 - science so more my involvement rather
06:46 - than like concrete things that I've
06:49 - completed I think because by that point
06:51 - I didn't I didn't have anything concrete
06:53 - from sound vision or anything what I did
06:55 - that in tribute so it was more just like
06:57 - where I was showing my interest so me
06:59 - participating a sound vision me doing
07:01 - extracurriculars outside of class that
07:03 - showed like my interest in computer
07:05 - science and coding as well as you did
07:09 - need some knowledge of data structures
07:10 - so I did study off of there cracking the
07:14 - coding interview book and that was the
07:16 - main two things it was just showing my
07:18 - interest and knowing like linked lists
07:21 - and arrays and string manipulation those
07:25 - are the main things from cracking the
07:26 - code even near the beginning of the book
07:28 - okay just just in case you know some
07:32 - people came just now
07:34 - sound vision was that project we worked
07:36 - on us basically an iOS app and what was
07:40 - your interview like for the Explorer
07:42 - intern right I'll first explain what the
07:46 - exported so it's more it's a freshman
07:48 - program
07:49 - that allows you to explore both the
07:51 - three positions of being quality p.m. so
07:55 - program manager and dev in Microsoft so
07:58 - you do you're going to part of two other
08:00 - interns with you you both you three of
08:02 - you work on the same project and you
08:04 - just cycle through the different roles
08:05 - so in that interview process
08:08 - they kind of tested in all three roles
08:10 - so they would ask me some coding
08:12 - questions and then they also ask me some
08:15 - more design related questions like
08:17 - design are calculated for the blind for
08:20 - example and where you put into
08:22 - consideration what the buttons should be
08:24 - like what the material you're gonna use
08:26 - for those buttons if there should be
08:27 - sound feedback and it kind of just show
08:30 - like you have a higher thinking like to
08:33 - be more of PME to have like more design
08:35 - or int your thinking as well as they
08:38 - also did def questions so the usual ones
08:41 - that you would find in practically
08:43 - cutting each of you yeah okay that
08:47 - sounds good and what is it has an
08:49 - explorer intern so that was like for the
08:52 - entire summer right for three or four
08:53 - months yeah it's for three months twelve
08:56 - weeks and as an explorer attorney I
08:59 - worked under the edge team under the
09:00 - quality team so we were building an
09:03 - internal bug tracking tool yeah so what
09:05 - second edge is the you know Microsoft's
09:08 - new browser right yeah so we were
09:16 - working on to the edge team specifically
09:18 - under the quality team at Microsoft so
09:20 - they the team that I was working on they
09:22 - focus more internal tools making a lot
09:25 - of internal tools so the tool that we
09:27 - were responsible for was making a bug
09:28 - tracking tool or pretty much those using
09:31 - edge internally could submit bugs easily
09:34 - into and to see bugs
09:37 - so yeah that's what we're doing we spent
09:40 - the first few weeks interviewing people
09:42 - around the around the floor and around
09:44 - our team asking them what kind of things
09:46 - they want to see what Qaida and being
09:50 - like interview all the stakeholders
09:51 - essentially and then afterwards we
09:53 - developed for a long time and then
09:56 - finally we collected data so it's called
09:58 - telemetry and Microsoft about
10:02 - our findings to showcase the team okay
10:06 - so it was like a team of just interns
10:09 - working on this project
10:10 - yes it was me plus two interns so all
10:13 - the Explorer programs it's you plus two
10:15 - other entrants
10:16 - all right nice because you get a nice
10:18 - like little teeny bonding experience too
10:20 - okay so this like you totally owned this
10:24 - project and it was up to you like what
10:25 - you wanted to build into this thing and
10:27 - what you wanted to do with it
10:28 - yep pretty much yep they just kind of
10:30 - gave like the overall like motivation
10:32 - behind it so we want to see bugs for the
10:35 - website and then it was just our
10:37 - responsibility for how we want to do it
10:39 - and what we would okay let's move
10:43 - forward now a little bit so that was was
10:46 - that like after your first year in
10:48 - university or your second year first
10:51 - year and then after that you you know
10:54 - you returned to Microsoft as a PM intern
10:57 - or program manager intern as they you
11:00 - know as they call it yeah so what's that
11:02 - like the year right after that um kind
11:06 - of it was so I was in the summer of
11:08 - first year I did explore and in the fall
11:10 - of third year / second years after my
11:14 - second year I went to another program of
11:17 - the summer so that's why I pushed my
11:18 - internship to the fall yeah so it was in
11:22 - the fall and to pick p.m. what happens
11:25 - with the Explorer program is after you
11:26 - do it you I you sometimes interview for
11:31 - well it kind of depends on what team
11:32 - you're originally placed in but you
11:34 - interview for another rule so I
11:36 - interviewed to be a p.m. and then I was
11:38 - places yeah right and just in case you
11:42 - know people don't know what is what is
11:44 - p.m. what is program manager and why did
11:46 - you choose that role for yourself yeah
11:48 - so program manager there's a lot of
11:51 - definitions of it but I think the
11:53 - biggest thing is from what my experience
11:57 - with is to see end to end the whole like
12:01 - a portion of the system and just keep
12:04 - everything kind of on track as well as
12:08 - kind of help the business value of your
12:11 - projects so you kind of look a little
12:12 - bit more into the business side as well
12:14 - for me the reason why I picked
12:16 - depict it because many of the peons that
12:18 - I met I really liked a few of the things
12:22 - they were doing so first thing is they
12:23 - had full oversight of the whole project
12:25 - which is really cool like if you ask me
12:27 - a question they'll know everything about
12:28 - something so if you don't know how to
12:30 - use a certain tool if you have to PM
12:31 - about it most of the times they actually
12:33 - know everything about it first is if you
12:34 - ask the developer they're very
12:35 - concentrated so I like the like how do I
12:39 - say a higher view of the project and the
12:42 - other thing I liked is that you also do
12:44 - code so it's not all just business we do
12:47 - code and you tend to code at least for
12:49 - me it was like other smaller projects or
12:51 - like I've seen PM's prototype code
12:54 - prototypes or code testing environments
12:57 - or just code like different things so
13:00 - you kind of get more flexibility from
13:02 - what I found in what you want to do on
13:04 - the terms of coding
13:05 - I want to code so when I told my manager
13:08 - like the first thing I said was I want
13:10 - to code that's what I like doing so he
13:11 - gave me a project purely relate to
13:14 - coming and there are other pans who
13:17 - don't want to come as much so they can
13:18 - do other things as well I think there's
13:20 - a lot of flexible all right so just to
13:23 - give everyone a little bit of context
13:24 - when people say p.m. it could mean like
13:27 - a few different things it could be like
13:29 - project manager product manager or
13:31 - program manager and I Microsoft you know
13:34 - the most common term is program manager
13:37 - and it's sort of like this like these
13:40 - whole things are this disposition where
13:43 - you decide what the product you know
13:45 - sort of looks like in general like not
13:48 - too much in detail because that's the
13:50 - the responsibility of you know of a
13:52 - designer like a UX or UI designer and
13:54 - then once p.m. has like a mock-up of
13:57 - what the product looks like then they
14:00 - sort of give it to the developers and
14:01 - they did you know do all of it that's
14:04 - sort of the usual practice at different
14:07 - software companies so what did you do as
14:10 - a p.m. Microsoft yeah so what I did was
14:14 - I was working again on your edge under
14:16 - their layout team which is responsible
14:18 - for CSS so what I was doing was
14:21 - collecting data about the usage of
14:24 - certain CSS properties across the web so
14:27 - pretty much I was crawling two million
14:29 - and collecting data and aggregating that
14:32 - into a website to be viewable by anyone
14:36 - um you say you were you are scraping 2
14:40 - million websites yeah yeah what did you
14:43 - use to do that um so we have like an
14:45 - internal crawler system where pretty
14:49 - much I made the code the script to
14:51 - scrape the information and I just ran it
14:54 - on that crawler system that they have
14:56 - internally and they went over Chrome
14:58 - Firefox and edge and it just scraped all
15:01 - the information off of some random
15:04 - source of 200 million euros I'm not
15:07 - exactly sure how we got that 2 million
15:09 - from but it's supposed to be a very
15:12 - representative sample and then yeah and
15:15 - then I was just responsible for
15:16 - collecting that data and then cleaning
15:19 - it up to make it actually readable and
15:21 - useful because you'd get I think we got
15:23 - like I got 9 terabytes of data back
15:25 - after doing that so that it's cleaning
15:27 - it up and making it actually actionable
15:30 - and that was pretty much my whole
15:32 - project was making actionable data for
15:35 - the other devil development teams or
15:37 - other PM's or whoever else ok and you
15:40 - say you the goal of that project was to
15:43 - analyze how CSS was used um it was aged
15:46 - analyzed but B was more to give more
15:49 - actionable feedback to our teams so
15:53 - specifically I was looking at rules it's
15:55 - a new feature from CSS so I'm
15:58 - specifically looking to how people
16:00 - nowadays in their websites use that
16:02 - rules and if our developers or our team
16:05 - can be better suited for the web so that
16:11 - just just in case you know there's
16:14 - someone who's not familiar it's like CSS
16:16 - and HTML CSS and HTML you know are
16:19 - basically used to build web pages and
16:21 - they're like always new developments in
16:24 - CSS I think so they're like always new
16:26 - features and stuff so you were basically
16:28 - like maybe counting the number of times
16:30 - that rule was used and how it was used
16:32 - yeah yes accounting the number of times
16:35 - it's used what kind of values people use
16:37 - like for it because I'm like what kind
16:39 - of specifications they would use I kind
16:41 - of just getting an overall percentage
16:43 - like what is used where and what kind of
16:47 - sites use these okay and just moving
16:52 - back a little bit I guess what was your
16:54 - experience like you know to become a PM
16:57 - or program manager intern at Microsoft
16:59 - the interview experience or sure
17:02 - interview experience right the interview
17:04 - experience from what I know a very some
17:07 - person person but for me it was there
17:09 - was no technical questions for me it was
17:11 - more questions related to like higher
17:15 - level thinking of design or or even like
17:20 - how to find business value and things so
17:21 - I got questions like if you were to
17:25 - pitch edge to a director how would you
17:28 - pitch it what business value can you
17:30 - like show for edge so things like that
17:33 - but I know that other PM's who also
17:36 - interviewed they got technical questions
17:38 - so they got like code this thing or code
17:40 - that so I think it really depends on the
17:43 - interviewer because some p.m. tend to be
17:46 - very very technical and some pants I
17:47 - guess aren't as technical they're more
17:49 - business focused so I guess it depends
17:51 - on interviewer a little bit okay that
17:54 - sounds good what did you think of you
17:56 - know your experience as a PM intern and
17:59 - then before that as as a exploring term
18:04 - explorer I loved it and I would
18:06 - recommend any freshman to do it I think
18:08 - was a really great experience it was
18:10 - really fun I learned a lot made really
18:12 - good friends it was just an overall
18:14 - really good summer so definitely
18:16 - recommend to anyone
18:17 - umm p.m. for me it was a very different
18:20 - experience because I was in the fall so
18:22 - I also got a little glimpse of what
18:24 - full-time life would be like it's very
18:26 - different in summer than it is in the
18:27 - fall I liked it um I wouldn't say it's
18:30 - like of the same excitement as explore
18:32 - just because explore was in the summer
18:34 - with like 2,000 interns a lot more fun
18:36 - yeah yeah I think what like what people
18:39 - don't see immediately is that you know I
18:41 - interned at Microsoft to and in the
18:43 - summer there are a lot of interns like
18:46 - 2000 interns and there's like even an
18:48 - event where every intern sort of comes
18:50 - together and there's a concert and stuff
18:53 - so it's almost like a den party guys
18:56 - and there's like events like every
18:58 - single day and there's like foods and
19:00 - like there's just like constantly like
19:02 - things to do like they're barely bored I
19:05 - wasn't bored at all like last summer at
19:07 - all I never had a moment of being bored
19:08 - because they're just so Mara I'm gonna
19:12 - fall is a lot different I I still really
19:14 - liked it like but it was like much more
19:16 - realistic I guess if you could put that
19:18 - as a word everyone's really nice and
19:20 - everyone's really easy to work with but
19:23 - of course it wasn't like the two
19:25 - thousand interest to hang out with and
19:26 - there was an event every single day it
19:28 - was a lot more like normal life kind of
19:31 - thing and as a p.m. I really enjoyed it
19:35 - I really enjoyed our team I really
19:37 - enjoyed talking to people but yeah I
19:41 - think I think I enjoyed the talking to
19:43 - people I enjoyed coding I think I was
19:45 - lucky and that my manager was pretty
19:47 - responsive to me so he I just told them
19:49 - I want to code and he gave me a project
19:50 - that was heavily technical um as opposed
19:53 - to something not nice yeah so um you're
19:58 - living in Seattle now yep so working on
20:01 - your projects and taking courses at the
20:03 - same time
20:04 - what's your you know like what's your
20:06 - life like in Seattle my life is very
20:10 - interesting so a few like random facts I
20:15 - guess is um so I'm living with a
20:17 - roommate right now in two hundred square
20:20 - feet place so probably like the size of
20:23 - a dorm room and we're working on project
20:26 - together so that's why I were living
20:27 - together and I guess like if the random
20:30 - facts is I actually live off of Soylent
20:34 - which is not very conventional but I
20:39 - don't know if you guys can see that
20:40 - that's all the empty ones for like the
20:42 - past I don't know three weeks or
20:44 - something like that yeah so in case you
20:46 - know Soylent is this like you know there
20:49 - it's supposed to be food you can drink
20:51 - yeah yeah pretty much
20:53 - supposedly I mean I like it so far I've
20:56 - liked it I've been on it for like many
20:58 - months now but it's 20% of your daily
21:01 - nutrition in a bottle and it's like
21:03 - drinkable and it comes from Amazon so
21:06 - yeah
21:08 - today and this live stream is not
21:11 - sponsored by Soylent it's not yeah
21:18 - pretty much living off this toy line and
21:19 - I'm perfectly healthy so that's good
21:22 - working for you then written gay uh yeah
21:26 - and then living in its very small place
21:28 - I'm still doing school so I actually
21:30 - spend a lot of time going back and forth
21:32 - from make over to Seattle of attending
21:34 - classes and quizzes but working on my
21:36 - project here it's a bit of a mess uh
21:39 - yeah that that's my semester in the next
21:42 - few months really okay and you know we
21:46 - we talked about it before a little bit
21:48 - and what I found interesting is that how
21:50 - you don't have a lot of stuff
21:52 - no yeah because of a really small place
21:57 - and there's two of us I think like yeah
22:02 - I only have like one suitcase of things
22:04 - which is like very different from the
22:05 - usual where like if you're living
22:07 - somewhere for a long time you can't fit
22:08 - all of your belongings into one suitcase
22:10 - so yeah and like we live on oh we sleep
22:14 - on like camping cots um because it was
22:17 - the easiest and the cheapest like a pink
22:20 - card spot kind of pink hot so they're
22:23 - like these beds that you usually take
22:24 - for camping so they're foldable oh and
22:26 - you put them in the car and you unfold
22:28 - them we sleep on that because it was
22:30 - cheapest and the easiest to get to so
22:34 - yeah yeah the very minimalistic I would
22:36 - say yeah yeah and you didn't even have a
22:38 - desk gray at some point oh yeah for a
22:41 - while we were using like an ironing
22:42 - board from Goodwill it was like three
22:45 - bucks and our chairs are actually like
22:47 - three dollars each the diving board was
22:49 - like four bucks maybe and using that for
22:51 - a while it's really ergonomic so I kind
22:53 - of think it's a business idea if you
22:54 - also go with it
22:55 - to make like an ironing board s cuz I
22:58 - just heights really well but now we have
23:00 - a desk fronting good well which is like
23:02 - 10 bucks but yeah yeah yeah that's
23:05 - better
23:05 - yeah okay so the life audience Q&A
23:08 - sessions coming up it starts so many
23:11 - questions
23:12 - you leave live chat we're gonna take a
23:15 - look at them you can ask kana or me any
23:18 - questions you have and for future live
23:20 - stream the best way to you know get
23:23 - credit on that is just by following csgo
23:25 - jokes Facebook page you can just search
23:27 - for CH dojo on Facebook for that so
23:30 - let's do life audience Q&A kind of
23:33 - beauty any interesting questions reading
23:48 - yeah it's cool not any questions if you
23:51 - see any yep is someone's asking are you
24:00 - from India I'm not I'm actually Bengali
24:04 - but I grew up in Canada Victoria my
24:07 - whole life because someone's asking me
24:17 - I am a University of Waterloo student
24:19 - that's in Canada what do you guys think
24:22 - of that school do you ever hear of it in
24:24 - the industry definitely like when I was
24:27 - interning at Microsoft you know I'm from
24:30 - the UBC which is in Vancouver and there
24:33 - were like maybe five people from UBC and
24:34 - they were like 40 people from you know
24:37 - University of Waterloo so I think it's
24:39 - definitely the best school for computer
24:41 - science in Canada
24:42 - definitely it's insane even like they
24:46 - also have a lot of meetup so all the
24:48 - tech interns that I'm from Waterloo for
24:50 - Facebook Microsoft Google all of them
24:52 - meet up a lot it's definitely like
24:54 - really like one of the best it has the
24:56 - best network yep
24:58 - Tenzing big one I think is asking what
25:01 - is the best website or way to get
25:04 - internship um so my my process of
25:09 - getting my recruiter was I attended the
25:10 - career fair at school and I kinda just
25:13 - started from there and it's really
25:15 - important one one advice I have for
25:17 - everyone is if they don't reply to you
25:18 - in two weeks please email them again
25:20 - sometimes I forget and like so many
25:23 - people I know missed out on
25:24 - opportunities because they just didn't
25:26 - think it was too routed email again but
25:28 - you should like definitely suspension
25:30 - weeks email again until you get a formal
25:32 - answer but yeah mainly just from school
25:35 - yes
25:36 - I definitely agree with that career fair
25:38 - thing so you know it's different for big
25:41 - companies and smaller companies for
25:43 - smaller companies I think the best way
25:44 - is to just sort of you know be they're
25:47 - all networked and you know maybe email
25:49 - people on LinkedIn before large
25:51 - companies going to career fairs it can
25:54 - be really really effective hmm um I did
25:57 - get paid I saw a question I did get paid
25:59 - to work at Microsoft as both an explorer
26:01 - and a PM injured I think someone was
26:04 - asking like a salary question would you
26:07 - be willing to share that sorry like well
26:10 - some of us asking a question about
26:12 - salary I wasn't there I don't know if
26:15 - I'm allowed to say specifically but I
26:17 - can kind of say that Explorer was a
26:21 - little bit less than a regular insurer
26:23 - oh but I don't think I'm allowed to
26:25 - fully disclose the exact amount but it
26:28 - was regardless right so I can you know
26:32 - just share my personal experience I
26:35 - think Microsoft so as a program manager
26:40 - intern I was getting paid I mean I I
26:42 - thought it was kind of crazy but I was
26:45 - gonna pay like seven thousand US dollars
26:47 - and when I heard it I was like well yeah
26:50 - that's that doesn't make any sense but
26:52 - that's sort of like you know what they
26:55 - the level you know they go they go for
26:57 - it like these big companies are pretty
27:01 - similar there's another question for me
27:10 - what programming language do you
27:12 - recommend me to start learning if I'm
27:14 - starting to learn any programming
27:16 - language so my advice is sort of always
27:19 - the same you know either Python or
27:22 - JavaScript and you know if you do with
27:25 - if you if you go with JavaScript go with
27:28 - like HTML CSS and then JavaScript and do
27:33 - you have any thoughts on that uh yeah
27:36 - that was a similar path that I went
27:37 - through with HTML CSS and JavaScript I
27:40 - also really recommend maybe I'm a little
27:43 - biased because of my computer science
27:44 - degree but to have like to start
27:47 - learning about the fundamentals and you
27:49 - can use that
27:50 - language business you're specific but
27:52 - actually like try to learn it rather
27:54 - than just like how to build a website
27:56 - but also like the things behind cracking
27:59 - the coding interview like the data
28:00 - structures and stuff okay I'm looking
28:06 - for more questions someone says what
28:16 - about Ruby so I would say Ruby is like a
28:20 - really simple and nice language to learn
28:23 - it is getting less popular these days
28:25 - but it's still like a good first
28:27 - language to learn I think someone's
28:37 - saying any interview tips um the biggest
28:42 - interview tip I have is talk your
28:44 - thoughts out loud that's really really
28:46 - helpful for the achieve your and also I
28:48 - think most my interviews have gone
28:50 - really well whenever I'm just talking
28:52 - through my thoughts hmm so as they ask a
28:55 - question I repeat it as I'm writing down
28:58 - things on the board
28:59 - I like say them out loud I also before
29:03 - encode make sure I understand the whole
29:05 - problem so I will ask questions make
29:07 - sure I understand all of the problem and
29:09 - then start coding it even when I'm
29:11 - coding I'm still talking about what I'm
29:14 - coding and why I'm doing certain lines
29:15 - and what my thought processes yeah I
29:18 - definitely agree with that I think I
29:20 - mean someone's asking me for it you know
29:22 - some interview tips and I think a lot of
29:24 - what a lot of people miss is how
29:27 - interviews are not just about solving
29:29 - you know the technical problem it's also
29:31 - about communicating your thoughts and
29:33 - trying to understand what the interior
29:35 - like wants exactly so that you know you
29:39 - can answer the question exactly that
29:41 - they're asking okay so should we take
29:47 - one more question - yeah sure okay
29:55 - looking through some questions here
30:07 - saying any website you recommend for a
30:09 - self-learning coding I have some
30:12 - thoughts on that do you have any
30:13 - thoughts
30:15 - okay sure so I would say code Academy is
30:20 - good I also heard that let me just type
30:24 - it in you know in the chat too so code
30:27 - kata me I saw you was code Academy but
30:30 - apparently it's code Academy was just
30:32 - confusing and then another one is I
30:38 - can't remember remember I can't remember
30:40 - what it's called but it's similar to
30:41 - code Academy like you know it does any
30:43 - of any of those interactive websites
30:45 - it's good and after that I would
30:46 - recommend
30:47 - Rinda calm and good to me like video of
30:52 - websites anything you want to add um I
31:04 - mostly I guess most money like online
31:06 - learning has been prepared for
31:07 - interviews so I really like using packer
31:10 - rank and I leak code sorry I was
31:15 - blinking so yeah those two um but I
31:20 - don't know any specific like video sites
31:23 - I also recommend also looking at like if
31:25 - you have time to look through like
31:26 - online video lectures from the
31:28 - universities if you guys want like a
31:30 - university I think courses on Coursera
31:32 - and stuff are good too yeah yeah one the
31:37 - one I was trying to think of yeah was
31:38 - free code camp free code camp is sort of
31:41 - I think similar to Co Academy but you
31:43 - know three hmm yeah okay um I guess
31:48 - that's it for this call yeah thanks for
31:54 - having me yeah no problem thanks for
31:56 - coming to my show first and thanks
32:01 - everyone for um you know being part of
32:03 - this and I'll see you guys in the next
32:05 - video bye bye everyone
