00:00 - they're paying us on average about a
00:01 - hundred bucks a month a little bit over
00:03 - that and so we're making half a million
00:04 - in annual revenue hey everyone today I
00:08 - have an interview for you guys with a
00:10 - couple who built their startup while
00:12 - traveling we talked about how they
00:15 - started their company the strategies
00:17 - they use to stay productive while
00:19 - traveling and the tech stack that they
00:21 - use to build their system among other
00:23 - things I personally learned a lot from
00:26 - this interview so hopefully you'll look
00:27 - to startups come cannae and that's the
00:32 - website scanning dot io and it's a user
00:34 - feedback tool and so we help other
00:36 - software companies keep track of feature
00:38 - requests and bug reports from their
00:40 - users that they can build a better
00:41 - product Yeah right so actually I had
00:44 - seen Kenny before oh really yeah
00:47 - yeah so what I saw was it's like a list
00:51 - of feature requests where people can
00:54 - like upload and maybe down boy
00:55 - - right no down vote no their cell phone
00:58 - which iq+
00:58 - and how long have we been running the
01:01 - company
01:02 - I think I left my full-time job about
01:03 - three and a half years ago but I guess
01:07 - we launched Kenny almost two and a half
01:09 - years ago now yeah okay
01:11 - so that was your job at Facebook yep
01:13 - cause we're gonna react team at Facebook
01:14 - nice stop engineer yep and you were
01:17 - designer at Facebook I was a designer I
01:19 - worked on a messenger messenger yeah so
01:23 - you left three and a half years ago did
01:25 - you leave about the same time no funny
01:28 - enough I started and entered left pretty
01:32 - much right exactly when I started as
01:35 - your left oh yeah so I kind of stayed
01:38 - there for my year and a half while
01:40 - Andrew kind of worked on an earlier
01:42 - version of candy I guess and then
01:46 - eventually I left to join him yeah I
01:47 - like to say I recruited sir did you did
01:54 - you leave Facebook to work on this
01:57 - startup yep this is different flavor of
01:59 - this startup and so back then was called
02:01 - product pains and it was a community
02:03 - where people can post and vote on
02:04 - feature requests for any product
02:06 - publicly and so we had a couple
02:08 - companies using it
02:10 - eventually the companies wanted more and
02:11 - more features and we kind of turn it
02:13 - into a sass - Landry pretended as candy
02:14 - and so yeah I was similar definitely
02:17 - yeah I mean eventually we found that we
02:20 - needed to make money a heart business
02:23 - and the earlier product pains the
02:26 - earlier version was very consumer
02:28 - focused and so there was not really a
02:30 - business model behind it and so we
02:34 - basically flipped it into a SAS tool and
02:36 - so we charged businesses to pay to use
02:40 - the platform yeah and how were you like
02:44 - how could you be so confident that you
02:47 - know you left good job it's not too
02:50 - comfortable it felt like um you know I
02:52 - wanted to get into startups and it felt
02:53 - like the things that I was learning at a
02:54 - big company weren't really relevant to
02:56 - startups like sales and marketing and
02:58 - recruiting and all that and so yeah I
03:00 - felt like I had to had to you know take
03:03 - a risk and go do it you know I had an
03:05 - idea that I was excited about and yeah
03:08 - that's turned out great I mean I think
03:11 - when you're going to startups there's
03:12 - there's no guarantee and this is our
03:15 - first venture together and so there was
03:18 - definitely like this feeling of you
03:20 - don't know what's gonna happen you don't
03:21 - know if you're gonna be successful and
03:23 - it definitely felt that way for a long
03:25 - time with product pains we just didn't
03:26 - really know where it was going for a
03:27 - long time
03:29 - I know we made our first dollar or first
03:31 - $20 and then we were like okay there's
03:34 - something going on here which brings us
03:38 - down here today right how long did it
03:42 - take you to you know make those firsts
03:44 - ready no yeah it was like a year and a
03:46 - half since I quit my job yeah but we
03:48 - weren't really focused on you know we
03:50 - were building a community like there
03:51 - wasn't even way for people to pay us and
03:52 - so we were just focused on growing this
03:54 - community with users giving feedback to
03:56 - companies and then companies started
03:58 - asking for the features and we said hey
04:00 - would you pay for those and then they
04:01 - said yeah and kind of happened naturally
04:04 - that we turn it into a money-making
04:06 - business which is great because we're
04:09 - bootstrapped
04:09 - and so we wouldn't be able to really
04:11 - contain
04:12 - doing this the way we want it to without
04:15 - being able to charge customers to make
04:17 - money off our work yeah yeah that's
04:20 - really cool
04:22 - so it's been two and a half years since
04:25 - since the launch since the launch yeah
04:27 - and like after that like after all that
04:30 - could you tell us about how the company
04:32 - is doing you know in terms of maybe the
04:34 - number of employees revenue numbers you
04:36 - can do my cherish sure yeah so we have
04:39 - 450 customers and those are paying
04:41 - customers and they're paying us on
04:44 - average about a hundred bucks a month a
04:45 - little bit over that and so we're making
04:47 - half a million in annual revenue which
04:50 - feels great for bootstrap company no no
04:51 - outside funding half a million is enough
04:53 - where we can support it like our
04:54 - business and a team we've hired three
04:57 - other people and they're all remote and
04:59 - so our team is in UK Estonia and Seattle
05:03 - and then we're here in Toronto and yeah
05:06 - we're really excited about where we are
05:08 - oh yeah so I went to the University of
05:11 - Waterloo and I studied a software
05:13 - engineering and I studied in a design
05:16 - program it was a joint program between
05:18 - York University and Sheridan College
05:20 - yeah I was like a regular 4 year program
05:22 - but very very much graphic design
05:25 - focused and less like digital tech focus
05:29 - yeah I eventually found my way to doing
05:31 - kind of more product design and UI
05:32 - design and stuff right so how did you
05:35 - get into tech yeah tons of my friends
05:39 - went to Waterloo honestly for for
05:41 - engineering and eventually participated
05:45 - in a bunch of hackathons which really
05:48 - opened my eyes to tech and San Francisco
05:50 - in general and I just really gravitated
05:54 - towards that and less of what I was
05:56 - studying at school which was a lot of
05:58 - like editorial design packaging stuff
06:01 - like that that's more traditional so I
06:04 - really really enjoyed that the the web
06:07 - aspect and so I just pretty much focused
06:10 - on that and did a bunch of internships
06:12 - and then eventually yeah I found my self
06:15 - at Facebook did you learn to do web
06:18 - stuff like digital stuff on your own
06:20 - then yeah school the school curriculum
06:24 - was behind
06:25 - in those aspects so we did have to take
06:29 - that onto ourselves just having a
06:33 - website it's kind of a must so in third
06:36 - year I think I just kind of said screw
06:38 - it like I'm not really learning how to
06:40 - build a website I'm just gonna go do
06:41 - this on my own during some summer and so
06:44 - I just got my own website and that's
06:45 - kind of how I picked my front-end skills
06:48 - yeah nice so after graduating from like
06:53 - those programs you bullets decided to
06:55 - work at Facebook I did this I tried to
06:58 - do a start-up for six months and it
07:00 - didn't go super well my co-founder felt
07:02 - some pressure to go get a job and so
07:05 - it's kind of just me working full-time
07:06 - and I had like the Facebook offer
07:08 - there's a backup option and I ended up
07:10 - taking at one point yeah I think it was
07:13 - a good move for both of us just to get
07:15 - some like foundation and like early job
07:17 - skills but there's nothing really that
07:19 - like sets you up for entrepreneurship
07:22 - other than doing it so yeah I'm glad we
07:25 - both got that taste but now we're like
07:27 - here doing our thing I think was super
07:30 - worthwhile like there's the the
07:32 - experience you get of you know being
07:35 - able to put together a project on your
07:37 - own which you might not get until you
07:39 - have some professional experience and
07:40 - then also financially like we probably
07:42 - couldn't have worked on it without you
07:44 - know funding if we didn't have a little
07:47 - bit of a financial cushion from working
07:48 - in a big company yeah that's really true
07:50 - right so working at Facebook was like
07:54 - very different from what you did not
07:56 - right 100% different I mean I wouldn't
08:00 - say I didn't like it like I really do
08:01 - like I really thought I did go to work
08:04 - there and I really enjoyed the people
08:06 - that I worked with but it wasn't like I
08:08 - knew from the beginning that I wanted to
08:09 - do my own company someday and so I made
08:12 - the jump eventually and yeah it's it's
08:15 - really different same thing for you
08:17 - yeah I mean I think at a big company
08:20 - like you're focused on this tiny tiny
08:21 - thing that's part of a huge huge picture
08:24 - and like for me I didn't really even
08:25 - know how my job correlated to growing
08:27 - Facebook's business I just was tasked to
08:29 - like make react native which was a part
08:32 - of react a great project used by a lot
08:34 - of companies and yeah whereas it can II
08:38 - it's hard to do anything without
08:40 - thinking about the ROI and like how is
08:42 - this gonna grow our business and if it's
08:45 - not worthwhile then we don't do it yeah
08:47 - that's really your impact a lot more
08:49 - directly yeah and the breath like you
08:51 - know here we're doing sales were doing
08:52 - marketing we're doing recruiting we're
08:53 - doing all this stuff that you know was
08:55 - totally abstracted away from your job as
08:57 - an engineer at Facebook which is cool
09:00 - it's fun to learn about a lot of new
09:02 - things to learn them yeah definitely so
09:06 - let's let's talk about you know how
09:08 - you've been traveling yeah building the
09:11 - company when did you decide to move out
09:15 - of San Francisco and why did you decide
09:17 - to move out of it yeah well since this
09:20 - was a great place to live if you're
09:21 - working at a big company or if you're
09:23 - trying to raise money but after we were
09:26 - after we left our big company and
09:28 - weren't trying to raise money it didn't
09:30 - feel like a great fit for us anymore
09:31 - it was it's really expensive really
09:33 - really expensive City and we had always
09:36 - kind of wanted to travel and you know we
09:38 - didn't have an office we didn't have
09:40 - employees we're gonna have investors
09:41 - there's no reason really keeping us
09:42 - there and so we thought why not go beat
09:44 - digital nomads for a little bit and we
09:47 - booked a ticket to London was our first
09:49 - destination just to kind of warm up with
09:51 - traveling and yeah we we ended up
09:55 - traveling for about two years after that
09:57 - yeah we're actually just now kind of
10:00 - slowing down a little bit and we decided
10:02 - to stay in Toronto so that's pretty
10:04 - exciting so were you like tired of
10:08 - traveling I think the biggest thing is
10:15 - loneliness is because we would stay in
10:16 - the city for about a month and then move
10:17 - around and you don't make a lot of
10:19 - friends that way just because you know
10:21 - even if you do meet people then you like
10:22 - leave immediately after and it's hard to
10:24 - find people who are gonna like travel
10:25 - tips from city to city with you and yeah
10:28 - I just missed like being around friends
10:29 - and so that was the big motivator for me
10:31 - was just being coming back and being
10:33 - around friends and having that
10:34 - camaraderie that you have you know
10:35 - hanging out with people that you know
10:36 - and like and yeah it's not for everyone
10:39 - that's for sure I would continue doing
10:42 - it but honestly and you Andrews made a
10:44 - big compromise for the last two years so
10:47 - thanks so when you're traveling
10:52 - would you like book on Airbnb for a
10:54 - month something like that yeah I booked
10:57 - flights yeah I mean we wouldn't like
11:00 - it's a trade-off if you if you booked it
11:02 - farther in advance you get cheaper and
11:04 - better places but you get less
11:06 - flexibility if you booked it like last
11:08 - minute you get worse places for more
11:10 - money but you get a lot of flexibility
11:11 - so we would some end up somewhere in the
11:13 - middle where maybe we'd book it like a
11:15 - month in advance or we'd book like a
11:16 - couple of our next stops we'd never try
11:19 - to be like crazy planners but we
11:21 - wouldn't save it for the very last
11:23 - second so that we could slip in a nice
11:24 - place and yeah we would try to stay in
11:26 - Airbnb for a month and you know usually
11:29 - if you stay for a month there's a
11:30 - discount it can be as much as like 30 40
11:32 - percent off and so you can get some
11:33 - great deals it makes it like very
11:34 - livable
11:35 - it was definitely way cheaper than
11:37 - living in like San Francisco like I
11:39 - think our average rent split between the
11:41 - two of us so it's maybe like $700 a
11:42 - month
11:42 - for the two years Wow which is pretty
11:45 - affordable compared to most cities yeah
11:46 - yeah especially like Southeast Asia
11:49 - right can you make it over there is just
11:51 - like meals or a dollar like it's crazy
11:54 - it's so cheap yeah yeah yeah we actually
11:58 - travel the world and save money
12:00 - yeah a lot of you asked how do you how
12:02 - do you afford to travel so much like
12:04 - we're saving yeah yeah yeah I think if
12:10 - you have the flexibility like I would
12:12 - recommend anybody should like try it and
12:15 - honestly if you don't like it just come
12:16 - back it's not a big deal yeah yeah and
12:20 - what was he like to you know try to
12:23 - build a company well chocolatine it was
12:25 - challenging I mean we weren't just like
12:27 - traveling right like we were working
12:28 - full-time and so every day it's like
12:30 - okay where's the cafe we gotta find a
12:32 - cafe with Wi-Fi and bathrooms and food
12:34 - and outlets and all that and that can be
12:36 - a struggle you know you get to a new
12:37 - place you get to like you know we're in
12:39 - like Ho Chi Minh City and we're like
12:40 - okay where's the cafe today and it's
12:41 - just like they did have them they've got
12:44 - like great tea shops and whatnot and
12:46 - like that was the ongoing struggle was
12:47 - like finding a good place to work but we
12:50 - did and a lot of times we work from home
12:51 - and um yeah I don't know I think I think
12:56 - well well and what's it being like well
13:00 - like what was he like to you know work
13:02 - with people remotely yeah yeah we kind
13:05 - of figured it out as we go as we went
13:09 - and yeah I don't know like we we had to
13:11 - think about like especially for
13:12 - something like customer success or
13:14 - marketing and something that we haven't
13:15 - actually worked in a job like this
13:16 - before and so we just think about like
13:18 - what do we do on a daily basis you know
13:20 - we're like this is how we talk to
13:21 - customers this is how we do support and
13:24 - then yeah we help them get on boarded to
13:27 - what we're doing and I would say it's
13:29 - been a learning process as still as a
13:31 - learning process like the next time we
13:32 - hire somebody we have to sit down and
13:34 - think about it really hard about like
13:35 - okay what is this person gonna be doing
13:36 - and how are we gonna get and make them
13:38 - successful but yeah overall you know
13:41 - lots of communication early on and then
13:44 - and so people are on boarded and then
13:46 - yeah we have to weekly meetings we have
13:48 - a meeting on Monday and Friday where
13:50 - everybody attends and Monday is like
13:53 - how's your weekend what are you working
13:55 - on this week and then Friday's like what
13:56 - did you work on this week
13:57 - what are you doing this weekend um so
13:59 - it's pretty casual you know we don't
14:00 - like a lot of meetings but I think face
14:02 - time is important just keeping in touch
14:03 - with people while your remote is really
14:06 - important and so yeah and as a remote
14:10 - team like we don't see each other that
14:12 - often so what we're planning on doing is
14:14 - team off-site or retreat or however you
14:17 - like to call it where we bring everyone
14:20 - together in some city around the world
14:22 - just for around a week so we've done two
14:25 - at least so we did our first one Lisbon
14:26 - and our second one in split in Croatia
14:29 - and then our third one is in Denver in
14:33 - September so just I think it's a great
14:36 - way for your team to get some like real
14:39 - personal like hangout time cuz you just
14:42 - it's not the same when you work with
14:44 - someone and you only see them via video
14:46 - chat it's a totally different vibe and
14:48 - we think it's really important for our
14:50 - team to just connect like on a personal
14:52 - level yeah they have been really fun
14:56 - yeah yeah yeah do you think it would
15:03 - have been easier if it wasn't a Remo
15:05 - team like there's definitely something
15:09 - nice to like be in the same offices your
15:11 - co-workers work with your co-workers see
15:12 - them every day but I just think it's
15:14 - like I don't know it feels like remote
15:15 - it's kind of the future it feels like
15:16 - that's where things are headed and
15:18 - especially for us when we were general
15:20 - digital nomads it seemed like that was
15:21 - the only company that we could build
15:23 - like we're not gonna build like a
15:24 - digital nomad troupe of people like
15:26 - traveling together and so yeah I just
15:30 - felt like the company that we had the
15:31 - build the company that we wanted to
15:32 - build and so that's what we did
15:33 - yeah anything a lot of people today are
15:36 - looking for a remote work and we just
15:38 - have like way more access I think to
15:40 - talent across the world which is letting
15:43 - a big deal for us when you know my
15:45 - competition for talent is so high but
15:49 - yeah I think just the flexibility of it
15:51 - personally like I enjoy work from home
15:53 - when I feel like it I enjoy going to a
15:55 - cafe when I feel like it I don't I
15:57 - enjoy not having to go into an office so
16:01 - yeah I think it's like I think it's
16:04 - great yeah it sounds like you you really
16:07 - enjoy this yeah yeah I think everyone on
16:10 - the team does to like people have
16:12 - families and they like to spend time
16:14 - with their families people like we
16:17 - wouldn't be able to work together
16:18 - because we're in totally different
16:20 - places so this team is because we're
16:23 - alone I think now before we go to the
16:27 - next section about their productivity
16:28 - and their tech stack I want to quickly
16:31 - mention this video sponsor skew share
16:32 - skew share is an online learning
16:35 - community for creators with more than
16:37 - 25,000 classes in coding design business
16:40 - and more for example you might want to
16:43 - check out one of their web development
16:44 - courses the JavaScript toolkit write
16:47 - cleaner faster and better code just
16:50 - looking through this course quickly I
16:51 - can see that the production quality is
16:53 - really good and this is definitely
16:55 - something I would personally check out
16:56 - if I was trying to improve my JavaScript
16:59 - skills right now now you can check out
17:01 - Skillshare for free for two months with
17:03 - my referral link in the description
17:04 - below and after that it only cost around
17:07 - $10 a month if you decide to
17:09 - using them alright now back to the video
17:14 - how did you stay productive when you
17:17 - didn't have an office yeah I mean we
17:20 - never had we never had an office so we
17:23 - always had to figure out what
17:24 - productivity means to us and I think
17:26 - that's really different for everyone
17:29 - like even between me and Angie like we
17:31 - have different work styles like for me I
17:33 - really like to go to cafes I just feel
17:35 - really really productive when I go to a
17:37 - cafe I don't know you might feel a
17:38 - little different
17:39 - I feel similarly yet yeah or like some
17:42 - days you're gonna work at home it just
17:44 - depends on your day to day and that in
17:46 - like again remote work just allows us to
17:49 - decide when we wake up in the morning
17:51 - what we feel like so yeah it's just like
17:55 - what do you feel like today what do you
17:57 - need to be productive do you need like
17:59 - coffee do you need to like a list and
18:01 - just make sure you have those and I
18:03 - think you're in productive you're in a
18:05 - productive zone yeah one thing that that
18:08 - we learned from Facebook was like you
18:11 - don't measure someone's productivity
18:12 - based on hours worked it's not like you
18:14 - know they need to show up at a certain
18:15 - time and leave it a certain time and so
18:17 - for us we don't really measure our own
18:19 - productivity based on how many hours
18:20 - we're working or based on you know like
18:21 - nine-to-five kind of thing like what's
18:23 - important to us is our output and that
18:25 - our company is growing and doing well
18:27 - and I think especially as founders we
18:28 - feel like pressure like you were asking
18:30 - like how do you stay productive right
18:31 - like we feel pressure like you know at
18:34 - first it was like if we don't you know
18:36 - work then our company fails and now it's
18:38 - like if we don't work not only does our
18:40 - company fail but then our team
18:41 - disappointed us and so there's just like
18:42 - so much pressure just like keep going
18:44 - moving forward that I couldn't imagine
18:46 - like you know not being productive but
18:48 - also yeah I think I think it's important
18:51 - to separate like home mode versus work
18:53 - mode especially you work from home you
18:55 - know like you you can't just like roll
18:56 - out of bed in your pajamas at work
18:57 - because then you're feeling like super
18:59 - lazy you know you have to like shower
19:00 - and get dressed and like be in work mode
19:02 - when you go to work if you're gonna even
19:04 - if you work from home so yeah I really
19:06 - think just having that mindset of like
19:08 - going to work even if you're working
19:09 - from home is important alright and are
19:12 - there any like particular tools that you
19:14 - recommend for staying productive
19:16 - interesting what I mean I literally my
19:18 - task list is like
19:20 - code editor you know it's an atom and I
19:22 - just have like a bunch of boxes and I
19:23 - change them to check marks and I'm done
19:25 - but um I mean there's one tool that I
19:27 - use called cube serve and it it kind of
19:29 - just tracks what you do in your computer
19:30 - and so can help you know like this is
19:33 - how much time you're spending on
19:34 - productive things like you know your
19:35 - code editor and this is how much time
19:36 - you're spending on unproductive things
19:37 - like Netflix and hacker news and
19:39 - whatever and so for me I feel motivated
19:41 - because there's a little percentage
19:43 - counter like in the dock of my Mac that
19:45 - says like you're like 81 percent
19:47 - productive today you've worked like four
19:49 - hours and 30 minutes of productive time
19:51 - and I want to like drive that up like
19:52 - every day I want to be like as
19:53 - productive as possible yeah I like that
19:55 - one it's kind of like a little bit of a
19:56 - mental hack and yeah I don't know the
20:00 - other side of things like I also feel
20:02 - like it's important to not get kind of
20:05 - too sucked into your screen and stare at
20:07 - all the time so I have this app called
20:08 - healthier that I've set to make me leave
20:13 - the computer every hour for one to two
20:15 - minutes it just helps me kind of make
20:19 - sure I'm just not kind of deteriorating
20:23 - in my seat so yeah that's I don't know
20:25 - if it helps with productivity but I
20:27 - think it's it's good for just health in
20:29 - general okay going to a different topic
20:37 - what's the tech slack that you use for
20:39 - it Kenny
20:40 - yeah it's all JavaScript and so we've
20:42 - got a you know react on the front-end of
20:44 - course cuz I used to work on that and
20:46 - then note on the backend for our
20:48 - database we use MongoDB and it's all
20:50 - hosted on AWS how it is you decide to
20:53 - use those um I mean really it's kind of
20:55 - like how many start up I think should be
20:57 - formed is my opinions like um it's what
21:00 - you know what and what I knew you know I
21:02 - was we're gonna react to my new
21:03 - JavaScript really well and it kind of
21:04 - makes sense for use JavaScript on the
21:06 - front end you know JavaScript very well
21:07 - like why not use it on the back end for
21:09 - a database like MongoDB is pretty
21:12 - controversial these days but it's like
21:14 - what I knew and what was really easy to
21:15 - get started and sort great for us so far
21:17 - it'll be the same thing it's like it's
21:19 - what I knew all this stuff is just like
21:20 - what I knew and so that's what we
21:22 - started with right it's worked out I
21:24 - think it's a pretty common
21:26 - dr. Hoffler yeah it's not too crazy yeah
21:28 - yeah did you have any like difficulties
21:34 - any any point like building you know
21:37 - this product on your own like I was
21:39 - opposed to working on Facebook yeah I
21:42 - mean I had never built a product like I
21:46 - had built side projects but nothing like
21:48 - to this scale and so it's definitely
21:50 - been a learning process you know and now
21:52 - that we have like customers there's like
21:53 - security and stuff involved and you know
21:55 - we've been learning a lot about you know
21:57 - scaling our app up but I remember like
21:59 - there are some significant difficulties
22:01 - when we went from like client-side
22:02 - rendering to server-side rendering or
22:04 - like when we went from one server to
22:07 - having multiple servers and just like
22:09 - these kind of like 0 to 1 steps we're
22:11 - difficult but you know we're so much
22:13 - more well put together now that we've
22:17 - got all that stuff but there's a lot
22:19 - ahead of us right so that was that was
22:22 - like a lot of learning involved to you
22:23 - yeah yeah especially like we did service
22:27 - I've been doing before next jest existed
22:29 - and so we kind of had to just like plug
22:31 - a bunch of stuff together cuz that's how
22:32 - people used to do it and now that we've
22:34 - got a bunch of stuff plugged together it
22:35 - doesn't really make sense to like tear
22:36 - all apart to move to next chance and so
22:38 - that's an interesting place where that
22:40 - we're in right yeah and are there any
22:44 - like particular resources for learning
22:46 - JavaScript react no and like those tools
22:50 - yeah that's kind of a tough one because
22:53 - I learned it kind of a long time ago but
22:55 - uh yeah I mean so like I learned react
22:58 - from joining the react team and learning
23:00 - it from literally the people that like
23:01 - invented it and popularized it and so
23:03 - you know that's one way go join the
23:05 - reaction of Facebook but yeah I think
23:09 - like one cool website that I'm really
23:11 - excited about these days is repli'd
23:13 - where you can just spin up like a coding
23:15 - environment for any programming language
23:16 - JavaScript node no PHP anything and just
23:19 - start coding and then you get like the
23:21 - output right there and they support
23:24 - react and you can build like websites
23:25 - there and so I think that's really cool
23:26 - and you're just like hacking around you
23:27 - don't have to worry about like setting
23:28 - up here
23:29 - environment I don't know if you can
23:31 - really like learn JavaScript but you can
23:33 - definitely play around there but
23:35 - otherwise it's just like try to build
23:36 - something see what walls you run into
23:38 - and yeah Google it you know try to solve
23:40 - your own problems because I think a lot
23:42 - of how I learned I totally agree like
23:45 - that's the best way is just like dive in
23:47 - and you know pick a project and try to
23:49 - do it and when you get stuck just like
23:51 - Stack Overflow like that's the best
23:54 - resource for me honestly when I was
23:55 - learning in front and stuff it was it
23:57 - was great and yeah whenever somebody
24:00 - asked like about for a book or something
24:01 - I have no idea
24:02 - sorry that's okay Oh how does your learn
24:06 - front end stuff yeah I mean literally
24:08 - like I was like I'm gonna build my
24:09 - portfolio website the first one was like
24:12 - just vanilla HTML CSS but the second one
24:15 - I for some reason did decide to use
24:17 - WordPress which a lot of people were
24:19 - using at that point but I just thought I
24:21 - would extra challenge myself and so I
24:24 - don't know yeah I was literally just
24:25 - when I got stuck I literally googled a
24:28 - problem that I had and it was usually
24:30 - like the first like overflow link and I
24:31 - just click it and I implement it and it
24:33 - works and then from then on I remember
24:36 - how to do it right so where I can school
24:38 - it again yeah yeah it's it's really as
24:41 - simple as that I think I guess that
24:43 - works yeah I mean I'm special for
24:45 - front-end where's like you don't yeah
24:48 - you don't need to have all that like
24:49 - mathematical background and all this
24:50 - logic stuff like yeah I think it's
24:52 - pretty straightforward all right so it's
24:58 - just one last question
24:59 - yeah is there anything you want to add
25:01 - to this conversation ooh I would say
25:05 - build side projects I would say like
25:07 - even if you know you're you're at a
25:09 - full-time job now start hacking on
25:12 - things like like especially if you can
25:14 - find someone that you work really well
25:16 - with I think that's like one of the big
25:18 - things for us was having someone else to
25:21 - bounce ideas off of or like just go
25:23 - check on certain things just go and
25:26 - build stuff honestly like there's you
25:28 - have free time like do it
25:32 - you get a good taste of what it's like
25:33 - to yeah just get started in the startup
25:37 - world yeah I think a big one for us was
25:41 - we made our first dollar before we
25:43 - launched and so then by the time we
25:45 - launched we knew that we could make
25:46 - money and so I would encourage people
25:49 - who want to start a software business to
25:51 - try to make their first dollar as fast
25:52 - as possible and then like they can do
25:56 - that by solving a problem you can only
25:58 - make money when you're solving a problem
25:59 - for somebody and so yeah solve a problem
26:01 - for somebody charge them for it and then
26:02 - launch and it'll be a pretty good start
26:05 - not saying that's the formula for like a
26:07 - billion dollar company but you kind of
26:08 - get like a small software business off
26:09 - the ground I think that's absolutely do
26:11 - it yeah oh great thank you so much thank
26:18 - you
