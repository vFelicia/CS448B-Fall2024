00:00 - okay I think we are live now hey
00:05 - everyone welcome to CS dojo and we have
00:08 - a guest today with us his name is Gaurav
00:11 - Shen and he's also known as JK CS hey
00:15 - everyone say say hi everyone
00:22 - okay so today you know we're gonna do a
00:27 - 20 about 23 minutes of interview and
00:30 - then seven minutes of audience Q&A with
00:33 - you guys and you know a little bit about
00:36 - Gaurav he has a YouTube channel about
00:38 - computer programming I'm gonna put a
00:41 - link you know to his YouTube channel in
00:43 - the description below and just in case
00:46 - you're curious
00:46 - he is from Mumbai so today you know
00:49 - we're gonna talk about what is
00:51 - competitive programming why should
00:53 - people care about it and then how did
00:54 - you prepare for it
00:56 - so let me add this get started could you
00:59 - first introduce yourself to everyone
01:05 - since the past four years I've been
01:07 - making vlogs and small videos on compare
01:12 - programming and it's been some time now
01:14 - but I think problem-solving is one of
01:16 - the key things if you are looking for
01:20 - not just interviews but in general
01:23 - getting better at computer science so
01:24 - I'm really passionate about
01:25 - problem-solving and algorithms and data
01:28 - structures is what you need for that so
01:29 - that's what I like to pursue I mean
01:32 - understanding okay and just curious how
01:35 - did you get started with like problem
01:37 - solving in general so problem solving it
01:40 - was there since I think the first year
01:42 - of my college education and although the
01:47 - problems then the much much simpler but
01:49 - I had friends who used to pick up stuff
01:51 - like Traveling Salesman or something
01:52 - like that and you try to solve that
01:54 - although it had been sought by many
01:55 - other people already but the excitement
01:57 - is when you are trying to tell a
01:59 - computer what you what you wanted to do
02:01 - and also after thinking a lot so that's
02:06 - that's how problem-solving came in for
02:08 - me I think in in first year or second
02:10 - year okay so you
02:11 - get started by solving problems that had
02:14 - already been solved and then you should
02:16 - be on to like newer problems I guess
02:19 - yeah so the popular versions of problems
02:22 - were how I started off with and later on
02:26 - we went into a little more specialized
02:28 - things like computer programming and
02:29 - stuff okay and could you explain what is
02:33 - programming I mean what is competitive
02:35 - programming there's a computer
02:37 - programming it's a little like let's say
02:39 - chess well it's a mind sport where you
02:41 - have problem solving which is put at the
02:44 - core of the computer programming thing
02:46 - is problem solving and for that you need
02:48 - algorithms and data structure knowledge
02:51 - it's it's done in usually internet sites
02:55 - because you need a lot of people who
02:57 - want to you know participate in that
03:00 - contest so company programming is a mind
03:03 - sport which requires you to know about
03:05 - algorithms and data structures it's
03:07 - focused on problem solving and people
03:10 - seem to love it
03:10 - bye and could you give like a maybe a
03:14 - really simplified example of what a
03:17 - problem might look like for example I
03:20 - could have something like mr. mr. X
03:25 - wants to go from A to B and there are
03:28 - some seven cities between a and B so he
03:32 - may or may not choose to visit all the
03:33 - cities but finally the shortest path
03:35 - between them now the algorithm that you
03:39 - might think about here is breadth-first
03:40 - search or Dijkstra's or maybe you might
03:43 - go for a brute-force at the end of it
03:47 - when you find the shortest path and you
03:49 - print that out that would be a solution
03:51 - the compared programming is about
03:53 - getting a solution and getting it in a
03:55 - short amount of time time so I guess you
04:01 - submit a solution in code and then
04:05 - whoever has the most efficient code wins
04:08 - is that the idea I'm sorry
04:16 - I missed the last bit sorry okay
04:18 - just asking whoever has the most
04:21 - efficient code wins right correct
04:25 - actually it's it's more about if you
04:27 - have the right solution and if it's fast
04:29 - enough so there will be some threshold
04:31 - set for time limits and correct nice and
04:34 - if both of them are there then you would
04:36 - score equal points but yes you're right
04:38 - there are some questions which have
04:39 - partial mocking so that's more
04:40 - interesting because if you have the
04:42 - fastest solution that is the best
04:43 - solution let's consider okay so I guess
04:50 - some problems are like as long as you
04:51 - solve the problem with a certain amount
04:54 - of efficiency you don't have to be the
04:56 - fastest one correct so when you look it
05:01 - has some sort of auto complexity so if a
05:04 - person has an algorithm which has let's
05:06 - say order n complexity or order n log n
05:08 - as long as it's not hitting something
05:11 - like n square the the comparator
05:14 - programing sight will allow your
05:16 - question to pass through it one time out
05:18 - okay otherwise it's gonna take too long
05:22 - yeah so what GK is CS was talking about
05:25 - just now is called something called Big
05:28 - O notation and it's just a way of
05:30 - expressing how you know how complex your
05:32 - algorithm is so what kind of experience
05:37 - do you have with competitive programming
05:40 - programming it actually started after I
05:44 - got placed in this company called Morgan
05:45 - Stanley and at that time I was
05:48 - completely free so I had nothing to do
05:51 - except solve problems or just enjoy
05:53 - myself so that's when I started off with
05:56 - computer programming it it took me a
06:00 - while to actually understand what the
06:02 - problems mean or how do I break it down
06:04 - to some math take a problem statement
06:07 - and then break it down to a mathematical
06:08 - statement and then just solve it through
06:10 - code right but yeah that's how I started
06:12 - okay so I guess you were you already
06:16 - working right when you get when I got
06:17 - started with competitive programming I
06:19 - had about three months before I joined
06:22 - my first company I was I was in college
06:24 - then but yeah you can say I was almost
06:27 - working because I wasn't studying at
06:29 - least okay would you
06:31 - say most people who work on competitive
06:33 - programming or students or not students
06:37 - most who work on computer programming in
06:40 - India are students who are looking for
06:42 - placements which the trend is right now
06:46 - very strong for students who are looking
06:48 - for placements to get into computer
06:49 - programming the reason for that is I
06:52 - think it makes your interviews a little
06:53 - easier
06:54 - the Iook interviews but yeah I think
06:57 - companies will be shifting from asking
06:59 - to me algorithm in to be as soon enough
07:01 - they focus more on projects and your
07:03 - internships so yeah computer programming
07:06 - is actually a sport but people use it
07:07 - for some good purposes yeah right yes I
07:12 - guess that that ways to my next question
07:14 - which is why should people care about
07:16 - competitive programming well in the
07:20 - current climate it's such that computer
07:24 - programming is helping people get get
07:27 - better at in problem-solving and from
07:29 - solving is a key part of interviews
07:31 - problem solving can also be a key part
07:34 - of your job assuming that you have
07:36 - something which is a little research
07:37 - oriented so if you know a lot about
07:40 - algorithms and data structures you can
07:42 - just look at a problem and you can say
07:44 - that fine I'm not so concerned about the
07:48 - computer science or the problem-solving
07:50 - about it I'm more concerned about how do
07:53 - I fix these modules and get the solution
07:56 - directly mm-hmm so I've seen really
07:58 - smart people they they are really great
08:00 - at compare program what they can do is
08:02 - they can take a complex problem break
08:03 - into small parts and then just solve the
08:07 - problem immediately right so I
08:10 - understand that you're currently working
08:12 - as a software developer in Mumbai yeah I
08:16 - like the knowledge and the skills you
08:19 - gain through competitive programming
08:20 - there's the help in any way with your
08:23 - job so it's it's a double-edged sword
08:26 - the first thing is yes it does it does
08:31 - help me solve problems and it's also
08:32 - something that gives you a lot of
08:34 - confidence when you are speaking with
08:35 - your team about a problem and you can
08:38 - just think about video annotations and
08:40 - immediately you know make sure that
08:42 - you're not making a big mistake if
08:44 - you're too deep into
08:45 - programming what have noticed is that
08:48 - students think too much I got McCleary
08:50 - rather than in the real world
08:52 - so now real what if you need to read a
08:53 - file you don't need all those algorithms
08:56 - you just need just a file reader yeah
08:59 - and for that you need reliability you
09:01 - need you need multi-threading concepts
09:05 - which are more focus on computer science
09:07 - than in this very specific thing of
09:08 - algorithms right so computer programming
09:11 - is mostly about algorithms and data
09:14 - structures right okay and if people want
09:20 - to get into competitive programming how
09:22 - should they get started with it so there
09:25 - are sites like code chef top coder
09:27 - hacker wrote there are quite a few sites
09:29 - I can just mention them here and what
09:33 - they do is they ask you questions yeah
09:42 - could you maybe do a screen share and
09:46 - you know show everyone what those sites
09:48 - look like yeah so I think you mentioned
09:56 - it helped chef top coder how could the
10:02 - quite a few sites the new sites more and
10:05 - more interesting they keep getting
10:06 - better okay I'll just do the screen
10:08 - share now all right yeah
10:26 - yeah sure so this is what I was talking
10:31 - about top coder TopCoder is one of the
10:34 - sites you can also have look at food
10:36 - chef this is really popular in India and
10:39 - it's also doing free well
10:41 - internationally and this recommend that
10:46 - those websites instead of like other
10:49 - kinds of competitions I would say code
10:52 - forces is probably the best if you are
10:55 - looking for a website to start off with
10:57 - because it's highly reliable and it also
10:59 - has a lot of people the community is not
11:02 - so friendly so to speak so if you're
11:04 - looking for just starting off then you
11:07 - can do it yourself I mean at home you
11:09 - can you can read up a little algorithms
11:11 - in stock which has a very friendly
11:13 - community top coders community yeah
11:18 - that's also fine but code forces here
11:20 - might be the best site at this point I'm
11:23 - okay what's the difference between those
11:27 - websites so cold forces has has a
11:33 - community which is really old it's also
11:36 - very very strong the kind of editorials
11:39 - you see here are pretty useful some of
11:42 - the concepts are really advanced so what
11:45 - happens is because people have been
11:46 - programming here for a long time they
11:48 - they don't want simple stuff to be
11:49 - posted in their editorials that's the
11:51 - reason why I would say for a beginner
11:52 - this site is not very you know friendly
11:57 - code chef on the other hand is very
12:00 - focused on getting students to do well
12:02 - in programming so going to meet new
12:05 - people in their 10th grade or ninth
12:07 - grade and explaining to them what
12:10 - programming is and how it can be so much
12:11 - fun while top coder seems to be a site
12:15 - which almost every interviewer refers to
12:18 - at some point of time this will promise
12:21 - you are good but you may not find a very
12:22 - strong community here so it's up to us
12:26 - to choose which one I personally started
12:28 - off with Coach F okay and I
12:34 - something like ACM programming
12:38 - competitions do you know about them ECM
12:43 - is yeah yeah I dunno ECM ICPC is
12:46 - probably what people are talking about
12:47 - it's a contest which is held in colleges
12:52 - almost all the colleges in India get
12:54 - together and they have the best
12:55 - representatives go out there and fight
12:58 - for them so easy my CPC is is fun if
13:02 - you're if you if you can make a team
13:03 - then please do so and there's the World
13:07 - Finals and if you win that then you have
13:09 - lots of prizes right I guess those
13:14 - websites the advantage of that is you
13:16 - don't need a team to work on them
13:18 - absolutely you can start off right now
13:21 - and you can also practice and this this
13:23 - is also advantages why you would want to
13:25 - go that that's like the gym and this is
13:27 - he my CPC is literally the Olympics of
13:29 - computer programming my and how should
13:35 - people prepare for like solving those
13:37 - problems on those websites and SEM n I
13:40 - CPC so if you have a data structure and
13:46 - algorithm teacher in your college I
13:47 - would say that you know you can start
13:49 - off there just by asking them some some
13:52 - advice but if you are completely alone
13:53 - like most of us are usually you can you
13:58 - can just read blog posts on code forces
14:01 - good chef all these sites have something
14:04 - like tutorials on how to start up with
14:06 - computer programming okay and if you in
14:09 - fact you don't even need that you can
14:11 - just read up a little on algorithms and
14:12 - try to solve some problems interview
14:14 - questions are fine then once you're once
14:17 - you're slightly good you can get in
14:19 - computer running full force right so I
14:23 - think you mentioned like interview
14:25 - questions several times right so I guess
14:31 - you know in case people don't know about
14:32 - them a lot of like software companies
14:35 - ask these algorithms and data structures
14:38 - related questions I think these
14:42 - interview questions are
14:43 - sort of similar in nature as then
14:45 - completed programming questions
14:48 - absolutely and that's that's one of the
14:51 - interesting things these days computer
14:53 - programming is so computer programming
14:57 - is a bit more advanced in some ways but
14:59 - it can be much simpler in some ways so
15:01 - interview questions are somewhere on
15:02 - medium difficulty when it comes to
15:04 - programming contests and so interview
15:08 - questions also have this sort of you
15:10 - need some insights to actually solve the
15:12 - problem well compared to programming you
15:15 - need insight sometimes you need just a
15:17 - brute understanding of algorithms
15:18 - sometimes and they are highly related
15:21 - though I can see questions from
15:23 - interviews going into computer
15:25 - programming and the same thing okay nice
15:28 - and are there any like common mistakes
15:32 - people make when they get started with
15:33 - computer programming I think they take
15:36 - it too seriously they think it's really
15:39 - really big and they won't be able to
15:41 - solve it it happened to me too it
15:43 - happens to everyone just don't stop just
15:46 - keep going it's similar to how
15:48 - programming is done you know it's scary
15:50 - in the start and then once you have
15:52 - stuff working for you it seems very easy
15:54 - and there all these plateaus or all
15:56 - these barriers but you can break them by
15:59 - so when you say like people get serious
16:01 - about it I guess they got to stress
16:03 - about it yes they start thinking about
16:06 - oh my god my rank last time was thirty
16:09 - and this time it's 45 and I'm not
16:12 - improving and what I do don't think
16:15 - about it that way think about it that
16:17 - were you able to solve a new problem
16:18 - this time or were you able to learn
16:19 - something new this time right so what's
16:21 - going to end up happening is you're
16:22 - always learning something and that's I
16:24 - think that's one of the most beautiful
16:26 - things about computer programming is
16:27 - there's a contest so you're you have
16:30 - this inherent incentive to learn more
16:32 - and that's how people end up getting
16:34 - good at others yeah sounds good so I
16:39 - mean I love what you say about like not
16:42 - being stress and focusing on like
16:44 - learning because I feel like it's it's a
16:47 - pretty you know easy thing to do and and
16:50 - like an easy mistake to make like in
16:53 - other areas of life too
16:56 - absolutely so when I I joined my college
17:00 - I didn't know a thing about computer
17:02 - science I didn't know how a computer
17:04 - even works well even now I don't I mean
17:08 - all the way but what I'm talking about
17:11 - is I have never written a single line of
17:13 - code and it was scary in the start but
17:16 - if you have good teachers and if you
17:17 - have an attitude that I want to learn it
17:21 - really helps plus if you have a calm
17:24 - mind yeah like you said like this right
17:30 - so someone's asking about Python for
17:34 - competitive programming and yeah I was
17:38 - actually like I wanted to ask you like
17:40 - more in general like what programming
17:42 - languages should people use for computer
17:44 - programming well I would love to say
17:48 - that any programming language is fine
17:49 - but most of the sites are pretty old so
17:52 - what they they tend to focus on is speed
17:55 - so I wanted either a C++ program or has
18:00 - an advantage compared to a Python
18:02 - programmer in a programming side but
18:04 - interestingly that that gap is shrinking
18:07 - so you can start off with Python
18:09 - definitely and you can then move on to
18:11 - some other language which you feel is
18:13 - fast enough while being simple enough
18:15 - right
18:16 - so I guess if you if you write Korean
18:22 - citizen and you might have some
18:24 - advantage that way yes so what what the
18:28 - program platforms are trying to do are
18:30 - give different time limits for different
18:32 - source languages so if you have if
18:35 - you're writing code in C++ they'll give
18:37 - you just one second but if you're
18:38 - writing coding python they'll give you
18:40 - three seconds so that's the way they're
18:42 - trying to level the playing field but
18:43 - even now there is some advantage that
18:45 - C++ has because so tremendously fast
18:47 - right Python is a really good language
18:49 - to start off with in fact I'm finding it
18:51 - really interesting okay how about Java
18:55 - Java is what I use and it's it's quite
18:58 - fast so you get about 2 seconds if C++
19:01 - gets one set in the end I mean I use
19:05 - Java in my job and I draw and compare
19:06 - programming so it's something that I
19:08 - really like
19:09 - right so if someone's like you know
19:12 - maybe that person knows like a few
19:15 - languages and they're like okay I want
19:17 - to get into competitive programming what
19:19 - would you like which language would you
19:20 - recommend that you know they get started
19:22 - with if they know a few languages C++
19:26 - okay but I just want them beforehand
19:30 - that your C++ is going to be complicated
19:34 - so company might them all so yeah so I
19:41 - think someone was asking earlier how
19:44 - long it takes to prepare for these very
19:47 - programming sites you can start
19:50 - immediately most so the first question
19:52 - the easiest question on code chef is
19:54 - printing the number 42 instead of
19:57 - printing hello world this is the first
19:58 - program right right so it's it's
20:01 - actually easy so the answer to
20:03 - everything is 42 and that's what the
20:05 - questions based on the joke from
20:09 - somewhere right yeah that's I think that
20:13 - spaceship thing so yeah it's it's easy
20:16 - and then you can go on levelling up the
20:20 - moment you hit someplace where you feel
20:21 - like no I don't understand this at all
20:23 - you can always read some tutorials or
20:25 - editorials and get back from solving so
20:28 - it's a continuous process where you are
20:30 - climbing up a ladder okay so um I think
20:36 - we talked about it all that way earlier
20:38 - but would you say people get started
20:40 - with culture or a different side like
20:45 - people should get story with culture if
20:48 - you're yes if you're just talking off I
20:49 - would suggest good chef for chef is a
20:51 - very friendly community and it has some
20:53 - really good problems right it also gives
20:55 - you the luxury of taking your time to
20:57 - solve the problem because it has these
20:59 - long contests ten days long well code
21:02 - forces seems to be a little advanced
21:05 - because you have to solve from so fast
21:07 - and yeah they're short that's what
21:11 - contests okay so when you say fast they
21:14 - mean like one day three hours three
21:20 - hours that's pretty
21:21 - chance yeah so that must make a net
21:25 - stress for them absolutely it becomes a
21:29 - real problem when people are just
21:31 - reading the question quickly and trying
21:33 - to think of the algorithm by letting the
21:34 - questions so it's fine to see that but
21:39 - yeah if you want a little more relaxed
21:41 - environment and if you're looking for a
21:42 - really nice learning environment I would
21:44 - suggest go check yeah so when you were
21:48 - like working on more the competitive
21:51 - programming problems what did you enjoy
21:54 - about them I think my favorite point was
21:59 - when I actually solved it by and thought
22:02 - that you know green take that yes your
22:05 - answers correct hmm but the second most
22:08 - favorite thing would be to learn
22:09 - something new things that I didn't know
22:11 - about averages go read and then convert
22:13 - that to code and actually have a machine
22:16 - verifying my answers that was a
22:17 - beautiful thing and I thought that I was
22:19 - getting smarter every day that's that's
22:23 - actually my favorite thing okay and one
22:26 - would be sort of an example of you know
22:30 - why you learn that way so I didn't know
22:35 - about dynamic programming and I was
22:37 - always afraid about you know coding in
22:40 - dynamic programming for some reason I
22:41 - found it to be really complicated and
22:43 - impossible to do and there was this one
22:46 - question on code chef I remember I took
22:48 - about food is they solve it where I
22:51 - somehow recursively solve the question
22:53 - instead of using dynamic programming
22:54 - like I somehow got away from it but it
22:57 - was a really nice alternative solution
23:00 - to the problem and later on of course
23:02 - when I learn programming I thought that
23:04 - what the hell am i doing but this was
23:07 - this was something that really taught me
23:09 - that you can solve problems if you are
23:11 - really focused and if you if you want to
23:14 - nice okay so I think we're gonna start
23:21 - oh yes Q&A soon bye if you haven't yet
23:26 - guys you know make sure to follow
23:28 - Facebook on sisters or for for more live
23:31 - streams because that's you know really
23:34 - where I announced them
23:36 - and you can find you can CSS YouTube
23:38 - channel in the description below so you
23:42 - know make sure to check that out send in
23:45 - your questions guys so I don't see any
23:53 - good questions right now so could you
23:58 - tell us about like what you do with your
24:01 - YouTube channel so my youtube channel is
24:04 - focused on algorithms and data
24:06 - structures that helps you solve problems
24:09 - and I try to get out one video every
24:13 - week on some new concept but when
24:17 - there's a contest I I get a little more
24:20 - active so I try to post many solutions
24:22 - to the problems that that contest has
24:24 - just had okay
24:26 - and yeah do you see any good questions I
24:30 - think Howard Sharma has asked a good
24:33 - question he says that can CP be done in
24:36 - part time and the answer is yes you can
24:41 - I mean I still do it while working so it
24:45 - takes about I mean it's up to you it's
24:48 - entirely up to you
24:51 - okay I gotta give a shout out to this
24:54 - person because this person sent
24:56 - something in Japanese he's just you know
24:58 - he's saying conscious which means like
25:00 - what's out yeah thanks for that
25:06 - okay so YK what do you think is the best
25:11 - website for learning a programming
25:13 - language so I always give the same you
25:18 - know same advice I would get started
25:20 - with something like code Carmi or free
25:23 - code camp okay let me type it in so
25:27 - people can see - free code camp and code
25:32 - Academy and that's for basics so after
25:38 - that I would say like something like a
25:39 - window comm or clear sight or udemy like
25:43 - one of those video sites you have any
25:46 - thoughts on
25:48 - yeah I think those are really nice this
25:52 - this capacity also is stylish yeah but
25:58 - I'm not sure breathe
25:59 - yeah thank you that's it pretty good
26:01 - tear and otherwise this again pinky
26:08 - speaks but it doesn't really eat you
26:09 - about programming as such by teach you
26:12 - about about problem solving
26:15 - so yeah that's that's not programming
26:19 - yeah gigs for gigs is good too like when
26:22 - you go for something like a lot of times
26:24 - kick for gigs shows up someone's asking
26:29 - for a new programmer Ruby on Rails is
26:31 - good I would say Ruby is good but Ruby
26:35 - on Rails is like it's it's not the most
26:37 - friendly thing to learn I had this
26:42 - experience where I started running Ruby
26:44 - on Rails and it does a lot of things
26:47 - automatically absolutely oh yeah so I'm
26:52 - yeah please go ahead um so the times the
26:57 - name usually we have writing build
26:59 - processes we are thinking about
27:00 - compiling the code and then deploying it
27:02 - so that's when we use Ruby on Rails but
27:04 - yeah you're right what programming no
27:09 - yeah I think so prodigy prodigy
27:16 - ACM training style I guess what he or
27:20 - she means it's like how should you
27:22 - prepare for it well yes if you are
27:26 - preparing for ECM it's probably in your
27:28 - second or your third you so what you can
27:31 - do before that is make sure that the
27:33 - coursework in algorithms and data
27:35 - structures is completed in a really good
27:37 - way so if you do that in a strong way
27:39 - that will give you a strong basis to
27:41 - learn more specialized algorithms so
27:44 - that'll be fun and then you can you know
27:46 - perform much much better also one final
27:50 - thing about a semi CPC is that it's a
27:52 - contest for colleges so some colleges
27:56 - are really good in terms of the math
27:58 - culture that they have and some
28:00 - don't really have any culture of ECM so
28:03 - if you want some advice you can ask
28:06 - seniors in the other colleges also
28:07 - they'll help you okay how would you find
28:11 - like the seniors in other colleges
28:13 - there's the science here which is called
28:16 - chef code forces they are always roaming
28:18 - around and you know commenting on
28:20 - editorials if their code if they're if
28:22 - they need improvements and then you can
28:24 - you can just message them directly and
28:25 - those guys tend to be the seniors either
28:28 - from India sometimes they're also from
28:30 - outside India and are really nice so
28:38 - someone's asking me about creating an
28:41 - Android app but this person doesn't know
28:44 - how to code I mean I would get started
28:46 - with Java because you know you can build
28:50 - Android apps with Java so that's you
28:52 - know that's pretty much it like go to
28:53 - code Academy lynda.com and learn Java
29:00 - Java yes my favorite language right
29:04 - worried why is Java your favorite
29:06 - language I started off with it and some
29:09 - of the things like garbage collection
29:10 - and multi-threading where where concepts
29:14 - that I really really liked and then it
29:16 - kind of stuck I'm not sure of the better
29:18 - languages per se but yeah Java is
29:21 - something that I'm really comfortable
29:23 - with my thing is basic exhibit okay so
29:28 - what do you like about garbage question
29:30 - in Java and what is garbage collection
29:32 - so you know just in case people don't
29:33 - know yeah sure so garbage collection is
29:36 - wendy create an object we want that
29:40 - object to be removed from memory maybe
29:42 - no no we no longer need it and java does
29:45 - that for you automatically by c++ you
29:48 - actually need to go to that memory
29:50 - location and free that up so that's a
29:53 - little complicated so occurring to me
29:55 - the lesser you put in you put in the on
29:57 - the programmer the fast a can code the
29:59 - fast it can go to the fast results you
30:01 - get so mm-hmm
30:03 - that's reason why I like Java and how
30:06 - come you like Java more than Python
30:09 - yeah the honest answer to that will be
30:13 - that I'm accustomed to Java but Python
30:15 - seems like a scripting language so you
30:17 - can't really design very big systems
30:19 - with Python right when you are going for
30:21 - software engineering it becomes a real
30:24 - pain to actually have Python code
30:26 - running that slow and there's also the
30:29 - concept of multi-threading which is
30:30 - which is not so good in Python
30:32 - okay so Java is better handling
30:34 - multi-threading what is reading so
30:37 - multi-threading is for for all the
30:39 - viewers multi-threading is you having 10
30:43 - or 15 computers and you can run one
30:45 - function one process on all of them
30:48 - together so that it's done faster mm-hmm
30:52 - so it's at the idea is you have a you
30:57 - have a problem to solve and you can
30:59 - divide it into multiple computers right
31:01 - good good okay okay I think that's time
31:06 - do you have anything to say to everyone
31:08 - oh yeah best of luck and I find this
31:13 - channel like it very interesting the
31:16 - tutorials you made on Python and yeah
31:21 - people can learn a lot about programming
31:24 - so my main message would be you can
31:28 - learn programming easily so don't take
31:30 - it too seriously and have fun okay
31:34 - awesome
31:35 - so thanks everyone for coming here we
31:39 - have like 326 viewers now so we did it
31:42 - guys next time we can do more if I do
31:47 - more live streams like I'm not sure if
31:48 - I'm gonna do it you know any more live
31:50 - streams but thanks everyone for your you
31:54 - know messages and everything so yeah
31:58 - I'll see you guys soon bye everyone
