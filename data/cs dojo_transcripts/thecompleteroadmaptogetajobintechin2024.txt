00:00 - this is going to be a six-step guide to
00:02 - maximize your chance of getting a job in
00:04 - Tech this year so let's get started step
00:06 - one ask yourself why you want to get
00:08 - into Tech in the first place is it
00:10 - because of the money is it because
00:11 - you're passionate about tech or is it
00:13 - because you want to be able to build a
00:15 - certain type of tech whatever your
00:16 - motivation is I'm not going to judge you
00:18 - for it but the important thing is that
00:20 - you think about it carefully and you ask
00:23 - yourself is getting a job in Tech
00:25 - actually going to get you the thing that
00:27 - you really want and then you need to
00:28 - decide what type of job you want because
00:30 - there are many many different types of
00:32 - jobs available in Tech there's front end
00:35 - backend full stack data engineering
00:37 - devops Cloud product management project
00:40 - management UI ux so many options so find
00:44 - what's available in your local market
00:46 - what you're good at and try to find you
00:48 - know an intersection of those things
00:50 - plus what you're interested in doing
00:52 - step three learn fundamental skills this
00:54 - step might take about 100 days or a
00:56 - little bit more depending on your focus
00:58 - area and 100 days are not going to be
01:02 - enough to learn everything you need to
01:03 - know to get a job in Tech but it is
01:06 - going to be enough to have a really
01:08 - solid foundation so for example if you
01:11 - want to be a software engineer you might
01:13 - want to learn things like for Loops if
01:15 - statements functions and other basic
01:17 - programming Concepts so after learning
01:19 - those things you know within those 100
01:21 - days start solving simple problems and
01:23 - work on exercise problems to solidify
01:26 - your understanding and make sure to
01:28 - build some uh simple project whether
01:30 - it's a calculator app or a calendar app
01:32 - to further practice your skills step
01:35 - four do everything you can to gain
01:38 - experience a lot of people say how do I
01:40 - even get experience before I have the
01:42 - experience my answer is always go get
01:45 - some experience and for that I recommend
01:47 - a couple things one open source
01:50 - contributions two freelancing for local
01:53 - businesses or using platforms like
01:55 - Fiverr or upwork three your own project
01:58 - or building your own business any
02:00 - options work here but be mindful you
02:03 - know if you try using stuff like Fiverr
02:05 - or upwork that can be really hard
02:08 - because you know you'll be competing
02:09 - with a global pool of talent so instead
02:12 - I would generally recommend contributing
02:14 - to open source or doing freelancing work
02:17 - for local businesses and keep in mind
02:20 - that even if you're not getting paid for
02:22 - some of these things in my opinion
02:25 - experience is experience you know if you
02:26 - do open source contributions and if you
02:28 - send in a few significant PRS then
02:32 - you're putting in a lot of work for it
02:34 - you might not be getting paid for it but
02:36 - at least you should be getting paid by
02:39 - experience H you want to be able to put
02:41 - that on your LinkedIn experience section
02:44 - I want to emphasize that part and the
02:46 - way you can do that is by creating a
02:49 - LinkedIn business page and by putting
02:52 - what you've done as part of your
02:54 - experience section by calling yourself
02:56 - software developer at the business page
02:58 - you know create a nice professional logo
03:00 - for it have a nice name for that
03:02 - business page and that way you're going
03:04 - to start to have more experience that
03:06 - you can show again in your LinkedIn
03:08 - experience section and you want to spend
03:11 - about six months at least 6 months I
03:13 - would say on this portion so that you'll
03:15 - have 6 months of solid experience once
03:18 - you have you know 6 months of experience
03:20 - 100 days of solid uh basic learning then
03:25 - you want to start a network so that you
03:27 - can get in front of people the thing
03:28 - with you know C apply it's totally fine
03:31 - if you want to go for it but each
03:34 - application will get hundreds of
03:36 - applicants and it's going to be really
03:38 - hard for you to stand out so what you
03:40 - want to do instead is actually go talk
03:42 - to people at meetups conferences online
03:45 - events offline events wherever you can
03:48 - talk to actual human beings recruiters
03:50 - or other people in Tech so that you can
03:53 - get noticed one thing you want to keep
03:55 - in mind is that you don't want to appear
03:57 - too desperate you know you don't want to
03:58 - go up to someone you just met and say
04:01 - can you give me a job I've seen this
04:03 - happen don't do it instead focus on
04:06 - creating long-term meaningful
04:08 - relationships you know this kind of
04:10 - thing will take at least three months
04:12 - let's say from the point you meet
04:14 - someone to the point where they might be
04:17 - comfortable referring you to a job now
04:19 - in the previous step as you gain more
04:22 - experience it's important to share your
04:24 - progress online so use platforms like
04:26 - LinkedIn Twitter you don't have to share
04:29 - every single thing but share highlights
04:31 - share something you learned share what
04:33 - you're proud of so that more people will
04:36 - know that you exist in the first place
04:38 - and so that more people will know what
04:40 - you're working on then what's really
04:42 - powerful about this concept of building
04:44 - in public is that as you start to
04:47 - network like this penguin is doing uh
04:49 - you start to meet more people and
04:51 - connect with more people on platforms
04:53 - like LinkedIn and as you building public
04:56 - as you share your progress online they
04:58 - will start to notice is they will start
05:00 - to have you on top of their mind as you
05:04 - share what you're passionate about what
05:05 - you're good at where your skill sets are
05:07 - and finally you want to start working on
05:09 - your interview skills I would say though
05:12 - uh in the current market and the market
05:14 - I expect later this year the main
05:17 - challenge will still be to land
05:19 - interviews not get through them but
05:22 - still when you start to land interviews
05:24 - uh you want to make sure that you don't
05:25 - waste those opportunities you might not
05:27 - be able to get through you know 10 out
05:29 - of 10 interviews but at least you want
05:31 - to be able to get through you know maybe
05:33 - five out of 10 uh seven out of 10 I
05:36 - ideally eight or nine out of 10 when you
05:38 - get uh really good at interviews it's
05:41 - possible and for that I recommend a few
05:43 - things first you need to realize that
05:46 - interviews are really just a form of
05:48 - conversations there's nothing really
05:50 - special about it you know you might
05:52 - think okay you're supposed to answer
05:54 - these questions that people ask in this
05:55 - weird formality thing but I wouldn't
05:59 - necessarily see it that way if you
06:01 - become a really good communicator in
06:03 - general a really good conversationalist
06:05 - in general then that will show in
06:08 - interviews because at the end of the day
06:10 - again they are just
06:11 - conversations so what you want to do is
06:13 - basically go talk to as many people as
06:15 - possible in these networking events like
06:18 - I mentioned earlier and then practice
06:20 - your communication skills in general
06:22 - become a really good listener be good at
06:24 - empathy and all of those things and then
06:27 - the second thing I recommend is is
06:29 - working on your problem solving skills
06:32 - again this is a general skill that you
06:34 - can also apply to interviews you know
06:37 - this is not particular to just
06:38 - interviews uh if you've worked on
06:40 - freelancing things or open source
06:42 - contributions then you will have
06:44 - naturally buil up some of these skills
06:47 - but you know if you feel like uh you
06:48 - need to practice a little bit more then
06:50 - do a little bit of lead code if you need
06:52 - to hacker rank uh cold Wars whatever you
06:55 - find the most enjoyable the or the least
06:58 - painful and and then uh you you might
07:00 - need to grind a little bit but whatever
07:02 - you need to do do that and then finally
07:05 - I would say practicing in a simulated
07:07 - environment is going to be really
07:08 - helpful so what this means is that you
07:11 - want to ask your friends or people in
07:13 - your community to give you some mock
07:14 - interviews this is going to be a really
07:16 - good practice for you and I would also
07:18 - say you should also offer to give people
07:21 - Mark interviews because that way you're
07:23 - going to start to understand what it
07:25 - feels like into in the interviewer shoes
07:28 - and that's going to give you some more
07:29 - empathy and that's going to make you a
07:31 - much better interviewer in my opinion so
07:34 - just to recap quickly first ask yourself
07:37 - why you want to get a job in Tech in the
07:38 - first place and then uh decide what type
07:41 - of job you want exactly and then learn
07:45 - fundamental skills that's step three
07:48 - gain more experience do some networking
07:51 - and work on your interview skills in my
07:54 - opinion this whole process should take
07:57 - about one year and you might say that's
08:00 - too optimistic maybe maybe true you know
08:03 - depending on your location but I don't
08:05 - think it's overly optimistic and here's
08:08 - why one of the reasons is because I'm
08:11 - pretty optimistic about the upcoming
08:13 - Market in the economy especially if and
08:16 - when the FED decides to cut interest
08:18 - rate it's going to be good for the stock
08:20 - market and it's going to be good for the
08:22 - job market as well but more importantly
08:24 - I think one year is a realistic timeline
08:27 - because most people are not that
08:29 - consistent you know a bunch of people
08:31 - are going to listen to this advice and
08:34 - let's say out of a thousand people who
08:36 - listen to this advice maybe um you know
08:40 - 100 people will get started or maybe 500
08:42 - you know if I'm being optimistic and out
08:45 - of those after 10 days you know we're
08:47 - going to have maybe 50 people left after
08:51 - 100 days maybe we'll have 10 people left
08:54 - after 365 days how many people do you
08:57 - think are consistent enough to show up
09:00 - every day to you know do the work every
09:02 - day to actually finish this world map I
09:05 - would say probably two or three you know
09:07 - if I'm being realistic if I'm being you
09:09 - know optimistic I might say five or six
09:12 - what that means is that if you're one of
09:14 - those people it's going to make a huge
09:16 - difference it's going to give you a huge
09:18 - advantage in this you know even tough
09:20 - economy and it's going to give you a
09:22 - much better chance of you know being
09:23 - able to get a job compared to those
09:25 - people who didn't show up for one year
09:28 - straight
09:29 - and as I said you know that's a
09:31 - realistic estimate you know two to three
09:33 - people five five to six people being
09:35 - able to finish this out of a thousand
09:37 - but I really want more of you to be able
09:41 - to finish this road map you know if you
09:42 - watch this far I really want you to be
09:45 - able to you know become uh more really
09:48 - more exceptional you know have a a lot
09:50 - more energy uh on this journey and be
09:53 - able to actually finish it and get a job
09:56 - in 365 days
