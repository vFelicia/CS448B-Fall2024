00:00 - I worked at Google in Montreux as a
00:04 - software developer for about a year and
00:06 - when I was there some people said to me
00:08 - wow you're working at Google
00:10 - you must be so smart and I would say
00:13 - yeah I must be jokes aside I don't think
00:18 - it's your smartness or your intelligence
00:19 - that matters the most when it comes to
00:22 - getting a job at a company like Google I
00:24 - believe being persistent and being
00:26 - willing to try and fail in the first
00:28 - place are much much more important the
00:31 - first time I applied for a job there was
00:33 - when I was in my third year in
00:35 - university it was for the software
00:38 - developer intern position in Tokyo I
00:40 - didn't think I was good enough for the
00:41 - job but I applied anyway I mean I wasn't
00:44 - even studying computer science I was
00:47 - studying statistics so I thought how
00:49 - could I possibly compete with other
00:51 - candidates who were studying computer
00:53 - science
00:54 - two months later though I got an
00:56 - interview with them I was really happy
00:58 - and excited when I got that interview
00:59 - but eventually I got rejected since then
01:03 - over the course of two years or so I
01:05 - applied for four more positions at
01:07 - Google and I got rejected three more
01:10 - times the last time I tried though the
01:12 - fifth time I tried they finally accepted
01:15 - me and I started working as a software
01:18 - developer in Montreal Canada now think
01:21 - about that one company you really want
01:23 - to work for do you think you're good
01:25 - enough for them if you don't think
01:27 - you're good enough for them who cares
01:28 - really I would say why don't you just
01:31 - try anyway if you're lucky you might
01:34 - just get an interview with them even if
01:36 - you don't get an offer in the end it's
01:38 - still a good practice for going through
01:40 - job interviews and of course in the
01:42 - future you can try again
01:44 - again and again all right go back guys
01:50 - you
