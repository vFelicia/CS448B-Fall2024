00:00 - hey YouTube so just in case you're new
00:02 - here my name is YK I was formerly a
00:05 - software developer at Google but now I
00:07 - work on this YouTube channel full time
00:09 - so in this video I'm gonna show you how
00:12 - to learn to code the best resources
00:14 - available online how to choose a
00:16 - personal project to work on and my
00:19 - thoughts on getting a computer science
00:21 - degree or going to coding boot camp I
00:23 - actually briefly talked about this topic
00:26 - in one of my previous videos but I'm
00:28 - gonna go into much more detail in this
00:30 - one so the first step for learning to
00:32 - code is to learn some programming
00:34 - fundamentals for this step I would
00:37 - recommend one of those interactive
00:39 - websites like code Academy or free code
00:41 - camp so the way these websites works is
00:44 - actually really cool so the way it works
00:46 - is you go to one of those websites and
00:49 - you can basically just start typing your
00:51 - code right away and check if your code
00:53 - is correct it's actually pretty unusual
00:56 - because if you want to do some coding
00:57 - usually you first need to set up some
01:00 - kind of special environment on your
01:02 - computer and if you're beginner it's
01:05 - actually really easy to get stuck just
01:07 - trying to set up the right environment
01:09 - you know installing the right things and
01:11 - setting up the right things so I would
01:13 - say these websites are super helpful for
01:15 - getting started with coding right away
01:17 - but if we prefer learning from videos
01:20 - instead of you know reading too much I'd
01:22 - recommend websites like plural site and
01:25 - lynda.com both of which have good video
01:28 - courses so just pick one of those
01:30 - websites and on that website search for
01:33 - something like programming fundamentals
01:35 - or Python for beginners and whatever you
01:38 - choose try to use their free resources
01:41 - and free trials as much as possible
01:43 - because that way you'll be able to learn
01:45 - you know most of the programming
01:47 - fundamentals for free and you'll be able
01:49 - to see which website you like the most
01:50 - so at this stage really focus on
01:53 - learning common programming basics so
01:56 - these are things like variables
01:58 - functions arrays or lists depending on
02:01 - the language that you're using for loops
02:03 - if statements and even classes and
02:05 - objects and once you know these basics
02:07 - the second step after that will be to
02:10 - start building your first personal
02:12 - project
02:13 - when it comes to building a personal
02:15 - project the most common question I get
02:17 - is how should I choose which project to
02:19 - work on there are basically three
02:21 - criteria I would personally use for
02:23 - choosing which project to work on first
02:26 - of all you should choose something that
02:28 - you're interested in building or that
02:30 - you're interested in doing already so
02:32 - for example if you're like playing video
02:34 - games you might want to create a simple
02:37 - video game and if you like photography
02:39 - maybe you can build a portfolio website
02:41 - where you can show off all your best
02:43 - photos and if you like trading stocks or
02:46 - even bitcoins maybe you can build a
02:49 - system that analyzes stock charts for
02:51 - you and whatever you choose it's really
02:54 - important to choose something that you
02:55 - can keep motivated about and the second
02:58 - point to consider is you should start
03:00 - with something that's really simple so
03:02 - if you want to be able to say a video
03:03 - game don't start with something really
03:05 - complex like legal lessons but start
03:08 - with something simpler like flappy bird
03:10 - or even tic-tac-toe and if you want to
03:13 - build a website don't start with
03:15 - something complete like Facebook but
03:17 - just start with a to-do list website and
03:20 - then go from there and the third point
03:22 - to consider is ideally you should build
03:25 - something that's useful for yourself or
03:27 - for someone else and that way it's gonna
03:30 - give you extra motivation you know so
03:32 - that it works for yourself or for
03:33 - someone else and if you can say
03:36 - something like I built this thing and it
03:38 - was used by ten thousand people it's
03:40 - gonna look really good on your resume
03:42 - but that's kind of hard so I would say
03:45 - first focus on the first two criteria so
03:48 - at least find something that you're
03:50 - interested in building and that's pretty
03:52 - simple to build and just in case you
03:54 - don't have any ideas here are a few
03:56 - ideas for you to get started with a
03:58 - to-do list app or a website or something
04:01 - like Twitter but something that's much
04:03 - simpler than Twitter so just the ability
04:05 - to tweet and follow someone else and if
04:09 - you like video games start with
04:11 - something simple like Tetris Sudoku or
04:13 - just tic-tac-toe okay once you start
04:16 - learning programming fundamentals and
04:18 - once you start building your first
04:20 - personal project actually it's very
04:22 - likely that you get stuck at some point
04:25 - and it's very natural because you're
04:27 - beginner and programming is actually
04:29 - really hard but when you're stuck it's
04:31 - actually really important to know how to
04:33 - get help from other people and the first
04:35 - thing you should try is actually you
04:37 - should just use Google so let's say just
04:39 - as an example you've been building this
04:41 - program and don't worry too much about
04:43 - what it's doing and let's say it's going
04:46 - just fine buts only you get an error
04:50 - message so this is pretty similar to
04:53 - what a typical error message looks like
04:54 - it says recursion error here and then
04:57 - you have a bunch of nonsense here really
05:00 - and then here it says recursion error
05:02 - maximum recursion blah blah blah now
05:05 - let's say you don't know what this error
05:06 - message means what you should do then is
05:09 - you should just copy this error message
05:11 - and then type that into Google and
05:14 - hopefully you'll be able to find someone
05:16 - else who had the same problem and then
05:19 - you'll be able to find an answer to how
05:21 - to solve that issue - and one trick I
05:23 - sometimes do in Google is I put this
05:27 - error message in quotation marks and
05:29 - just like that I can tell Google to find
05:31 - webpages that have these exact same
05:34 - words in the exact same order because
05:37 - without these quotation marks sometimes
05:40 - Google finds webpages that are not
05:42 - directly related to what I'm looking for
05:44 - and once you start doing this this
05:46 - website called stuck overflow will come
05:48 - up over and over again in your Google
05:51 - results and it's like a Q&A website for
05:54 - software developers and it's one of the
05:56 - best resources for any programming
05:58 - related questions so when you have any
06:01 - programming related questions you should
06:03 - just first try using Google and Stack
06:05 - Overflow then if you can't find anything
06:08 - that's relevant on there you can also
06:10 - ask something yourself on Stack Overflow
06:12 - just keep in mind that it might take a
06:14 - while to get an answer say 2 to 3 weeks
06:17 - or longer other than that for asking
06:20 - questions
06:20 - I'd recommend web sites like Reddit for
06:23 - the learn programming subreddit or
06:25 - language-specific subreddit for example
06:28 - the Python ones if you're interested in
06:30 - learning Python I'd also recommend
06:32 - Facebook groups for example the free
06:34 - code camp Earth's Facebook group which
06:37 - is basically a group of people who are
06:39 - trying to learn to code together and
06:40 - again language-specific groups for
06:43 - example groups for Java and in addition
06:46 - to all of that getting involved with
06:48 - offline communities is also a good idea
06:51 - to get help and advice in person for
06:54 - example you can use meetup comm on
06:56 - meetup comm you can just search for the
06:59 - kinds of events you're interested in
07:00 - let's say Java or iOS development near
07:05 - you let's say Vancouver and if you click
07:09 - groups you'll be able to find relevant
07:11 - groups right there you should try using
07:13 - Facebook events as well and to get
07:16 - started with that just search for
07:18 - programming or coding and then in this
07:22 - search view just go to the events
07:24 - section and select your location let's
07:27 - say Vancouver British Columbia and
07:29 - you'll be able to find relevant events
07:31 - right there so let's say you worked on a
07:34 - few personal projects you already
07:36 - learned some programming fundamentals
07:37 - and you started getting involved with
07:39 - ideally offline and online communities
07:42 - what you should do after that is you
07:44 - should try to get a job or an internship
07:46 - as soon as possible and ideally a paid
07:49 - one too so when you're learning
07:51 - everything on your own you might make a
07:53 - lot of mistakes but you might not even
07:54 - realize that so if you get a job and if
07:57 - you start working with other software
07:59 - engineers they'll be able to give you
08:01 - some feedback on your code so you'll be
08:03 - able to learn much faster and hopefully
08:06 - you'll be able to get paid at the same
08:07 - time and obviously there are different
08:09 - ways of applying for jobs like using
08:12 - LinkedIn or going to career fairs but
08:15 - the one I'd recommend the one method I'd
08:17 - recommend for beginners is networking
08:19 - and I actually don't like the word
08:21 - networking much but I see as just you
08:24 - know meeting people and basically making
08:25 - friends so there are a couple reasons
08:27 - why I recommend networking for beginners
08:30 - one is that if you followed my steps in
08:33 - the step before this you should have
08:35 - already found some events that you like
08:37 - going to on Facebook mera kaam so you
08:40 - should just keep using them and then the
08:42 - second reason is that if you're a
08:44 - beginner you probably don't have a lot
08:46 - of experience so you don't have a strong
08:48 - resume so if you just apply online it's
08:51 - gonna be really hard you two stand out
08:54 - from all the other candidates but if you
08:56 - have some kind of personal connections
08:57 - people will be more likely to trust you
09:00 - even though you don't have a lot of
09:01 - experience so it should be an easier way
09:04 - for you to get a job and actually when I
09:07 - didn't have a lot of experience you know
09:09 - when I just got started with coding
09:10 - that's how I got my first and second
09:13 - internships too so when you go to one of
09:15 - these events for the first time it might
09:17 - be pretty awkward you know you might not
09:19 - know what to say exactly but it's
09:21 - actually pretty simple you just need to
09:23 - basically walk up to someone and say
09:25 - something like what's your name and what
09:28 - brings you to this event and what are
09:29 - you hoping to get out of it if the other
09:32 - person asks you the same question you
09:34 - can just say something like you know I'm
09:37 - mostly here to learn because I just got
09:40 - started with coding and I'm also curious
09:42 - about what kind of jobs are available
09:44 - you know with what I'm learning and then
09:46 - you know just have a good conversation
09:48 - basically and once you have a meaningful
09:50 - connection that way you know either
09:52 - right there or after the event you can
09:55 - start asking for help for you know
09:57 - learning specific technologies or for
09:59 - getting a job and one piece of advice
10:02 - for you here would be to not just ask
10:04 - for help but also offer help for example
10:07 - by volunteering your time to you know
10:09 - local organizations and that way you'll
10:12 - be able to build trust more quickly and
10:14 - build you know meaningful connections
10:16 - more quickly and like I said once you
10:18 - get a job that way you'll be able to
10:20 - learn coding much much more quickly
10:22 - because you'll be able to learn from
10:23 - your colleagues and based on your
10:26 - experience from your first job it's
10:28 - gonna be much easier for you to get a
10:30 - second job and a third job and so on so
10:33 - so far I mostly talked about how to
10:35 - learn to code on your own so you might
10:37 - say what about going to a university or
10:39 - going to a coding bootcamp if you don't
10:42 - have a degree yet and if you're planning
10:44 - to get one soon I definitely recommend
10:46 - computer science and that's partly
10:48 - because computer science will give you
10:50 - sort of fundamental knowledge that you
10:52 - need for writing efficient code but also
10:54 - because of some other subtle things for
10:57 - example when I went to my University I
10:59 - wasn't studying computer science I was
11:02 - studying statistics and then when I
11:04 - wanted to apply for some jobs and you
11:06 - programming related internships I
11:08 - couldn't really use the university
11:10 - system because those job postings on my
11:13 - university system there were for
11:16 - computer science students only so there
11:18 - are some subtle advantages like that
11:20 - computer science students and joy but if
11:23 - you already have a degree let's say in
11:25 - biology or art history or whatever I
11:28 - personally wouldn't take a second degree
11:30 - in computer science just to learn coding
11:32 - unless it's like a shorter program let's
11:35 - say for two years because I think
11:37 - addition of four years is just way too
11:39 - long and what about coding boot camps
11:41 - well first of all in case you don't know
11:43 - what a coding boot camp is it's sort of
11:46 - like a private school you can go to for
11:48 - three to four months to learn to code
11:51 - basically and I think they're really
11:53 - good for the support systems they have
11:55 - so if you get stuck you can just ask
11:57 - questions and the pressure that's built
12:00 - in for you to learn at a set schedule so
12:03 - the downside of a coding boot camp is
12:05 - that it's kind of expensive so
12:06 - personally if I were you I would first
12:09 - learn to code on my own and then if it
12:12 - doesn't work out for any reason then I
12:15 - to consider a coding boot camp another
12:17 - thing they might say on their website is
12:19 - that when you go through their program
12:22 - after the program they'll be able to you
12:24 - know connect you with potential
12:26 - employers so it's gonna be easier for
12:28 - you to get a job but I think that
12:30 - connection aspect is sort of overrated
12:32 - because if you just want to build
12:34 - connections you know you can just build
12:35 - connections by going to events and stuff
12:37 - so if I were to go there I would just go
12:40 - there to learn coding basically okay if
12:43 - you're curious about what programming
12:44 - language you should learn first I have a
12:46 - video about that and if you just want to
12:49 - get started with coding I would
12:50 - recommend my Python tutorials for
12:52 - absolute beginners right there and if
12:55 - you're not part of the CS dojo community
12:57 - yet you should join us by subscribing to
12:59 - this channel I'm YK from CS dojo of
13:02 - course and I'll see you guys in the next
13:03 - video
