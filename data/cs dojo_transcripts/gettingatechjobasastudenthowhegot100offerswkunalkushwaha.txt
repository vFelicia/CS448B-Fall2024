00:26 - around first week of july i am an open
00:30 - source enthusiast
00:31 - i am a content creator i'm active in a
00:33 - lot of communities i love teaching i
00:36 - love
00:37 - going to conferences organizing events
00:40 - things like that

00:46 - um yeah i mean i just graduated last
00:49 - week so around like around somewhere
00:51 - last last week so i'm
00:54 - still adjusting to the
00:56 - graduate graduate like uh like life and
01:00 - have some have some exciting things
01:01 - planned for my future so
01:03 - yeah hopefully uh
01:05 - i'll answer some of your questions yeah
01:08 - looking forward to it thanks for having
01:09 - me like appreciate it
01:11 - yeah i appreciate you uh being here
01:14 - um
01:16 - and you know our time is uh limited so
01:18 - let's you know let's let's see how many
01:21 - questions we can get through but i think
01:23 - i want to start with the job that you
01:25 - just mentioned as a developer advocate
01:26 - at sibo
01:29 - you got that job as a student right
01:32 - yeah if i remember correctly it was
01:35 - it was last year may
01:38 - yeah last year me so then one year i
01:40 - started as an intern i worked throughout
01:43 - my
01:44 - like junior and scene area
01:46 - at ceo
01:47 - and i'll be joining full time
01:50 - yeah
01:51 - nice
01:51 - um yeah i think we there's a lot we can
01:55 - talk about there
01:56 - you know the first natural question
01:58 - is how did you get that job
02:02 - um so i actually
02:04 - actually got a google internship in
02:05 - north america and uh
02:08 - then what happened was
02:10 - all the offers were revoked because they
02:12 - were not hiring people because of code
02:14 - so i made a post about it it got 40 000
02:17 - likes on linkedin
02:19 - and
02:19 - around 3 million views so a lot of
02:21 - people started reaching out like oh you
02:23 - have a great profile and whatever
02:25 - uh would you like to interview with us
02:27 - and all the all these other things
02:29 - and then during that time i got in the
02:31 - mlh fellowship which is a good
02:33 - experience contributed to facebook open
02:34 - source um that was nice
02:37 - and then
02:38 - um i was sort of like looking for a
02:40 - like a company sort of experience and
02:42 - not like a
02:43 - like a open source program for students
02:45 - sort of thing i just wanted to see how
02:48 - how that goes so
02:50 - i i i just
02:52 - i was just i just made some tweets and
02:53 - stuff and people reached out and
02:55 - um then you know we got on a call and
02:58 - it and it happened yeah
03:01 - nice so yeah social media and like
03:03 - reference and open source yeah
03:06 - cool um
03:08 - okay stepping back for a minute how did
03:10 - you get the google internship or how did
03:13 - you get the initial offer
03:16 - i i just applied online uh on the portal
03:19 - with a referral i actually did a podcast
03:22 - with my google recruiter also there she
03:24 - mentioned everything about how the code
03:26 - situation messed things up and stuff but
03:28 - it was a good experience i learned from
03:30 - the interview process and got good
03:31 - feedback so that was good
03:33 - um but nothing nothing really special i
03:36 - did i just applied on the portal with a
03:38 - with a referral gave my interviews
03:40 - i think there was an online coding round
03:42 - and then
03:43 - phone screen and then two three coding
03:45 - rounds if i remember correctly um and
03:48 - then in the end there's a project tool
03:50 - section
03:51 - and that's the end stage um so i just
03:53 - applied normally with a reference that's
03:55 - it
03:56 - nice
03:57 - um
03:58 - i think i actually want to step back
04:00 - even more
04:02 - how did you get your first
04:04 - you know paid job or how did you make
04:06 - your first dollar
04:07 - as a student
04:10 - oh um
04:13 - at the end of my freshman year i um
04:17 - i i started volunteering at local
04:19 - programming boot camps as like teaching
04:21 - assistant india has a
04:23 - big tech culture of like tech startups
04:25 - so i just uh i i started doing
04:28 - internships there
04:29 - i don't know how much i got paid it was
04:31 - around uh
04:33 - 350 bucks for two months
04:36 - um
04:38 - so yeah that's how i started i sort of
04:39 - like gained a lot of experience in
04:41 - indiana startups
04:43 - that's why i'm really good at teaching
04:46 - so i know the ins and outs and about how
04:48 - these guys work and
04:50 - what makes them special what why people
04:52 - buy their courses
04:55 - so i worked at these startups for like a
04:57 - few months
04:58 - and then i got into like
05:00 - open source mostly like google summer of
05:03 - code and then um linux foundation
05:05 - programs and mlh fellowship then i
05:07 - worked at mlh for one year something i
05:09 - was in the core team actually reviewed
05:11 - the most mls fellowship applications and
05:13 - interviews coding interviews that i did
05:16 - around 3000 plus so
05:19 - great great program not a plug but
05:21 - genuinely if you are looking for
05:23 - something all these programs are nice
05:25 - but yeah that's basically about it
05:28 - right
05:29 - yeah and like no
05:31 - no again
05:33 - even back no
05:36 - yeah nah nah i think i think i think
05:39 - we're all good i'm just kidding yeah
05:41 - um
05:43 - yeah i was gonna say you know i think
05:45 - sometimes people miss that you need to
05:47 - start where you can
05:50 - um i remember you know
05:52 - you know sort of my first paid job as as
05:55 - a student was like a minimum basically
05:57 - like a minimum a paid job as a you know
05:59 - math tutor and yeah that's all i could
06:01 - get and that's it you know that's that's
06:04 - exp but the experience counts you get to
06:06 - teach a class i remember there was a
06:08 - class of like 60 people and sometimes
06:10 - they sometimes they let me like teach
06:13 - entire lectures also which was nice and
06:15 - i definitely got a lot of teaching
06:17 - skills out of it if not a lot of money
06:20 - yeah i think the experience counts it's
06:22 - something you can put on your resume
06:25 - and that's how everyone starts
06:27 - and yeah i think i can you know i can
06:29 - start going backwards now
06:31 - how did you get that you know google
06:33 - summary of
06:35 - code internship and like do you have any
06:38 - advice for people who want that
06:41 - yeah gsoc is not that difficult to get
06:43 - into so it's an internship alternative
06:46 - by google
06:47 - you contribute to open source projects
06:48 - some of the largest ones in the world
06:50 - around i think 200 plus organizations
06:52 - take part
06:53 - so in my freshman year when i was
06:55 - starting out i thought gsoc was a really
06:56 - big thing firstly because the price
06:58 - price was like the stipend was a lot for
07:01 - an indian student i think around 3000
07:03 - bucks
07:04 - and then
07:05 - um
07:06 - and then uh
07:07 - my college seniors and everyone on
07:10 - youtube they were saying oh google
07:12 - summer code do it you'll get a job at
07:14 - google oh it's the best thing you can do
07:16 - for your career very difficult to get
07:18 - into
07:19 - and then i sort of like did not know
07:20 - about it that much i just i was actually
07:22 - looking for open source projects to
07:24 - contribute to because i attended an
07:25 - event in new delhi
07:27 - and there i learned about open source
07:29 - and i just started contributing to the
07:31 - kubernetes java client by red hat
07:32 - middleware and i just started with some
07:34 - documentation and then some
07:37 - so simple code changes and things like
07:38 - that and then the people the maintainers
07:40 - are like hey
07:42 - we are participating with some of code
07:44 - check it out and then i applied and i
07:45 - got selected in my freshman year itself
07:47 - with red hat middleware working on
07:49 - kubernetes java client so
07:51 - really big project not at all like
07:53 - simple pretty complex code base but i
07:56 - learned on the go ask good questions and
07:58 - worked a lot hard
08:01 - you know waka time
08:03 - uh no
08:05 - so waka time is like it manages your
08:07 - keystrokes and it tells you how much
08:09 - hours you have quoted
08:11 - so during my gsoc period i was world
08:13 - rank 8 on that
08:15 - i did a lot i did a lot of coding i
08:17 - start i finished my gsoft project in
08:19 - like
08:20 - um
08:22 - in like a more than one and a half
08:24 - months and it's like a two three month
08:25 - long period so it's a good experience i
08:28 - i i remember still now how hard i work
08:30 - for that um but it was a rewarding
08:32 - experience because then i got into into
08:34 - this field and
08:36 - um
08:37 - gsoc was
08:38 - i think like even if you do open source
08:41 - contributions without g-shock in these
08:43 - programs
08:44 - it's still beneficial you can still put
08:46 - it in your resume if you have a good pr
08:48 - merged or whatever i think that's fine
08:50 - um you don't have to be like um
08:54 - it's not like i only need to do
08:56 - gsoc in order to contribute to open
08:58 - source that's not the case yeah but i
09:01 - got in it was a fun and then i didn't do
09:03 - it again i i mentored in the same
09:05 - organization red hat
09:06 - for two years for google summer code and
09:08 - one year for google coding
09:12 - cool
09:13 - um yeah i'm not surprised you know based
09:16 - on what you said that you got a google
09:18 - summer code because
09:20 - you were already doing open source work
09:22 - and then you basically just needed to
09:23 - say i'm already doing this and i can
09:25 - continue doing this right
09:27 - yeah that's what
09:29 - that's what that's like a best practice
09:30 - you want to get selected in gsoc
09:32 - um try to start early maintainers would
09:36 - prioritize students who are active
09:38 - contributors
09:41 - yeah makes sense
09:45 - um
09:48 - yeah and
09:49 - how did you go from that to the next
09:52 - step you know juice out to the next
09:54 - thing
09:56 - yeah after that um i think after that a
09:58 - few months after that after that i got
10:00 - to attend kubecon on a scholarship right
10:02 - after gsoc because
10:04 - my projects for projects were related to
10:06 - k-8 so
10:07 - i got a scholarship by the linux
10:08 - foundation i went to san diego um that
10:11 - was fun met folks at kubecon attended
10:14 - the contributor summit at kubecon
10:16 - um and then sort of like
10:18 - mls fellowship happened and then i got
10:20 - involved in the cncf i'm a cncm
10:22 - ambassador
10:23 - um
10:24 - and i feel really
10:28 - blessed to be a part of this community
10:30 - and be recognized in this community
10:32 - when i was at kubecon last like in may
10:35 - in in spain
10:36 - um all the big big minds in tech and the
10:40 - big big faces of cloud native they were
10:42 - like you know they're coming up to me
10:43 - and they're like oh canal appreciate the
10:45 - work you do a great youtube channel
10:47 - great vlogs and things like that
10:49 - um
10:50 - so it has been amazing and
10:52 - uh
10:54 - it's just that you could you do good
10:55 - work in public you get recognized um
10:58 - it's very very amazing journey yeah
11:02 - then covet came
11:04 - oh yeah
11:06 - it's cool yeah it was like just at home
11:08 - yeah nothing yeah yeah
11:10 - yeah
11:11 - yeah it's a whole different thing right
11:13 - all different things
11:14 - yeah
11:15 - and just quickly cncf that's cloud
11:18 - native right
11:20 - cloud native computing foundation yeah
11:24 - is that like a it's a foundation
11:27 - yeah it's an organization has uh has
11:29 - various members associated with it it
11:32 - has a lot of projects in it so companies
11:34 - choose to donate their projects to the
11:35 - cncf um like cuban it is was donated by
11:40 - by google in 2014 so it's a relatively
11:43 - new new tech so companies choose to do
11:45 - that there's an entire cncf landscape um
11:48 - that you can look at which has a lot of
11:50 - projects categorized um i spoke at
11:52 - kubecon as a student speaking at kubecon
11:55 - 2-3 times
11:56 - i i just could not ask have asked for a
11:58 - better better career yeah yeah
12:02 - yeah that's
12:03 - that's that's a lot that you've done
12:05 - um
12:06 - i think i want to ask you more about
12:08 - like time management but first of all
12:11 - you know going back again um
12:13 - you can talk about it yeah yeah yeah
12:16 - good
12:17 - but yeah before that
12:19 - i think um
12:21 - some people have asked me like how do
12:23 - you deal with a big code base when you
12:25 - start you know contributing to open
12:27 - source because you know
12:29 - it might be pretty like overwhelming for
12:31 - beginners
12:33 - yeah that's a good point um
12:35 - you don't have to know the entire code
12:37 - base um the
12:39 - the the most
12:42 - the biggest mistake that students make
12:44 - is
12:44 - they look they find a project to
12:46 - contribute to they look at the code base
12:48 - they feel overwhelmed and then they
12:50 - leave they're like oh this won't i can't
12:53 - work with this
12:54 - if you just google
12:56 - um fabricate i o q as java client that
12:58 - is a project i contributed to in
13:00 - freshman year if you check that right
13:01 - now check the code base
13:04 - overwhelming for someone who is a
13:06 - student and who does not like who's just
13:08 - starting out with coding
13:09 - i think instead of running from it it's
13:12 - a good thing that you find a founder
13:13 - project like this this is a little bit
13:15 - of a controversial opinion but i believe
13:17 - that in the student community there is
13:19 - no such thing as imposter syndrome what
13:21 - is impossible syndrome impossible means
13:23 - i don't know i don't know something and
13:26 - they know something people i work with
13:28 - correct
13:29 - is that what imposter syndrome is like i
13:31 - don't know something and people know
13:33 - something right you feel like you lack
13:35 - knowledge or whatever
13:37 - i think impossible basically instead of
13:39 - that you should look at it i'm a very
13:41 - optimistic person
13:42 - i try to find silver lining in
13:44 - everything
13:45 - so i think with the with this scenario
13:47 - it's like i know something else and they
13:49 - are working on something else
13:51 - so
13:51 - i'm not denying that the existence of
13:54 - impostor syndrome but i'm saying that
13:55 - it's a good thing in the student
13:56 - community because if you're just a
13:58 - student you're just starting out no one
13:59 - expects you to know stuff that much if
14:02 - you're a student you're just starting
14:03 - out you don't know what cuban it is no
14:05 - one would be surprised
14:06 - so
14:07 - if you find yourself in a place where
14:09 - you see a project or a contribution or
14:11 - whatever and you don't know much about
14:13 - the tech stack that's a great thing for
14:14 - you as a student because you'll get to
14:16 - learn and contribute now
14:18 - right what if someone gave you a job
14:20 - all you have to do is implement binary
14:22 - search just implement binary search
14:24 - that's it for it for six hours a day
14:27 - would that be really
14:29 - beneficial to you no learn something new
14:31 - go out of your comfort zone your college
14:33 - years are all about exploring and
14:36 - um one thing folks have to realize when
14:38 - they see big code bases it's not going
14:39 - to happen overnight it will take a few
14:41 - months
14:42 - clone this clone the repository
14:44 - run it on your local system look at the
14:46 - test cases look at the architecture of
14:48 - the project how the things are working
14:50 - what are the various components if it's
14:52 - a huge code base it's like divided into
14:53 - modules and packages
14:55 - um check out good first issues
14:57 - the
14:58 - maintainers can help you guide you
15:00 - towards like a particular package or
15:02 - whatever so
15:03 - you don't have to know the entire code
15:04 - base in order to contribute
15:08 - yeah thank you for that i feel like
15:10 - that's
15:11 - you know that's that's a that's like a
15:12 - big question and you know
15:15 - it could easily be like a separate video
15:16 - too
15:19 - yeah
15:20 - yeah
15:21 - and you know if if you could like share
15:23 - your screen kind of walk through some of
15:26 - your like workflow you know you're
15:28 - welcome to do that too but
15:30 - yeah what workflow of github
15:32 - oh like you know like an example of like
15:35 - say a beginner is looking at a new open
15:37 - source project they're overwhelmed oh
15:39 - yeah okay
15:40 - yeah i can do that um
15:44 - let me just hide a few things
15:46 - yeah sounds good
15:48 - no just it's a slack company slack
15:50 - oh yeah no worries and some some
15:52 - announcements i haven't made yet
15:56 - all right um
15:57 - [Music]
16:11 - and
16:12 - okay can you see my github
16:13 - [Music]
16:14 - yes
16:16 - so um actually summer of code with
16:17 - google.com is a great website to find
16:19 - open source projects you don't have to
16:21 - do gsoc but you can check out the um
16:25 - organizations you want to contribute to
16:27 - so like you can search let's say okay i
16:29 - want to contribute to java
16:31 - as i just search for java and you will
16:32 - find projects that you can that use java
16:35 - how cool is that this is like a really
16:37 - big list
16:38 - you can see
16:39 - 110 projects just 110 organizations for
16:43 - java and every single organization would
16:45 - have their own like projects number of
16:47 - projects so like big big ones chromium
16:49 - is there
16:50 - so many my jboss would also be here
16:53 - rocket chat would is here somewhere
16:55 - you'll find your sef is here for storage
16:57 - open ways post grade so you get the idea
17:00 - and you can also filter from here so
17:02 - this is a great resource to find open
17:03 - source projects
17:05 - apart from that um
17:07 - you can check out cncf slash mentoring
17:10 - we also have some projects if you want
17:11 - to contribute to open source and cncf
17:14 - cncf there has their own
17:16 - landscape
17:18 - uh
17:19 - here you can see
17:21 - cncf
17:22 - landscape
17:26 - but these are all individual projects i
17:28 - can get a little bit overwhelming
17:30 - to like navigate these but i suppose i
17:32 - spoke at cubecon at a panel on
17:35 - navigating the cncf landscape but
17:37 - putting us on track if i just give an
17:39 - example of the
17:41 - project i contributed to only
17:43 - um
17:48 - where is it
17:49 - so this one right
17:51 - um
17:52 - what what you can do is first of all
17:54 - like clone it or whatever fork it and
17:58 - read the documentation run it on your
17:59 - local system check out the test cases
18:01 - things like that and check out the
18:03 - beginner friendly issues go to issues
18:06 - and check out good first issue labels
18:09 - should be having it somewhere here good
18:11 - first issue
18:12 - right now there's one but this is a good
18:14 - example because if you don't find good
18:17 - first issues on github you can join the
18:19 - mailing list or slack community or
18:21 - whatever they're using they are using um
18:24 - what are they using gator so you can
18:26 - join gita uh i'm not saying this to join
18:29 - this project i'm just giving an example
18:31 - and then you can put hey i'm beginner do
18:32 - you have any beginner friendly issues i
18:34 - can contribute to or whatever and just
18:36 - follow the
18:37 - community guidelines don't spam anyone
18:39 - um as you can see this is the project i
18:41 - contributed to and it's really
18:43 - overwhelming like
18:45 - as a student this does not make any
18:47 - sense to many people but um if you want
18:50 - to check my pr's you can go to closed
18:51 - pr's
18:52 - author
18:54 - naal kushwaha
18:58 - so as you can see this particular
19:00 - example that i it's very how i started
19:03 - so just some refractoring that's it
19:07 - and some documentation and refracting
19:09 - stuff see nothing major
19:12 - and from that i started with like
19:15 - um adding tests
19:17 - and uh adding support for new resources
19:20 - so this is like the
19:22 - big contribution type thing obviously
19:24 - took me some while
19:26 - around 10 000 lines of changes lot of
19:28 - java code here
19:30 - so
19:31 - it takes time but i showed you
19:33 - um you know how basic stuff i started
19:35 - with
19:36 - um
19:37 - so yeah it takes time take your time um
19:40 - is what i'd recommend
19:42 - yeah
19:43 - nice um yeah i think
19:46 - you know coming back to this question
19:48 - again
19:49 - the thing
19:50 - beginners see when they see a big code
19:52 - base is this like
19:54 - this big chunk of code and they're like
19:56 - oh you know there there's so much stuff
19:57 - going on like
19:59 - do do i read this file
20:01 - yeah and ask questions break it down
20:05 - yeah they might feel like they need to
20:07 - kind of read the whole thing or uh
20:09 - whatever
20:10 - i think that's that's what you know
20:12 - that's that's where this question is
20:14 - coming from
20:15 - yeah no it is a it's a valid question
20:17 - thanks for asking that whoever asked
20:20 - yeah
20:21 - um all right let's
20:23 - let me ask you about
20:25 - time management then because it seems
20:27 - like you've done a lot like a lot of
20:28 - internships open source school work
20:31 - supposedly
20:33 - um so like how do you manage all of
20:35 - those
20:38 - um i think i think time management is
20:40 - it's it's like a lot of discipline comes
20:41 - with it
20:42 - but um
20:46 - you have to see what your priorities are
20:48 - um i am not the best person for time
20:51 - management because i have burnt out
20:52 - pretty badly in the past um
20:55 - the the
20:56 - the thing students specifically if
20:58 - you're talking about them
21:00 - what they struggle with is managing
21:02 - college and all these other things right
21:05 - um
21:06 - i think college plays a
21:08 - big role in it some call some colleges
21:10 - take a lot of your time
21:11 - um mandatory lectures
21:14 - um like you have to attend 75 of all the
21:16 - lectures and then you have to
21:18 - um
21:20 - you know do some assignments and all
21:21 - these other things
21:22 - um and why k i'm not saying like good
21:24 - assignments in india they are like they
21:26 - will give you a sheet right and they
21:28 - will say copy this sheet
21:31 - it's 10 pages in a book
21:33 - just copy it
21:34 - that's what the kind of assignments we
21:36 - get not like here's an interesting
21:38 - question solve it no
21:40 - just copy pasting so
21:43 - you have to like work accordingly to
21:45 - save your time um
21:47 - i think koh it sort of like helped a
21:49 - little bit with this giving students a
21:51 - little bit more time that they were you
21:53 - know things were remote classes were
21:54 - remote so they could do whatever they
21:56 - wanted um
22:00 - but you have a time management it's
22:01 - important to prioritize your tasks isn't
22:02 - this a thing i i recommend you checking
22:04 - out eisenhoer metrics
22:07 - um have you heard of it yk
22:10 - no what is it i i think it's called
22:13 - eisenhore metrics
22:14 - you can google it and share your screen
22:17 - so basically the idea is that
22:19 - there are four quadrants
22:21 - um
22:22 - urgent not urgent important not not
22:25 - important so something that lies in not
22:28 - important and not urgent i will just not
22:30 - do it something that is important but
22:32 - not urgent i will
22:34 - schedule it for the future something
22:36 - that is important and urgent i'll do it
22:38 - asap and also it's important to say no
22:42 - like learn how to say no i would love to
22:44 - help out i would love to answer all your
22:45 - questions on all your dms but
22:48 - i would love to make all the courses
22:50 - that i taught in tech companies but it's
22:52 - just that because almost time takes it
22:54 - takes so much time and um
22:57 - it's not like i'm asking you from for
22:59 - like money that i owe you stuff
23:02 - so
23:03 - you have to learn how to say no and
23:06 - make sure you don't burn out take care
23:08 - of your health
23:10 - and um
23:11 - prioritize your tasks the one thing with
23:13 - time management as a student was that i
23:16 - i follow a pie shape or t-shaped
23:18 - learning whatever you want to call it
23:19 - know everything about something
23:20 - something about everything um i did not
23:23 - focus that much as a student on being an
23:24 - expert
23:26 - i don't call myself an expert like right
23:28 - now even um i'll try to get some more
23:30 - certifications or whatever um now that
23:33 - i've graduated but
23:34 - i focused a lot more on applying the
23:36 - things that i've learned that i'm
23:37 - learning
23:38 - um
23:39 - it be that with devops or like web dev
23:41 - or
23:42 - um machine learning whatever um
23:45 - contribute to your projects created a
23:47 - course on it or whatever um gave a
23:49 - webinar contacted a conference event
23:52 - wrote a blog so i think as a student
23:54 - that was very rewarding for me because
23:56 - as a student no one expects you to be an
23:58 - expert they expect you to have an open
24:00 - mind and have the willingness to learn
24:02 - um
24:04 - but yeah so i think yeah that's
24:05 - basically about it um
24:07 - don't be stuck in tutorial hell and
24:09 - manage your time well um
24:12 - apply whatever you're learning
24:14 - yeah
24:17 - yeah uh thank you for that
24:19 - i think saying no is
24:21 - pretty big for a lot of people
24:23 - you know even
24:27 - yeah a lot
24:30 - yeah i remember even you know among
24:32 - students on twitter in particular i see
24:35 - people saying oh yeah sorry yeah i'm not
24:37 - gonna post stuff for a while but you
24:39 - know i always say like never apologize
24:42 - for
24:42 - not posting free stuff it's free in the
24:46 - beginning anyway it's it's
24:47 - it's free and that's that's the whole
24:49 - point
24:50 - plus i don't think there is a lack of
24:52 - resources i just think there's a lack of
24:55 - how to find resources good resources
24:58 - yeah you can learn anything you want
25:01 - online
25:02 - everything
25:03 - yeah yeah true
25:06 - [Music]
25:08 - um
25:10 - okay and i'm i'm curious like
25:12 - you know you mentioned burnout what was
25:15 - he like how did it happen how did you
25:16 - get out of it
25:19 - it happened when i started creating my
25:20 - boot camps uh that dac boot camp stuff
25:23 - a single video
25:25 - so i can say this even confidently right
25:27 - now
25:30 - the the course is ongoing but the topics
25:32 - i have covered till now like the
25:34 - complete recursion playlist
25:35 - object-oriented programming
25:37 - and all the java stuff that i have
25:38 - covered
25:39 - according to me and apparently a
25:41 - thousand students
25:42 - um
25:45 - that content content wise and quality
25:47 - wise it is not available on youtube
25:49 - period
25:50 - but uh the thing is that the reason for
25:52 - that is i've done a lot of research and
25:55 - i always say to people don't trust me
25:58 - when i say this
26:00 - you watch it yourself and then you're
26:01 - the one to decide
26:02 - um
26:04 - the thing is that with burnout
26:06 - a single video is like
26:08 - too in-depth it's more than
26:11 - it should be and it takes me an entire
26:13 - day to create one data structures video
26:16 - and that's when i went out pretty pretty
26:17 - pretty badly because i work at co as
26:20 - well so that's obviously my priority
26:22 - and
26:23 - um
26:24 - and and yeah i started just focusing on
26:26 - my my mental health and my personal
26:27 - well-being and my career as compared to
26:30 - other people because
26:32 - i did not have a canal when i was in
26:34 - college so why do you need one
26:36 - uh if that makes sense right um i see
26:41 - all these amazing people who are getting
26:43 - jobs and students contributing to open
26:45 - source going to events around the world
26:48 - they're not watching my content why
26:50 - can't you do it then right and
26:52 - this is what bugs me with most content
26:54 - creators they're like oh follow me and
26:56 - i'm i will help you or whatever
26:59 - i am saying don't be dependent on me
27:01 - leave me alone i'm very busy
27:03 - if you have a question go join a
27:05 - community or
27:10 - join a community based on whatever tech
27:11 - stack you like ask questions in public
27:13 - or whatever so in the end i'm helping
27:15 - you only by making you realize that you
27:17 - don't need to be dependent on one person
27:20 - i know my course is amazing i know it's
27:22 - the best
27:23 - but i i also need to prioritize my
27:25 - health
27:26 - having said that i'll complete it don't
27:28 - worry because i need subscribers as well
27:30 - and i know once i create complete the
27:32 - dsa bootcamp and machine learning i'll
27:34 - cross a million very soon
27:36 - so i obviously want a million
27:38 - subscribers on youtube
27:40 - so i'll complete it don't worry
27:44 - yeah you know i totally relate
27:47 - to that
27:48 - especially with like data structures and
27:50 - algorithms you know i made a bunch of
27:52 - videos on those it takes a lot of time
27:54 - to make each one of time
27:56 - yeah and
27:58 - sometimes i think people don't realize
28:00 - how much work it takes you know just
28:01 - like preparing editing the video
28:04 - recording all of that
28:06 - it's like now that i've graduated there
28:08 - are two communities i can focus on one
28:11 - is the student community
28:13 - and one is the more professional
28:14 - community
28:15 - so my experience with the
28:18 - student community outside india like in
28:20 - the mls fellowship i had
28:22 - i was a pod leader in the mls fellowship
28:23 - for the facebook's production
28:24 - engineering track so i mentored students
28:29 - who are in the u.s time zone
28:32 - some of the best students i've met in my
28:34 - life
28:35 - i love them great people
28:37 - but whenever i interacted with someone
28:38 - who was here in india
28:41 - i don't i don't want to say i don't want
28:42 - to generalize it but it it's just not
28:45 - the quality is not there both in terms
28:46 - of the questions
28:48 - and the way people perceive it it's like
28:50 - so many
28:51 - toxicities here in the community you
28:53 - can't share about your salary people
28:55 - will look down on you you can't share
28:57 - about the good work you do in public
28:59 - people will think you're boasting on the
29:00 - other hand the same cultural difference
29:02 - outside india is like learn in public
29:05 - be open about it discuss your salary
29:08 - with your employer
29:09 - so that sort of like
29:11 - made me realize that okay why should i
29:13 - care
29:14 - if the community is so
29:16 - weird like i'm gonna focus more on
29:18 - things that reward me which is
29:20 - professionals
29:21 - so that's why i started cube world where
29:23 - i'm doing more and more devops content
29:25 - on my channel more and more devops
29:27 - related podcasts
29:28 - going to events like i'm speaking at
29:30 - devops world this year in florida
29:31 - container days i'm going to devops days
29:34 - in israel
29:35 - um kubecon
29:37 - um i was speaking at kct berlin so
29:42 - yeah that's sort of like my priority
29:43 - because i my priority for me is my
29:45 - career um
29:47 - and uh i'm helping the student community
29:49 - with um
29:50 - with the way i can like i'm giving you
29:52 - all funds for kubecon travel so we're
29:54 - having scholarship fun like we will be
29:56 - covering your flights and hotels so i'm
29:59 - doing that good community work um i'm
30:01 - coming up with a open source initiative
30:03 - like google summer of course sort of a
30:04 - thing that will help you
30:06 - i'm doing nice podcast nice devops
30:08 - related content so
30:10 - if i as a student can teach you these
30:12 - things and about these communities then
30:15 - can you as a student not consume this
30:16 - content
30:18 - um but again you are not missing out on
30:20 - anything because i am not the end of the
30:22 - world please stop thinking like that get
30:25 - involved in communities and you will get
30:26 - all your answers don't be dependent on
30:28 - me
30:29 - you can consume the content that i'm
30:30 - posting but you are in no place to
30:32 - request
30:35 - no to totally get there and i think
30:38 - it's good that you're prioritizing
30:40 - yourself but at the same time you know
30:42 - you're you're doing your best to help
30:44 - students and hopefully this you know
30:45 - this live stream is part of that
30:50 - yeah
30:53 - okay uh so another common question i got
30:56 - for you you know from twitter is
30:59 - how do you motivate yourself because you
31:01 - know there's there's a lot of stuff
31:02 - going on
31:03 - yeah
31:05 - um motivate doesn't
31:06 - like uh how do you motivate yourself to
31:09 - do like all this open source work and
31:12 - kind of you know your job at the same
31:14 - time
31:15 - college work all of that yeah college is
31:18 - over
31:19 - thankfully um
31:23 - motivation with me comes with um
31:27 - i'm not a huge believer in motivation um
31:29 - and it does not mean you should not be
31:31 - okay it's a very individual person thing
31:34 - so don't take my word for that um
31:37 - i'm i mostly focus on action items
31:40 - starting from my freshman year i had
31:43 - i had a notes list in that i divided i
31:46 - created eight columns first time second
31:48 - sims hurts them till eight sim and then
31:50 - in every column i listed down some goals
31:53 - um
31:54 - and then i sort of like
31:56 - uh wanted to make sure i'm on the right
31:58 - track so i took guidance from people who
32:01 - are active in the global community
32:03 - also in india there's a lot of
32:04 - discrimination so i sort of like
32:06 - identified those discriminations and
32:09 - was away from it like okay i don't want
32:11 - to do that
32:12 - um
32:15 - and then with the motivation part it's
32:16 - just like you know um
32:18 - as a student i needed a job you know
32:21 - needed to pay my bills
32:23 - uh have a good life travel around the
32:25 - world to do things i like and and stuff
32:28 - like that so that's what sort of like
32:29 - the motivation for me like okay i need a
32:31 - career i need to support my family or
32:33 - whatever
32:34 - it has been amazing journey and i owe it
32:36 - to open source and the people in the
32:39 - community who have like shared about the
32:42 - their experiences or whatever so
32:46 - you can call it motivation if you want
32:48 - but for me it was more like a plan
32:50 - um
32:52 - yeah
32:55 - yeah thank you for that um
32:58 - you know i think like making money is
33:00 - a big motivation for a lot of people
33:02 - because people need money right what
33:03 - yeah what's wrong with that
33:05 - yeah nothing wrong with that yeah
33:08 - it's it's so weird when people say when
33:10 - you say that i'm in for the money and
33:12 - then some people call you out oh you are
33:14 - in tech for money not good
33:16 - shut up
33:18 - it's totally fine if someone is doing
33:19 - that i to be quite frank money is not
33:21 - the priority for me i've turned down
33:23 - offers worth two hundred thousand us
33:24 - dollars and more
33:26 - um
33:27 - because i know that in case
33:30 - things don't work out with what i'm
33:31 - doing right now i'm i am capable all i
33:34 - need to do is send one message
33:36 - and i'll have a job
33:37 - um so i know that i'm capable so money
33:40 - is not always the driving factor if it
33:42 - is for you great for me it's second
33:43 - priority i mean the first priority right
33:45 - now is doing extraordinary things
33:47 - which is why startups
33:50 - nice
33:52 - uh by the way i think we have 14 minutes
33:55 - left
33:56 - um no worries yeah thank you you know
33:59 - really appreciate you being here again
34:01 - uh i see everyone in the chat thank you
34:03 - everyone for being here and hello
34:05 - everyone
34:07 - um yeah i think another common question
34:09 - i get is
34:11 - how do you go from doing open source
34:13 - work to getting a job from it or like
34:15 - how do you
34:16 - or is it even the right way to look at
34:19 - it or should you you know should people
34:21 - just like contribute to open source
34:23 - because it's something they can learn
34:24 - from and then not expect a job from it
34:28 - um
34:29 - i think if you're doing open source to
34:31 - get a job that's 100 fine and i
34:33 - recommend doing that um it's totally
34:35 - cool um there are many companies who
34:38 - offer full-time roles
34:39 - that you need
34:40 - like a full-time role is actually
34:42 - contributing to open source
34:43 - um even at sibo we do a lot of open
34:46 - source work uh collaborating with open
34:48 - source projects with the marketplace app
34:50 - um community collaborations business
34:52 - collaborations so open source is
34:55 - supporting businesses as well and if
34:57 - you're doing it to get a job or your aim
34:59 - is to get a job via open source as a
35:01 - student yeah you're on the right track
35:03 - go for it because there you have proof
35:05 - of work
35:06 - you know you have your code base online
35:07 - available you make connections so most
35:10 - of the people who are contributing to
35:11 - open source obviously work at companies
35:14 - so they can refer you or they can hire
35:15 - you in your own company
35:17 - that's sort of like how i got an offer
35:19 - from red hat also i contributed to
35:20 - fabricate io and i got an offer um
35:25 - um from from red hat at the end of my
35:27 - sophomore year
35:28 - so they did not hire second year
35:30 - students but they made an exception for
35:32 - me i did not take that because i did the
35:34 - mls fellowship then
35:35 - but um
35:38 - but yeah um
35:40 - definitely you can get
35:42 - roles by open source especially remote
35:44 - rules as well because your proof of work
35:46 - matters quite a lot so to answer your
35:48 - question why okay yeah if you're doing
35:49 - it for jobs or internships yeah no
35:51 - worries
35:52 - keep up it keep it up
35:56 - cool um
35:59 - all right i think we're getting some
36:01 - questions about
36:03 - yeah let's do rapid fire
36:05 - yeah
36:06 - um
36:07 - we're getting some questions about like
36:08 - content creation tips
36:10 - for beginners
36:12 - um
36:13 - yeah like how how do you how do you grow
36:15 - on twitter and youtube
36:20 - so twitter is um
36:23 - i think there's there's already a lot of
36:24 - content uh shout out to eddie francisco
36:27 - i have i've lost count on how many how
36:29 - many spaces and videos they have done on
36:32 - this particular topic
36:34 - so you can you can yk does twitter
36:36 - spaces yk has some threads
36:38 - uh on how to grow on twitter so we won't
36:40 - like bore you with that but
36:42 - um with youtube though um i gained zero
36:45 - to 100 in three months
36:47 - um
36:48 - i think for me it was word of mouth and
36:51 - it was because of my gestures course
36:55 - people were starting getting jobs after
36:57 - watching the videos and purely it was
37:00 - word of mouth
37:01 - to be more specific i utilized my
37:04 - my network linkedin
37:06 - twitter youtube like just posting really
37:10 - good content
37:12 - um i think if you post great content
37:15 - you would not have difficulty in growing
37:16 - on youtube definitely also if there's
37:19 - content out on something already you can
37:22 - still make content on that topic people
37:23 - don't watch what you do they watch how
37:25 - you do it
37:26 - there are
37:28 - i don't know 100 plus dsa courses on
37:30 - youtube and every day i get requests
37:32 - from please complete yours please
37:34 - complete yours um
37:36 - because people are addicted to the way
37:38 - that you teach
37:40 - at a particular point of time so be
37:41 - extremely good at what you do and
37:43 - second route is you don't have to be
37:45 - really good at what you do you can just
37:48 - do like share your experiences do
37:50 - podcasts or whatever
37:52 - um
37:53 - get some interesting people on your
37:55 - channel
37:55 - um non-code like if you don't code so
37:58 - like you know i don't code i can't teach
38:00 - does it mean i can't have a youtube
38:02 - channel no that's not true you can get
38:04 - other people on your channel
38:06 - uh they can share their experiences you
38:08 - can create value
38:09 - um
38:10 - yeah
38:11 - but just if you provide value you will
38:13 - grow that's a very simple
38:16 - statement yep um
38:19 - thanks for that and yeah i'll try to you
38:21 - know go through some some more questions
38:24 - and this one is
38:26 - how do you stay motivated while coding
38:32 - habit now
38:34 - like i like doing it so
38:36 - um i think if you enjoy something
38:40 - yeah
38:42 - i enjoy learning
38:44 - new things so i i was able to grasp a
38:46 - lot of
38:47 - fields um because i like like to learn
38:51 - yeah
38:53 - yeah i think uh it's it's important to
38:55 - find something you like to you know
38:58 - because when when this person says
39:00 - coding it's it could be anything
39:03 - could be anything
39:04 - yeah
39:06 - you know they might not like one aspect
39:08 - of coding but if they try something else
39:11 - they might like it so it's probably
39:12 - important to try different things
39:17 - yeah
39:18 - yeah
39:22 - um
39:23 - yeah so
39:25 - you know we've been going for like 40
39:27 - minutes how are you feeling
39:30 - yeah i'm feeling good we have
39:32 - eight more minutes so i'm happy to
39:33 - answer questions in the chat
39:36 - sure uh let me take this one
39:40 - what's uh developer advocate role like
39:43 - in general
39:45 - yeah
39:46 - i won't tell you like the definition
39:47 - part but
39:49 - um if you like
39:50 - if you like communities if you like like
39:52 - content creation if you like engaging
39:54 - with people
39:55 - uh you can get into a devel role
39:59 - it's it's
40:00 - it's not marketing that's the wrong term
40:04 - it's more like building
40:06 - connections
40:07 - and trust
40:08 - so there are two rules to develop
40:09 - advocacy one is the internal developer
40:12 - advocacy within your team and one is the
40:14 - outward developer advocacy you have to
40:15 - work with both um day to day load look
40:18 - something like you know maintaining open
40:20 - source projects uh documentation um
40:23 - going to events staffing the event booth
40:26 - um creating content um
40:28 - community feedback surveys
40:30 - um maintaining open source projects i
40:32 - mentioned mentioned that already um
40:35 - i think most developer advocates like at
40:37 - least in startups the the role is a
40:38 - little bit more like um
40:41 - it's not like just just dedicated at
40:43 - least at you know like cbo we have
40:45 - advocates who also do like other work
40:47 - like coding related like more more of
40:49 - the development related stuff they help
40:50 - but i'll help out
40:53 - in these things
40:54 - i haven't worked in a big tech company i
40:55 - don't know how that functions uh
40:58 - internally
40:59 - but uh startups give you much more
41:00 - flexibility so if you like you know um
41:03 - advocating about technology um demoing
41:06 - products um
41:08 - creating content documentation meant
41:10 - open source um
41:12 - yeah you can you can try a developer
41:14 - advocacy yeah
41:19 - all right uh let's just go to the next
41:21 - one
41:25 - how to get a remote job this is like a
41:27 - big question but yeah let's let's try it
41:31 - that's a good question um
41:35 - the first thing is you have to be
41:36 - skilled and because when you reach out
41:37 - to someone they will look at your
41:38 - profile they will ask you some questions
41:40 - or whatever so be skilled um
41:43 - have have something to showcase projects
41:46 - github personal portfolio whatever you
41:49 - want
41:50 - and then
41:52 - just reach out to people that's first
41:54 - step
41:55 - um in my case people will reach out to
41:57 - you if you do great things but
41:59 - don't take me into consideration because
42:01 - i i am like now
42:03 - popular like on social so you you get it
42:06 - you know
42:07 - you reach up if someone so many people
42:09 - know you and you've been active in the
42:11 - community you get roles and i'm i'm not
42:13 - denying that i've gotten quite a lot
42:15 - because of it um but for an app like a
42:17 - person who's not that active on socials
42:19 - um
42:21 - have a good portfolio at least a
42:22 - developer portfolio uh reach out to
42:24 - people um go to events and conferences
42:27 - their network with people check out the
42:29 - project boards
42:30 - many companies have their own project
42:31 - boards you can check that out apply
42:33 - directly from there if you find someone
42:35 - who works at that company you can take a
42:36 - referral
42:37 - and uh
42:39 - that's it yeah
42:43 - cool um that's pretty simple and yeah
42:46 - just wanted to quickly mention you know
42:48 - building a social media presence
42:50 - it's not that hard to be honest
42:54 - honestly anyone can do it so
42:56 - it's not that hard but
42:59 - yeah it's not that hard but
43:01 - over my course of college i found two
43:02 - people
43:03 - right two types of people one who are
43:05 - really good at social media and get jobs
43:07 - one who are really good at development
43:10 - and get jobs
43:11 - um
43:12 - both are good whatever works for you go
43:14 - ahead because as a student people would
43:16 - expect you to be open-minded and learn
43:19 - new things so you have that time to you
43:22 - know explore and build yourself
43:24 - but yeah
43:25 - always be up for trying new things
43:28 - yeah
43:29 - yeah personally i've done both so i i
43:31 - can definitely speak to that
43:36 - okay
43:36 - let's actually
43:39 - and do
43:40 - the last question
43:45 - okay i'm just looking for
43:46 - you know for the comment here but the
43:48 - question was uh how do you get better at
43:51 - reading other people's code faster
43:56 - it also depends on the the the other
43:58 - person
44:00 - to be quite frank
44:01 - um
44:02 - i remember there was a guy in the
44:04 - fellowship
44:05 - his variable names were like so big you
44:08 - read the variable name you would know
44:09 - what it does
44:11 - so i think i think just just practice
44:13 - you can review code um that would help
44:15 - you
44:16 - ask questions and
44:19 - just you know we can go we can do
44:20 - another session on code qualities and
44:22 - code reviews shout out to sema by the
44:24 - way matt he has some great content on
44:26 - code reviews
44:28 - um i did a session with him also on code
44:30 - reviews on my youtube channel actually
44:32 - so
44:33 - um you can check that out yeah
44:37 - yeah i i sort of have a quick comment
44:40 - about this
44:41 - you know it takes practice you know open
44:44 - source is a really good way to practice
44:46 - that
44:47 - it takes a lot of patience to you know
44:50 - sometimes you can just try different
44:52 - things like you know
44:54 - obviously clone your clone the repo try
44:57 - you know change different things to see
44:58 - what happens you can do those things but
45:01 - ultimately it's about like being patient
45:03 - reading sometimes you need to read line
45:05 - by line
45:06 - uh and you need to break things down you
45:08 - know you need to ask yourself like do
45:09 - you understand this line what about this
45:11 - line what about this line
45:13 - uh if you take it slowly you know people
45:14 - should be able to get it
45:17 - yeah couldn't agree more
45:20 - all right uh any last words
45:24 - um no just there are millions of
45:26 - developers in the world so everyone has
45:27 - a different roadmap so please stop
45:29 - asking questions like you know what's a
45:32 - road map just follow all the good all
45:35 - the good practices work hard you are
45:37 - very privileged that you work in tech or
45:38 - you are studying tech or you want to get
45:40 - a job in tech because
45:42 - there are so many opportunities you can
45:45 - you can get remote jobs you can join
45:47 - in-person jobs if you don't get a job
45:49 - you can have your own business you can
45:50 - freelance if you don't want a job
45:53 - there's so many things you can do if you
45:54 - just have the right skills
45:56 - so take advantage of it
45:58 - and good luck and ask questions in
46:01 - public leave me alone
46:04 - yeah i totally agree with that i think
46:06 - asking questions in public is kind of
46:08 - underrated you know especially on
46:10 - twitter you can just tweet a question
46:12 - tag a bunch of people and
46:14 - like even before you ask you can search
46:17 - on twitter too you know yeah obviously
46:19 - on twitter google youtube
46:21 - use all the search you can use and then
46:24 - you should be able to find something
46:25 - like before you you know like ask
46:27 - yourself
46:29 - yeah really yeah
