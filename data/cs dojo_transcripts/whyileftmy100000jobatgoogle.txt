00:01 - so I worked at Google in Montreux as a
00:04 - full-time software developer for about a
00:06 - year I like to work in there but then I
00:08 - decided to leave the company to focus on
00:11 - my YouTube channel instead when I told
00:13 - my friends about it some of them were
00:15 - like wow you're following your passion
00:17 - that's awesome
00:18 - but really that's not what I was doing I
00:21 - liked making YouTube videos for sure but
00:24 - I didn't quit my job just so that I
00:26 - could follow my passion if passion was
00:29 - what I was falling I would probably be
00:32 - pursuing stand-up comedy right now what
00:35 - I love comedy but when I left Google
00:37 - that's not what I started doing instead
00:40 - I was following this gap in the market I
00:43 - found so a little bit before I started
00:46 - working at Google I started my youtube
00:48 - channel called CS dojo which was mainly
00:51 - about software engineer job interviews
00:53 - it started growing fast and I got more
00:56 - than 100 thousand views and five
00:58 - thousand subscribers when I had only
01:00 - like 10 videos on the channel around the
01:02 - same time I also started coaching people
01:05 - on how to get through software
01:07 - engineering job interviews and they
01:08 - actually started paying me for it what I
01:11 - realized through this experience is that
01:13 - I was starting to feel the difference
01:15 - between what people wanted and what they
01:17 - were getting it was sort of like this
01:20 - gap in the market people wanted to see
01:22 - high-quality videos about software
01:24 - engineer interviews but they couldn't
01:26 - find them anywhere else that's why I was
01:28 - able to get that many views and
01:30 - subscribers some people also wanted
01:33 - someone to teach them how to get through
01:34 - software engineer interviews 101 but
01:37 - they couldn't find anyone else to do
01:39 - that easily and that's why they found me
01:41 - to help them because I was starting to
01:44 - feel this gap between what people wanted
01:46 - and what they were getting I was able to
01:49 - grow my YouTube channel really quickly
01:50 - and through my channel I was able to
01:53 - help thousands of people being able to
01:55 - help so many people actually just felt
01:58 - awesome and then I thought maybe if I
02:01 - focus on this full-time maybe I'll be
02:04 - able to help a lot more people a lot
02:06 - faster and that's why I left Google
02:09 - actually I'm making a lot less money now
02:12 - but it's just a
02:14 - amazing to be able to directly see the
02:16 - impact that I'm making on people's lives
02:18 - this was actually something that was
02:20 - sort of lacking in my engineering job
02:22 - even though working at Google was
02:24 - amazing
02:25 - so I'm not really sure how my channel is
02:28 - gonna go from here but I think there is
02:30 - still a lot more potential here and
02:32 - there's still a lot more people I can
02:34 - help out there somewhere you know I
02:36 - actually just feel really lucky to be
02:39 - able to directly touch so many people's
02:41 - lives and so I promise you I'm gonna
02:43 - keep doing this
02:44 - as long as possible so that I can help
02:46 - even more people okay I hope you enjoyed
02:49 - this video and hopefully I'll see you in
02:51 - the next one - Cheers
02:53 - and high-five
