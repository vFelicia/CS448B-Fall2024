00:00 - Hi everyone!
00:00 - In this video I'm gonna
00:02 - Give you an introduction to Recursion
00:04 - So in computer science, recursion is a way of solving
00:08 - a problem, by having a function calling itself
00:12 - To see how that works exactly
00:14 - let's take a look at a few examples here
00:16 - First of all, let's think about factorials, and let's just quickly
00:20 - review factorials here. If you're given a
00:23 - positive integer n, and n!
00:26 - is equal to n times n minus 1
00:29 - times n minus 2 times
00:32 - n minus 3 down to 3 times 2 times 1
00:35 - So I'm just gonna give you a few examples here
00:37 - Four factorial is equal to four times
00:40 - three times two times one
00:42 - which is equal to twenty four and
00:45 - two factiorial is equal to two times one
00:48 - which is two and one factorial is one
00:51 - and what about
00:53 - zero factorial? It's actually defined to be one
00:56 - and you might say why is that? But you know
00:59 - This (inaudible) is just how it is defined, and let's just
01:02 - say here, we're trying to write a function called
01:05 - let's say fact, which takes
01:08 - a positive integer or zero as its argument
01:12 - and return this n factorial. Now let's say
01:15 - we wanna write this function using Recursion
01:18 - How can we do that? To solve this problem
01:20 - or to write this function recursively
01:23 - we need to actually examine this equation and
01:26 - a little bit more detail. Okay so I brought that
01:29 - equation over here and like we saw earlier
01:32 - we have n factorial being equal
01:35 - to n times n minus one times n minus two
01:38 - and so on times three times two times one
01:41 - I want you to see this equation, I want you to look at
01:43 - this part following the first n
01:46 - you might notice that this part is
01:49 - equivalent to n minus one factorial
01:52 - and that might be more obvious if I write this separately here
01:55 - as n minus one factorial equals
01:58 - n minus one times n minus times and so on
02:01 - times three times two times one. So this whole thing
02:04 - is equivalent to this part
02:07 - so you might say "well we can rewrite n factorial
02:11 - as n times
02:14 - n minus one factorial", and that's good
02:16 - this new equation is mostly correct but it's not
02:20 - a complete definition of factorials. Let's see why
02:23 - Let's say if you plug(?) in two to n right here
02:27 - It works just fine because you'll get
02:30 - two factorial being equal to two
02:34 - times two minus one factorial which is
02:37 - one factorial and one factorial is one
02:40 - so two times one factorial is two and that's correct
02:43 - What if you plug in one here?
02:46 - It's still good because you'll get one factorial
02:49 - being equal to one times
02:53 - one minus one factorial which is zero factorial
02:56 - and zero factorial is one as we saw earlier
02:59 - so that's one
03:00 - and this is correct. But as soon as you plug in
03:03 - zero here, it breaks. Let's see how that works
03:07 - zero factorial is equal to zero
03:10 - here, right here
03:12 - times zero minus one factorial
03:14 - which is minus one factorial, and minus one factorial
03:18 - is not defined. So this defenition works
03:21 - only for n that is greater than
03:23 - or equal to one, but it doesn't work for zero
03:26 - so actually for this definition to be complete
03:29 - for factorials, we need to write n factorial
03:32 - as two separate cases
03:35 - so here we're gonna write n factorial is equal
03:38 - to n times n minus one factorial
03:41 - if n is greater than or equal to one
03:44 - and if that's not the case, or if
03:47 - n is equal to zero,
03:50 - n factorial is equal to one and
03:53 - this is actually a complete definition of
03:56 - all factorials for all positive integers
03:59 - and zero. So let's just quickly see how we can
04:02 - use this new definition of factorials
04:05 - to find the factorial of any positive integer
04:08 - Let's say three. So if you ask yourself
04:11 - What's three factorial? There's
04:14 - two ways of answering that question. The first one would be
04:16 - to use the old definition and then the second way
04:19 - would be to use this new definition. And let's
04:22 - use this new definition here because
04:25 - we're gonna use this new definition later to write a
04:28 - function using recursion as well
04:31 - So using this definition, we can
04:34 - ask ourselves, what's three factorial? Well three is
04:37 - greater or equal to one, so
04:40 - by definition this is equal
04:43 -  
04:46 -
