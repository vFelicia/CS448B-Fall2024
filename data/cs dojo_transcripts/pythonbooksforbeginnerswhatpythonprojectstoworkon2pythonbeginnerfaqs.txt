00:00 - hi everyone in this video I'm gonna
00:02 - serve two of the most frequently asked
00:04 - questions by Python beginners first of
00:07 - all do you have any book recommendations
00:09 - for Python beginners and the second
00:11 - question is what type of Python projects
00:13 - should I work on after learning the
00:15 - basics so first of all python books for
00:18 - beginners actually personally I haven't
00:20 - read a lot of books for Python so I
00:22 - decided to ask my Twitter and LinkedIn
00:25 - followers about this and they
00:27 - recommended three books automate the
00:29 - boring stuff with Python Python crash
00:31 - course and learn Python the hard way so
00:34 - the only one I've personally read out of
00:36 - these is learn Python the hard way I
00:39 - remember it's pretty good but it seems
00:42 - like with my followers actually automate
00:44 - the boring stuff with Python is more
00:46 - popular I'm actually not too sure about
00:48 - the other book Python crash course but
00:51 - it seems like it's pretty popular too
00:52 - and it has good ratings on Amazon I
00:55 - waste anyway if I were you I would try
00:58 - you know automate the boring stuff with
01:00 - Python first and then if you don't like
01:02 - it I would try the other two books okay
01:04 - the second question was what type of
01:06 - projects should I work on after learning
01:08 - the Python basics well there are a few
01:11 - options here first one is to work on a
01:14 - web app like a website with either
01:17 - Django or flask you need to actually
01:20 - learn HTML CSS and JavaScript to be able
01:24 - to do that and I actually don't have a
01:27 - lot of experience with you know either
01:29 - flask or Django
01:30 - but I've heard that for beginner it's
01:32 - much easier to use a flask than jungle
01:35 - because it has you know fewer components
01:37 - built in and it's easier to see how
01:39 - everything fits together with flask than
01:42 - with Django so if I were you I would
01:44 - start with flask when you're ready to
01:47 - you know start building something more
01:49 - serious then I would start learning
01:51 - Django after that and to learn all of
01:54 - those things I recommend video websites
01:56 - like plura site udemy YouTube and I've
02:00 - heard that for JavaScript in particular
02:02 - this website called free code camp is
02:04 - pretty good and it's free too
02:06 - okay the second option for a project is
02:09 - if you're interested in stuff like data
02:11 - science machine
02:12 - and their analysis you can start working
02:16 - on problems on this website called cargo
02:18 - so I've talked about you know how to
02:20 - learn these things in my video about
02:22 - what you can do with Python but
02:25 - basically the idea is if you want to
02:27 - learn machine learning you should start
02:29 - with a machine learning course by either
02:32 - Stanford or Celtic and afla you can
02:35 - start working on problems on this
02:37 - website called cargo for data analysis
02:39 - and data visualization I have an
02:42 - introduction video right here on YouTube
02:44 - and I also have a full course on the
02:47 - same topic on this website called pleura
02:49 - site now either of these options is
02:52 - pretty good you know making a web app or
02:55 - working on a machine learning project
02:57 - but the only thing is to do either of
02:59 - these projects you'll need to learn
03:01 - something extra either JavaScript or
03:04 - machine learning so you might say that's
03:06 - kind of too much well if that's the case
03:08 - there's another option you can either
03:11 - build a game with PI game or a simple
03:15 - desktop application with QT or TK intern
03:18 - now like I said in one of my previous
03:21 - videos Python is actually not the best
03:23 - language for either building games or
03:26 - desktop applications but I think it's
03:28 - good enough to build one of these if you
03:31 - just want to practice using you know
03:32 - Python so I've talked about a bunch of
03:34 - different things in my Python tutorial
03:36 - series like variables loops functions
03:39 - and objects and classes and if you just
03:42 - want a way to practice using these you
03:46 - know building games or desktop up okay
03:48 - so see it's just good enough and then
03:50 - later on you can just move on to
03:52 - something more practical like a web
03:55 - application or a machine learning
03:56 - project all right that's it for this
03:59 - video and on my previous video some
04:01 - people ask me about my vacation and I'm
04:04 - not on my vacation yet I'm going to be
04:07 - soon my flight is at the end of August
04:09 - so I'm planning to you know hopefully
04:11 - make a few more videos before them so
04:14 - that you know you guys have something to
04:15 - learn from while I'm away
04:17 - anyway think you guys always for
04:19 - watching my videos and I'll see you guys
04:21 - in the next one
