00:03 - asked me to make a video showing my
00:05 - apartment but I realized if I were to
00:07 - just do that it would be pretty short
00:09 - because my apartment is fairly small so
00:12 - instead I'm also going to show you guys
00:14 - some of my equipment and setup that are
00:16 - used for making YouTube videos just in
00:19 - case you guys are curious about that
00:20 - kind of stuff anyway let's get started

01:07 - I guess there's like nothing special
01:10 - here maybe except for my Google home I

02:04 - finally it's so pretty you look old
02:07 - yeah everything your old oh yeah let me
02:18 - see let me show you guys some of those
02:20 - things here so these are the whiteboard
02:22 - is I sometimes use like actually what I
02:24 - do is these white boys is like I put one
02:26 - of them like right here sort up on the
02:29 - wall and then tape it and then I just
02:31 - like do this and they film it I'm like
02:35 - what I feel me like only like this part
02:37 - of my body it looks like you know I'm
02:39 - just like standing instead of like this
02:43 - is the pen table I use for like you know
02:46 - writing on the screen like yeah so this
02:49 - is just USB that connects to my laptop
02:51 - and I just write oh mama it's me no way
02:54 - oh yeah so let me show you guys like my
02:57 - other rooms first and then you know
02:59 - we're gonna come back to my equipment so
03:02 - this is my bedroom actually I'm leaving
03:05 - here you know with my girlfriend so this
03:07 - is our bedroom the bathroom also pretty
03:10 - stun guard I feel like this place is
03:12 - like pretty old but for an old apartment
03:15 - you know it's not thought to that let's
03:17 - go back to my equipments so I guess I'm
03:20 - gonna show you guys a little bit about
03:21 - like how I make my videos just in case
03:24 - you guys are curious we are so this is
03:27 - my main camera
03:29 - it's like panasonic lumix it's a
03:33 - mirrorless camera if you guys
03:36 - so usually what I do is I felt like like
03:41 - running balls here and then I use this
03:44 - very little thing it's like a tripod
03:46 - that bends like that and then just the
03:50 - angle and then I see here so I basically
03:54 - like move this chair here and then sit
03:57 - here to shoot oh do you guys want to
03:59 - guess what the rent is yeah yeah 1 mm
04:05 - 2.8 oh wow
04:07 - 22 yeah it's actually 23 1500 by like
04:12 - it's 23 15 you furnished oh really yeah
04:17 - so like like this chair is mine like I
04:23 - got a crown that was what everything
04:26 - else is like what you know it was here
04:28 - yeah so I was popping camera the
04:30 - microphone I use so I think when you
04:33 - make like youtube videos the audio is
04:35 - like more important than video what I
04:38 - use is it's a transceiver thing so
04:42 - basically I have this thing and then I
04:44 - have like something else that goes in
04:46 - your into my pocket basically and then
04:49 - the audio goes from my microphone like
04:52 - right here to my transceiver to the
04:55 - other transceiver and then into the
04:57 - camera so some people like take video
05:00 - and audio separately but I like to like
05:03 - take them at the same time so I don't
05:04 - need to like sync them later you know
05:06 - it's it's easier to like have everything
05:08 - in one file so that that's like the like
05:11 - standard setup I use when I do like
05:15 - tutorials on my laptop I use my you know
05:18 - my pro and I use like this webcam it's
05:23 - at a Logitech webcam it's like 80 bucks
05:25 - but the quality is like really good I
05:28 - think up to like a hundred thousand
05:30 - subscribers you know I was only using
05:32 - this camera because you know I don't
05:34 - want to spend that much money but anyway
05:36 - like I miss
05:37 - this oh wow that's too much yeah this
05:41 - one like goes onto the table and they're
05:43 - just like talking so their microphone
05:45 - like this
05:46 - I see yes mr oh yeah one thing
05:53 - estimation is for editing the videos I
05:56 - use Final Cut Pro I'm not like super
05:59 - happy with it but you know that's what I
06:01 - know so that's what I use I use my
06:03 - macbook pro it's like a couple years old
06:05 - it's good for like post editing videos
06:07 - and Cody
06:09 - it's great usually like I just sit here
06:12 - for like so recently I got this like
06:15 - really cool sort of thing that goes with
06:18 - my laptop so usually it's like this way
06:21 - but I realize it's too low but then they
06:24 - gave me this thing that I kind of
06:26 - problems up the my book so it's
06:29 - basically like good it's a cool thing
06:31 - it's attached onto the laptop and then I
06:34 - can just like do this to use it as a
06:37 - laptop stack and like if I want to like
06:42 - crazy further I want I give this boosts
06:45 - man thing this one's like really small
06:48 - and then I'll be like I'm selling stuff
06:52 - yeah it's videos it's not supposed to
06:57 - buy lists but maybe I lost them haha
07:01 - yeah it is
07:03 - I've had it like for a couple of years
07:04 - and they just do this so like the setup
07:08 - usually looks like this you found when I
07:11 - like yeah when I edit or when I code and
07:15 - then like my back's 30 hurting recently
07:19 - like sometimes you
07:20 - like I said so much so I made this like
07:22 - really crappy a standing desk up so I
07:27 - just like yeah I feel like all of my
07:30 - setup is like pretty crappy and - yeah
07:36 - just like my roots down put it up and
07:44 - then just like put it here it's like
07:48 - it's super crappy but it works and then
07:52 - just do this this is way more stable
07:54 - than I thought it'd be
07:55 - yeah yeah yeah I thought I was gonna
08:00 - followed that it's actually pretty
08:02 - stable yeah so you were saying yeah it
08:05 - is actually interesting though you look
08:06 - candid right like I'm actually
08:08 - right-handed but for the mouse I really
08:13 - yeah like it's just like chopsticks
08:16 - NFL's top or you officer - I can - yeah
08:24 - that's a real new I am right-handed yeah
08:29 - no I like I do everything except for
08:32 - like they're bouncing really no I would
08:37 - show you but I don't have chopsticks I
08:39 - thought it was house yeah my friends
08:42 - think it's funny that I don't have Java
08:43 - C yeah I like forks and knives or five
08:48 - yeah so like you know certain has a soft
08:51 - conclusion you know I don't like to buy
08:54 - a lot of stuff and that's why I like I
08:56 - have a lot of crappy stuff like this
08:58 - it's definitely not a stir grumble but
09:01 - it works and it's cheap alright I guess
09:04 - I guess that's it oh I think I'm gonna
09:08 - put a link to like my FAQ page where I
09:11 - list all my equipment you know in case
09:13 - you guys want to buy any of those if you
09:16 - guys have any like topic requests for
