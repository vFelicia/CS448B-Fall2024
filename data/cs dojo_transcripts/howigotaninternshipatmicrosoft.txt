00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - when I was in university I did two
00:03 - separate internships at Microsoft the
00:05 - first one was a data science internship
00:07 - in San Francisco and the second one was
00:10 - a program manager internship in Redmond
00:13 - which is near Seattle in this video I'm
00:15 - going to focus on how I got my first
00:18 - internship there as a data scientist
00:20 - just in case you're not familiar with it
00:22 - data science is sort of a combination
00:24 - between computer science and statistics
00:27 - or their analysis but before I go into
00:30 - how I got the job I believe that there
00:32 - is a formula for getting a great job
00:34 - it's in the form of something plus
00:36 - something else the first one of these is
00:39 - skills the first thing I did for
00:42 - building my skill set for this
00:43 - particular data science position was I
00:45 - took a few programming courses they were
00:47 - on basic programming and data structures
00:50 - and algorithms using what I learned in
00:52 - those courses I eventually landed my
00:55 - first technical internship that one was
00:58 - as a software developer intern at a tiny
01:00 - startup in Tokyo when I was working
01:02 - there I also started working on some
01:04 - competitive math problems just for fun
01:07 - after that I took a few statistics
01:10 - courses because it was my major I also
01:12 - started learning machine learning on my
01:14 - own by taking an online course from
01:16 - California Institute of Technology
01:18 - which is also known as Celtic using what
01:21 - I learned from those courses I started
01:23 - working on a few machine learning
01:25 - projects using a website called cago so
01:28 - how did all of these come together when
01:30 - I applied for the data science position
01:32 - at Microsoft I believe what made me
01:34 - stand out was the combination of my
01:37 - statistics background my programming
01:39 - experience as well as the machine
01:41 - learning project I put on my resume it
01:43 - was probably rare for any other
01:45 - candidate to have a combination of all
01:47 - of those things at the same time on
01:49 - their resume and as for the interviews
01:52 - for this data science position in San
01:54 - Francisco there were two types of
01:56 - questions one of them was solving math
01:59 - problems some of these math problems
02:01 - were focused on probabilities while
02:03 - others were focused on other areas of
02:05 - math for example community X I was
02:08 - actually well prepared for this type of
02:10 - questions because of my experience with
02:13 - paedon if math problems which I
02:14 - mentioned earlier the other type of
02:16 - questions was statistics and their
02:19 - analysis related questions for these
02:21 - questions
02:22 - I found that taking a few statistics
02:23 - courses at my University and working on
02:26 - a few machine learning related personal
02:28 - projects was really helpful so the
02:30 - reason I worked on those particular
02:32 - skills was not just because I wanted to
02:35 - get a job in data science it was mostly
02:37 - because I genuinely enjoyed working on
02:40 - each of those projects I sort of knew
02:42 - that statistics would be useful for
02:44 - getting a job at some point somehow and
02:46 - I also knew that fundamental math skills
02:49 - are good to have because they're
02:51 - universally applicable but I didn't
02:53 - expect them to be useful in this
02:55 - specific way all right let's go back to
02:57 - the formula I mentioned earlier for
02:59 - getting a great job as I said earlier
03:01 - the formula is getting a great job is
03:04 - equal to skills plus something else in
03:08 - my opinion this something else is
03:10 - connections so right before I applied to
03:13 - the data science position I was actually
03:15 - trying to start a data science Club at
03:17 - my University
03:18 - so I was talking to a statistics
03:20 - professor about it and one day she told
03:23 - me about an event in which a speaker
03:25 - from Microsoft would talk about how data
03:27 - science and statistics were being used
03:29 - there so I went to the event and
03:31 - afterwards I asked the speaker there if
03:34 - Microsoft was hiring any data science
03:36 - interns he said yes so I sent him my
03:39 - resume later and that's how I got an
03:41 - interview with them just like how I
03:43 - built my skills the reason I wanted to
03:45 - start at there a science club wasn't
03:47 - just because I wanted to put it on my
03:49 - resume or because I wanted to build
03:51 - connections so I could get a job one day
03:53 - it was just because it was something I
03:55 - wanted to do because I found a
03:57 - meaningful so what's a key takeaway here
03:59 - first of all I believe that a
04:02 - combination of formal education
04:04 - practical experience and personal
04:06 - projects can be really powerful in my
04:09 - particular case taking a few statistics
04:11 - courses at my university having done one
04:14 - programing internship and working on
04:17 - math and machine learning personal
04:19 - projects all contributed to eventually
04:21 - getting my first internship at Microsoft
04:23 - and the second takeaway from my personal
04:26 - experience
04:26 - is that I think you should build your
04:28 - skills and connections in a way you
04:31 - enjoy the process a lot if you enjoy the
04:33 - process you will want to spend more time
04:35 - on those things so it should become
04:38 - easier for you to build those skills and
04:40 - connections all right that's all I have
04:48 - for this video good luck guys on getting
04:50 - your next job or internship and if you
