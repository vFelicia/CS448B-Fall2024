00:00 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:02 - to use dictionaries in Python you can
00:04 - think of a dictionary in Python as sort
00:07 - of like a lookup table just as an
00:09 - example let's say you have this table of
00:12 - information this table indicates that
00:14 - George is 24 years old
00:16 - tom is 32 years old and Jenny is 16 or
00:21 - in general there's the value of 24 with
00:26 - the key George the string and the value
00:29 - that's associated with the key Tom the
00:32 - string is 32 these are sometimes called
00:36 - key value pairs because we have a bunch
00:39 - of keys and a value associated with each
00:43 - of those keys and you can use a
00:46 - dictionary to store this kind of
00:48 - information so let's see how we can do
00:50 - that in Python code to create a new
00:53 - dictionary you can write the following D
00:56 - equals curly brackets and when you run
00:59 - this cell this defines a new dictionary
01:02 - that's empty so it doesn't have any keys
01:05 - or values yet and it assigns that
01:08 - dictionary to the new variable D another
01:11 - way to write the same thing is to write
01:14 - D equals dict parentheses and it would
01:18 - do exactly the same thing but let's go
01:20 - with curly brackets for now and actually
01:23 - you could also write this so that it has
01:25 - some predefined keys and values as well
01:28 - so for that you can write D equals curly
01:31 - brackets double quotes George : 24 comma
01:36 - double quotes Tom : 32 and this defines
01:40 - a new dictionary with the value 24
01:43 - that's associated with the key George
01:45 - and the value is 32 that's associated
01:48 - with the key Tom but let's go with the
01:50 - first one for now to define an empty
01:52 - dictionary after defining an empty
01:55 - dictionary you can add a key value pair
01:57 - like so these square brackets double
02:01 - quotes George equals 24 this says add a
02:06 - new key value pair where the key is
02:08 - George and the value is 24 we can
02:13 - more pairs by writing for example D
02:16 - square brackets double quotes tom equals
02:19 - 32 and the square brackets Jenny
02:23 - equals 16 and now this dictionary has
02:27 - the three key value pairs and to find a
02:30 - value that's associated with a certain
02:32 - key for example George
02:33 - you can just write print the square
02:37 - brackets George and this will print out
02:39 - the value that's associated with the
02:42 - value George and then of course if you
02:44 - want to print out the value that's
02:46 - associated with the key Tom you can just
02:49 - write print these square brackets Tom
02:51 - and then it will print out 32 and if you
02:55 - try to look up a key that doesn't exist
02:58 - yet it's gonna give us an error for
03:01 - example if you do the scar brackets
03:03 - Alice it gives us this key error because
03:08 - the key Alice doesn't exist yet now as
03:11 - we saw the value that associated with
03:14 - Jenny was 16 but it's possible to change
03:18 - the value that's associated with a
03:20 - certain key after we already have that
03:23 - key value pair in the dictionary we can
03:26 - do that with just like before the square
03:29 - brackets Jenny
03:30 - equals 20 and once we run this cell now
03:34 - the value that's associated with Jenny
03:36 - is 20 now one thing to note here is that
03:40 - the values can be any type but the keys
03:44 - can only be certain types and there are
03:48 - different types we can use for that but
03:50 - most commonly keys are strings or
03:53 - numbers and in Python you can even mix
03:56 - different types of keys so for example
03:59 - you can add a new key let's say 10 with
04:04 - the value 102 this dictionary D with D
04:08 - square brackets 10 equals 100 and once
04:12 - we write print parentheses the square
04:15 - brackets 10 it works just fine
04:17 - retrieving the value 100 now what if we
04:20 - want it to iterate over key value pairs
04:23 - in the given dictionary for example this
04:26 - one D
04:27 - let's pretend for a second that we don't
04:29 - know how to do that and of course if we
04:31 - don't know how to do something like that
04:33 - the first thing we should do is we
04:34 - should just use Google and I'm gonna
04:37 - show you how I would go about it and for
04:41 - that I might write something like how to
04:43 - iterate over key value pairs dictionary
04:49 - Python let's take a look at the first
04:53 - result
04:54 - this one right here from Stack Overflow
04:56 - and just be careful because this one is
04:58 - a little bit old
04:59 - it's from 2010 but it might be okay and
05:02 - you can see that this question is about
05:05 - a dictionary and then a for loop here so
05:08 - I would just skim through this page and
05:10 - then I would try to find what I'm
05:12 - looking for which is something about
05:15 - Python 3 probably so it says for Python
05:18 - 3 points X we're using Python 3 by the
05:21 - way it looks like we might be able to
05:24 - use four key comma value in d items and
05:28 - it looks like this D is the dictionary
05:31 - so let's see if it works by copying this
05:34 - over here and let's try print key and
05:39 - then key without the double quotes and
05:42 - then the same thing with the value it's
05:46 - a print value and then value and once we
05:49 - run this cell we see key is George and
05:54 - then the value that's associated with it
05:56 - is 24 and to make this look a little
06:01 - nicer let's add colons here and let's
06:04 - add an empty line here by adding an
06:07 - empty string here with the print
06:09 - function and when we run this cell again
06:14 - it looks much nicer so value is 24 for
06:19 - the key George and the value that's
06:22 - associated with Tom is 32 Jennie 20 and
06:25 - the value that's associated with the key
06:28 - 10 is 100 so it looks like this method
06:31 - works okay and that's the basics of how
06:34 - to use dictionaries in Python and
06:36 - actually the ability to use Google just
06:39 - like I did
06:40 - to find what you're looking for when you
06:43 - don't know how to do certain tasks is an
06:45 - important skill to have as a software
06:47 - developer as I talked about it in my
06:49 - last video so that's definitely
06:51 - something I would cultivate over time if
06:53 - you're just getting started with
06:54 - programming anyway I will see you guys
06:56 - in the next video
