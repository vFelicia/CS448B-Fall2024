00:00 - so ever since I started this channel
00:01 - I've gotten a lot of questions about
00:03 - working at Google like what's he like to
00:06 - work there but I realized that if I were
00:08 - to talk about it from my own experience
00:10 - it would be a little bit outdated
00:11 - because I was only there upon till about
00:14 - two years ago so instead I decided to
00:17 - interview a friend of mine
00:18 - Jane Lew who is currently a software
00:20 - engineer at Google in this interview we
00:23 - talked about things like what's he like
00:25 - to work there her advice on getting a
00:28 - job at companies like Google and her
00:30 - experience of being a female software
00:32 - engineer in this male-dominated industry
00:35 - so here's the interview and I hope you
00:38 - enjoy all right so thanks so much for
00:43 - coming here thank you for having me yeah
00:45 - I appreciate it
00:46 - let's just get started with you know a
00:49 - basic question yeah so just could you
00:52 - introduce yourself for us yeah hi
00:55 - everyone I'm Jane and I'm a software
00:57 - engineer at Google in the Waterloo
00:59 - Kitchener office I've been at Google for
01:01 - a year now and I'm on the cloud
01:03 - healthcare team great so let's get
01:07 - started with your education okay so I
01:11 - understand that you were in the
01:12 - engineering science program at the
01:14 - University of Toronto okay no computer
01:16 - science yeah but eventually you got into
01:19 - coding you got your first coding
01:22 - internship yeah so how was what was that
01:24 - process like yeah so um so I guess I'll
01:28 - talk a little bit about what engineering
01:30 - science is about so this program is kind
01:33 - of like they want to give you two years
01:35 - of foundational studies and all sorts of
01:38 - engineering all different disciplines
01:40 - and after two years you can pick which
01:43 - option you want to go into so
01:45 - essentially you can pick electrical
01:47 - Computer Engineering and rural space
01:48 - civil engineering and stuff like that
01:50 - and for me after first year I wasn't
01:54 - completely sure which option I want to
01:56 - pick after two years but I was kind of
01:58 - narrowing down towards Electrical and
02:01 - Computer Engineering and I wanted to see
02:03 - if I couldn't get an internship just to
02:05 - see how it's actually like working as a
02:07 - software engineer and see if actually
02:09 - like it I want to pursue it for the rest
02:11 - of
02:12 - my studies so that's when I started to
02:14 - look around I was also thinking about
02:17 - moving to California for a little bit so
02:20 - that's when I started to look at
02:21 - software internship openings in
02:23 - California it just so happened that
02:26 - somewhat older in my program told me
02:28 - about engineering practicum program at
02:30 - Google it's basically a software
02:33 - internship geared towards first and
02:34 - second year students at universities and
02:36 - I was told that it's not really expected
02:39 - that you have a lot of coding experience
02:41 - or know so many data structures to get
02:44 - into engineering practicum so that's
02:47 - when I just applied and I want to take
02:49 - my chance at it and I mean obviously
02:51 - after I got the interview and I spent a
02:53 - lot of time studying for the interviews
02:56 - but in the end I got it and that was my
02:59 - first engineering internship the Google
03:02 - one yeah right like how did you study
03:05 - for me it was a combination of cracking
03:09 - the coding interview and also just
03:12 - talking to a pupper years a lot of
03:15 - people in my program already had a lot
03:17 - of interviewing experience with big
03:19 - companies so they kind of told me what
03:21 - are the common type of questions and
03:23 - what what are usually the data
03:24 - structures and algorithms they will ask
03:26 - you and interviews especially I
03:28 - introduced with like first and second
03:29 - year students and that's mostly how I
03:32 - got my practice cool and so eventually
03:37 - you went from just interning there to
03:40 - working there full-time
03:41 - mm-hm what was your transition like
03:43 - there um that's actually a pretty easy
03:46 - process usually I would say not just for
03:50 - Google for a lot of big companies once
03:52 - you've interned there especially if
03:54 - you've entered there multiple times as
03:56 - long as you've done well in your
03:58 - projects they are most likely to give
04:01 - you a return offer at the end of the
04:04 - internship so for my case actually I
04:07 - actually didn't even need to do
04:08 - additional interviews I got an offer for
04:12 - full-time position when I was in fourth
04:14 - year I did some comparisons between
04:17 - other companies but in the end I decided
04:19 - Google
04:20 - my fit so that's how I signed a full
04:23 - time offer at Google nice and what do
04:27 - you work on as a software developer at
04:29 - Google so I'm currently on the cloud
04:32 - healthcare team it's a pretty new tune
04:35 - so probably not a lot of you have heard
04:37 - of it basically we are building
04:39 - healthcare solutions on Google cloud
04:41 - platform
04:42 - usually we say googles mission is to
04:45 - organize the world's information and
04:48 - make it universally accessible and use
04:50 - useful for us but in particular it's
04:53 - more that we are organizing the world's
04:55 - healthcare information and make it
04:57 - accessible useful and most importantly
05:00 - secure I can't talk about a lot of the
05:03 - products that we're working on right now
05:04 - but some of the stuff that we've already
05:06 - made public include a fire API so that's
05:10 - for medical health records DICOM api so
05:13 - that's for medical imaging records and
05:15 - we also have like machine learning
05:17 - solutions for healthcare data and just a
05:19 - lot of stuff around that right so the
05:23 - idea is using Google cloud to store
05:26 - medical data or maybe do something with
05:29 - it yeah yeah so a lot of our mission is
05:31 - about data interoperability and also how
05:34 - to help patients and providers with
05:38 - their experience overall okay and could
05:43 - you tell us about what your
05:44 - day-in-the-life is like working there
05:47 - yeah
05:48 - I'm just a software engineer right now
05:50 - so my day in the left face pretty simple
05:53 - I would say so we have a free meals at
05:56 - Google as probably a lot of you know so
05:58 - I usually go in the morning and have
06:01 - breakfast and then I also get my morning
06:04 - coffee after that because we also have a
06:06 - barista bar at Google and then Wow I
06:10 - jerk my coffee I usually check my emails
06:13 - from last night because sometimes it's
06:14 - like you run things the day before you
06:16 - want to just check some updates coming
06:18 - from yesterday and then after that in
06:21 - the morning my team also has a daily
06:24 - stand up so during the standby usually
06:26 - everybody gives updates about what
06:28 - they've been working on and what they're
06:30 - planning to do
06:31 - next and then we should go to lunch
06:33 - together as a team and then in the
06:36 - afternoon that's where the bulk of
06:38 - working time is so it's mostly coding
06:40 - and then some team meetings or just
06:42 - project updates in general we also have
06:46 - a lot of like activities iGoogle so
06:49 - those are usually towards the end of the
06:51 - afternoon so we have a lot of Tech Talks
06:54 - hosted at Google Waterloo and we also
06:57 - have a weekly TGIF thank god it's almost
07:00 - Friday hosted towards the end of the
07:02 - afternoon on Thursdays where the whole
07:04 - office kind of get together and mingle
07:06 - and have some snacks and drinks and then
07:08 - afterwards I get dinner at Google that's
07:11 - that's my day iGoogle cool yeah so it
07:14 - sounds like you have like a lot of
07:16 - events happening but when do you
07:18 - actually get stuff done you know I think
07:22 - like as I said I usually a lot of the
07:25 - time in the afternoon is for you to get
07:28 - your work done and I would say like
07:31 - everyone at Google is really mindful
07:33 - about how they spend their time at those
07:36 - events so like for myself particularly
07:39 - if I'm really really busy with something
07:41 - then I just I would skip those events
07:43 - just so I can get my work done but then
07:46 - if the progress at work is a little bit
07:48 - slower then I would look up like is
07:49 - there any workshops that I want to do or
07:51 - is there anything I want to learn and
07:53 - that's when I would participate a little
07:55 - more on those things nice so you're
07:59 - being working there for one year two
08:01 - years now one year one year yeah so like
08:05 - after working there for one year do you
08:08 - have like any long-term goals there that
08:11 - you want to achieve like either at
08:12 - Google or maybe somewhere else I have to
08:15 - say I haven't really thought about that
08:17 - a lot I think for me as a pretty junior
08:20 - software developer I'd obviously want to
08:23 - spend more time learning different
08:24 - technologies and getting to know our
08:27 - codebase better and then later on I hope
08:30 - that in a few years I will be able to I
08:33 - guess take projects of bigger scope and
08:35 - design things at a bigger scale so I
08:38 - guess that will be my short term goal
08:40 - nice and what's your favorite part of
08:44 - working at Google I would say my
08:47 - favorite part is the culture I go I
08:50 - think it probably sounds really cliche
08:52 - to a lot of people but that's actually
08:53 - one of the big reasons why I picked to
08:55 - go back to Google for full time I just
08:59 - think in general everyone on Google is
09:00 - like super respectful and just the whole
09:03 - environment just feels very inclusive to
09:06 - me I feel like even if you do feel like
09:09 - there's any aggression Network or
09:11 - anything like that there's like so many
09:14 - channels where you can like voice your
09:16 - concerns and get your help that's my
09:19 - purse that's been my personal experience
09:21 - and that's just something that I really
09:23 - like how does it compare working at
09:28 - Google versus working at other companies
09:31 - like I don't really have that much
09:34 - experience working at other companies
09:36 - but as you said I interned at Intel
09:39 - before but it was actually altaira
09:41 - when I was there and then it was
09:43 - acquired by Intel while I was there for
09:45 - the internship so those two are actually
09:48 - kind of hard to compare because altaira
09:51 - was a pretty hardware focused company
09:54 - it's an FPGA company whereas Google is
09:56 - like pretty software centric so that's
09:59 - one of the differences um I feel like at
10:01 - Google because everything is focused
10:03 - around software people like move faster
10:06 - and projects move a little faster
10:08 - because you know it's just coding right
10:10 - but then at companies and Intel sorry
10:13 - I'll Terra when I was working there it
10:16 - was more like because a lot of things
10:18 - are centered around their fpga rollout
10:20 - and stuff like that things move a little
10:23 - slower and then all the software's have
10:25 - to kind of move around or hardware
10:27 - progress another small thing that I also
10:30 - noticed is that I feel like people in
10:32 - the software industry and also
10:34 - particularly at Google move around a lot
10:37 - so then you see a lot of I guess young
10:39 - faces and then a lot of people have them
10:42 - being a Google for that long whereas at
10:44 - Altera and I would say probably a lot of
10:47 - other hardware companies people stay
10:48 - there for a lot longer so you see like
10:51 - really senior people who have been there
10:53 - for
10:53 - a really long time so they really know
10:55 - what they're doing know they know like
10:56 - the software system inside out and stuff
10:58 - like that so that's another difference
11:01 - and I'm just kind of curious is there
11:05 - anything you don't like about working at
11:07 - Google I have to say there is nothing
11:12 - that would come to my mind right now I
11:14 - think overall I'm pretty happy with the
11:17 - working environment and projects and
11:19 - everything I mean that's why I'm still
11:21 - there I guess all right the next
11:26 - question is do you have any advice on
11:28 - getting a software developer job at
11:30 - companies like Google yeah
11:33 - so I would say my advice were probably
11:37 - more get be more geared towards people I
11:39 - guess seen universities still because I
11:41 - have anything out of university for that
11:43 - long but I feel like in general if you
11:46 - want to work at companies like Google
11:49 - after you graduate you would want to
11:52 - start looking at doing projects and kind
11:54 - of just demonstrate your skills and also
11:57 - learn more things while you're in
11:58 - university there's obviously a lot of
12:01 - ways that you can do this you can apply
12:04 - for internships like I did you can do
12:07 - side projects if you have any ideas you
12:10 - can also contribute to open source
12:12 - projects I think that's like a really
12:14 - big thing right now a lot of people are
12:15 - talking about it yeah and then also just
12:18 - if you if you have the option to take
12:20 - more software courses definitely do that
12:23 - and then try to do well in your course
12:25 - projects I think all of them will help
12:27 - you manage all that Google after you
12:29 - graduate okay and one thing that is sort
12:36 - of like hear about a lot you know about
12:39 - people working at companies like Google
12:41 - prestigious companies is they sometimes
12:44 - have a pollster syndrome
12:47 - have you had anything like that
12:49 - yeah of course I was there probably
12:51 - there's not that many people who haven't
12:53 - experienced it for me I guess in
12:56 - particular one thing that I always feel
12:59 - is that I feel like I haven't done
13:01 - enough or I just haven't produced enough
13:03 - results and stuff like that and I got
13:07 - like super anxious about it I guess
13:09 - earlier on when I first joined Google
13:12 - and then I started to talk to my manager
13:15 - and other people about it and then they
13:17 - sort of were giving me advice to view my
13:20 - work from technical perspective so for
13:22 - example I can ask other people what they
13:24 - think of my work I can ask my managers
13:27 - or peers for feedback and I can also
13:30 - just look at the progress of my project
13:32 - and compare to say our team team
13:36 - objectives or quarterly objectives and
13:38 - and then if you do it that way then you
13:40 - will have a more objective view of how
13:43 - you're doing turns your at work and then
13:45 - for me that's when I realized oh like
13:47 - I'm doing fine like I'm meeting all the
13:49 - objectives I'm meeting the dollar
13:50 - deadline so I'm doing fine so right now
13:54 - I'm feeling like less anxious now I'm
13:57 - pretty happy about the progress that I'm
13:59 - making so yeah all right and is there
14:05 - anything you can tell us about your
14:06 - experience of being a female software
14:09 - engineer in this male-dominated industry
14:12 - yeah so um I have to say my experience
14:15 - has been mostly positive I think I've
14:18 - been really fortunate to I guess even
14:21 - for my classing engineering science
14:23 - everyone was really supportive and then
14:25 - after I started to do internships and
14:28 - after I started working full-time at
14:30 - Google I feel like the environment is
14:32 - overall very inclusive and very
14:34 - supportive overall but I have to say
14:37 - there's definitely small aggressions
14:39 - that I experienced as a female software
14:41 - engineer so for example one of the
14:44 - things that I heard I really stuck with
14:46 - me was that when I got my first
14:48 - engineering practicum internship at
14:50 - Google some of my classmates told me I
14:54 - only got it because I was a girl at that
14:57 - time I didn't really think too much of
14:59 - them but the later I felt a little
15:01 - I heard about it but then again I
15:03 - started to look look at my I guess
15:06 - progress and skills from more technical
15:08 - perspective I know that I've been doing
15:11 - well at Google
15:12 - even when I was an intern so that was
15:14 - when I kind of shook it off and and know
15:16 - that I really deserves this okay so do
15:21 - you have any advice for other female
15:23 - software developers or maybe other
15:25 - minority groups yeah um so something
15:28 - that really helped me along the way is
15:30 - mentorship I think it really helps a lot
15:32 - when you know that there's someone there
15:34 - who might have more experience than you
15:36 - in the software industry to give you
15:38 - advice or just tell you that they've
15:41 - been through the same thing when you
15:42 - when you're going through something
15:43 - difficult so I would say if you feel
15:46 - like you're I guess a more junior member
15:49 - in the industry and you need any sort of
15:51 - advice you should never hesitate to
15:53 - reach out who are the people you look up
15:55 - to or you think might know more than you
15:57 - and ask them what they think and ask
16:00 - them for advice just ask them if they
16:02 - can get coffee or something like that
16:03 - and I would say if you feel like you are
16:06 - a little more senior in the industry or
16:08 - in your class and you might know
16:11 - something that might help other people I
16:13 - would encourage you to kind of take the
16:15 - time and see if anyone else might need
16:19 - help or just need someone to talk to I
16:22 - think if everyone could do that then we
16:25 - would really be able to foster kind of
16:28 - like a really positive a feeling of
16:30 - community withing the minorities within
16:33 - the software industry all right so this
16:36 - is my last question for you do you have
16:38 - any general advice for people who want
16:40 - to get into this field of software
16:42 - engineering um I would say my advice is
16:44 - pretty similar to what I said about how
16:47 - you can land a job at Google after you
16:49 - graduate it will be that if you're
16:51 - interested in the software industry then
16:54 - you should definitely take the time to
16:56 - improve your skills maybe through going
16:59 - through cracking the coding interview or
17:01 - just learning about data structures and
17:03 - algorithms in general and then if you
17:05 - want to get some practice you should
17:07 - definitely take every chance you can get
17:09 - to do some side projects and
17:12 - to open-source projects and if you get
17:14 - internships definitely do those
17:16 - internships and yeah that will be
17:19 - married by think alike alright that's it
17:23 - for this interview and if you're looking
17:25 - for a software engineer job right now
17:27 - you should check out the sponsor of this
17:29 - video
17:29 - triple bite Superboy is I would say one
17:33 - of the most prominent and useful
17:35 - websites for getting a software engineer
17:37 - job in either San Francisco New York
17:39 - Seattle or Los Angeles the way it works
17:43 - is you take their skill assessment quiz
17:45 - once and once you pass it you'll be able
17:48 - to start having you know on-site
17:50 - interviews with a bunch of companies so
17:53 - basically it's a way to skip the phone
17:55 - screening phase altogether and the
17:58 - reason I decided to have them as a
18:00 - sponsor of this video is because first
18:03 - of all I already knew about them before
18:04 - they contacted me for this and secondly
18:07 - because it's actually something I would
18:09 - personally use if I was looking for a
18:10 - software engineer job right now and if
18:13 - you want to check them out please use my
18:15 - referral link CS dojo that IO slash
18:17 - triple just to let them know that you
18:19 - guys came from here and by the way it's
18:21 - completely free for you guys for the
18:23 - candidates because it's only paid for by
18:25 - the companies that hire the candidates
18:27 - anyway thank you as always for watching
18:30 - my videos and I'll see you guys in the
18:32 - next one
