00:00 - [Applause]
00:12 - hi everyone today I decided to take a
00:16 - break from my regular coding videos to
00:19 - make more of a blog type video instead
00:21 - and you know I want to really show you
00:23 - the process of how I go about solving
00:26 - problems usually and then I'm also going
00:29 - to this event later today where people
00:32 - will be pitching their startup ideas and
00:34 - I'll be pitching my startup idea to so
00:37 - hopefully I'll be able to talk about it
00:38 - later today anyway let's get started
00:40 - okay so first of all let me just quickly
00:43 - talk about what I've done so far this
00:44 - week to give you some context on what
00:47 - I'm working on basically I'm trying to
00:49 - set up Twitter integration for the web
00:52 - app I'm working on called edit dojo and
00:54 - I was working on the sign up with
00:56 - Twitter button yesterday and for that I
00:59 - found this tutorial it turns out to be
01:01 - pretty good so I basically you know
01:03 - followed everything and pretty much copy
01:05 - and paste it everything and then here's
01:08 - the result I have you have the sign up
01:10 - sign e button when you click it you go
01:13 - to Twitter and then you go back to my
01:15 - website and then it says welcome
01:17 - username and once a user signs up to my
01:21 - website using Twitter I want to be able
01:23 - to start interacting with that users
01:25 - Twitter account from my Twitter account
01:27 - edit dojo and I think the first step for
01:31 - doing that would be to make this account
01:33 - edit dojo
01:34 - follow them so that's what I'm gonna
01:36 - work on today and by the way whenever I
01:39 - start coding what I like doing is I like
01:42 - going into the accessibility settings
01:43 - and I just invert colors and then
01:47 - recently I started using greyscale on
01:49 - top of that too and the reason I do it
01:51 - is because this way my browser has a
01:54 - dark background and everything else like
01:57 - my terminal and my editor has a dark
02:00 - background too so throughout this video
02:02 - you might see a weird call our skiing
02:04 - from time to time but that's basically
02:06 - just the way I like it
02:07 - anyway I'm looking at the admin panel
02:10 - right now
02:11 - of my website and you know I'm looking
02:13 - at the user record and I see three users
02:15 - one of them YK dojo this is the one I
02:19 - created with my personal Twitter
02:20 - accounts and actually my personal
02:22 - Twitter account has the same handle so
02:25 - it looks like my twitter handle is
02:27 - automatically recorded as my username
02:29 - when I sign in so I guess what I'm gonna
02:33 - do here is I'm just gonna say whenever
02:36 - someone signs up for the first time I
02:38 - log into the edit dojo Twitter account
02:41 - you know just like I did in my Twitter
02:43 - bot tutorial and then I'll follow that
02:46 - user's account using the username
02:49 - obviously this is not gonna be the
02:51 - perfect solution because you know what
02:53 - if this user changes their user handle I
02:56 - mean their Twitter handle after signing
02:58 - up but I think this solution is good
03:00 - enough for now so I'll see if I can
03:03 - implement that okay so I did a little
03:05 - bit of thinking and right now what I'm
03:08 - trying to understand is what happens
03:10 - exactly when I click this sign up sign
03:12 - in button because all I did is you know
03:15 - I copy and paste it code from a tutorial
03:18 - and it looks like this is just applying
03:22 - link so let me show you some of the code
03:25 - the relevant part is just this one a
03:28 - provider login URL Twitter and if you
03:31 - look at the HTML snippet right here it's
03:34 - just a link and when you copy if you
03:38 - copy
03:39 - you know this link address and then put
03:42 - it in a new tab it just redirects to
03:46 - Twitter and then back to my website so I
03:50 - think I'm gonna look into you know
03:52 - exactly what happens when you go to this
03:55 - URL and then I'll say whatever happens
03:58 - there you know I'll add the part about
04:01 - following this user maybe before
04:04 - redirecting back to my website okay so I
04:08 - started reading the documentation of the
04:11 - library I'm using for this but I'm
04:14 - actually starting to think maybe I was
04:16 - thinking about it in the wrong way you
04:18 - know whatever happens when the user
04:21 - clicks signs in doesn't matter
04:24 - Octus it goes back to the URL that I
04:28 - specified in Twitter so maybe I can just
04:31 - create a special URL like slash you know
04:36 - say sign in and half Twitter you know
04:39 - redirect the browser back to this URL
04:42 - and then maybe I can make a view for
04:45 - this like a jungle view that handles the
04:48 - following and everything so let me look
04:51 - into that approach instead okay so I
04:54 - wanted to do some more coding today to
04:56 - solve that problem but unfortunately I
04:58 - actually need to get ready for the
05:01 - startup pitch contest thing I told you
05:03 - about earlier so I think I'm gonna do
05:05 - that now and I'll do more coding either
05:08 - later tonight or maybe tomorrow
05:12 - okay so before I go to this event let me
05:15 - tell you guys just a little bit about it
05:17 - apparently it's an event for Canadian
05:19 - newcomers to pitch their startup ideas
05:21 - and you know I'm a Canadian newcomer I'm
05:25 - a recent permanent resident in Canada
05:28 - and I have a startup idea so I was like
05:31 - you know why not give it a try and I
05:33 - wrote this little application explaining
05:35 - what my idea is and apparently I was
05:39 - selected as one of the 10 people to
05:41 - pitch their ideas today
05:43 - you know I just got that email earlier
05:44 - so yeah I was pretty excited okay the
05:50 - event is happening in 12 minutes and I
05:52 - have 15 minutes to get there I mean it's
05:55 - a 15-minute walk from here I think I'm
05:58 - gonna be fine
05:58 - also it's knowing it's pretty nice okay
06:03 - I just got here I think I'm a few
06:06 - minutes late but it's probably okay
06:07 - we'll see
06:12 - so I just noticed how Canadian this
06:15 - place is I mean there's the stage right
06:18 - there and there's hockey right here I
06:22 - mean how how much more Canadian could it
06:25 - get okay so the event started with a
06:29 - panel of entrepreneurs talking about how
06:31 - to start successful businesses in Canada
06:33 - and it turned out I was gonna be the
06:36 - first one to pitch so let me show you
06:38 - just a small part of my okay so the rest
06:59 - of the pitch was basically the same
07:01 - stuff as what I already explained on
07:03 - this channel basically you read stuff in
07:06 - Japanese if you're learning Japanese and
07:08 - Japanese native speakers are gonna fix
07:11 - it for you and then you're gonna have to
07:13 - fix other people's posts in English
07:15 - assuming that you're fluent in English
07:17 - anyway after my pitch nine other people
07:20 - pitched for example this guy was
07:22 - pitching a company that produces 360
07:25 - degree videos and after all that the
07:28 - judges went away to decide which five of
07:31 - us are going to win
07:33 - [Music]
07:40 - okay and it turned out the first winner
07:43 - was the 360 view guy and then he was the
07:51 - second winner and the third winner
07:53 - turned out to be this guy so at this
07:55 - point I'm thinking oh my god I'm
07:57 - actually not gonna win what am I gonna
07:59 - say to myself Carver's then this
08:02 - happened
08:02 - [Music]
08:07 - [Applause]
08:16 - [Applause]
08:20 - [Music]
08:23 - alright I'm done for the day I'm super
08:26 - tired but I'm happy that I won
08:29 - apparently there's gonna be like a free
08:31 - week of boot camp programs startup
08:34 - bootcamp programs but I don't know
08:36 - what's gonna happen exactly I'll
08:37 - probably talk more about it later on
08:39 - this channel okay so that was pretty fun
08:43 - but actually after that the last few
08:45 - days have been kind of slow
08:47 - partly because I needed to do some work
08:49 - for our first meetup in Toronto and this
08:52 - code server I recently set up for this
08:54 - channel but I'm back at coding today
08:57 - okay so I'm on Twitter's developer
09:00 - website now and I was looking at this
09:02 - section callback URL and it looks like
09:06 - it goes to this URL what I'm guessing
09:10 - what happens is when someone signs in
09:14 - with Twitter Twitter sends us back to
09:17 - that URL and then the library that I'm
09:20 - using for this purpose just handles that
09:23 - request so I guess I'll need to either
09:26 - you know do something with the library
09:28 - or maybe when the library sends us to
09:30 - this route URL
09:33 - maybe we can do something special with
09:35 - Django instead let me think about that
09:38 - for a second okay so I think that's what
09:40 - I'm gonna do you know whatever happens
09:43 - with the Twitter longing workflow what
09:46 - happens is eventually you know we go
09:48 - back to this root path and then it goes
09:51 - to the login view and in the login view
09:54 - we're just rendering this template
09:57 - logging that HTML so I guess what we can
09:59 - do is before we render that we'll say
10:03 - follow the user if the user is signed in
10:09 - and you know we haven't followed them
10:12 - yet and yeah that's pretty much all we
10:15 - need to do I think okay so I just
10:18 - searched for Django get user in a view
10:22 - because we need to be able to get the
10:24 - users info in our view and then I found
10:27 - Stack Overflow page and I found
10:31 - code snippets it looks like this is a
10:34 - view that takes a request and then to
10:37 - get the user it looks like all we need
10:40 - to do say is request that user and then
10:43 - to get the username we can do request
10:45 - that user that username so let me see if
10:48 - that works
10:57 - so I just got an error here let me just
11:00 - read the error here it says full object
11:02 - is not callable and then it looks like
11:06 - it's a line eight of you stop I end
11:10 - users so let me take a look at that okay
11:13 - so it's right there this is one of the
11:16 - lines I copied from Stack Overflow and I
11:19 - think what's happening is this is just a
11:23 - boolean or bull but we're trying to call
11:25 - it as if it's a function so if we just
11:28 - delete these parentheses hopefully it's
11:31 - gonna work
11:31 - let's see if that's the case all right
11:34 - so it's working what I did is I got you
11:38 - know our username with the code we saw
11:41 - earlier request that user that username
11:43 - and then I just put it in this variable
11:47 - called username and then I'm returning a
11:50 - response that says here's the name and
11:52 - then my username it looks like it's
11:55 - working
11:55 - so I've tested the part about retrieving
11:58 - the username now we just need to follow
12:00 - this account okay and I think the way
12:03 - I'm gonna do that part is I'm gonna you
12:06 - know show you the strategy I'm gonna use
12:08 - to go about it and then when I'm done
12:11 - with the code I'm gonna show you later
12:13 - so basically the idea is gonna be you
12:17 - know once the user is authenticated and
12:20 - once we retrieve the username we'll say
12:23 - log in to our special Twitter accounts
12:27 - at edit dojo and then follow this user
12:31 - at username from that account and I
12:35 - think at the end what we want to do is
12:37 - we want to be able to store some
12:39 - information about if we follow them
12:42 - already or not because if we follow them
12:45 - already you know we don't have to follow
12:46 - them again but maybe we'll implement
12:48 - that later we might not need to do that
12:51 - right now so I will say later store some
12:55 - info about if we already follow them
13:00 - corner
13:01 - and actually logging in to edit dojo and
13:04 - following someone that should be easy
13:06 - because I already made a tutorial on
13:07 - that so I'm just gonna use my
13:10 - open-source code right here for my
13:13 - Twitter bots here what I did is I log it
13:16 - into edit dojo and then I tweet it at
13:19 - someone so I think what I'm gonna do is
13:21 - I'm gonna test you know this part of the
13:23 - code by tweeting at username and then
13:26 - later I'm gonna change that part of the
13:28 - code and you know just a little bit to
13:30 - follow them instead ok so let's get to
13:33 - coding
13:40 - [Music]
13:42 - okay so it looks like sending a tweet
13:45 - works here I just said at you know my
13:48 - personal account testing this tweet one
13:51 - so that part is this line of the code
13:55 - API that updated status I'm just gonna
13:57 - look for you know the equivalent
13:59 - function for following instead so it
14:06 - looks like it's this function API dot
14:08 - create friendship let me see if that
14:11 - works so I'm gonna replace update status
14:14 - here with create friendship and then
14:17 - maybe it's just gonna be username here
14:20 - let's try that I'm gonna refresh our
14:24 - home page here it looks like I got
14:26 - nowhere so let's go to Twitter and then
14:30 - refresh Twitter Oh actually I was
14:32 - already following myself
14:34 - so let me unfollow myself make sure I'm
14:38 - not following my personal account
14:40 - anymore and let me do the same thing
14:42 - again no errors and when I go to Firefox
14:46 - yeah I see it
14:47 - it looks like this script is working now
14:50 - so there are a few things I still need
14:52 - to clean up here I still need to take
14:54 - care of the case when the user is not
14:57 - logged in I think what I'm gonna do is
15:00 - return early if the user is not logged
15:03 - in you know like right here and then if
15:06 - the user is logged in then you know grab
15:08 - the username and do this thing you know
15:12 - right now all it does is just follow
15:14 - someone it doesn't do that much but you
15:17 - know hopefully I'll have more functions
15:19 - later so actually you know I think this
15:22 - is pretty much it for this video I'll
15:24 - put all this code and more at siesta
15:26 - io / edit as usual and actually you know
15:30 - vlogging and coding at the same time was
15:32 - kind of hard probably just partly
15:34 - because I'm not that used to it so
15:37 - hopefully I'll focus more on coding this
15:39 - weekend and maybe a little bit early
15:42 - next week and that for the next video
15:45 - I'll think of something else or you know
15:47 - I'll do another vlog I will think about
15:49 - that anyway thank you as always for
15:51 - watching my videos and oh by the way if
15:53 - you haven't
15:54 - our discord server you should join us
15:56 - and I'll see you guys in the next video
