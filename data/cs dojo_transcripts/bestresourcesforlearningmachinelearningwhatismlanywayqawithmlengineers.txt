00:00 - okay so the other day I hosted a meet-up
00:02 - right here in Toronto and in this meetup
00:05 - we had a Q&A session with machine
00:07 - learning engineers from this company
00:08 - called DISA it's a company that
00:10 - implements machine learning solutions
00:12 - for other companies including a bank and
00:14 - I thought this Q&A session was really
00:17 - informative but it was pretty long it
00:19 - was about 40 minutes long in total and
00:21 - the audio we got from the event wasn't
00:24 - the best I would say so I decided to
00:26 - give you a summarized version of the Q&A
00:28 - session in this video but just in case
00:30 - you want to watch the entire raw footage
00:32 - of this Q&A I'm gonna put a link to that
00:34 - in the description and if you want to
00:36 - sign up for future meetups in Toronto
00:39 - and maybe elsewhere I'm gonna put a link
00:41 - to sign up for that in the description
00:42 - below - okay so this Q&A session was
00:45 - with machine learning engineers Joe mark
00:48 - Helen Pippin Danny and Sachin and the
00:51 - first question I asked was what is
00:53 - machine learning exactly this is
00:55 - actually something I already talked
00:57 - about on this channel in my video about
00:59 - what can you do with Python but let me
01:01 - summarize their explanation here so
01:03 - machine learning is used when you can't
01:05 - explicitly write on the algorithm to
01:07 - solve a given problem an example of a
01:10 - problem like this is when you want to
01:12 - make a computer categorize images so
01:15 - let's say that you want your computer to
01:16 - understand that this picture contains a
01:19 - dog and this other picture contains a
01:21 - car you can solve this problem with
01:23 - machine learning by giving a machine
01:25 - learning algorithm a bunch of labeled
01:27 - examples and then a your machine
01:29 - learning algorithm which might be for
01:31 - example a neural network will learn to
01:33 - label new images into either dogs or
01:36 - course so that's basically what machine
01:38 - learning does it's a way for a computer
01:40 - to learn patterns from a bunch of
01:42 - examples anyway after that I asked them
01:45 - if they could share some interesting
01:46 - applications of machine learning
01:49 - one application Helen right there talked
01:51 - about is how some people have been
01:53 - trying to use machine learning to
01:55 - generate things like art poetry and
01:58 - music so I asked them how you would
02:01 - actually go about doing that and then
02:03 - Joe right there explained that for the
02:05 - example of poetry you can just take a
02:07 - bunch of poems you like and
02:09 - what's called a language model on those
02:11 - poems and then that language model will
02:14 - basically learn these statistical
02:16 - regularities in those poems and it will
02:19 - learn to generate similar new poems
02:21 - similar to the given ones so I asked
02:23 - them after that Pippin right there
02:35 - talked about how he applied machine
02:37 - learning to astronomy because that's
02:39 - what he's really interested in so he was
02:42 - basically trying to help astronomers
02:43 - find more supernovae in the space and
02:46 - right now it's mostly a manual process
02:48 - you know astronomers need to look at a
02:50 - lot of images to find supernovae and he
02:53 - saw that this is basically just a
02:55 - classification problem so in this
02:57 - problem you just need to classify each
02:59 - image into either containing a supernova
03:02 - or not containing a supernova and he
03:05 - told us that he was able to apply this
03:07 - relatively new technology called
03:09 - convolutional neural networks to solve
03:12 - this problem and this approach was
03:14 - actually better than the state of art
03:16 - method astronomers used to have them now
03:19 - another example mark right there shared
03:21 - with us was how they helped a bank with
03:24 - their credit card customers they
03:26 - basically built a model that would
03:28 - predict whose payments would be delayed
03:30 - based on the past customer information
03:32 - and they also built a model to predict
03:35 - if each customer would respond to a
03:38 - phone call to remind them to pay yeah
03:44 - that was an early client success for us
03:49 - mark said that model and Bank in
03:52 - particular was our flagship project and
03:54 - so that was very successful
03:56 - some of you okay and after that I asked
04:06 - them what are the best resources for
04:08 - learning machine learning and they
04:10 - recommended a few one is FASTA AI it's
04:13 - supposed to be a more of a hands-on
04:15 - practical course in particular
04:18 - I I recommend it to this audience
04:19 - because it targets people who are
04:22 - already coders and it's very well done
04:26 - it was developed by a guy named Jeremy
04:29 - Howard and also Rachel Thomas are both
04:32 - very interesting and very good teachers
04:36 - so please
04:38 - and then mark here recommended the
04:40 - machine learning course on Coursera by
04:42 - joining from staff board it's also a
04:45 - really popular course and apparently
04:46 - it's more theoretical and more
04:48 - mathematical than FAFSA AI another
04:51 - bookmark recommended is this online
04:53 - freely available book called neural
04:56 - networks and deep learning by physicists
04:58 - michael nielsen yeah I just really find
05:01 - his writing especially clear ok so those
05:04 - are some of the machine learning
05:05 - learning resources they recommend it but
05:08 - such an you right here took a slightly
05:10 - different approach for him he got
05:12 - started by learning statistics because
05:15 - machine learning is partially based on
05:17 - statistics and he didn't recommend any
05:19 - particular resources for that before
05:22 - stats I would personally recommend
05:23 - getting started with Khan Academy and
05:25 - Coursera and just go from there
05:28 - you know I would say the same thing for
05:29 - linear algebra too anyway after that Joe
05:32 - added this this is kind of two paths
05:35 - that people art argue for there's like a
05:38 - top-down approach to learning in the
05:40 - bottom-up approach to learning the
05:42 - top-down approach is start with
05:44 - practical things first start with how to
05:47 - do it and then get into the nitty-gritty
05:49 - of like what is the underlying
05:51 - mathematics and the bottom-up approaches
05:53 - start with them underlying mathematics
05:55 - and then work your way to the practical
05:57 - stuff if I had to guess I would say the
05:59 - top-down approach will work better on
06:02 - average for this audience but you have
06:05 - to try for yourself and see see what
06:07 - works and top-down approach being like
06:10 - fast thought is faster i bottom-up
06:13 - approach being like learning statistics
06:15 - and reading the deep learning book but
06:19 - you can good fellow or something like
06:20 - that ok so one thing they all
06:23 - recommended is working on a machine
06:24 - learning project so you can learn from
06:26 - the experience so I asked them how
06:29 - should people find a good much
06:30 - project to work on so that's Helens
06:44 - advice and I asked them how should
06:47 - people go about finding good datasets
06:49 - for that and they recommended a few
06:51 - resources for that like google's AI
06:53 - datasets and after the event they also
06:56 - sent me an article that lists good
06:58 - datasets for machine learning so i'm
07:01 - gonna put a link to that in the
07:02 - description below too but after that
07:04 - mark also said this for many projects
07:07 - you'll find there isn't a nicely curated
07:09 - data set if there's like something you
07:11 - want to do or build and you'll have to
07:13 - come up with creative ways of building
07:16 - yourself whether it's scraping scraping
07:19 - the web and then actually a few of them
07:23 - also recommended this website called
07:25 - cargo which is a machine learning
07:27 - competition websites personally I found
07:30 - that coming to be helpful for me to get
07:32 - started an initiative that also offered
07:34 - it's been a few hackathons data science
07:37 - related hackathons around Toronto place
07:40 - in the US and these places are good for
07:43 - talking to other people find in the
07:45 - field
07:45 - talking to leaders who are the field
07:47 - employees in the field other machine
07:49 - learning engineers and good scientist in
07:51 - the field
07:52 - and I say eventually okay goal is
07:57 - excellent but it only goes so far
07:58 - I think on a huge skill that machine
08:02 - learning years if you wanted to go into
08:03 - machine learning in industry you have
08:05 - this working with real life thing Cagle
08:09 - is not quite really right if you're
08:11 - interested and actually working I feel
08:13 - like a lot of nonprofits actually
08:20 - because they don't have in-house do
08:23 - science teams and so a good way to go
08:25 - about getting your hands on real data
08:27 - actually
08:41 - and it's just the other big French slow
08:45 - motion engineers anyway after those
08:50 - questions I let the audience ask
08:52 - questions one of the questions we got
08:55 - was why these are choose machine
08:56 - learning out of everything and here was
08:59 - Danny's answer and so I thought myself
09:01 - you know what something does I'm good at
09:06 - and that could be good at and then use
09:08 - my skill as well and that's something
09:10 - that I enjoyed and previewed like
09:12 - machine learning because and data
09:14 - science and when I got into it I found
09:16 - that it was using a lot of what I really
09:18 - really knew from physics you know it's
09:20 - about explaining the world in novel ways
09:23 - it's playing physical phenomena through
09:26 - mathematical algorithms and the power of
09:29 - your power machine learning that blew
09:31 - away predict traditional predictive
09:33 - classical analytics really drew me and
09:37 - so that's what I really found
09:38 - fascinating about and there's a lot of
09:40 - promise in the future also them loved
09:45 - another question we got was what
09:48 - language should you get started with if
09:50 - you're new to coding people recommend a
09:52 - Python he said that it's because there's
09:55 - a really strong open-source community
09:56 - with Python and that you know there are
09:59 - a lot of open source machine learning
10:00 - tools written in Python and recently
10:03 - there's also this really strong culture
10:05 - of sharing what you've been working on
10:07 - with machine learning and he said that
10:09 - that's really helpful - and the last
10:12 - question we got was what do you look for
10:14 - when you hire machine learning engineers
10:16 - one thing they mentioned is real world
10:19 - experience they look for someone who's
10:21 - actually put a machine learning model in
10:24 - production ideally and Mark said that
10:27 - they look for someone with real-world
10:28 - experience as opposed to just personal
10:31 - projects because there are a lot of
10:32 - challenges that come up when you try to
10:34 - apply machine learning to a real problem
10:36 - in the industry and then Joe also added
10:39 - this but personal projects still have a
10:42 - lot of value I think I think people
10:44 - actually underestimate the value of it
10:46 - it's worth way more than a certificate
10:50 - from a Coursera course or anything like
10:52 - that worth more even than
10:55 - the courses I would say if you do a hard
10:58 - project something that really pushes you
11:00 - and you write good clean code that you
11:04 - would be happy to share and you put it
11:05 - on github and you write a nice summary
11:07 - of that that will make you stand out
11:11 - more than the average engine alright so
11:14 - that wraps up this Q&A session again in
11:17 - the description you can find a link to
11:19 - the entire raw footage as well as a
11:21 - sign-up link for future meetups in
11:23 - Toronto and possibly in other cities
11:26 - I'm thinking maybe la San Francisco
11:29 - Vancouver maybe New York maybe I'm just
11:32 - dreaming here but we'll see by the way
11:35 - this is not a paid promotion but if
11:37 - you're looking for a job in machine
11:38 - learning I would totally recommend
11:39 - checking out this as career page because
11:41 - it seems like a pretty cool place to
11:43 - work out anyway thank you guys always
11:45 - for watching my videos and I'll see you
11:47 - guys in the next one
11:50 - I've never even taken a single cs4 SAS
11:52 - course University you don't need a
11:56 - soldier
