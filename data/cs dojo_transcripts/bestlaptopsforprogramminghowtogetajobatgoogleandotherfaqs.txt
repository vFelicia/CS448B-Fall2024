00:00 - hi everyone in this video I'm gonna
00:02 - answer some of the most frequently asked
00:04 - questions on this channel the questions
00:06 - I'm gonna answer today include what
00:08 - laptops should I get for programming do
00:11 - you have any advice on getting a
00:12 - software engineer job Google by the way
00:15 - the reason I get this question a lot is
00:16 - because I used to work there and how old
00:19 - are you so let's get started
00:21 - okay so first of all what laptops should
00:23 - you get for programming well to answer
00:26 - that question you know you need to first
00:27 - think about Mac versus Windows and in my
00:31 - opinion I don't think it matters that
00:33 - much which one you get you know it
00:35 - really depends on your budget and
00:37 - preferences and everything for me
00:39 - personally I like Mac more just because
00:42 - I think it's easier to use but I know
00:44 - that you know some other people like
00:46 - Windows more - and there's always on an
00:48 - option of running you know windows on a
00:50 - Mac or running Linux on a windows-based
00:54 - computer or a Mac based computer - so I
00:57 - think any one of those configurations is
00:59 - fine I think pretty much the only time
01:02 - you need to get a Mac and not Windows is
01:04 - when you want to develop iOS apps so
01:07 - most people use Xcode to develop iOS
01:10 - apps and it only works on Mac so if
01:13 - that's not the case for you I think
01:15 - getting either Mac or Windows is just
01:17 - fine
01:18 - now what about hardware well the
01:20 - criteria I would personally use is I
01:23 - would look for something that's light
01:25 - portable and affordable I'd also look
01:27 - for something that's you know built well
01:29 - enough so it doesn't break easily
01:31 - personally I recommend MacBook Air
01:34 - because you know it's super light and
01:35 - portable and it's fast enough for most
01:38 - situations I think the only thing with
01:40 - MacBook Air is that it's a little bit
01:43 - you know expensive it's about a thousand
01:45 - to twelve hundred US dollars when I
01:47 - checked it last time and when you're
01:50 - choosing a MacBook Air I think getting
01:52 - 128 gigabytes of storage is probably
01:55 - okay but you know it might be a little
01:57 - bit too tight so if we can afford it you
01:59 - should get the 256 gigabytes one now
02:02 - personally I actually don't use a
02:04 - MacBook Air I use a MacBook Pro and the
02:08 - reason I got this one is mostly because
02:10 - I wanted to do you know video and photo
02:12 - ed
02:13 - on this one because it has more
02:15 - resolution it's a little bit faster but
02:18 - I think for programming like for most
02:20 - situations MacBook Air is fast enough ok
02:23 - what if you're looking for a
02:24 - windows-based laptop instead well I'm
02:26 - not too familiar with windows-based
02:28 - laptops so I asked my Twitter and
02:30 - LinkedIn for Lords about this and they
02:32 - gave me three recommendations they are
02:35 - Lenovo ThinkPad series now that's about
02:38 - six hundred US dollars and up on Amazon
02:40 - and they'll XPS series that's about
02:43 - eight hundred US dollars and up and Asus
02:46 - Zenbook series which is about seven
02:49 - hundred US dollars and up another one
02:51 - that's also popular for programmers is
02:53 - Microsoft Surface book too but it's a
02:56 - lot more expensive it's about twelve
02:58 - hundred US dollars but what if you're
03:00 - looking for a cheaper laptop well I also
03:02 - asked my floors about this and I got two
03:05 - suggestions for this
03:06 - the first one is Lenovo ThinkPad 320
03:10 - which is about $400 on absalom and
03:12 - another solution I got is that you can
03:15 - just get a Chromebook and install Linux
03:18 - on it so this one I found is about two
03:21 - hundred dollars with four gigabytes of
03:23 - RAM on Amazon okay next question
03:25 - do you have any advice on getting a
03:28 - software engineer job at Google well yes
03:30 - and I actually wrote an entire article
03:33 - about this and in this article the
03:35 - argument I made is that there are six
03:37 - steps for getting a software engineer
03:39 - job not just at Google but also at other
03:42 - top tech companies like Facebook
03:45 - Microsoft and Amazon so the first three
03:49 - steps of these are something I already
03:51 - talked about on this channel in my video
03:53 - about how to learn to code basically
03:55 - learn to code if you haven't yet work on
03:58 - a few personal projects and then get
04:00 - your first programming job or internship
04:02 - and after that step number four is learn
04:05 - data structures and algorithms I have a
04:08 - series of seven videos on this topic on
04:10 - this channel and I also I also have
04:13 - another video about additional resources
04:15 - you can use to learn more on this topic
04:17 - so I'm going to put links to both of
04:19 - them in the description and step 5 is
04:22 - preparing for coding interviews
04:25 - basically just use
04:26 - sources like you know leak code and
04:28 - cracking the coding interview and then
04:30 - practice as much as possible ideally
04:32 - with your friends so you know do a lot
04:34 - of mock interviews with your friends and
04:36 - step six is apply I also have another
04:40 - video about you know four best ways to
04:42 - apply for software engineering jobs so
04:45 - I'm gonna put a link to that in the
04:46 - description too okay and there are a few
04:48 - common questions I get a lot about
04:50 - getting a job at Google and you know
04:52 - other top tech companies the first one
04:55 - is do I need to get a computer science
04:57 - degree well the short answer is no you
05:00 - know I don't have a computer science
05:01 - degree but I was still able to get a
05:03 - software engineer job there and the
05:05 - second question is do I need to go to a
05:07 - top university like you know MIT
05:09 - Stanford
05:10 - Carnegie Mellon etc well the short
05:13 - answer is no again you know it probably
05:14 - helps to go to one of those universities
05:16 - to get the initial phone screen
05:18 - interview but after that you know what
05:21 - matters a lot more is your performance
05:23 - your performance on the interview itself
05:25 - and the third question I get a lot is do
05:28 - I need to have a high GPA to get a job
05:30 - there well the short answer is no again
05:32 - you know again it probably helps a
05:34 - little bit for getting the initial
05:36 - interview but after that probably
05:38 - doesn't matter that much okay so when I
05:41 - list these things you know you might say
05:43 - what do I need then to get a job at
05:45 - Google well there are basically only
05:46 - three things that you need the first one
05:49 - is you know strong problem-solving and
05:51 - coding skills the second one is a solid
05:54 - base in computer science fundamentals
05:56 - including data structures and algorithms
05:58 - and the third one is you know
06:00 - interesting projects and interesting
06:02 - hopefully some work experience to show
06:05 - on your resume and you know that's
06:07 - basically all you need and you might say
06:09 - you know that's a little bit too
06:10 - simplistic but it's just true based on
06:13 - my personal experience and based on what
06:16 - I read out there okay the next question
06:19 - how old are you you know for me I kind
06:22 - of find it funny that I get this
06:24 - question a lot but I'm currently 26
06:27 - years old and you know if you're curious
06:30 - about my birthday there's actually a
06:32 - super easy way to remember it it's just
06:34 - 2 to the power of 10 yeah I know it's a
06:38 - little bit nerdy but just think
06:40 - case that's not nerdy enough for you you
06:42 - can just run this Python code to find my
06:45 - birthday okay that last question what's
06:48 - the best way to contact you well for me
06:51 - the best way is either Instagram or
06:53 - Twitter you know I do respond on my
06:56 - Facebook page sometimes when I get
06:58 - messages there but it's just a you know
07:00 - it's usually much easier for me to use
07:02 - Twitter and Instagram but actually I
07:05 - might not be able to respond to you know
07:07 - everything in the future just because
07:10 - I've been getting a lot of you know
07:11 - messages and tweets recently so on
07:14 - Instagram alone I have like 40 unread
07:17 - messages and you know I'm gonna do my
07:19 - best to respond to everything but it
07:21 - just might not be feasible in the future
07:23 - so actually to mitigate this issue a
07:25 - little bit I decided to set up a
07:27 - subreddit for you guys to you know sort
07:29 - of ask each other questions the idea I
07:32 - have for this is if you ask questions
07:34 - there and if I can answer them that's
07:37 - great but if I can't you know hopefully
07:39 - other people will be able to sort of
07:41 - jump in and then provide their own you
07:44 - know thoughts and answers I'm not sure
07:46 - how it's gonna go but hopefully you know
07:48 - this will be a place where people will
07:50 - be able to you know help each other with
07:52 - any programming related questions so I'm
07:55 - gonna put a link to that in the
07:56 - description just in case you wanna check
07:57 - it out okay that's it for this video and
08:00 - actually this video is probably gonna be
08:03 - my last video before my vacation you
08:06 - know like I said in some of my other
08:07 - videos I'm planning to travel in Japan
08:09 - for about one month and I'm planning to
08:12 - move to Toronto after that I'm also
08:15 - planning to you know make some travel
08:16 - videos while I'm in Japan which I'm
08:19 - gonna post on my other channel called
08:21 - here YK anyway thank you as always for
08:23 - watching my videos you know I really
08:26 - can't do this without you guys and I
08:28 - appreciate you know all the comments and
08:29 - messages I get okay I'll see you guys in
08:33 - the next video
