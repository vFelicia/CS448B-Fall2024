00:00 - hey everyone so as you might have seen
00:02 - in the video title I was sick for a bit
00:04 - and I was hospitalized for one week and
00:07 - I decided to make a video body for two
00:10 - reasons one is that I just wanted to
00:13 - give you a quick update on what's going
00:15 - on with my life just in case you were
00:17 - curious about why you know I haven't
00:19 - been uploading any videos recently and
00:21 - the second reason is that I felt like I
00:24 - learned a lot through this experience
00:25 - and I just wanted to share some of those
00:27 - lessons with you today okay so let me
00:30 - just quickly explain what happened
00:31 - exactly so about two weeks ago I had
00:34 - what I thought was just a cold you know
00:37 - I was just sneezing and coughing and
00:39 - stuff but then a few days later I
00:41 - started having these really bad vision
00:43 - problems I had this really bad double
00:46 - vision everywhere everything looked
00:49 - doubled you know that's why I have this
00:51 - eyepatch thing right now and then
00:54 - everything started looking blurry and I
00:56 - wouldn't be shaky and basically my eyes
01:00 - my eyes were fixed in a you know certain
01:03 - position and that's what I have right
01:05 - now - and then you know they didn't know
01:09 - what was going on at the beginning so I
01:11 - when I went to the hospital they I
01:13 - started doing some tests and it took
01:15 - them a few days to figure out what it
01:17 - was exactly but then they found that I
01:20 - have this rare condition called Miller
01:22 - feature so after they knew what it was I
01:25 - started getting treatment and after one
01:28 - week or so I was able to get out of
01:30 - hospital and come back home here and you
01:34 - know I'm gonna try to get back into my
01:37 - regular routines as much as possible so
01:39 - I can make videos again and you know
01:41 - start doing more coding again but
01:44 - unfortunately might take me a while to
01:46 - get back into that because apparently it
01:49 - takes most people with this condition at
01:51 - least two to three months to recover
01:54 - completely visual wise so I might be
01:58 - like a little bit you know slower than
02:00 - usual until my visions back to normal
02:03 - alright so that's my personal update but
02:07 - let me now quickly talk about some of
02:10 - the things I learned
02:11 - through this whole experience just in
02:13 - case you might find them useful too
02:15 - I'm just gonna share you know just three
02:17 - of them even though there were other
02:19 - ways since I learned to the first one of
02:21 - those is about not caring about small
02:23 - things you know I feel like I have this
02:25 - natural tendency to be sort of neurotic
02:28 - and you know worry about a lot of things
02:31 - one example is when I'm having a
02:34 - conversation or when I'm missing you
02:36 - someone I might say something and I
02:38 - might worry a lot about what the other
02:41 - person thinks or if I might you know
02:44 - offend them and stuff like that but then
02:47 - when I was at the hospital when I was
02:50 - going through a lot of distress I just
02:52 - couldn't care about those things because
02:54 - you know I was worrying about like am I
02:57 - gonna eat today and oh my god I be able
03:00 - to like have my vision back and am I
03:03 - gonna vomit or not today and stuff like
03:06 - that so when I thought about like those
03:08 - other things they just seemed so small
03:11 - and not that important and I feel like I
03:14 - brought some of that perspective back
03:16 - even now so when I think about like
03:19 - those small problems now I just think as
03:22 - long as I'm healthy as long as I have my
03:25 - vision still I'm happy with that
03:28 - and I realized that I don't have to
03:30 - worry about those you know small things
03:32 - anymore the second thing I learned is
03:34 - actually about a software development so
03:38 - when I started having this condition
03:39 - about two weeks ago my eye so it was
03:42 - like even worse than it is now you know
03:45 - like I said earlier a lot of double
03:47 - vision
03:47 - everything looks shaky and blurry and
03:50 - looking at anything was really hard and
03:53 - like even reading on the screen I
03:54 - couldn't do it properly so I started
03:57 - using this feature called voiceover on
03:59 - iphone let me just quickly show you what
04:02 - it's like first so once you turn on
04:04 - voiceover
04:05 - it starts reading everything on the
04:07 - screen that you touch
04:09 - so for example on the home screen you
04:11 - can basically touch the screen to you
04:13 - know try to find the app that you want
04:14 - to launch Google Maps Safari so gonna
04:18 - per page two and five a job done Forrest
04:22 - double tap to open and then once you
04:25 - find it you know in this case forest one
04:27 - of my favorite apps you can just do this
04:29 - to launch what's that forest double tap
04:34 - to open forest many BTN new and then in
04:40 - the app itself to you know I can just
04:42 - touch the screen to try to find the
04:44 - button and that I wanna click just like
04:54 - that so it's a good feature for anyone
04:57 - who's visually impaired or blind but it
05:00 - turned out not all apps support
05:02 - voiceover equally for example for
05:05 - messaging I personally found that you
05:08 - know I messages and Facebook Messenger
05:10 - are pretty pretty easy to use with
05:12 - voiceover and they support voiceover you
05:16 - know better than some of the other
05:18 - messaging apps for example slack or
05:21 - Instagram so I would say you know if
05:24 - you're ever in a position to develop an
05:26 - app or maybe a website I think it would
05:28 - be really great if you could take a
05:30 - moment to think about people like me and
05:32 - other people who have vision problems or
05:35 - other disability issues that make it
05:39 - harder for them to use your app and you
05:42 - know if you could think about like how
05:44 - to make your app as accessible as
05:46 - possible to as many people as possible I
05:49 - think there'll be a good thing all right
05:51 - the third and final lesson that I
05:54 - learned through this experience that I
05:56 - wanted to share today is about how
05:58 - important it is to have strong
06:00 - relationships I mean it's like a cliche
06:02 - but I really think it's true you know
06:06 - when I was at the hospital like I
06:08 - mentioned earlier I was going through a
06:10 - lot of emotional and physical distress
06:12 - and honestly I was having hard times
06:15 - like I cried a little bit and basically
06:21 - like it was really tough for me and what
06:24 - helped me get through was the fact that
06:27 - I had my girlfriend around you know she
06:30 - was visiting me a lot and helping me
06:32 - with like food and
06:34 - and the fact that I had friends come
06:37 - over sometimes and visit me in person or
06:41 - call me or message me to encourage me
06:43 - and you know that was like really
06:48 - helpful and you know who you are if
06:52 - you're one of those people I already
06:55 - thanked them but I want to thank them
06:57 - again here all right
07:00 - so that's all I wanted to talk about in
07:02 - this video thank y'all so always for
07:05 - watching my videos and by the way thank
07:07 - you for letting me hit 1 million
07:09 - subscribers this is like super exciting
07:12 - to me I thought I was gonna hit it you
07:16 - know at some point but I didn't think I
07:18 - was gonna hit you know this landmark so
07:21 - soon so I'm super psyched about that
07:25 - thank you
07:26 - it's like the population of Vancouver I
07:28 - guess my next goal is gonna be 1 million
07:32 - followers on Instagram and 10 million
07:36 - here on YouTube yeah I don't know if I
07:39 - can get there but I'll try my best
07:41 - anybody thank you so much and I'll see
