00:00 - so the other day I came across this news
00:02 - about an open source company called
00:04 - charm raising $6 million that surprised
00:08 - me for a few reasons as we'll get into
00:10 - them in a minute but luckily I had a
00:12 - chance to interview someone who was a
00:14 - key part of the whole process uh her
00:16 - name is Jay-Z to sort of demystify the
00:19 - whole process when I went through the
00:20 - recording of it I found that there's a
00:23 - lot of value information you know and
00:25 - practical tips that a lot of you should
00:27 - be able to learn from you know whether
00:29 - or not you're an Entre rur so that's why
00:31 - I decided to share the recording with
00:32 - you today I hope you will enjoy so jzz
00:36 - do you mind introducing yourself for
00:38 - everyone sure hello everyone I am Jay-Z
00:42 - I am the COO at charm and very excited
00:47 - to be here
00:48 - today cool right so let's step back a
00:51 - bit and let me ask you sure what is
00:55 - charm charm is an open- Source company
00:59 - we make
01:00 - tools that are modernizing the command
01:04 - line and making the command line a
01:06 - platform it's the easiest way that I can
01:09 - say it for those are interested in
01:11 - checking out we're all over GitHub uh
01:14 - some most popular libraries include
01:17 - bubble te which is an Elm architecture
01:19 - inspired tuy framework to gum which is
01:23 - an easy way to customize shell scripts
01:27 - your your bash scripts and V just which
01:30 - allows you to demo your Tooling in the
01:33 - command line cool my understanding is
01:37 - that you raised $6 million recently for
01:40 - a seed around for charm yes and that
01:43 - seems unusually large for a seat
01:47 - round how did you do
01:49 - that H so which part if we were to D
01:55 - more in details is it the number part
01:57 - you want to know about the journey the
01:59 - process
02:00 - what is most intriguing uh just a quick
02:02 - summary of the whole journey you know
02:05 - from I think where the journey where a
02:08 - charm started where you joined and then
02:11 - how you got here would be great okay all
02:13 - right the full story well let's see
02:16 - charm started at the end of
02:18 - 2019 by my wonderful co-founders Toby
02:22 - and Christian now at the time the three
02:25 - of us were at a long table that is not
02:29 - unlike this one in New York City side by
02:32 - side filling out paperwork I myself have
02:35 - a background of Serial entrepreneur and
02:38 - that's where I met Toby and Christian we
02:40 - were all at a series a company I was
02:42 - heading finance and operations Toby was
02:45 - the senior engineer and Christian was
02:48 - the creative director now after that
02:50 - company went through series a I was
02:53 - invited by the partners to be a VC so I
02:55 - ended up leading a bunch of deals and
02:58 - Toby and Christian and were at that
03:00 - table filling out incorporation docks
03:02 - for charm and where I come into play is
03:05 - I was there that day filling out the
03:08 - paperwork with him including you know
03:10 - kind of what compliance boxes to check
03:13 - I've done this for better for worse you
03:15 - know a lot of times and uh and I
03:18 - remember walking away that day just
03:20 - thinking wow anyone would be so lucky to
03:23 - work with such talented individuals I
03:26 - ended up having taking part in investing
03:29 - in the company in their earliest rounds
03:31 - at on my VC firm and fast forward year
03:34 - and a half later which was almost now 2
03:37 - years ago uh Toby had reached out and
03:40 - said hey uh we just crossed an open-
03:43 - Source Milestone I think at the time
03:44 - they just crossed 12,000 GitHub Stars
03:47 - which as you know YK is and those
03:49 - listening might know is is kind of a
03:51 - marquee Milestone and they said we've
03:53 - raised some funding the team right now
03:55 - is super technical we would love for you
03:58 - to join in and run the business
04:00 - and so I kind of thought about the pros
04:03 - and cons and you know I always I started
04:06 - my first company when I was 17 I'd
04:08 - always kind of had that entrepreneur bug
04:11 - I'd saw the other side of VCS how to
04:13 - lead deals what the fundraising Market
04:15 - looks like sitting on the other side
04:17 - looks like being a board member looks
04:19 - like how to negotiate
04:21 - terms and I took that leap of faith and
04:25 - I was like you know what if we're going
04:26 - to do this I want to do this with the
04:28 - right team build some interesting and
04:30 - certainly it's my first Dev tooling
04:33 - company you know I've always been in the
04:35 - consumer software business whether it's
04:37 - my own or those I've helped run and that
04:41 - was when I joined we had just crossed I
04:43 - think we shortly had celebrated
04:46 - 25k three months after I joined and very
04:50 - recently as YK you know we just crossed
04:53 - 90,000 GitHub Stars across our libraries
04:56 - which is something just to be very very
05:00 - grateful for for the community support
05:03 - um so fast forward that's kind of a
05:05 - little bit of background
05:06 - story fast forward um they had raised a
05:09 - seed round I joined a smaller seed round
05:12 - about 3 million and this past year and a
05:16 - half I will be completely transparent to
05:19 - those listing for those who are not in
05:22 - kind of the Silicon Valley or the
05:23 - startup Tech scene it's been a tough
05:26 - funding market and I think that kind of
05:28 - alludes to why K's question about like
05:30 - wow 6 milon is a lot yeah it's a lot you
05:33 - know it's a lot for where we are right
05:35 - now because of how tough the fundraising
05:37 - Market is um you know public equities
05:40 - have tanked and that kind of you know
05:42 - IPO markets haven't opened some people
05:44 - might have heard of but in the private
05:46 - Market especially early stage
05:48 - unfortunately startups are falling left
05:50 - and right and we were were startup
05:54 - funding company we at the beginning of
05:56 - the year end of last year we started to
05:59 - talk to to BCS and quite frankly you
06:02 - know W you you and I have talked about
06:04 - this there were a lot of NOS I want to
06:07 - be completely transparent it wasn't you
06:09 - know everyone sees a tech crunch article
06:11 - and you're like wow big figure big name
06:13 - and spoiler we uh it was Google's early
06:17 - stage AI fund that funded us called
06:19 - gradient Ventures and so people see the
06:21 - head headliner and they see the title
06:24 - and they're like oh my gosh like so easy
06:27 - for them like how they could they do it
06:29 - and we got a lot of Nos and so my my
06:33 - first tip for those who are trying to
06:35 - look for Venture funding um for those
06:38 - who want to be entrepreneurs and go
06:40 - through this route which is a chosen
06:42 - path it's not easy very Market
06:44 - conditional is you have to find the
06:46 - right investor and sometimes for some
06:50 - people that's two going through two
06:52 - investors and maybe the second one you
06:54 - you found the right one it's I mean it's
06:58 - cliche but it's like dating
07:00 - right sometimes you get 49 NOS sometimes
07:04 - you get 120 NOS right but also who cares
07:08 - how many NOS until you get to the yes
07:11 - and hopefully you get to the yes before
07:13 - you run out of money because that is a
07:15 - taking time um so the next question is
07:20 - how did it come to be so I wrote a
07:23 - little thread when we announced it but
07:25 - um essentially we had gone to Market
07:27 - Toby especially one of of our
07:29 - co-founders he led the charge in a lot
07:31 - of these conversations and with both
07:34 - existing investors as well as new
07:35 - investors and the time the market wasn't
07:38 - looking so friendly and uh I in the
07:42 - summertime I want to say um last summer
07:45 - I brought on when I joined the company
07:47 - uh a host of open- source entrepreneurs
07:50 - so a network of my personal friends and
07:53 - and open source enthusiasts I thought
07:54 - that was really important to add to our
07:56 - Network including some that were
07:58 - announced so including you know super
08:00 - basis CEO their their head of devell to
08:03 - EXA that planet scale to um various kind
08:07 - of Dev full heavy we had uh truffle
08:09 - security to Fleet Smith Founders all
08:12 - very entrepreneurs who get it and I
08:15 - wanted their advice honeycomb CEO Dev
08:18 - tooling space and uh we ended up having
08:21 - one of those angels Walter lead me a
08:24 - warm introduction to the general partner
08:26 - at gradient and
08:30 - that's what happens when we talked him
08:32 - and I had that first call he got it he
08:35 - got he wasn't like a lot of the VC's who
08:37 - were pressing us to have 2 million AR
08:40 - yesterday you know he understood oh wow
08:42 - you guys have crazy distribution and
08:45 - adoption which is rare and and people
08:47 - who know no I mean YK you know but not
08:51 - everyone knows and we we see that love
08:53 - we know the value but a lot of VCS you
08:56 - know you're just another company that's
08:57 - not a 2 million AR so fortunately um
09:01 - they got it and shortly after I
09:03 - introduced Daran to my co-founders Toby
09:07 - and Christian and you know we started
09:10 - going through the round really fast
09:12 - within two weeks um you know we had met
09:15 - the three of us with the entire gradient
09:18 - partnership team and then uh the week
09:20 - after that I negotiated the terms with
09:23 - Daren um him and I and we make sure
09:25 - everything was fair to the team the
09:28 - larger team as well as to gradient and
09:31 - we signed the term sheet by I think it
09:33 - was like maybe two and a half weeks and
09:35 - then within six weeks everything was
09:39 - wired sealed and done and that was I
09:42 - want to say a month ago so the second
09:45 - kind of huge learning for those
09:47 - listening and in this space is if they
09:51 - someone wants to do it they can do it
09:53 - fast so if they're dragging you on for 6
09:56 - months you know like with dating as we
10:00 - said um it's it's usually not a friendly
10:05 - sign I just went on a whole SPI i k so
10:09 - feel free to tell me if if there are
10:11 - things I'm missing or are things that
10:13 - should be cleared up right uh so one
10:15 - immediate question I have yeah please is
10:18 - you did a seed round of 2 million and
10:20 - then you did another seed round of six
10:22 - million how does that work yeah so um in
10:26 - terms of equity financing so three
10:29 - million was the original round that
10:31 - happened I want to say 20 yeah end of
10:34 - 2019 when it was formed and this round
10:37 - technically is called a
10:39 - C+ so depending on it it's very Venture
10:43 - Capital but it's it's usually between a
10:45 - seed and an A and some people would call
10:49 - it a bridge it's called Bridge round or
10:51 - you can call it a plus round but
10:53 - essentially it's a seed round it's not a
10:55 - series a cuz six is for us still too
10:58 - small for a series a um but still in
11:00 - today's market uh a really fair and
11:02 - squared seed round and fortunately for
11:05 - us you know I know a lot of people are
11:06 - doing safes and notes as debt um this
11:09 - one is kind of fair and square Equity
11:12 - round nice yeah yeah I mean again that's
11:16 - amazing to hear and I'm trying to think
11:18 - of something you know that would be
11:19 - useful to hopefully the maximum number
11:22 - of people listening yeah and one thing
11:24 - that stands out to me is the personal
11:26 - connection aspect of it yeah you know
11:29 - you mentioned these open source
11:30 - Executives that that you sort of are new
11:33 - in your network and they introduce you
11:35 - to even more people yeah uh so it sounds
11:38 - like building this personal Network it
11:40 - has been a huge part of your success so
11:42 - far absolutely and it's it's really
11:45 - important especially
11:47 - for those listening some I know maybe
11:50 - are not as extroverted or don't really
11:53 - you know they think of networking I I've
11:55 - heard this a lot everyone thinks of
11:57 - networking as this like use car salesman
12:00 - old model you know and but reality is
12:03 - it's kind of like making friends online
12:05 - too on on Twitter or on Discord you're
12:08 - just making a friend like you asked me
12:11 - why do you come to GitHub because I have
12:13 - friends I have met on met on Twitter met
12:15 - met on Discord met on whatever that I've
12:17 - never like touched hugged high-fived all
12:21 - the things and whenever for example
12:23 - whenever I go to a Dev Meetup in SF and
12:27 - there's you know say people at Dev meet
12:29 - up I say oh I'm from charm and I'm
12:31 - usually you know I I don't go to Dev
12:33 - meetups every day I don't know who knows
12:35 - us who doesn't know us I just assume no
12:38 - one knows us you know or at least me and
12:40 - then when people are like oh my gosh
12:42 - charm I love charm I use VHS I use
12:45 - bubble tea you're from charm the CLI
12:47 - company and I'm I'm so touched I'm like
12:50 - we're friends we're already friends you
12:52 - know and so that kind of I think that is
12:56 - something very special to open source
12:58 - that not not every type of company gets
13:01 - to enjoy this network of very creative
13:04 - passionate opinionated developers that
13:07 - are all striving to create something for
13:09 - the better ecosystem with maybe some
13:11 - with an agenda but largely just trying
13:14 - to share wealth of knowledge which is
13:15 - something I really enjoy working with YK
13:18 - and and your platform your friends is
13:19 - just sharing oh how do you grow better
13:22 - how do you start coding like trying to
13:24 - remove those barriers and that's also
13:27 - what kind of draws me into open source
13:29 - even though I'm not you know your
13:30 - traditionally trained
13:32 - Dev right uh so it sounds like the
13:36 - people you talk to online you know like
13:39 - the online Network you have you value
13:41 - that yeah value a
13:44 - tons and and it's funny because um I've
13:47 - also gotten the the frequent question
13:49 - they're like oh you're not you know
13:51 - you're not a Dev you're like how do you
13:53 - how do you kind of connect with these
13:55 - folk and you know when I first joined
13:58 - I'll admit that that was like that was a
14:00 - question I had I was like you know I'm
14:02 - not going to be telling them about the
14:03 - best sources to find you know the
14:05 - hottest tooling and and now I know a
14:08 - little bit about you know dabbling with
14:10 - my configuration zshell files but like
14:13 - you're thinking about um what do they
14:15 - need so I think W you've been so good
14:18 - about you know helping people introduce
14:21 - them to easy ways to connect or build
14:23 - tooling or getting into Ai and for me
14:27 - I'm kind of the honorary
14:29 - parentheses bis person for devs so when
14:33 - when my team who is very technical
14:36 - everyone is Technical and I'm the only
14:37 - one who runs business stuff when they
14:39 - need questions on marketing or maybe
14:41 - some of them are doing um have
14:44 - Partnerships with a Hashi corporate
14:46 - Enterprise and they're working on their
14:47 - SLA they're like what are Market terms
14:50 - or for example some of them are curious
14:53 - about freelancing or investor stuff how
14:56 - does that work like you had asked and
14:58 - I'm sure common question what is a preed
15:00 - or a safe round or these things that to
15:04 - be honest devs have no need to know
15:07 - really but maybe they're just naturally
15:09 - inclined or they think about starting
15:11 - their company one day they just want to
15:13 - be in and I'm like hey I'm that person
15:15 - that can like that's like all I do bread
15:18 - and butter like let me share some
15:19 - knowledge in a way that is applicable to
15:22 - you and let me help you like your
15:25 - support contract this is what I've seen
15:26 - as Market I want to get you the best
15:28 - great and I want to offer you to you cuz
15:31 - you're you're part of the community and
15:33 - you know at no charge whatsoever we're
15:35 - just all here to help each
15:37 - other right so it sounds like you you
15:40 - help Debs with business stuff and Debs
15:43 - help you with technical stuff kind of
15:45 - yeah and I'm definitely not shy as my
15:47 - team knows ask all the stupid questions
15:50 - I'm very much about it and I very much
15:51 - ask hey what are top you know tools and
15:54 - tips you you wish you knew when you
15:56 - launch your first open source project or
15:59 - um what is um I someone asked me if we
16:01 - the hottest tools that you're seeing in
16:03 - the market right or the newest editor or
16:05 - the newest kind of AI function that they
16:07 - want to try around with I'm not in these
16:10 - things day and day out and so and but
16:13 - but not only do they help me with stuff
16:14 - it's also like there're are users right
16:17 - so I want feedback I want them to try
16:19 - our stuff and just tell me what they
16:21 - like what they don't like and I think
16:23 - through kind of building that Rapport
16:25 - and Trust they can be more Trust full of
16:29 - of me of the team of the charm brand
16:32 - that you know Jay-Z's not going to snake
16:35 - you right because like you know we we've
16:38 - talked to her like she can take tough
16:40 - feedback and and I want them to be
16:42 - passionate if there's some stuff that we
16:45 - can improve they want features on that's
16:48 - something that is
16:50 - geeez that's something that uh that I
16:52 - want to hear and improve
16:55 - on cool uh so you talked about about
16:58 - negotiation I think that's a huge topic
17:01 - uh and you know it's good to hear that
17:03 - this is a bridge round you know it does
17:05 - uh give a little bit more context on
17:07 - this you know it's not a pure seed round
17:09 - so that's good to know but still six
17:11 - million for bridge round you know
17:12 - between seed and series a that's well
17:15 - it's double it's double the size it's
17:18 - the double of the size of our Original
17:19 - Seed yeah right so and you mentioned
17:22 - negotiation so how did you
17:24 - negotiate oo I mean we might need
17:27 - another hour for this session
17:30 - um let me think so I
17:33 - actually negotiation is something of an
17:36 - art just like coding is an art and I
17:41 - love it it is so
17:44 - fun uh I know how many people just hate
17:47 - it because often times it can feel
17:50 - confrontational but I think one of the
17:52 - top things to consider is to think of it
17:54 - as a mindset so when you think about
17:57 - negotiation it's like I like to think of
18:00 - it as a conversation and it's a little
18:02 - bit of a game where I think where people
18:05 - get stuck is they think of it as Zero
18:07 - Sum and that's fair because that's been
18:10 - their maybe their life experience right
18:12 - so maybe from and I'm just drawing this
18:14 - out of air but when you were little it's
18:16 - like if you had a sibling and resources
18:19 - were slim then hey you got to give that
18:21 - toy to the younger brother and or like
18:24 - okay I only have um only one of you the
18:27 - winner gets the ice scream so only it's
18:30 - a zero sum only the winner gets it and
18:33 - and as you get older more of those
18:36 - circumstances come up like only the the
18:38 - only the gold winner gets their credit
18:40 - in the Limelight and the silver and the
18:42 - bronze no one hears about ever again and
18:44 - it feels like you're pinpoint against
18:46 - each other but in kind of in business or
18:49 - in negotiation in anything right it
18:51 - should be kind of a friendly exchange it
18:54 - is transactional don't get me what we're
18:55 - very much in capitalism here um but it
18:58 - should be like um if you do it right uh
19:02 - in in hopefully an environment that's
19:03 - suitable and again the right investor it
19:06 - should be fair and so there are many
19:09 - items say there are 10 items on a term
19:12 - sheet or on a contract or on an SLA I'm
19:14 - trying to make this applicable to
19:16 - everyone that or like a job offer right
19:19 - um there if there's 10 items you can
19:21 - negotiate then you kind of try to
19:23 - prioritize what matters most so maybe
19:26 - you know we care about
19:29 - the amount of dollar invested in so for
19:31 - us that was six um and we maybe we care
19:34 - about valuation the most right we maybe
19:37 - we don't care about whether they take a
19:39 - board seat or not um maybe we don't care
19:42 - about if they take two board seats um or
19:45 - maybe they care about that the founders
19:48 - are 20% vested or 50% vested or Founders
19:52 - have you know 50% of the company or I'm
19:55 - just throwing blank numbers or they have
19:57 - 25% of the the company like there there
19:59 - are certain things that investors care
20:01 - about from their point of view um and
20:03 - there are certain things we care about
20:04 - from the company's point of view so how
20:06 - do you align things that make sense for
20:09 - each of you in terms of that priority
20:11 - matching and then how can you work
20:13 - around a compromise around things that
20:16 - are somewhat important to each of you
20:19 - and so for those listening if you think
20:21 - about day-to-day you think about I think
20:24 - most common people think about
20:25 - negotiating in their job offers right
20:28 - and I've kind of advised various friends
20:30 - in the network or or or those have you
20:33 - even devs right for negotia advice and
20:36 - and I think sometimes the Golden Nugget
20:39 - is like how much can I charge but really
20:42 - like there are other polls that you can
20:44 - do hey can I be remote I mean remote
20:47 - that flexibility is a big pull that's a
20:49 - non-financial benefit another might be
20:52 - title right that's a big fin like
20:54 - principal versus staff versus junior
20:56 - engineer those main different things to
20:58 - different people can you pull that now
21:00 - vacation days you know you have 10 set
21:03 - vacation days or you have unlimited I
21:05 - mean unlimited vacation that I mean
21:07 - everyone in the room just like sparked
21:09 - up um another might be going to GitHub
21:13 - Universe one or two uh annual
21:15 - conferences where you get to network
21:17 - where you get to meet YK in person and
21:21 - uh those are all those are all
21:23 - meaningful like what are skills that
21:25 - matter to you in the longer term if a
21:26 - company say it's a startup they're
21:28 - Limited in resources they're like hey we
21:30 - can't do this but we want to help you
21:32 - succeed we will introduce you to the
21:34 - CEOs of super base or whoever to help
21:37 - you grow and and that's meaningful
21:39 - that's always something to think
21:42 - about hopefully it does actionable yeah
21:45 - I think it definitely is I'm now curious
21:48 - because you mentioned uh the CEO of
21:50 - super B twice yes couple yes he's a
21:54 - friend he's a friend what's your
21:56 - relation like how you know can you tell
21:58 - us more about that yes so I mentioned
22:00 - couple partly because um when we were at
22:03 - least when I was joining charm they were
22:06 - kind of the most recent very successful
22:09 - open source venture-backed company you
22:12 - know there are more uh you know more
22:13 - advanced quotequote so there's you know
22:16 - geell um you know from nextjs now a huge
22:19 - preo and then there is also uh obviously
22:22 - Hashi Corp right Hashi being the IPO
22:25 - example of Open Source now subab base
22:27 - being like where we are right ahead of
22:29 - us they just rais I think a big series b
22:32 - um they we kind of look at them as the
22:34 - big brother that we want to Aspire to
22:37 - and couple I was introduced through the
22:38 - open source community and we've since
22:41 - hung out you know a few times and got to
22:44 - know each other he he knows of charm and
22:47 - you know I get to ask him for advice on
22:50 - a little bit in the hey big brother like
22:52 - what did you guys do when you guys were
22:54 - trying to go to market initially you
22:55 - guys had huge open source TR R traction
22:58 - and um whenever he sees my investor
23:01 - updates uh he will send me like um I I
23:04 - was I remember one investor update I was
23:06 - like oh our we just had our third
23:07 - project go viral and we've now kind of
23:10 - honed this playbook for open source
23:12 - projects and I remember he like texted
23:14 - me he was like can you share the
23:16 - Playbook but but similarly too when we
23:20 - announced our six million round um he
23:22 - was one of the first to text me and say
23:25 - hey you guys just he sent me a
23:27 - screenshot you guys made the front page
23:28 - of Hacker News and I I didn't even know
23:31 - this cuz he got the news earlier and uh
23:34 - and so it's a it's a great relationship
23:36 - I think it's very important to have
23:38 - friends who are we've also done kind of
23:41 - highlights together streaming events
23:43 - together and you know when they do a sub
23:45 - base event or when we do a charm event
23:47 - we all always like try to invite each
23:48 - other um because we share Community um
23:51 - and I think that's very special as you
23:53 - cultivate these relationships a lot of
23:55 - them you know in person I find them very
23:57 - efficient so come to GitHub H's
24:00 - relationship with the GitHub Giants but
24:02 - also Microsoft also AWS also um various
24:06 - individual Champions enthusiasts
24:08 - maintainers that's huge for anyone I've
24:11 - also had this conversation with
24:13 - individual devs who's told me like IRL
24:15 - has changed your life once they kind of
24:18 - got out of that I'm only comfortable in
24:20 - my home coding mode it it does step out
24:24 - of it it changes your life and I
24:26 - encourage it for everyone
24:29 - did you just say get out of your house
24:31 - to change your life well for those who
24:33 - are who are used to kind of just being
24:36 - in their own environment in their home
24:38 - which I get comfy cozy I mean we all
24:39 - love being in PJs but like I have heard
24:42 - from specific de friends of mine who've
24:45 - now done very well as individuals there
24:47 - they said the top tip that changed my
24:49 - life was going out there meeting people
24:51 - IRL that's that's a quote from someone
24:54 - who's you know quite prolific so I think
24:56 - that's a hacker tip that I can share
24:59 - with many so if there's one takeaway
25:01 - from this get out of your
25:05 - house hey sweats are all the rage right
25:07 - now you can even go out in your in your
25:10 - sweats so come for the stickers and uh
25:13 - and stay for the
25:14 - friends
25:16 - nice so you
25:19 - know it's amazing uh to hear your
25:22 - journey and it's interesting to think
25:24 - about super Bas example because M you
25:27 - know to me it's a clearer example of a
25:31 - business that's based on open source
25:32 - project or a couple of Open Source
25:34 - projects because they're able to host uh
25:37 - their own you know open source services
25:40 - and charge for that and that's a very
25:42 - clear monetization strategy but for you
25:45 - yeah you're pre-revenue
25:48 - correct but you still were able to
25:51 - convince investors that this is a
25:53 - valuable
25:54 - business how did you do that yeah yeah
25:57 - so it's a good question it's about
26:00 - finding the right investor who believes
26:02 - in your long-term Vision right so we do
26:04 - have a go to market commercialization
26:06 - strategy and we do have you know a
26:09 - product that we're working on you know
26:11 - stay tuned um and so it's
26:14 - about showing the right investor that
26:18 - this is something that will work in the
26:20 - long term and right now we're investing
26:21 - our time and resources on growing the
26:24 - proper Foundation community and network
26:27 - that will lead to conversion for the
26:29 - Right audience right because I mean why
26:31 - K you know this so well with open source
26:34 - a lot of companies choose not to do that
26:36 - and I know this because they've told me
26:39 - because it's a very passionate creative
26:41 - also opinionated user base and you know
26:45 - sometimes they are they you know don't
26:47 - like certain way that the ways things
26:49 - are handled and and we don't want
26:52 - because of we value our users so much we
26:54 - don't want to flip on certain things too
26:57 - soon soon we want to make sure the
26:58 - product is right to our users who are
27:00 - willing to see the value and eventually
27:02 - pay for it and we will always have open-
27:06 - Source Products that's going to be
27:07 - always a core component of the company
27:10 - um but for some users a subset of that
27:12 - probably organizations more they will
27:15 - have additional features that make sense
27:17 - for them to pay for like I'm thinking
27:20 - Enterprise features correct so
27:22 - Enterprise features um to deal with
27:25 - maybe compliance security team related
27:27 - stuff ACL nothing that you haven't seen
27:30 - before nothing that superbase is not
27:32 - doing GitHub is not doing like you're
27:34 - seeing the Enterprise bottle they are
27:36 - you know they are the giant right
27:38 - they're free everything open source
27:40 - everything you know more Donuts more
27:42 - chips all the things and then Enterprise
27:45 - is like you know six figure contracts at
27:47 - a time right and so yeah yeah I think I
27:50 - I want to sort of you know play The
27:52 - Devil's Advocate and you know push it
27:54 - back on that a little bit yeah because
27:56 - you know again with with superbase it's
27:58 - a hosty service you pay for it but it's
28:00 - very clear GitHub same thing it's a
28:03 - hosty service you pay for it but charm
28:05 - is not a hosting service it's a local
28:07 - you know app so I'm wondering you know
28:10 - how do you even approach that so I can't
28:13 - revealed too much yet um when we have
28:15 - the product hopefully we can talk again
28:17 - and and I can share a lot more but we
28:19 - are certainly exploring certain models
28:22 - um including kind of the right user set
28:25 - and um starting with a lot of our early
28:27 - adopters what that looks like we'll be
28:29 - trying out them probably with a either
28:32 - free or very very low price to start out
28:34 - with and hope to include some of those
28:36 - listening in that early alpha beta
28:38 - testing phase um and and we'll be
28:40 - exploring that's kind of all I can share
28:42 - for now um and uh but yeah we do look at
28:46 - you know your GitHub and super base for
28:48 - a reference and stay tuned it's all I
28:51 - can
28:52 - say right I guess this does come back to
28:55 - you know building your relationship with
28:57 - uh your user base maybe Enterprise
29:00 - customers potential customers it's a
29:03 - conversation that needs to happen to
29:05 - figure out H how to monetize this you
29:08 - know whole thing right yeah absolutely
29:10 - and in today's market kind of what are
29:13 - people willing to pay for what is the
29:14 - pricing Point what's the customer
29:16 - Journey it's a whole I mean once you get
29:18 - into an organization that's funded by VC
29:21 - it's a whole spectrum of things that we
29:24 - will have a part two conversation on but
29:26 - uh but for now we uh we're we're going
29:29 - one step at a time awesome uh I think
29:32 - this is a perfect note to end this
29:34 - conversation on uh thank you so much for
29:37 - being here if you have any you know
29:38 - quick last word feel free to go ahead
