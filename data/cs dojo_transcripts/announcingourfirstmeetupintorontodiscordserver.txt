00:00 - hi everyone in this video I just wanted
00:02 - to make two quick announcements the
00:04 - first one is that I'm gonna be hosting
00:06 - my first meetup for this channel next
00:08 - week it's gonna be on December 6th
00:11 - evening and it's gonna be at this
00:13 - company called DISA in downtown Toronto
00:15 - you can find more details about it and
00:17 - sign up at CH dojo io / meet one if you
00:21 - don't live in the city or if you can't
00:24 - make it this time don't worry because
00:25 - you know you can still sign up for
00:27 - future meetups in your city at CH dojo
00:30 - da yo / Meetup okay the second thing I
00:33 - wanted to tell you guys about today is
00:35 - the discord server I recently set up for
00:38 - this channel and just in case you're not
00:40 - familiar with discord it's sort of like
00:42 - slack and you have basically a list of
00:44 - topics that you can chat about for
00:46 - example Python JavaScript and a lot of
00:49 - other topics here and I think it's a
00:51 - cool way to chat about any programming
00:53 - related topics and you know sort of ask
00:55 - each other questions - I also find it
00:58 - interesting how it seems pretty easy to
01:00 - make BOTS for discord for example one of
01:03 - our members made this bot called red
01:04 - where you can do stuff like rez Jeff dog
01:09 - to get a dog Jeff liked that and
01:12 - apparently he made the spot with Python
01:14 - anyway feel free to join us to chat
01:17 - about programming or maybe just to try
01:19 - creating your own bot okay and there's
01:22 - actually another thing I wanted to tell
01:23 - you guys about today so the company
01:26 - that's hosting our meetup next week Desa
01:28 - told me that they are actually hiring
01:29 - Python engineers you know I'm not
01:32 - getting paid to say this but honestly it
01:34 - seems like a pretty cool company to work
01:36 - for so if you want to get a job with
01:38 - Python and if you want to you know
01:40 - potentially work in Toronto which is a
01:42 - nice city I would say you should
01:43 - definitely check out their career page
