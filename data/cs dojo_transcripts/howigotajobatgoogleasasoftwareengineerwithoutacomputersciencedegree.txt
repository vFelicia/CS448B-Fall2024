00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - so I worked at Google in Montreux as a
00:04 - software developer / software engineer
00:06 - for a little over a year but my major
00:09 - and my university wasn't computer
00:11 - science or Computer Engineering
00:13 - it was statistics so how was I able to
00:16 - get this job without a computer science
00:19 - degree I'm going to explain the process
00:21 - I personally used step by step so here I
00:24 - present the six steps I personally used
00:27 - for getting a job at Google as a
00:29 - software engineer step one I took a few
00:33 - programming courses during my summer
00:34 - break and that gave me enough technical
00:37 - basis to start learning on my own after
00:39 - that these courses were on programming
00:42 - basics and data structures and
00:44 - algorithms and they were taught using
00:46 - Java step 2 I worked on a few personal
00:50 - projects first of all I used the website
00:52 - called project Euler to work on my
00:55 - programming fundamentals then my first
00:58 - real personal project after that was
01:00 - going to be like the reddit of Japan
01:02 - because nothing like ready existed in
01:04 - Japan at the time so I built a simple
01:07 - prototype using a language called Ruby
01:09 - and it worked but in the end I was
01:11 - actually too afraid to release it maybe
01:14 - I was too shy but still I enjoyed the
01:16 - process a lot and I enjoyed learning a
01:19 - new programming language on my own too
01:21 - step 3 thanks to my personal project I
01:24 - eventually landed my first technical
01:26 - internship it was at a tiny tiny
01:29 - start-up in Tokyo and it was as a
01:31 - software engineering intern I think I
01:34 - was able to get that job
01:35 - partly because I had demonstrated
01:38 - without reddit in Japan project that I
01:40 - was able to build stuff with Ruby and
01:42 - something called Ruby on Rails and step
01:45 - forth again more experience in the tech
01:48 - industry with a few more internships
01:49 - this time actually at Microsoft
01:52 - these internships were in something
01:54 - called data science and product
01:56 - management as I explained in a previous
01:58 - video I was able to get these
02:00 - internships thanks to the combination of
02:02 - my statistics background my first
02:05 - technical internship as a software
02:07 - engineer and a few more personal project
02:09 - I worked on after the one I mentioned
02:11 - earlier
02:12 - Step five I prepared myself for software
02:15 - engineering interviews I used resources
02:18 - like cracking the coding interview and
02:19 - lead code I'm going to put links to
02:22 - those resources below in case you're
02:23 - interested
02:24 - but I found that the most helpful thing
02:27 - I did by far for preparing for software
02:29 - engineer interviews was doing mock
02:31 - interviews with my friends practicing
02:33 - with my friends was a really good
02:35 - practice for me so I'd be less nervous
02:37 - in the actual interview and actually
02:39 - when I gave mock interviews to my
02:41 - friends as if I'm the interviewer that
02:44 - was really helpful to giving a mock
02:46 - interview to my friends helped me
02:48 - understand what it feels like to be in
02:50 - the interviewers shoes and I think it's
02:52 - really really important and this is a
02:54 - point that's often overlooked the reason
02:57 - why it's so important is because at the
03:00 - end of the day your job interview
03:02 - whether it's technical or non-technical
03:04 - it's just a form of a communication and
03:07 - just like in any other form of
03:09 - communication it's crucial that you
03:11 - understand the other person's
03:12 - perspective in this case the
03:14 - interviewers perspective not just yours
03:16 - and step 6
03:18 - I applied and actually I kept applying
03:21 - as I mentioned in a previous video I
03:23 - applied to Google at least five times
03:26 - over the course of two years or so and
03:28 - in the end I had five separate
03:31 - interviews for five different positions
03:33 - at Google and I got rejected the first
03:35 - four times so I only got through the
03:38 - last one but the first four interviews I
03:41 - did they're never gonna be on my resume
03:43 - so nobody really cares that I failed
03:46 - four times at this point all right those
03:48 - are the six steps but there is something
03:51 - else I want to tell you whether you're
03:53 - applying for a job trying to start a
03:55 - business or looking for a girlfriend or
03:57 - boyfriend when you go for something you
03:59 - really want this whole process can be
04:02 - really hard and it's actually really
04:04 - discouraging for most people so it's
04:07 - almost inevitable for you to keep
04:09 - getting rejected by your potential
04:11 - employers or by your potential
04:12 - girlfriends or boyfriends and if you're
04:15 - trying to start a business it's also
04:16 - very common for your business idea is to
04:18 - keep failing one after another but at
04:22 - the end of the day nobody cares about
04:24 - the things that
04:25 - didn't work out none of those rejections
04:28 - are not gonna be on your resume so
04:30 - nobody will care about them the only
04:33 - thing that matters is what you get in
04:35 - the end so if you're in the process like
04:37 - that right now if you're going for
04:39 - something you really want maybe it's
04:41 - hard maybe you get discouraged sometimes
04:43 - but keep going because eventually you
04:46 - get there if you don't give up okay
04:49 - that's all I have for this video if you
04:52 - want more videos like this like this
04:54 - video and subscribe for more and if you
04:57 - have any requests about what kind of
04:58 - videos I should make in the future let
05:00 - me know in the comment section below as
05:02 - well and I'll see you in the next video
