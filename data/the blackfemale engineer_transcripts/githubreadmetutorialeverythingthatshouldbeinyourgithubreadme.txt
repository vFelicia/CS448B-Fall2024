00:00 - hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the
00:02 - black female engineer
00:04 - i provide content for new and aspiring
00:06 - software engineers
00:07 - and today we're going to be talking
00:09 - about github
00:10 - readme now if this is not your first
00:12 - video you know make sure you hit that
00:14 - subscribe button it really helps me out
00:15 - really helps support my channel
00:17 - and so also make sure you follow me on
00:19 - instagram you can engage with me more
00:20 - there and so
00:21 - yeah let's just build this community now
00:24 - the github
00:25 - project we're going to be working with
00:26 - is an old project of mine while it's
00:28 - going through coding boot camp
00:30 - it's called piggy for piggy bank
00:33 - it was a financial literacy uh
00:37 - like web app where people would track
00:39 - their expenses and then see like
00:41 - a chart auto populate of the proportions
00:44 - of
00:45 - you know their expenses going to wear
00:47 - and all of that
00:48 - so yeah we're going to work with that so
00:51 - let's get to it so this is what our
00:55 - readme is going to look like we're going
00:58 - to go into
00:59 - very deep detail about how to make it
01:01 - look like this
01:02 - but i wanted to show you what the end
01:04 - result is
01:07 - code examples picky features
01:10 - status why contact and
01:13 - license
01:18 - so let's scroll back up and click
01:21 - on yeah click on edit
01:25 - you all would have a blank like default
01:29 - readme that github would have
01:31 - created automatically after you create a
01:33 - repo
01:34 - it would have just like just default
01:36 - stuff and so
01:38 - you'd click this pencil
01:41 - button to edit it
01:47 - so right away the first thing we want to
01:50 - do
01:51 - is tell people what this app is what is
01:53 - the title of your app
01:55 - and you know make that the first thing
01:57 - they see and so we do that in github by
02:00 - putting this you know hashtag pound
02:03 - symbol
02:04 - um and then followed by a space and then
02:08 - the title you want your audience to see
02:11 - so for me that was piggy web app front
02:13 - end
02:14 - i've also done it where it's just the
02:17 - name of the app and front end
02:20 - i always make sure it says front end or
02:22 - back and because for me
02:24 - i never have combined projects i make
02:26 - sure that there's always
02:28 - a separation of concern that's really
02:31 - for me the most efficient way to develop
02:34 - and so
02:35 - my repos always say front end or back
02:37 - end and so
02:39 - there that was and then there's the
02:40 - table of contents
02:42 - so in github your headers start with a
02:46 - pound
02:46 - or one hashtag and then your sub headers
02:49 - are two hashtags
02:50 - and so everything else in here are two
02:52 - hashtags
02:53 - and the next thing i put here are the
02:56 - table of contents
02:57 - so that people can very quickly from the
03:00 - get-go
03:00 - know what to expect out of this readme
03:03 - without having to parse through it all
03:05 - but we're going to get back to this and
03:07 - there's actually something really cool
03:08 - about the table of contents which i
03:09 - really like
03:10 - so we're going to get back here because
03:12 - for me the table of contents is always
03:14 - something i do
03:15 - last because it's based on the structure
03:18 - of
03:18 - the readme and so if i don't know the
03:21 - structure yet how can i create a table
03:23 - of contents i i it's no so
03:27 - so i always do that last and so we'll
03:29 - get back to that
03:31 - but now the next thing i do
03:34 - is provide an about
03:38 - x and x app so about piggy and so i just
03:41 - say
03:41 - how piggy is an expense tracker for
03:43 - users it
03:45 - gives users insights as to what's in
03:47 - their piggy bank by
03:48 - being by providing a list breakdown of
03:52 - all of the expenses they log
03:54 - and it also provides users with
03:56 - resources on
03:57 - to better their financial literacy and
04:00 - so you know it doesn't have to be
04:02 - you know some wall street journal
04:03 - article or anything just
04:05 - something quick and just saying look
04:07 - this is what this is about
04:09 - because here's the thing you want
04:12 - to remember that a lot of people who are
04:16 - going to your github specifically
04:17 - i tailor things like this to recruiters
04:20 - when i'm looking
04:21 - specifically for when i'm looking for a
04:22 - job and recruiters don't have the time
04:25 - to open the app and try it out
04:28 - themselves and go into their code base
04:30 - especially because a lot of recruiters
04:32 - aren't engineers themselves so they
04:34 - likely don't know how to deal with all
04:36 - of this and so i try to just
04:38 - provide them with all the information
04:40 - they need
04:42 - on my apps on my projects without them
04:44 - actually needing to go
04:45 - into the code same thing with people who
04:49 - would interview you they those people
04:52 - may be
04:52 - engineers maybe project managers so they
04:56 - may have you know the better abilities
04:59 - to actually go through your code and
05:01 - things like that
05:01 - but still odds are they won't so just
05:04 - provide them with something easy to look
05:05 - at
05:06 - and just see what you're about and so on
05:08 - that theme the next thing i would always
05:10 - provide
05:11 - was a walkthrough video of my app i
05:14 - would film the walkthrough the same way
05:15 - i'm doing here
05:16 - just putting you know quicktime player
05:19 - screen record
05:20 - and hitting play and i would really just
05:24 - the video was always just me using it i
05:27 - wouldn't really
05:28 - explain um like the technologies i used
05:31 - i wouldn't
05:32 - i wouldn't really explain anything i
05:33 - would just be a user
05:35 - providing um and showing what the user
05:39 - experience would
05:40 - look like so they'd be very quick videos
05:41 - one to three minutes depending on how
05:44 - big
05:44 - the app was so in github
05:48 - the way to add you know links to certain
05:52 - texts so that
05:53 - it's the text that shows and not the
05:55 - link but once they click on the text
05:57 - they go to that link
05:59 - it's by putting brackets let me do it
06:02 - here
06:03 - it's by putting brackets putting text
06:06 - within
06:06 - brackets so you can say click me if you
06:09 - wanted a link
06:10 - that said that and then if you wanted it
06:13 - to go
06:14 - to google.com
06:19 - like that and that's how you do it you
06:23 - would put the url within parentheses
06:25 - make sure you don't have a space having
06:27 - a space changes
06:29 - um the ability for it to be linked so
06:32 - you wouldn't put a space just back to
06:33 - back and so so i can
06:35 - show you what this now looks like
06:39 - let's see let's zoom out a little tiny
06:42 - bit
06:43 - okay so you see now click me and i'm not
06:46 - going to click it because we haven't
06:48 - saved
06:48 - certain changes and it might mess things
06:50 - up so
06:51 - yeah now you can say click me and you
06:53 - see how there's no link being shown
06:56 - or anything no um url being shown
06:59 - yeah so that's something really cool
07:02 - about
07:02 - github that i really really like
07:05 - so i use that really everywhere where
07:08 - were we oh right here
07:10 - so yeah you have to click me right here
07:12 - but i'll take it out from now
07:16 - so the next thing i do is provide
07:19 - a list of technologies that i used in
07:22 - creating this front-end portion or
07:25 - back-end portion
07:26 - depending on what portion you're on for
07:28 - me it's end so defining the technologies
07:31 - i used the languages i used
07:32 - the frameworks i used for me this was
07:35 - built in
07:36 - vanilla javascript so i didn't use any
07:38 - frameworks like
07:39 - react angular view i didn't use any of
07:41 - those it was just javascript
07:43 - and so i put javascript es6 and then
07:46 - html
07:47 - css and i wanted to put the versions
07:50 - there um just so this readme withstands
07:54 - the test of time and i always know what
07:56 - version i used no matter how
07:59 - long time goes by you know
08:02 - things like that because that affects
08:03 - you know certain variables and scope and
08:06 - functions and things like that what
08:08 - version you use so that's why i put that
08:10 - there
08:11 - but yeah if i had used a framework i
08:13 - also would have included you know react
08:15 - and angular and things like that
08:17 - but yeah i list the technology so that
08:19 - the recruiter seeing this the
08:21 - interviewer seeing this can can see that
08:25 - i am not lying on my resume during my
08:28 - interviews when i say i'm proficient
08:30 - in javascript i'm proficient in angular
08:33 - things like that then i go down to the
08:36 - setup so the setup
08:38 - this is something that um honestly it's
08:41 - kind of like my
08:42 - least favorite part um even though it's
08:44 - so small but these
08:46 - setup i use this section to just
08:49 - provide people seeing um this read me
08:52 - just the instructions on how to have the
08:56 - project
08:56 - on their local computers um to
09:00 - mess around with and play around with on
09:02 - their own
09:03 - so they're not playing around my code no
09:04 - no i don't i don't play those games
09:07 - but they themselves can um
09:10 - you know alter things and see how the
09:12 - code really works
09:13 - and things like that and really just
09:15 - fostering their own learning
09:17 - that is where the license at the bottom
09:20 - comes up though so we'll get to that
09:22 - but yes i provide setup instructions and
09:24 - so i say
09:26 - to run this project please go to the
09:28 - backend repo
09:30 - which i made sure i linked to the actual
09:33 - github url all the urls here
09:37 - are you know adjusted so that certain
09:40 - confidential information of mine
09:42 - stays confidential but yeah you would
09:45 - have the full
09:46 - url here that would connect to the back
09:49 - end repo
09:50 - of this project because yeah you for me
09:53 - for this
09:54 - app you needed both a back end and a
09:56 - front end which were separate
09:58 - then two after you follow the
10:01 - instructions
10:02 - on the back end repo whatever was
10:04 - provided there
10:05 - run light server in your front end
10:08 - directory
10:09 - then click here and then that was the
10:12 - local host you know 2001
10:14 - so they can preview the app
10:17 - on their local machine instead of
10:18 - looking on youtube or things like that
10:22 - now i find this section so
10:25 - so so so important code examples
10:28 - code examples was just somewhere i put
10:33 - you know some type of um
10:36 - look into how i develop how i use
10:39 - functions how i create you know the
10:41 - functions and the variables and things
10:43 - like that
10:44 - and just showing like look this is yeah
10:47 - what i can do and so it's a very small
10:50 - of course like when it comes to
10:51 - the entire project this is point zero
10:53 - one percent of the entire project
10:56 - but it's still nice to see that you know
10:59 - the person actually
11:00 - okay they can create a
11:04 - iterative function they can um create
11:07 - like work with
11:08 - arrays and map through them and all of
11:10 - that and so
11:12 - i provided code examples now to provide
11:15 - code examples
11:16 - this is what you do you provide these
11:18 - backticks so not an apostrophe like this
11:21 - for me i use a macbook and so um
11:24 - this backtick is under the escape
11:28 - button on the top left of my keyboard
11:31 - so if you're also on the macbook on the
11:33 - top left of your keyboard
11:35 - um it's under this kit for me so for me
11:38 - it's the second button down from the top
11:41 - left
11:42 - that is where you put the backtick if
11:45 - you can't find it
11:46 - it's the same button as this like
11:49 - sideways s
11:50 - right here i know there's a name for it
11:52 - someone comment the name
11:53 - please for this i can't think of the
11:54 - name but um
11:56 - yeah it's the same uh button
11:59 - as this sideways s but
12:03 - it's the back tick portion so you do
12:06 - three of the back ticks then put
12:12 - example here and then you close it
12:16 - out with three more backticks
12:19 - and so let's see what it looks like
12:22 - in preview mode so preview changes
12:27 - let's zoom out and see you see how now
12:31 - it has its own little section right here
12:34 - the example here
12:35 - yes that's why code examples um
12:37 - specifically like using backticks
12:39 - is important because it really shows it
12:41 - as like
12:43 - code with i hope if you can't see what
12:45 - i'm talking about maybe
12:46 - bring your brightness down a little bit
12:48 - let's see can i bring my brightness down
12:51 - i feel like that doesn't help anything
12:54 - but yeah it creates these like little
12:56 - boxes this these like super light gray
12:58 - boxes
12:59 - around the code so that it really
13:01 - differentiates
13:02 - text from code and then i had provided
13:05 - different code examples two code
13:08 - examples and so
13:09 - it breaks them up into their own
13:12 - portions and so
13:13 - that's very important both for the look
13:15 - and also just the functionality of this
13:17 - readme
13:18 - and so let's go back to the editing
13:22 - of this go back to code examples
13:26 - and yeah now just take that out
13:29 - and so for me i wouldn't type this
13:33 - in readme specifically it i would just
13:36 - look through my app because
13:38 - the readme was always created after the
13:40 - app
13:41 - was finished always um
13:44 - if i if i was eager i would maybe put an
13:47 - about
13:48 - but really nothing else because the
13:49 - thing is
13:52 - you think you're creating one app and
13:54 - then a month goes by and you're finished
13:56 - and you realize it's a whole different
13:58 - app
13:58 - and so it's just better to leave things
14:00 - like readmes and all of that
14:02 - to the very end so that you're not in
14:04 - this loop of constantly editing your
14:06 - readmes and all of these
14:08 - different things so anyway
14:12 - yeah i would go into my code go into my
14:14 - project
14:15 - and find somewhere that i
14:18 - liked what i put you know and i would
14:22 - want it to be just a couple of lines
14:23 - like five to eight lines of code
14:26 - um and yeah make sure it was as
14:28 - efficient as possible something
14:30 - something to say like look like i write
14:32 - decent
14:34 - code for the level i'm in or something
14:36 - like that
14:37 - so then i would just copy and paste it
14:40 - and then put
14:41 - the backticks before before the back
14:43 - ticks
14:44 - after that coding section
14:48 - and so i did two different examples so
14:51 - that's why there's the two sets
14:53 - of the backticks i hope that made sense
14:56 - i
14:56 - really really hope it did but no we're
14:59 - just moving along here
15:00 - so next we have the piggy features
15:04 - this was where i provided the
15:07 - reader with what to expect with this app
15:10 - so input and track expenses visualize
15:14 - expenses through a colored
15:15 - donut chart and then provide finance and
15:18 - budgeting
15:19 - resources then i provided a to-do list
15:23 - part of the piggy features because i
15:26 - wanted to
15:27 - also just show that i have plans for
15:30 - this
15:30 - app i i don't consider myself done i
15:33 - never
15:34 - with specifically app development i
15:36 - never consider myself done
15:38 - it's app development and just
15:40 - development in general is something
15:41 - that you can constantly go at over and
15:45 - over
15:45 - so i always provided a to-do list and
15:48 - for here
15:49 - it was ad expense breakdown options
15:51 - labeling expense
15:52 - type status completed
15:56 - this app is built to carry out the
15:59 - crutch framework
16:00 - crud so crud stands for
16:03 - create read
16:07 - update delete basically
16:10 - every well maybe not every app but
16:13 - basically
16:14 - the core of most apps is to carry out
16:17 - the crud framework if you think about
16:18 - facebook
16:19 - instagram blogs you want to be able to
16:22 - create a post
16:23 - read other people's posts update your
16:27 - own posts or your own um what you call
16:29 - it
16:30 - wall or your own you know update
16:32 - pictures update any
16:34 - things like that or delete pictures
16:36 - delete post delete
16:38 - blog posts so that's really the
16:42 - base of um i say kind of every app but
16:46 - i may be wrong with every but with most
16:48 - apps that's the
16:50 - base you always want to see so yeah i
16:53 - say this app is built to carry out the
16:55 - crud framework
16:57 - then down here i say why i decided to
17:01 - create this specific app and it's the
17:04 - same thing
17:05 - um i shared with you all just moments
17:07 - ago
17:08 - because i care about financial literacy
17:11 - as a finance major myself
17:13 - and so i wanted to provide a resource
17:15 - for individuals to
17:18 - do the same to be their best
17:22 - selves when it comes to money habits and
17:24 - things like that
17:26 - then at the bottom here is some of the
17:29 - most important portions
17:30 - i would put a contact field in which
17:34 - i linked my name to my linkedin so
17:36 - created by
17:37 - and then my name in the brackets because
17:41 - i wanted it
17:42 - to directly link to my linkedin and so
17:44 - like my linkedin like url so it would be
17:47 - like slash like
17:48 - nia something like that and so
17:51 - then in the actual readme they'd be just
17:56 - able to click on my name it would take
17:58 - them to my linkedin
18:00 - then license so the license
18:04 - part is what allows
18:09 - other viewers other readers to
18:12 - use your code to develop with your code
18:14 - um
18:15 - but also say like hey you can't just
18:18 - steal this
18:19 - or you can maybe they can and that's
18:21 - okay with you i personally don't play
18:22 - those games
18:23 - but saying like yeah you can use this
18:26 - um but at the end of the day this is my
18:30 - work you can use it for your own
18:31 - learning and development and things like
18:33 - that but this
18:33 - is my work and so the license i'm going
18:37 - to have to look
18:38 - um here i'll make sure to actually
18:41 - provide a
18:42 - link to the license because i always use
18:44 - the same exact license every time
18:45 - so i'll provide a link to the license in
18:47 - the description box because i can't
18:50 - specifically remember i think i just
18:52 - searched
18:52 - github license types there were three
18:55 - main
18:56 - types i saw um like the three most
18:58 - popular ones and i chose one that i
19:01 - just preferred but um yeah i'll link the
19:04 - license
19:05 - um down in the description box that way
19:07 - it's just one less thing for you all to
19:09 - do
19:10 - and so yeah there we go and so then we
19:13 - would
19:14 - we would click commit changes i'm not
19:16 - going to go all the way down because
19:18 - some personal information is down there
19:20 - but um i'll just go into the preview
19:25 - that way you can see what it would look
19:27 - like
19:29 - so yeah oh shoot hold on
19:32 - wait a minute i am so sorry i forgot
19:36 - about the table of contents that is my
19:38 - bad y'all i'm so sorry so table of
19:40 - contents
19:41 - so table of contents i would go in
19:44 - and look at each of the sections i put
19:47 - in
19:47 - and in brackets place all of those
19:50 - sections
19:51 - here now we're talking about linking
19:54 - to link to outside resources we use the
19:57 - parentheses and the you know
19:59 - just the url to link inside
20:03 - your own readme you use a hashtag
20:06 - so you do i'll draw at the bottom here
20:09 - so i'll say
20:11 - example oh no hold on
20:15 - so i'll say example within brackets
20:18 - and then right away no space or anything
20:20 - right away you put parentheses
20:22 - and then you say whatever the name of
20:26 - that header
20:27 - was so example dash header
20:30 - there are no spaces allowed if there's a
20:32 - space you
20:34 - replace it with the dash so you see how
20:36 - about piggy
20:38 - has a space right here and the table of
20:40 - content name is about
20:42 - so to link to it
20:46 - i was i put hashtag about
20:49 - dash piggy then you see how underneath
20:52 - it's piggy walk through video
20:56 - and then but all i name it here in the
20:58 - table of contents is video
21:00 - so i would put hashtag piggy dash
21:03 - walkthrough dash video in the
21:06 - parentheses
21:07 - and so if we look at the preview again
21:11 - it would just be about video technology
21:14 - setup
21:14 - but it links to the different portions
21:19 - and so if i click it i'll wait
21:22 - let me get out of this so i will be
21:24 - right back
21:27 - hey all we're back so we have our table
21:31 - of contents
21:31 - let's say i want to jump right into code
21:34 - examples right away
21:36 - so i click code examples and it jumps
21:38 - you see how the screen
21:39 - jumps to that section and so now if i
21:43 - scroll
21:44 - back up i see all the other sections
21:46 - that were before it
21:48 - and i can you know go back to table of
21:50 - contents if i want to jump to the
21:52 - license
21:53 - i click license boom jumps right
21:56 - to the license the license is the last
21:59 - part of the page and so that's why it's
22:01 - not like up here because there's nothing
22:03 - to show below that but anyway
22:07 - but yeah so it jumps the license that's
22:09 - why the table of contents is important
22:11 - it
22:12 - is just a nice efficient way of
22:15 - providing the user with a more seamless
22:17 - easy experience and you know we're
22:20 - developers y'all like all we want to do
22:22 - is provide
22:22 - seamless efficient experiences to our
22:24 - users and so that does
22:26 - not change with readme and honestly if
22:28 - you're looking at
22:29 - you know companies and things like that
22:31 - it's that shows them that like no you
22:33 - think about the user
22:35 - process first you think about their
22:37 - experience first and they see that in
22:39 - these examples
22:40 - features piggy features boom
22:43 - just so i can show you just a little bit
22:45 - of the license
22:46 - i think you guys would appreciate seeing
22:48 - that this is what it is
22:50 - so the license is a you know for me it
22:53 - was like just a general license
22:56 - and yeah it provides like the rights and
22:59 - copyrights and
23:00 - the yada yada yada so make sure you're
23:02 - putting that
23:03 - in your readme because if you're
23:05 - building the next uber we don't want
23:07 - someone
23:08 - you know from down the hall who just
23:10 - stumbled upon your readme
