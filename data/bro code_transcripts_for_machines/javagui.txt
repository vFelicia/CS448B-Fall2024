hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well this is my new and improved java swing tutorial series and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a simple jframe that we can later add components to so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody so let's create a jframe so a jframe is a gui window to add components to we're not going to be adding any components in this video but in the next video we're going to cover labels so to begin let's create an instance of a jframe so jframe let's call this frame equals new j frame so this creates a frame for us an instance of a frame however we'll need an import so we'll add that at the top import java x dot swing dot j frame so if we were to run this it's actually not visible so we need to set the visibility to true so we'll add that the end frame dot set visible and we're going to set this to true so this will make frame visible so we can actually see it now however it is very small so let's increase the size so we can do that by saying the name of the frame dot set size so we can pass in a dimension or a width and a height and this is in integers so let's say this frame will be 420 by 420 because 420 is a funny number so this sets the x dimension and y dimension of our frame and this should be visible now here's our jframe let's set some other things let's change the title so we can do that by saying frame dot set title and we can set this to a string i'll call this j frame title goes here and this will display at the top so set this to whatever you want your title for your window to be so this sets title of frame now pay attention to this so when we hit this x button in the corner it's going to actually hide our frame but not actually close out of the program so if you want to close out of the program and exit we're going to change a setting we're going to use frame dot set default close operation and we're going to set this to jframe dot exit on close so when we hit that x button it's going to exit out of application and by default it's normally hide on close so it appears that we killed the application but it's still running in the background otherwise there is do nothing on close and you can actually prevent somebody from hitting the x button to close out of the frame which is actually kind of annoying but that's how you can do that but let's set this back to exit on close because we want to exit out of the application when we hit that x button now another thing that we can do is that we can resize our window so we can actually prevent that so we're going to say frame dot set resizable false what this will do is prevent frame from being resized so we can no longer resize this even if we tried we can no longer make this full screen either with the maximize button so here's something else for you guys how do we change the icon for the top left of our frame window normally it's the java logo but we can actually change that to something that suits our program better so i'm actually going to use the logo for my channel and change the icon from the java logo to my logo so if you want feel free to pause the video and download an image that you might want to use here's my logo i'm going to change the icon of my frame to this logo instead of the default java logo so what i'm going to do is copy this go to my project folder and then paste it so then we're going to create an image icon out of this so image then icon let's call this image just image equals new image icon and then we're going to list either the file path or the file name since this is within my project folder i only have to list the file name so this file name is logo.png logo.png and then we're going to need another import so java x dot swing dot image icon at the top so this will create an image icon and now what we're going to do is set the image icon of the frame so we'll say frame dot set icon image and within the parentheses of this method here we're going to say image dot get image so this will change icon of frame so then if we tried this our image is now at the top left of our frame in place of the java logo that was there by default pretty cool huh now let's change the background color of our frame so what we're going to do is that we're going to say frame dot get content pain we're going to have to do a little bit of method chaining followed by dot set background and then you can place a color within here so there's a few basic colors such as color dot let's say green and then we're going to need an import as well so make sure to include this at the top java.awt.color so this will change color of background so now this window should be green however you might not like some of the default colors you can create a custom color too so within the set background method we're going to say new color and we have a few options we can place some rgb values here or a hexadecimal color value so let's begin with some rgb values so all zeros this is black so the background is now black and this is on the range from 0 to 255 with 255 for all three values is just white so the first value is the amount of red and you can see it's as bright red as you can make it really the second value is green so that's 255 and remember this is on a range of 0 to 255 and the last one is blue so you can adjust the amount of red green and blue that you want so i'm just going to make up some random numbers 123 50 250. i have no idea what color this is so oh i actually really like that that's like a twitch purple so to say i think i'm keeping that actually i'm going to remember this number 123 50 250. all right you can also place a hexadecimal value here so you say 0x and then it's a series of six values so all zeroes would be black otherwise all f's would be white and if you don't believe me i'll prove you wrong so you can always go to google and look up hexadecimal color values and you can pick a color that you want so 1 2 3 4 5 6 would be this shade of blue which is actually pretty sweet uh otherwise you can really pick any color you want and put that here and the last thing that i got for you guys today in this video is that there are two i would say different ways in which you can create a frame the first is just to create an instance of a frame and give it a name and then you can change all of the members and properties of this frame by just saying the name of the frame dot and then whatever change you want to make the other way is that you can use a jframe as a parent class to a child class so i'll show you how to do that because i do this quite often in this tutorial series so what we're going to do is actually create another class that's going to be a child class of jframe so go to your source folder then go to file new class and i'll call this my frame so my frame extends j frame this is the subclass or child class and jframe is the parent class also known as the super class then we're going to need this import at the top as well so the other way in which we can create a jframe i'm actually going to copy this turn all of this into a comment because we won't really need it right now and then i'm going to create a constructor for my frame so this constructor is going to be called when we create an instance of my frame and i'm going to paste everything within here however we're going to replace the name of our frame and take out that line as well so instead of saying frame dot set title we're actually going to replace the word frame with the word this so an easy way that you can make these changes is go to edit find replace and we're going to replace frame with this and replace all so replace the word frame or whatever else you called your frame at this point with this and we're going to create an instance of the my frame class so we'll do that here so we're going to say my frame instead of jframe and let's call this my frame equals new my frame and this will do the exact same thing as all of this code where it creates a basically a duplicate of the frame we had so you don't necessarily need to create a name for this instance if you don't plan on using this name for anything so one thing that we can also do is take out this portion of the code if we don't really plan on using the name or a name for your my frame you can just say new my frame and this works as well however if you need to make some changes within this class to your my frame you might have to actually create a name for it all right so that's the basics of frames in java if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how you can create a frame in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button
