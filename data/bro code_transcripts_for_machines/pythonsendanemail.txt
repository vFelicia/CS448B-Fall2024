hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can send an email using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show oh a quick note for you all you're going to need a gmail account to sign into as well as your username and password so once you have those set you're ready to begin all right let's begin by importing the simple mail transfer protocol library we'll need a couple variables to hold strings let's say we have a sender a receiver a password a subject for your email as well as a body for the email okay sender is going to be you signing the email so enter your email in here i'm just going to make up one you at gmail.com actually sender would be better i would say let me change that sender gmail.com let's say we have a receiver this is who you're going to send the email to receiver gmail.com don't actually enter in these emails use your own or the person that you intend to send the email to for your test because these will probably not work i'm assuming then enter the password for your gmail account so let's say password123 and a subject uh let's say python email test and a body what do you want to say within your email i wrote an email okay so that should be good so remember that you're going to want to change these to your actual gmail account and you'll want to send it to a valid email address too and make sure that you use your password for your gmail account okay now we're going to create a header for our email and the syntax on this is a little strange we're going to say message f and then triple quotes so what this triple quotes is is that a triple quote string can span multiple lines of text so the first thing we'll enter is from within our header from and then since we're using an fstring we can insert a variable at a given location when we insert a pair of these curly braces so from will be sender the next line to colon receiver then the next line subject colon subject this will be the title of the email then i'm going to add a new line and then insert the body and if you want you can give yourself a name when you send this email let's say maybe snoop dogg and if there's somebody you want to send the email to and give them a name you can say like nicholas cage but these aren't necessary okay so we have our header completed let me just add a note that this is our header okay we're going to create a server object server equals smtp lib dot smtp there are two arguments the first is smtp the other argument is the port number and that is going to be 587 that is the default mail submission port 587 now we're going to take our server object and start tls transport layer security okay now we need to log in so server dot login we will pass in our sender email that's us as well as our password password and let's print logged in we'll eventually place all this within a try and accept block later all right and then to send an email type server.send mail and we pass in our self sender receiver and our message sender comma receiver comma message and let's print a confirmation print email has been sent now if you were to run this program you may encounter this error smtp authentication error that either means your username password combination was not correct or you need to turn on the less secure app access on your gmail account which you can find here however i would recommend turning that back off when you're done with this program just because your account will be less secure and i'm not liable if you get hacked hey you know what let's place this code within a try block we will try all of this code and then if we encounter this exception we can catch and handle it properly so we will try these four lines of code and we will handle our exception of smt lib dot smtp authentication error that means we could not sign in so let's print unable to sign in so i'm going to run this one more time and instead of getting that ugly error we should get a simple message that says unable to sign in once you have the proper username password combination for your gmail account and if you need to set less secure app access to on but make sure that you turn it back off when you're done with this you should be able to send an email let's try it logged in email has been sent here is a snapshot of the email that i received i blurred out my actual email because i don't want it public because some of you guys are weird so we have our sender our receiver and i gave myself a nickname of snoop dogg that's why it says snoop to nicholas the receiver but you don't actually need a name for these as long as you have the sender and receiver fields filled in you should be good we have our subject python email test as well as our body i wrote an email well everybody that's how to write and send a simple email using python if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below but yeah that's how to send a simple email using python you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if
