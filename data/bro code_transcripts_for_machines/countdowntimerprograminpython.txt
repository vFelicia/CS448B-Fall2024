what is going on everybody in today's topic we're going to be creating a countdown timer in Python we'll be using what we learned in the previous topics let's begin we'll need to import the time module there's a pretty cool function within the time module that is the sleep function type time dot sleep add a set of parentheses within the set of parentheses our program will essentially sleep for a given amount of seconds like three after three seconds let's print something this is just a demonstration times up when I execute this code nothing happens for three seconds but after three seconds passes it displays our message time's up so you can use the sleep function of the time module to sleep for a given amount of time we will ask the user how long would they like to set the timer for we will create a variable let's say my time my time will be in seconds we will create a prompt enter the time in seconds then we should Typecast our input as an integer we'll need to create a loop we could use either a while loop or a for Loop there's a lot of overlap where you could use either one I'll use a for Loop in this case four will need some sort of counter X in our range 0 through my time after each iteration we will sleep for one second Let's test what we have so far I would like to sleep for three seconds I think that's approximately three but now we are going to print whatever X's print x x is our counter zero one two times up we're getting somewhere but I would like to count backwards what we could do is enclose our range function within the Reversed function but another technique that we can use is by using a step let's replace zero with my time then end at zero but we will set the step to be negative one then we can increment backwards using this function that's another technique too to count backwards so let's wait for three seconds three two one time's up now let's display a digital clock of some sort but we would have to calculate how many hours minutes and seconds there are so let's calculate seconds seconds equals x x is our counter remember modulus 60. within our print statement we'll use an F string we are displaying hours minutes and seconds I'll add some placeholders for each of these fields we have seconds with our digital clock we can't go above 60 for either seconds or minutes that's why I'm using modulus 60. the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division let's begin at 11. so 11 10 9. so it is counting down but I would like to add some zero padding and we can do that with the format specifier after seconds I will add colon I need to display two digits then zero pad those digits let's try that again I will wait for 11 seconds 11 10 9. yeah and we do have some zero padding so that's looking more and more like a digital clock let's add minutes then so to calculate minutes let's assign variable minutes equal to x divided by 60 because there's 60 seconds within a minute but then I'm going to type cast the result as an integer modulus 60. we would not like this field of minutes to go above 60. so let's add a placeholder we're displaying minutes format specifier zero two now I'm going to wait for 65 seconds that is one minute and five seconds then I just want to be sure that we go below a minute yep it's working then let's calculate hours oh by the way to stop your program from running hit this red square up in the corner let's calculate hours equals x divided by three thousand six hundred there's three thousand six hundred seconds in an hour then we will Typecast the result as an integer within our F string we will display hours format specifier zero two then I will run this program let's wait for three thousand six hundred five seconds that is one hour and five seconds and I just want to be sure that we go below one hour yeah all right so that works so the reason that I didn't add modulus 24 I don't have days within my F string we can display any amount of hours I will exclude modulus 24. all right everybody well I thought that'd be some good practice with working with loops we should try and do as many exercises as we can and yeah that is a countdown timer program in Python
