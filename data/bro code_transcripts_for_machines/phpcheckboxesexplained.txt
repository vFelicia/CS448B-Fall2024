well hello again everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can work with check boxes in PHP we need a form element I have the action attribute set to my PHP file index.php for the method I'm using post to create a checkbox we can use a selfclosing input tag the type will be check box and here it is if we were to use post we will get a key value pair from this checkbox element the key will be equal to our name attribute let's say that the name is pizza and for the value let's say pizza I'm going to capitalize the value just so that it's easier to differentiate between the key and the value the name is the key the value as well the value then let's add some text Pizza break element not sure why Google wants to translate this but okay let's copy these two lines of markup then paste them three additional times the second button will be hamburger the third will be hot dog the fourth will be taco let's change the names the values and the text the second checkbox is hamburger then hot dog then Taco here are the four check boxes then we'll need a submit button input type equal submit for the name that will be submit as well now within our PHP script when I press this button I would like to execute some code after we press the submit button I will enclose all of my code with an if statement we will check to see if our submit button is set we'll use the is set function we'll use the post variable we are accessing submit if we click the submit button then do stuff to check to see if a checkbox is set we can use the is set function again we'll use an if statement if is set now we are examining the key of pizza whatever the name attribute is set to if Pizza is set if it's checked what we want to do let's simply Echo you like pizza when I press Pizza click submit we will display you like pizza let's do this with the other check boxes let's copy this if statement paste it three times then we'll check the other Keys we have hamburger you like hamburgers hot dog you like hot dogs taco you like tacos oh then let me add a break after each of these sentences because I forgot to do that now I can press any combination of these check boxes if one of these check boxes is checked we'll execute one of these if statements you like pizza you like hot dogs you like tacos alternatively we can determine to see if a checkbox is empty using the empty function let's copy our if statements change is set to empty empty empty empty if Pizza is unchecked if it's empty we'll Echo you don't like pizza do this for hamburgers you don't like hamburgers hot dogs you don't like hot dogs and Tacos you don't like tacos if I were to click pizza and Tacos again then submit you like pizza you like tacos you don't like hamburgers you don't like hot dogs that's one way in which you can check to see if a check box is set you can use the is set function to determine if it's set or empty to determine if it's empty you can place all of these check boxes in an array but they would all need the same name attribute let's rename the name attribute to foods for all of these check boxes then add a set of straight brackets after each these will all be placed within an array let's get rid of our if statements after pressing the submit button let's create a Foods array then we will get via post the key name which is Foods Foods is technically going to be an array to prove it let's Echo Foods then see what happens Pizza hamburger hot dog taco warning a right to string conversion so Foods is an array we can access elements of an array with an index number Foods at index 0 that would be Pizza one is hamburger two is hot dog three is Taco four should be out of bounds undefined array key for you can Loop through all of the elements of an array using a for each Loop for each list your array Foods as food then let's Echo each food then I will add a break Pizza hamburger hot dog taco all right everybody so that's how to work with check boxes in PHP the type set to checkbox the name attribute will be the key and the value as well the value you do have the option of placing all of these check boxes in the same group they would need the same name then add a set of square brackets after and well everybody that's how to work with check boxes and PHP
