hey guys in this video we're going to create a game of rock paper scissors using javascript so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right then everybody in this video we're going to be creating a game of rock paper scissors we'll be using html elements javascript code and styling with css let's head to our html document i'll create a div section to contain our game div id equals i'll name this game div we'll close it i'll create three labels one for the player the computer and the result who won these will be h1 header tags i'll give each of these header tags a class class equals game text i'll give the first h1 header tag a unique id of player text the second header tag will be computer text third will be result text the first h1 header tag will have this initial text player colon space then computer colon space result colon space let's add three buttons for rock paper scissors button close it each of these buttons will have a class class equals choice button we'll need three buttons add some text rock paper scissors that's everything for now let's head to our javascript file let's select all of the elements that we'll need we'll begin with the player text const player text equals document dot query selector we are selecting an id that id was player text we'll select the computer text const computer text the id was computer text we'll select the result text construct result text the id was result text then we will select all of the buttons const choice buttons equals document dot query selector all we are selecting the choice button class we'll create three variables let player to store the player's choice let computer for the computer's random choice let result to display who won we'll iterate over our choice buttons using the for each method choice buttons for each we'll use an arrow function expression for each button within our choice buttons array we will use an arrow function i'm going to add an event listener to each of these buttons within the arrow function expression button dot add event listener the event is click when we click on a button we're going to do something within the ad event listener we'll add a second arrow function expression there are no arguments arrow then we're going to do a bunch of stuff so let's expand this when we click on a button what are we going to do let's take our player this is our player's choice set the sequel to whatever button we select and get the text content if we click on this rock button then our player variable contains the string rock same thing goes with paper and scissors if we select those then we will invoke the computer's turn computer turn function we'll need to declare this function outside of our for each method let's declare this computer turn function function computer turn we'll select a random number between 1 and 3. constrained number equals math dot floor we'll need a random number math.random method there's only three choices we'll multiply this by three then add one this will give us a random number between one and three we can examine this random number with a switch switch rand number we'll find any matching cases case one computer will equal the string rock then break case two computer equals paper case three computer equals scissors and that's it for the computer turn function the player variable will be assigned a string as well as the computer next what we'll need to do is set the text with our choices player text dot text content equals i'll use a template literal player colon space i'll add a placeholder player let's do the same thing with computer computer text text content computer computer then the results text results text dot text content we will set the sequel to invoke a check winner function we'll need to define this function let's do that after the computer turn function function check winner first we'll compare if our player and computer strings are the same if player is equal to computer we will return a value this will be a string draw it's a tie else if computer is equal to rock going to return then use the ternary operator our condition is if player is equal to paper question mark if the computer is equal to rock is the player equal to paper if so then we will return a string you win if this condition is false we'll return a different string u lose okay let's create another else if statement else if computer is equal to paper and the player is equal to scissors add another elsif statement else if the computer is equal to scissors and the player is equal to rock and that should be it let's test it okay rock it's a draw paper you lose scissors you win all right so that is the logic of our game hey for fun let's style this using css let's begin with our game development that surrounds our game let's take this id we will style game div it's an id i'll set the font family to brush script mt if my web browser can't display this font i'll have a fallback of cursive i'll add a border border 3 pixels solid i'll round the corners border radius 25 pixels that's better but let's add some padding padding 10 pixels is good i'll add a background color background dash color maybe light gray i'll align the text in the center text align center okay we're getting somewhere let's select these buttons they all have the same class that class is choice button i like to add classes at the top choice button class let's change the line height to 30 pixels then set a width because all of these buttons have different widths to accommodate the text i would like them all to be uniform width of 150 pixels is good let's expand this a little bit there let's select our player text id player text i'll change the color of the text color pick a color i'll be blue let's do the same thing with computer text id computer text i think the computer should be red okay let's try this one last time rock paper scissors well alright everybody that is a basic game of rock paper scissors for beginners if you would like a copy of my javascript code as well as the html and the css markup i'll post all of this in the comments section down below and pin it to the top be sure to check underneath the original video in the playlist but yeah that is a basic game of rock paper scissors using javascript
