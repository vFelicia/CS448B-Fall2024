hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be writing files in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm so to begin it's kind of similar to the last video on reading files with open within the open function list the file name or the file path so what do you want to call this file i will call this file test.txt now normally with the open function there is a mode and you can actually change that there's a second argument that you can pass in by default this is r for read but if you want to write a file this would be w so now we're going to write a file called test.txt so to finish with open as file what are we going to do file dot write and within the write function we can write some text so let's create a text variable and we will add a string so let's say text equals yo and if you need to go down to a new line be sure to use the new line character so after this new line character the text that comes after is going to be on the next line as if we're hitting enter so yo this is some text have a good one all right so after i run this program we should have a file a text file within our project folder that appears and it is right here and it says yo this is some text have a good one now this is in write mode if this text was something else it will actually overwrite your current file so if i were to change this to uh oh this text has been over written well then this will overwrite the text that we have uh oh this text has been overwritten so you can actually append a file by changing the mode to a for append so let me change this back we will rewrite this this will save over our current file now we can append some text so let's add maybe a new line uh have a nice day see ya so i would like to append some text to this file i'm going to change the mode to a for append and we can now append some text onto the end of this file well everybody that's how to write to a file and or append a file if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how to write to and or append a file in python
