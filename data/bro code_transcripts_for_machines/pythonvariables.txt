hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how variables work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right let's do this a variable is a container for a value it behaves as the value that it contains it's much like in algebra lessons back in the day where we had to solve for whatever value x was and then we can reuse x and it behaved exactly as that value well with programming we can do that plus we can assign variables of different data types so they are not limited to just numbers we can assign whole words numbers and even these things called booleans which are either true or false but i'll get more in depth into data types a little bit later on in this video so let's create a variable and this is how to do so we need a unique name for this variable let's say name name equals some value now the first data type that we'll cover is strings a string is a series of characters so to create a string we can either use single quotes or double quotes in python and we can assign this a value of whatever your own name is so i will assign this variable name a value of bro now this variable will behave exactly as if it was this value this name and then we can reuse this variable for something so let's print whatever our name is print name and this will print whatever your name is to the console window now when you print your variable make sure you don't put it within quotes because what we're doing then is literally printing the word name as you can see here so if you need to use your variable for something make sure it's not within quotes now we can combine our string variable with another string so within our print statement let's print a string literal such as hello space plus name so we are combining strings and then we're printing the results to the console window so this will print hello bro now you can actually check the data type of a variable so i'm going to turn this line into a comment so what you'll do is take the name of the variable surround this with a set of parentheses and then precede the set of parentheses with the type function and this will print the data type of this variable to the console window and you can see that it says class str short for string a string is a series of characters a name is a good example of a string a series of characters so that is how to check the data type of a variable just use the type function now you can actually combine variables together as long as they're of the same data type so let's change our name to maybe first name and we'll create a second variable called last name now a common naming convention with variables if it has two words separate each word with an underscore it's not necessary but it's common practice for python and honestly i sometimes forget about that but don't tell anybody so let's create another variable called last name last name equals whatever your last name is and then let's create a third variable called full name full underscore name and let's combine first name plus last name and let us display full name along with hello plus full name now these two names were combined together to create a whole new variable actually what i think i'll do is add a space within my variable so i'm doing a bunch of string concatenation i'm combining the variable first name plus a space character plus last name so the result is hello whatever your first name and last name is so that is a variable of the string data type it is a series of characters now with strings we cannot normally use these for any sort of math that's where the next data type comes in for the time being i just turned all of these lines into comments and we are going to move on to the int data type short for integer this time let's create a variable called age and we will assign this a value of whatever your age is let's just say that i'm 21 now when you assign a value of the int data type make sure that it is not within quotes because then technically it would be a string then and you can see that the color scheme for this number actually changed so if this was a string we would treat it different than an int data type because with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math so we now have a variable called edge and we can actually increase or decrease or do whatever we want with the edge let's increase our age by one let's say it's our birthday to do so we would say age equals edge plus one and then let's print our age to the console window print edge and you can see that it says i am 22. now there's a shorthand way of writing this what you'll do is type age plus equals one so that's kind of like a shortcut and this would work the same too now let's print the data type of our age variable because we can within a print statement i will print the edge and add my edge variable to this type function and this will print the data type of my edge variable to the console window and i will turn this line into a comment just so that it doesn't get in the way now if i were to print the data type of my age variable as you can see it is of the int data type short for integer it only stores a whole integer number now what if this was a string so what i'm going to do is surround my value within a set of quotes and i will turn this line into a comment so that it does not get in the way you can see that the data type of my age variable is now a string and with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math so let's attempt to increase our age variable by one and we ran into an error a type error can only concatenate string to string not end now the point being is that it's important to use the appropriate data type because with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math you'll want to use a data type of a numeric value an int or a float which we'll discuss a little bit later now here's a situation to consider what if we would like to display our edge variable along with a string literal much like what we did with this line involving a string literal such as hello plus the user's full name so let's attempt to do so and this is not going to work and i'll explain why so within our print statement let's say something such as your age is plus edge now we're going to run into a type error that's because we attempted to use string concatenation with a string literal and a variable of a different data type a variable of the int data type in order to display our edge along with the string we would need to convert our edge variable to the string data type and one way in which we can do that is by type casting and we'll cover this more in the next video so we're going to surround our age variable that is of the in data type with a set of parentheses and precede this with str short for string and this will convert our variable to a string that will allow us to display it with another string now if we were to run this program this way this will now display your age is and in this case 22 so if you need to display a variable of a different data type along with the string you would just need to use a string cast to convert that data type to a string but we'll cover this more in the next video on typecasting so that is the int data type it stores a whole integer number and the next data type is the float data type and i'm going to turn these lines into comments and we can move on now the float data type is a numeric value that can store a number that includes a decimal portion an int data type cannot store a decimal portion that's why it's in short for integer it only stores a whole number this time let's say we have a height and i will assign this a perfectly normal height of maybe 250.5 centimeters so this decimal portion is important that's indicating that this is a floating point number a float for short so let's print our height to the console window print height and this will print whatever my height is and now let's check the type of our height using the type function so within a print statement i'm going to add my height surround this with another set of parentheses and precede this with the type function and the data type of my variable height is a float short for a floating point number a numeric value that contains a decimal portion and now for practice let's print our height along with a string literal so let's create a string literal such as your height is plus height but guess what we're going to do some type casting so surround height with a set of parentheses and precede this with str so that we convert height to a string so that we can use string concatenation within this print statement and this will print the message your height is 250.5 actually let's add centimeters to the end so plus cm and there we go and that is what a floating point number is float for short it is a numeric value that contains a decimal portion now the last data type that we're going to cover is the boolean data type it is a variable that can only store true or false let's say we have a variable called human if we were to assign this a boolean value this would be either true or false and we can print whatever this value is let's print whatever human is and this will display false now the reason that you may want to use booleans instead of strings even though you can still store a string representation of the word false or true is that these are very useful when we get to if statements we can check to see if some statement is true so that is a good use of boolean values now let's check the data type of my human variable so let's print type human and this will print to the console window bool short for boolean now make sure you're not putting this within quotes because then it's technically a string and they behave differently now the data type is a string and you may have noticed as well that the font color has changed between strings and boolean values so that's another good indicator now what if you need to display your value along with a string using string concatenation well guess what we're going to typecast again so let's print something are you a human so we need to use string concatenation so i will convert my boolean variable of human to a string and i have been programmed to inform you that yes i am in fact a human that is true well everyone that is the basics of variables it is a container for a value and they behave as the value that they contain there are four basic data types strings which store a series of characters ins which store a whole integer floats which are floating point numbers a numeric value with a decimal and booleans which only store true or false and they're very useful with if statements so that is it for variables if you would like a copy of all this code i will copy and paste all of this to the comments section down below but yeah that is how variables work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
