hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the grid pain container in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay we're talking about the grid paint today grid panes are found underneath the containers drop down menu it's a flexible grid of rows and columns to arrange different nodes so we have two columns and three rows to begin with if you were to right click on grid pane then go to grid pane we can add rows and columns let's say that i would like to create a game of tictactoe and i need three rows and three columns so i will add a column i now have three rows and three columns so we can drag and drop nodes into each individual region so let's say we have a button now the defaults for adding nodes is that these nodes will stick to the middle left but we can change that by going to the alignment and each alignment when you click on one of these nodes so we can change this to top center bottom left center right wherever you need or you can expand these but they will not expand to take up more room than the grid that they're in their individual cell now by heading to the grid pane constraints region of your layout drop down menu you can change the index of a node after you click on it currently my button is at row 0 column 0 but you can change that let's say row one column zero row two column zero row two column one row two column two so that would work or you can drag and drop it to a different cell within your grid another important note is that if you adjust the dimensions of your grid pane each cell of your grid pane will adjust as well i will click on my grid pane head to layout and change the dimensions if i need this grid to be an even square let's change the width to 500 and the height to 500 as well so each cell within my grid pane is an even square and within the properties drop down menu you can display grid lines between each of these cells by clicking this check box grid lines visible and if we preview this we have our button and then grid lines between each of these cells too so let's copy and paste our node and drag and drop it to each individual cell within our grid pane i think i'm going to get rid of these grid lines between each of these cells let's preview and i have a grid of nine cells each contains a button so this could work as some sort of framework for tictactoe or maybe even a calculator but you'd probably need to add more buttons you can also add a horizontal gap between each of these columns and a vertical gap between each row click on your grid pane then head to layout and we will change the h gap so if you type in a number you will add that amount of pixels as space between each column with an h gap and then v gap will add a vertical gap between each of these rows and it looks a little something like this all right everybody so that is a grid pane it's a flexible grid of rows and columns in which we can lay out nodes if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
