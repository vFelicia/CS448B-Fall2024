hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain a raise in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody so arrays think of an array as a variable but it can store multiple values not just one so i have the string variable named car and it contains the name of a car bmw so what we could do is turn this variable into an array so it can store multiple values and this is all you have to do after the data type add a set of square brackets and then surround all of the values with a set of curly braces boom you got yourself an array and that's all there is to it so you can add multiple values to this array named car and actually i'm going to rename this as cars so it's plural so that we know that there's multiple values within here so let's separate each value with a comma so let's say we have a bmw a mustang as well as a corvette okay then let's display what cars is with a right line statement console the right line cars so this is what appears we have the data type of our array instead of the values within the array so if you need to access an element that is an item from an array you need to add after the variable name well the array name a set of square brackets and then the index so computers they always start with zero the first element would be zero so place that number within the square brackets cars at index zero and the first element would be bmw so let's display the other elements let's just copy what we have okay let's display cars at index one that will be this value because this is index zero and that is mustang then the next value cars at index two and that is corvette so let's take a look to see what happens if i attempt to access an element that doesn't exist so cars at index three so that would be something beyond corvette so we'll actually run into an error we ran into an index out of range exception so arrays do have a fixed size you have to make sure that you're not accessing an element that doesn't exist now if you need to update an element within an array all you have to do is type the array name in this case it would be cars straight brackets and list the index so if i need to change the first element within my array i will say my iran name cars at index zero equals let's place a tesla there instead and then run this so instead of a bmw in the first position index zero we have a tesla so if you need to access or update an element within an array type the array name straight brackets and then the index and remember that these only start with zero so what we've done here to display the elements of an array is that we wrote a writeline statement for each individual element so a much better approach would be to iterate over our array using a for loop and later on i'll explain the for each loop so to display all of the elements of our array easily let's create a for loop so we'll say into i equals 0 will continue this as long as i is less than now arrays have a length property so type the name of the array dot length then i plus plus to increment our index okay with our right line statement let's display cars straight brackets and the index is going to be i so i is 0 for the first iteration then during the next iteration it will be 1 then 2 and then it will stop because this statement will no longer be true ok let's try this again so we have tesla mustang and corvette so an easy way to display the elements of an array is to write a for loop and set the index equal to i whatever you have right here but we'll have to discuss the for each loop coming up in a later video one thing that you should know with arrays is that they have a fixed size if you would like to declare an array and then assign values later you'll need to declare that array with a fixed size of how many elements you're planning to place within that array so that would look something like this let's turn this line into a comment and this is how to declare an array so type the data type square brackets the name of the array equals new the data type again square brackets and then within this set of square brackets we will list a size so if i plan on adding no more than three elements to this array i can place three here but you can make this a larger size to accommodate more values and if you don't use those values they'll just remain empty no big deal and this will work the same as before and then we'll just have to update some values so cars at index zero one and two zero is a tesla one is a mustang and two is a corvette and this will pretty much work the same as before instead of just in one step declaring and assigning an array we have done it in two steps we declared the array and then assigned some values later well okay then everybody that is an array it's a variable that can store multiple values and they have a fixed size so that's something you need to pay attention to if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well those are arrays in c sharp
