hey guys in this topic we're going to create a banking program for practice we'll be able to deposit money withdraw money and show a balance this is more or less just for practice let's begin by creating our functions void show balance there will be one parameter double balance whatever our bank account balance is we'll show it the return type is double deposit no parameters double withdraw and there will be one parameter double balance let's fill in a few things within the main function double balance and i will go ahead and set this to zero as well as int choice i will set that to zero as well we'll use a switch to determine if the user wants to show their balance make a deposit a withdrawal or exit let's display some output some prompts standard output enter your choice and i'm just going to add some text decorations because i think that'll be cool maybe a bunch of asterisks and one more okay we have option one one show balance two will be deposit money three is withdrawal money four will be exit then we'll accept some user input standard input choice now we're going to create a switch we're examining the user's choice switch we're examining our choice against many matching cases we have case one case two three four then a default case okay case one the user wants to show their balance we'll invoke the show balance function but we need to pass in our balance balance and then we are going to break case two the user wants to deposit money so we're going to take our balance equals balance plus our deposit function so deposit will return a double right here so we're going to add that to our balance once we verify it actually we can shorten this to balance plus equals whatever value is returned with the deposit function then we are going to break case three withdraw money balance minus equals the withdraw function pass in our balance we're withdrawing money from our balance once we verify it then we're going to break we'll exit with case 4 i'll display some output standard output thanks for visiting then i'm going to break okay default case standard output invalid choice okay now we're going to place all of this code within a do while loop do all of this while some condition is true so let's take all this code cut it put it within that do while loop let me just format this a little bit the condition will be while choice does not equal four four is what we used to exit we'll need to add some function definitions but i'm going to fill these in later we'll need to return something so let's return zero for the time being for two of these functions at least return zero okay let's run and compile this just to test our do while loop okay enter your choice uh one show balance that doesn't show our balance yet but it will deposit money withdraw now we should be able to exit by pressing four thanks for visiting okay so we know that the do while loop is working let's fill in our functions let's begin with show balance now with the show balance function we're receiving our balance as an argument so i'm going to display standard output your balance is dollar sign or some other currency if you choose i'll display our balance then add a new line so let's say we have 123 dollars in our account i'm going to show my balance 123. even but i would like to display cents i'll need two decimal places after the decimal so there's one thing we can include we'll include this header file include io man ip there's a function in here to set some precision for floating point numbers i'm going to make this change after the dollar sign standard set precision pass in 2 for 2 decimal places then add standard fixed this will display our balance up to 2 decimal places after the decimal point so let's try that again okay show balance 123 dollars and zero cents if i were to change this to 123.01 we should display two decimal places yep 123 dollars and one cent okay that is the show balance function let's work on the deposit function okay now we're within the deposit function i'm going to create a local variable named amount set this equal to zero we'll ask the user how much they would like to deposit standard output enter amount to be deposited standard input r amount so i'm gonna set balance back to zero then let's test it show balance one your balance is zero dollars and zero cents i would like to make a deposit uh 420 69 cents okay now i would like to show my balance after we make a deposit so within case two after making a deposit let's show our balance pass in the balance variable now let's do so after withdrawal 2. okay let's try that again show balance zero dollars zero cents make a deposit 420 69 cents your balance is zero dollars and zero cents so what we're going to do is return our amount at the end of this function return amount 420 dollars 69 cents all right we have our balance the user is able to enter in negative money enter amount to be deposited negative one thousand your balance is now negative one thousand dollars we need to prevent somebody from making a negative deposit so before we return our amount let's use an if statement if amount is greater than zero then we will return the amount else standard output that's not a valid amount then let's return zero okay let's try that again deposit money negative one thousand dollars that's not a valid amount your balance is zero dollars i'm just going to add a new line like right here then let's make a legitimate deposit deposit money i will deposit one thousand dollars in one cent your balance is one thousand dollars and one cent okay that is the deposit function that is complete then we have the withdrawal function we'll create a local variable named amount of the double data type we'll create a prompt standard output enter amount to be withdrawn standard input amount at the end of this program we will return amount okay let's test it okay i need to deposit some money first i will deposit one thousand dollars and one cent then let's withdraw money i will withdraw one hundred dollars and one cent my new balance is nine hundred dollars but we can overdraw our account still so i'm going to withdraw a million dollars and one cent our balance shouldn't be negative so let's prevent our user from overdrafting their account within our withdrawal function let's add an if statement if amount is greater than our balance will display insufficient funds then we will return zero okay i'm going to withdraw one million dollars and one cent insufficient funds your balance is zero okay now what if the user would like to deposit negative money withdraw money negative one thousand your balance is one thousand dollars we'll need to make sure that the amount is a legitimate amount i'll add an elsif statement if amount is less than zero standard output that's not a valid amount now else we will return the amount to be withdrawn then within the elsif statement we'll need to return zero there okay let's withdraw money enter amount to be withdrawn negative one thousand dollars that's not a valid amount that's good let's withdraw again i would like to withdraw 100 insufficient funds my balance is zero let's deposit some money 99.99 our balance is 99.90 let's withdraw again let's try and withdraw 100 nope we can't let's withdraw again 99.99 your balance is zero that's good then let's exit press 4 to exit thanks for visiting okay so these functions are done there's just one more thing we should add if i type in some characters like the word pizza well this will break our program we'll want to clear the input buffer so after our choice let's add these two lines standard input dot clear function so i haven't talked about this function this function will reset any error flags when the standard input fails to interpret the input then follow this with f flush this is a function pass in standard input this will clear the input buffer basically speaking once we hit enter we have a new line character within our input buffer so we just need to flush that and get rid of it that should prevent our program from going crazy so let's type in some characters invalid choice cool then i would like to exit all right everybody that is a banking program for some practice if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's a banking practice program in c plus plus
