hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a simple countdown timer in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right let's get started guys and gals so for this video we're going to import the time module we're going to create a timer that will start at 0 and count up to maybe 10 and then we'll create another timer that will do the reverse start at 10 and count down to 0. so maybe you need this for a game or something it's fairly simple and straightforward so we'll need a few variables a variable called running and this will store a boolean value of true while our timer is running while it remains true we'll continue the timer if we need to stop for any reason we can reassign this variable a value of false we'll need an amount of seconds seconds equals and we'll set this to zero and a point at which we would like to end this timer so we'll create a variable called end and let's say we would like to count up to 10 so we'll set end to 10. we'll need a while loop while running so while running remains true what do we want to do we'll print the amount of seconds that have elapsed initially this is going to be zero we would like our thread that is running to sleep so we can sleep for a given amount of seconds i would like to sleep for one second and then we'll increment our seconds variable by one seconds plus equals one all right and then we should write an if statement to check to see if seconds is greater than or equal to our end whatever value that we set which is 10. if seconds is greater than or equal to end so if we reach the end we're going to reassign our running variable as false and let's print seconds and once we exit this while loop let's print done all right let's try this so this will begin at zero and count up by one every one second and then once we reach our end which is 10 this will display done which it has all right so that's how to create a count up timer now if you want to create a timer where you count down we just need to change a few things so seconds let's set this to 10. let's start at 10 and count down to zero so let's switch the values of seconds and end seconds we'll begin at 10 and end will end at zero now with seconds we're going to decrement by one if seconds is less than or equal to our end and let's change the message as well let's say happy new year let's pretend that we're counting down to new year's day all right let's begin so it starts at 10 and it's going to count down to zero and once seconds reaches zero it's going to display happy new year all right everybody so that's how you can create a simple count up as well as a countdown timer in python oh and be sure to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
