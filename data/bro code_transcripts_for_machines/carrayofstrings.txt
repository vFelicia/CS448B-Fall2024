hey everyone in this video i'm going to show you how we can create an array of strings let's say we will have an array named cars so we will need a twodimensional array so we need two sets of straight brackets and within the second set of straight brackets we will specify a maximum size for each of these elements let's say maybe 10 characters so a string is already an array of characters let's add our first string maybe we have a mustang so to add a second element we would separate the next one with the comma then we can add another string let's say we have a corvette and then one more how about a maybe camaro okay so with all of these different strings i'm going to surround with a set of curly braces and here we go we have an array of strings it's basically a 2d array of individual characters except each element is a string now one important difference with an array of strings is that we can't directly change one of the values let's say cars at index zero equals a tesla and then i'm going to try and run this so we can't directly assign a new value one way in which we can do so is to use the string copy function so if you're going to use the string copy function include this import string dot h okay so to update one of the values i will use string copy pass in my array and an index number followed by a string so let's say a tesla and this would work now to display an array of strings we can use a for loop and there's no need for a nested loop so we will create an index i set this equal to zero i would like to continue this as long as i is less than and we will calculate how many elements are within our array so we will use the size of operator pass in our array divided by one of the elements size of cars and maybe the first element of zero and then increment i by one during each iteration so then during each iteration let's display one of these elements using a printf statement let's display a string i'll add a new line after each printf statement and let's display our array cars at index of i so this should display tesla corvette and camaro in that order tesla corvette and a camaro so yeah that's an array of strings it's really a twodimensional array of characters but it involves less steps because each of these strings is already an array and if you need to update or edit one of the values you can use the string copy function so yeah that's how to work with an array of strings if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to work with an array of strings in c
