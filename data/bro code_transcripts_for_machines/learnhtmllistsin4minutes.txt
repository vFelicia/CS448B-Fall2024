hey welcome back in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create lists in html there's three lists we're going to talk about unordered ordered and description lists let's begin with unordered lists to create an unordered list we need a pair of ul tags for an unordered list and between these ul tags we can create individual list items and we use a pair of li tags for each item we would like to add to our list so what's an example of an unordered list one thing that comes to mind is a shopping list like a grocery list because well i'm kind of hungry right now it's breakfast time let's say that we're going to bake a pizza and we need a list of ingredients we need pizza dough so add an item between this pair of li tags and we now have one bulleted item within our unordered list and let's create another item so we can just copy and paste this pair of li tags and create a new list item what about tomato sauce and then maybe cheese and toppings point being to create an unordered list you need a pair of ul tags and with each list item you would like to add to your unordered list you just place within a pair of li tags for list item an ordered list is very similar except we use old tags so we need an opening ol tag and a closing ol tag so by default each list item is going to be numbered so let's say that we have a todo list to add a list item we need to use a pair of li tags perhaps this is a schedule of what we have to do in the morning we have to eat breakfast that could be one list item so to add another item we need another pair of li tags then maybe we need to take a shower so each of these is numbered and they're in ascending order and then we want to what about leave for work okay so yeah that is an ordered list the order of the list items does matter and we can change the type too within the opening oel tag there is a type attribute we can set each list item to a number a letter or roman numerals if i would instead like letters i can just set the type equal to a and our list items are now marked with the letter and we have description lists we need a pair of dl tags for description lists and instead of using an li tag for each list item we use a pair of dt tags for description term and d tags for description definition so for a term that is d t and then we add a definition to this term let's say we have a list of web dev languages for a term we need an opening dt tag and a closing dt tag and then we can add a definition to this term so that would be dd description definition between the opening and closing dd tags we can add a definition to this term let's say that this adds structure to a web page and then to create another term and definition pair we can just copy this let's add css this adds style to a web page then javascript this adds functionality to a web page with description lists each list item is a pair of terms and definitions the last thing i'm going to show you you can create a nested list within a list so let's say i would like to add a sub list of individual toppings to our unordered list within the list item we just create a new list let's say that i would like another unordered list so i need a pair of ul tags and what are some toppings we can place on our pizza so we need a list item what about pepperoni so we have a sub list going if you take a look on the webpage right now ah then maybe what about mushrooms next i like mushrooms and peppers i guess all right people those are how to create lists there's three types unordered ordered and description lists just use a pair of appropriate tags depending on the list you want to use so yeah everybody that's how to create different lists in html if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
