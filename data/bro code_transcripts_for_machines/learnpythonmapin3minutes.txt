hey everybody today I'm going to explain the map function in Python the map function applies a given function to all items in a collection the map function takes at least two arguments a function and a collection we will apply this function to every item in this collection here's what we'll do we will create a list of temperatures in Celsius which will convert to be Fahrenheit we have a list of Celsius temps make up some numbers that's good enough for this example then at the end I will print my list of temperatures in Celsius we would like to convert all these temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit well we can use the map function for that but we'll need a function to pass in as an argument there's two ways in which we can do that we can declare a function and pass in the name of that function or use a Lambda function let's start by defining a function let's name this function C2 F meaning Celsius to Fahrenheit we have one argument a temp for temperature once we receive our temperature in celsius we can return the following formula take our temp multiply it by 9 / 5 + 32 so now using the map function let's create a new list of Fahrenheit temps I think I spelled that right I can never spell Fahrenheit we're going to use the map function we have to pass in a function and a collection which function would we like to apply to every item in this collection we're going to take the name of our function C to F that's the first argument and the second argument is the collection our Celsius temps and then we will print our Fahrenheit temps so the map function returns a map object they are iterable we can iterate over it using a for Loop like so for every temp in Fahrenheit temps print each temp that would give me these new temperatures in fut right if you would like to keep it as a list when we're done mapping we can enclose this function within a list function to typ cast it to a list and then I will print my Fahrenheit temps and it should be a list which it is so using the map function we have converted these temperatures which were originally in celsius to fahrenheit if we would rather not Define a function we could use a Lambda function instead so we don't clutter the namespace and have to think of unique names for each function let's copy this equation delete our function when we pass in the name of a function as an argument we will instead write a Lambda function a Lambda function is a small Anonymous function we type Lambda any parameters we had one parameter of temp colon then what would we like to return the formula that we just copied we'll paste it this should work too it does work and here are the temperatures in Fahrenheit all right everybody that is the map function it applies a given function to all items in a collection one by one and well everybody that is the map function in Python
