hey everybody we gotta talk about enums enums also means enumerations it's a userdefined data type that consists of paired named integer constants they're great if you have a set of potential options here's an example suppose we have a day of the week standard string today then pick a day i'll pick sunday normally you can't use strings within switches but we can use enums which are kind of similar let me explain so i'm going to create a switch we will examine today normally we can't do this because it's a string we'll examine today against many matching cases case sunday and i'll speed up the footage okay here's my switch depending on what day of the week it is we'll display a custom message it is either sunday through saturday one of these days so normally we can't use strings within switches this is what happens when we attempt that error switch quantity not an integer something similar that we can use are enums they're paired named integer constants we have a name and an associated value they're interchangeable at the top of my program i will declare enum then a name for the set of enumerations let's say day for day of the week we have sunday monday tuesday and you know the rest you can associate a value with each of these names sunday equals zero monday equals one then we'll just continue on with the rest of these i'm going to group these together like that okay we have our enum setup this identifier is kind of like the new data type we're not working with strings anymore we're working with days these are a set of potential options each option is a pair of a name and some associated value you can really pick any value i went with the numbers 0 through 6 to represent the day of the week i'm going to set today to sunday this name we can now use this within a switch there's an associated integer value but we'll change the cases from strings to that enum data type and this would work it is sunday within the cases you could use the associated values as well i'm going to change today to be friday case 0 is sunday monday is 1 2 three four five six it is friday so that also works but i don't think it's as readable another cool thing with enums is that enum variables take only one value of the set if i try and make up some value like pizza day well we can't do that pizza day was not declared in the scope here's a few other enum examples you could create a set of enums for flavors vanilla chocolate strawberry mint an important note is that if you're working with enums and you don't assign an integer value to each of these names you'll implicitly assign 0 to the first name then 1 two three kind of like what i did up here but we explicitly assigned to those values we have six colors or maybe planets i have a set of enums of the nine planets in our solar system the associated integer is the size of each planet in kilometers so yeah those are enums they're a userdefined data type that consists of paired named integer constants they're great if you have a set of potential options your assignment is to post a set of enums in the comments section down below and well yeah those are enums in c plus
