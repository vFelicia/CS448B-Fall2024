hey it's me again so today I'm going to explain string Methods in JavaScript string Methods allow you to manipulate and work with text also known as strings in this example I have a username username equals a string of text why don't you go ahead and create a username variable and set it equal to either your username if you have one or your full name strings have different builtin methods where we can manipulate this text one way or another here's a few examples suppose I would like to get the first character of the string I can use the Char at method type a string or a variable containing a string then follow this with DOT by adding a DOT we are accessing any Properties or methods that the string has follow this with Char at then list an index the first character is zero the second character would be one so get the character at index zero that that should be a b however if I were to run this let's go to our Dev tools uh nothing appears to happen because it's going to return a single character let's place that within console.log just so that we can see it cut this code and paste it within console.log so the first character in my string is B but depending on what you wrote it might be different for you the character at index one would be R then is O so that is the Char at method the index of method will return the index of the first occurrence of a character let's find the first occurrence of an O it will return an index and then again I have to console.log whatever is returned so let's place this method within console.log what is the index of the first occurrence of an o that would be 2 0 1 2 otherwise for the last index let's change the method to be last index of which would be four 0 1 2 3 4 so the length property this isn't a method to get the length of a string type the string or a variable containing the string dot length this isn't a method but it's very similar so the length of my username is seven characters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so that's how to get the length of a string now we are going to trim the string maybe there's a bunch of white spaces after or before I will reassign username equal to let's take our username variable Dot and use the trim method to trim any wh space then I will console dolog my username there's my name and there's no Whit space after let's add some white space before our name yep and there's no white space to make my name I'll uppercase I can use the two uppercase method now my string is all uppercase then there's two lowercase to make all of the characters lowercase there's repeat to repeat a string within the parenthesis of the method how many times do you want to repeat the string if I were to type three we'll repeat the string three times to determine if a string starts with a given character we can use the starts with method this will return a Boolean I will store that within a result variable username do starts with method we we will check to see if the string starts with an empty space then let's console.log the result that is false my username does not begin with the space but what if it did I'll add one then that returns true this could be useful within an if statement if result if the string starts with a whit space let's console.log your username can't begin with an empty space else let's console.log the username my username has a whit space in the beginning your username can't begin with Whit space if that were false then we will display my username so that is the starts withth method there's also ends with does my username end with the Whit space it does not but what if it did your username can't end with an empty space next is the includes method does the string contain an empty space I'll split my username into two your first and last name would work as well your username can't include an empty space currently it does your username can't include an empty space if it didn't then we pass the test we will display the username all right now this time we will create a phone number let phone number equals make up some phone number including dashes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7890 so this phone number is a string even though it contains numbers because strings can contain numbers but we treat them as characters let's eliminate all the dashes in our phone number here's one way in which we can do that let's reassign our phone number equals our phone number we will use the replace all method which character are we replacing let's replace any dashes comma then the character to replace the dashes with or whatever you put for the first character we will replace all dashes with no characters then let's console. log our phone number and that should eliminate all of the dashes or otherwise you could replace it with a different character let's do a forward slash so 1 234567890 there's also the pad start method. pad start the first value within the pad start method is a specified length how many characters should the string be I would like the string to be 15 characters long then for the second value make sure to comma separate it we can pad the start of the string with a given character let's say zero so the result is a couple zeros than our phone number pad this string with zeros until it's 15 character long if I were to set this to 20 then we would have more zeros there's more padding then there's pad end pad the end of the string with this character until the string is 15 characters long all right everybody so those are string Methods they allow you to manipulate and work with text also known as strings we'll have more practice with these in the future and well those are a few useful string Methods in JavaScript
