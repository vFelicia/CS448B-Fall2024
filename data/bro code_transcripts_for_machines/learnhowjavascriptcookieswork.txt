hey guys in this video i'm going to explain cookies a cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer it's used to remember information about a user data within a cookie is saved in name value pairs in order to check to see if we have cookies enabled within console.log i can type navigator dot cookie enabled for me that's true i have cookies enabled to add a cookie we would type document.cookie we will set the sql to a string but the string has certain components first is a name value pair i would like to create a cookie to store a user's first name the name of this pair will be let's say first name set the sequel to some value the value that i will pick is spongebob then end it with a semicolon now you can add an expiration date when the current time is past a certain expiration date well then this cookie will be deleted to set an expiration date set expires equal to then pick a date i'll pick sunday 1st january maybe a date that's really far out like 20 30 at midnight utc then semicolon we're also able to set a path for this cookie i'll use the default path that would be path equals forward slash okay let's take a look at this cookie console.log document dot cookie even though this appears to be a string it's actually an object the expiration date and the path aren't displayed all that's displayed is the name and the value you can add more than one cookie so again we will type document.cookie let's copy this text paste it last name last name equals square pants then let's take a look at our cookie again the cookie property of our document can hold more than one cookie but to access it you would just type cookie to overwrite a cookie you would just change the value of a name value pair if i overwrite the first name and the last name they'll change this time let's set first name to patrick last name star there we go first name patrick last name star if we change the expiration date to a date that has already passed that will delete this cookie it'll expire so maybe the last name expired in the year 2000 that last name portion of my cookie is no longer there so that's how to expire a cookie at this point we're going to create a function to create a cookie instead of doing so manually function set cookie we'll need a few things a name because these are a name value pairs a value and an expiration date although that's optional for the third argument let's name this parameter days to live as an argument you'll pass a number of days that you would like this cookie to be set to expire 365 would be one year let's create a date object const date equals new date i will set the time of this date date dot set time method within the parentheses we will take date dot get time this will return the current time in milliseconds then add the amount of days to live converted to milliseconds days to live times 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds times 1000 for 1000 milliseconds our future date is currently in milliseconds we'll convert that to utc string date to utc string method i'll assign this to a variable let expires equals and then we'll use some string concatenation we'll need to set this expires value so within quotes expires equals plus our future date converted to a utc string then we can assign our cookie document.cookie equals i'll use a template literal we're inserting our name that we pass in equals our value add a semicolon to finish this section then the expire section expires then you could also add a path if you would like path equals forward slash that's the default path okay now let's create some cookies i will invoke our set cookie function pass in a name value pair and the amount of days i would like this cookie active what about an email address email make up some email address sponge gmail.com i would like this cookie to live for 365 days then let's display our cookies console.log document dot cookie and here's our cookies we still have our first name and last name because we never deleted them but we do have an email now email equals sponge at gmail.com how can we delete a cookie all we have to do is set the expiration date to a pass date here's one easy way to do that let's create function delete cookie all we'll need is a name what we'll do is invoke set cookie pass our name as an argument null for the value and null for the days to live if i was to invoke the delete cookie method and pass in the name email well that email cookie is no longer in here so it's gone let's delete the other cookies too delete first name delete last name and those three cookies are cleared let's create a function to get the value of a cookie by a name let's declare this function function get cookie we'll accept a name as an argument what we'll need to do is decode our cookie i'll store this within a constant constant c for cookie decoded equals decode uri component then pass in document.cookie let's take a look at this console.log c decoded let's make sure we have at least two cookies set cookie first name spongebob 365 days to live set cookie last name squarepants then i will invoke the getcookie method then pass in a name first name is fine okay let's see what we have this is what's stored within c decoded we have our name value pairs what we'll need to do is split each of these name value pairs at each of these semicolons that's how to separate them so after this first statement we'll take c decoded and split at each semicolon semicolon space this will return an array we'll store that within const c array cookie array let's display cookie array console.log cookie array each of those name value pairs is now within separate elements what we're going to do is for each element we'll check to see if there's a match between each of these element names and the name that we're looking for let's take our cookie array c array and use the for each method i'll use an arrow function expression there is one parameter element arrow what would we like to do for each element i'll use an if statement let's check to see if our element at index of the name that we're looking for is equal to zero say that we're looking for last name we'll iterate over each element of our array and see if there's a match we check the first element these don't match but this one does if there's a match then let's return the result results equals and we'll create a substring element dot substring name dot length plus one the length of the name plus one will create a substring and return this text so let's declare let result at the end return result actually i'm going to set result to null okay let's see if this works so we have two cookies and i'm going to console.log getcookie pass in my first name and that first name is spongebob let's get last name last name spongebob and squarepants okay yeah that's how to set delete and get cookies let's take this a step further let's create some text fields a submit button and a get cookies button heading to our html file let's create some text fields and some labels label for equals first text first name colon close the label input id equals first text i'll add a line break let's do the same thing with last name last text last name id is last text i'll create a submit button button id equals submit now let's name this btn for short submit button text will be submit then a get cookies button cookies btn for button the text will be get cookies okay heading back to our javascript file let's select these elements const first text equals document dot query selector we're selecting the id of first text let's do the same thing with last text our submit button submit button then cookie button cookie button i'm going to add an event listener to our submit button submit button dot add event listener the event attribute will be click when we click we're going to perform an arrow function expression we will set the cookies according to what these values are within these text boxes we will invoke the set cookie function the name will be first name the value will be whatever's within our text boxes first text dot value and days to live i'll set this to be a year 365 days let's do the same thing with our last name set cookie last name last text.value let's add an event listener to our cookie button that will populate the fields that function will search for any cookies and return a value okay we have cookie button add event listener click first text dot value equals get cookie then the name of the cookie first name do the same thing with last text last text value gut cookie last name whoops looks like i misspelt this id cookie button now before we run this i'm just going to delete our cookies delete cookie first name delete cookie last name then save and run it so when i press get cookies well we don't have any first name or last name cookies there's nothing to populate these text fields so i'm going to type in a first name and a last name spongebob squarepants press submit this first name and last name are stored as cookies now so i'm going to refresh this page press that get cookies button again that will populate these text fields with the cookies i have so yeah everybody that's an introduction to cookies they're small text files stored on your computer they're used to remember information about the user and they're saved in name value pairs if you would like a copy of all this code i know there's a lot here i'll post all of this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's an introduction to cookies using javascript
