hey yeah pseudoelements pseudo elements are used to style specific parts of an element here's the formula we have a selector two colons and then a pseudo element for example we can style the first letter of any h1 elements in this example let's create a sample paragraph i'll use a pair of paragraph tags and generate some sample text by typing lorem and then tab i would like to style only specific parts of this paragraph tag in my style sheet i would like to select any p elements and to use pseudoelements i will type two colons and here's a list of the possible pseudo elements i would like to change the first letter of any paragraph tags perhaps i will change the font size to maybe 40 pixels and the font style to italic these properties will only be applied to this specific part of this element let's change the first line the selector will be p elements again two colons first line and i will make the first line what about blue sky blue and the first line is now blue and if you do resize this window the length of this first line is going to change in this next example we'll need two lists i will use unordered lists the first unordered list will have an id of list one and the second list an id of list two i will add three list items to each unordered list okay list one will have html css and javascript list two will have c c plus plus and c our next pseudo element is before we can add some content before an element so i would like to select any list items and i will add some content before each of these list items one useful property to combine with the before pseudo element is content we can append some content before an element maybe before each of these elements i would like to append maybe some text an image or an icon maybe in this example i'll append an emoji before each of these elements so i'm using windows to select an emoji i can hold windows and semicolon and i would like to append a check mark before each of these elements what we're doing here is saying before all list items append this content now what we did is select all list items within our page if i would like only a specific list styled this way i can precede the selector with the name of the parent let's change the list items of anything found within the list1 parent class we will proceed list item with the name of the parent list one then hashtag so this selector is all list items found within list one now after is kind of the same thing uh this time i will give each of these list items a unique id we can use an id as a selector so maybe i will select css and use the after pseudo element and then add some content after this list item so maybe i will add a hand pointing to the left kind of like we're currently learning css so we added some content after this element there is also a marker pseudo element with all list items i would like to change the marker the markers are these bullets in an unordered list or the numbers in an ordered list so i'll list items let's say that the color of the marker will be silver so that is the marker pseudo element and the last one is selection this text is selected with a blue background and white text so let's change that to something else so i will select my paragraph two columns and selection so let's change the color to white and the background to what about black so when we select this text the background color is black and the text is white so that is the selection pseudo element so yeah those are pseudo elements they're used to style specific parts of an element so yeah those are pseudo elements if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
