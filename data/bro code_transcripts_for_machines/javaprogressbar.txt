hell's going everybody its Ebro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how J progress bars work in Java so let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey everybody we're gonna be building a progress bar and this is defined as a visual aid to let the user know that an operation is processing so it's usually good practice to let the user know what's going on behind the scenes if something's processing you're waiting on something otherwise if there's no sort of visual cue the user might close out of your application because they think it's frozen so let's create a progress bar we're going to create a new class within our project folder so file a new class I'll call this progress bar demo but call it whatever you want click finish then we're going to create an instance of this within our main class so we'll type the name of the class and I'll call this instance just demo equals new progress bar demo all right so we're done with this class let's go back to our progress bar demo class and we're going to import a few things import java.awt asterisk and import Java X dot swing dot asterisk then let's create the constructor for this class so we're going to type in the name of the class followed by a set of parentheses and curly braces and before the constructor we're going to declare a few things so we'll create a jframe and we'll call this frame equals new J frame and we're going to create a component called a J progress bar so J progress bar and we'll call this bar for short equals new J progress bar okay now within the constructor let's create the frame so we can add the bar to the frame so frame dot set default close operation jframe dot exit on close and then frame dot set size pick whatever size you want and then I usually set no layout manager so set layout to null only in certain situations I like layout managers and then we need to take our frame and set the visibility to true ok now we are going to create the J progress bar so we're gonna set the initial value first so we're going to type bar dot set value and if you want to start at zero type in zero here don't know why you'd want to start at a different number but hey maybe you can set this to 100 and countdown for something all right then we're going to set the bounce because we're using no layout manager so bar dot set bounds and let's start in the top left corner so we'll set X to 0 Y to 0 and then we'll need to choose a length for this so maybe I'll type in 420 to match the size of my frame and then maybe 50 pixels for the height and then we need to add this bar to our frame so we'll type in frame dot add bar and let's see what we got so far going on ok we got a nice little bar here so that's a good start so with this progress bar there is actually a special method so type in bar and this method is called set string painted and then pass in true within here and what this does is that it adds a percentage to your progress bar and when you fill the progress bar or set the value this percentage is going to change so that's kind of cool alright so let's fill this progress bar so all we really need to do is just take this bar and set the value to something else that's like the bare minimum I would say but I think what we'll do is actually put this within a while loop and we'll have the value of our progress bar increased by a certain amount every second or so there are so many different ways that you can create a progress bar this is just like a basic demonstration so let's do that within a fill method so at the end of our constructor will call a fill method and we're going to declare this so outside of the constructor we'll make a public void method called fill and what we'll do is just set the value whenever we call this all right so let's just set this to 10 to begin with so when we run this it's immediately set to 10 now what I think we'll do is actually put this within a while loop and we'll start at 0 so we'll create a counter so int counter set this equal to 0 create a while loop and within the while loop what we'll do is that will continue this while loop as long as our counter is less than or equal to 100 and we're going to take our bar and set the value to whatever our counter is so if we want to simulate the progress bar increasing over time we can use the thread dot sleep method here and we can set this to maybe 1,000 milliseconds so this is going to pause our program for 1 second after each iteration of the while loop and we're going to need to surround this with a try and catch block and then let's increase our counter maybe by 10 percent so we can say counter plus equals 10 this is the shorthand for saying counter equals counter plus 10 so let's see what happens now all right so it starts at 0 and it's going up by 10 percent every second almost there all right I think I'm gonna speed this up a little bit so maybe I'll change the counter to increment by 1 percent each time and change the thread dot sleep method to perhaps 50 milliseconds so it's going to appear to go actually faster this time and it's increasing by one percent after each iteration of the why Loup all right we can also add some text on our bar so maybe we'll set this after the while loop is complete we'll display a message such as done so we type in the name of the progress bar set string and then you can add some text so maybe we'll type in done and that should be good so let's try it again and then when it's finished it says done but it's a little difficult to see so let's change the font of the progress bar so if we want to change the font we can type in bar dot set font then within parenthesis we're going to pass in new font parentheses again we can pick a font style I like MV Bohle it's one of my favorite fonts then let's set this to bold so font da bold and for a size maybe 25 but bold has to be all capital I forget about that sometimes okay let's take a look at this now alright that's much better you can actually see it this time and when it says done that's actually visible this time and it's not so small let's also change the foreground color so bar dot set foreground then within here we just send in a color so maybe color dot maybe red and let's take a look and the fill color is now red actually this would be kind of cool for some sort of HP bar for a videogame but you'd probably want to start at maybe 100 and then just progress this downwards and let's also change the background color so bar dot set background maybe black color dot black so the background is black and the fill color is red so another thing with this J progress bar within the constructor you can pass in a and a maximum value for this progress bar so maybe we'll set the minimum to 0 and then the max maybe 500 actually you know what let's create like some sort of HP bar in a video game so I think what we'll do is actually count down words so we'll change our while loop we'll continue this as long as counter is greater than or equal to 1 or 0 I guess actually greater than 0 would be better and then we'll decrease our counter by maybe 1 so that's minus equals 1 all right so let's try this oh we should probably set our counter to whatever this was 500 okay that kind of appears to be somebody's HP training like in a video game that's pretty cool too but we'll switch back to the example we had previously so I'm just going to undo all of this but yeah you can pass in a minimum and a maximum value to your progress bar all right everybody well that's the basics of J progress bars and with this set value method of the J progress bar there's so many different things you can do with this you won't necessarily have your thread asleep for so many milliseconds before updating this you might link this to some sort of like task after the task is complete you can increment this counter by something there's really no right way or wrong way to do this this is just like one of a few different ways to demonstrate this concept so if you want a copy of all this code I'll post this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of how J progress bars work in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by
