what's going on everybody today I'm going to show you how we can read files using python we'll cover plain text Json and CSV files in the previous topic we have created some sample files to work with here is my plain text file my Json file and my CSV file they're all named input they each have a different file extension for convenience I will create a variable of file path we can list a relative file path or an absolute file path I'll use an absolute file path I'm going to right click on the file I would like to read go to properties copy the location then paste it then add the file name including the extension input and this is a txt file within the context of a string backlashes or Escape sequences for special characters we would either need to use double backs slashes or a forward slash here is the absolute file path to the file I would like to read to read this file I will add a wi block wi is a statement it's going to wrap a block of code within a context manager and it'll close a file if we open it it is good practice to close a file if you do open it if you don't it can lead to unexpected Behavior we will use the open function the open function has two arguments our file path and a mode to read a file we'll set the mode to be R for read the open function is going to return a file object which we will give a nickname of file as file when we read our file object it's going to return one long string which we will assign to a variable named content content equals file use the read method and assign it to this variable then I'm going to print the content print our content the content of the file here's the result that is the content of my file I like pizza it's really good let's say we can't find this file perhaps I forget the file extension we'll run into a file not found error this this will interrupt our program we can catch exceptions when they happen any dangerous code that may cause an exception we can wrap within a tri block if there's an exception we will catch them by stating accept the name the exception in this case File not found error instead of our program being interrupted let's take a different course of action we will print that file was not found found let's try this again that file was not found at least our program isn't being interrupted let's add the file extension back what if we don't have permission to read this file to demonstrate that I'm going to right click on that file go to properties go to security edit the permissions I will deny any sort of control I will attempt to read this file and we get a permission error permission denied we could handle this exception as well if we encounter a permission error I will print the following you do not have permission to read that file let's run this again you do not have permission to read that file those are a few exceptions we can handle in case they appear file not found errors and permission errors let's say we would like to read a Json file we will need the help of the Json module I will import the Json module at the top of my program I need to get the file path of this Json file it's pretty much the same as before in this case the file extension is a Json file there's only one change we're going to make we will assign our variable of content equal to access the Json module use the load method and load our file and that should read the contents of my file here's my Json file name SpongeBob ag30 job cook with the data of your Json file you could access a value given a key I will access our content by its key of name that will return the value of SpongeBob age 30 job cook now here's how to read a CSV file we will import the CSV module the file extension is going to be CSV again this is on my desktop in the same location as the previous files my content will equal access the CSV module access the reader method and pass in our file here's the content currently we're given a memory address with the CSV file what we need to do is read the CSV file line by line all of the data is within a collection which we need to iterate over so to do that we're going to create a for Loop for every line in my content I will print each line that's much better the format resembles a spreadsheet like an Excel spreadsheet there's rows and columns to get a specified column we can access an index in my example our line at index of zero would give me the First Column name SpongeBob Patrick Sandy the next index would be all the ages of each person 30 35 27 and index 2 would be the job positions cook unemployed and scientist if you need a specific column of data from a CSV file you can use an index as one possibility all right everybody so those are a few ways in which we can read files using python
