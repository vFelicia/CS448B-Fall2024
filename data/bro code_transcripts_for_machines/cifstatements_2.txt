hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to cover if statements in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people if statements an if statement is a basic form of decision making if some condition that we specify is true we can execute a block of code if it's not true we can do something else entirely so let's write a small program where we will ask a user to enter in their edge and depending on their age we can write an if statement that checks to see if somebody is 18 years or older let's say that a user is signing up for a credit card and you have to be 18 years or older so if their age is greater than or equal to 18 we will display a message that says you're now signed up if they're less than 18 we can do something else so to write an if statement we just write if then parentheses to hold some sort of condition which we would like to evaluate followed by a set of parentheses so if some condition that we set within the parentheses is true we will execute this block of code if it's not true we skip over it entirely so let's check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18 then we will display something console that right line you are now signed up and let's try it please enter your age let's say that i'm 21 i hit enter boom you are now signed up now what if i enter in an edge that's less than 18. let's say that i'm 12 years old and i'm trying to sign up for a credit card well nothing appears to happen and that's normal so if this condition evaluates to be true we execute this block of code if it's false we skip over it entirely as if it never existed now we can take a different course of action if our above condition is false we can perform some other block of code so let's display a message that says you must be 18 years or older to sign up you must be 18 plus to sign up so if this condition is true we do this if it's false we do this so let's try it again please enter your edge let's say that i'm 12 i hit enter you must be 18 plus to sign up so if this is true do this if it's not true do this now between the if and else statements you can add an else if statement if there's more things they want to check before reaching the else block so the else block is kind of like a last resort if all above statements evaluate to be false let's check to see if somebody's age is less than zero else if age is less than zero then we will display a custom message such as you haven't been born yet please enter your age i am negative 12 years old you haven't been born yet with these else if statements you can add as many as you want between if and else let's add another so i will copy what we have let's check to see if somebody's age is greater than 100 if it is then we'll say i don't know you're too old to sign up that's kind of mean i guess but it serves the purpose of this example so you are too old to sign up now we're going to run into one issue okay please enter your age i am 101 years old you are now signed up now the reason that this block of code executed and not this one is that we're just going down in order starting from the top since age which was 101 is technically greater than or equal to 18. this condition evaluated to be true and we executed this block of code and skipped everything else after it and continued on with the rest of the program so if we first want to check to see if somebody's age is greater than 100 we should probably put that within the if statement and check that first because age is technically greater than or equal to 18 if we set age to be 101 else if we will check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18 then we just have to change these lines of text around so you are too old to sign up so the order of these if statements and else if statements does matter and let's try it again okay please enter your age i am 101 years old you are too old to sign up all right now in this next example let's ask a user for their name instead of their age let's change int age to string name and we do not need to convert this because it's already a string so to check to see if somebody does not enter in some user input we can check to see if our variable name equals an empty set of quotes so this is an empty string now the reason that we're using two equal signs is that this is a comparison operator if you just use one that is an assignment operator c sharp thinks you're attempting to assign name with an empty string so we're comparing if these two are equal so that's why we use double equals so if name is equal to an empty string that means that somebody skipped over entering in some user input so let's yell at them you did not enter your name so if our name is not empty we can display maybe hello whatever the user's name is so hello plus name and let's try it okay please enter your name i'm just going to hit enter you did not enter your name let's run this again and take it seriously this time please enter your name bro hello bro now there's another way in which we could write this so instead of using this double equal sign we can use exclamation point equal sign that means not equals if name does not equal an empty string then we will display hello name else we will display you did not enter your name so we're checking to see if name is not equal to an empty string and if that's true display hello name okay please enter your name i'll hit enter you did not enter your name let's try it again please enter your name bro hello bro all right everybody those are if statements they're a very basic form of decision making we can check to see if some condition is true if it is true then we can do something if not we can do something else so if you would like a copy of both examples from this video i will post that code to the comment section down below and well those are if statements and see you sharp
