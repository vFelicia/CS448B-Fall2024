hey welcome back so today I gotta explain functions in JavaScript a function is a section of reusable code you declare that code once and you can use it whenever you want all you have to do is call the function to execute that code here's an example we'll create a function to sing Happy Birthday whenever we call this function it's going to sing Happy Birthday so to declare a function you type function a unique function name let's name our function happy birthday because it's well the happy birthday function then you add a set of parentheses then you add a set of curly braces any code we write between this set of curly braces we can reuse whenever we want so what do we want to do exactly with this function I'll create the lyrics to my own Happy Birthday song console.log happy birthday to you let's repeat that again happy birthday dear you happy birthday to you trust me I'm going somewhere with this so we have a function when we run the program it currently doesn't do anything to execute this code within the function we have to call the function by its name happy birthday then add a set of parentheses so now we should execute this code yep happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear you happy birthday to you so to call a function you type the function name then you add a set of parentheses I like to think of the parentheses as two telephones talking to each other that's how I remember it so if I were to call this function again what do you think is going to happen well we're going to execute this function twice three times we'll execute it three times as many times as I want in fact that's what a function is it's a section of reusable code reuse it whenever you want you just have to call it you can send a function some values or variables let's change our happy birthday function I will turn this line into a template literal let's replace U with the placeholder then we'll add a username I'll add one more line we'll use a template literal you are insert a placeholder age ears old so when I run this program we have an uncaught reference error username is not defined at happy birthday so our happy birthday function doesn't know what our username is or the age so we can send some information to the function when we call it so within the set of parentheses what would we like to send this function let's send our name so whatever values you place within the function be sure to comma separate them so why don't you go ahead and send the happy birthday function a name and an age but there's one step missing these are known as arguments their data that you send a function but you need a matching set of parameters within the parentheses of the Declaration in a way we can Define some temporary variables and they're all comma separated we will Define a username parameter as well as age now this function should work properly happy birthday dear bro code you are 25 years old so these are parameters and what you send the function are arguments let's call the function but send different information happy birthday uh how about SpongeBob will be I don't know how old he is according to SpongeBob lore but let's say he's 30 years old happy birthday dear SpongeBob you are 30 years old how about Patrick this time it's his birthday everybody gets a birthday Patrick will be 37. happy birthday dear Patrick you are 37 years old so that's a benefit of passing arguments to a function when the function receives this data it can do something with it now the order of the parameters does matter if I were to switch age and username here's what happens happy birthday dear37 you are Patrick years old with the arguments that you're passing to your function you'll want to be sure that the parameters match up all right now I'm gonna cover the return keyword we'll create a few other function examples we'll create a function to add two numbers function add then we'll need two arguments which we will name X and Y so when we invoke this function I would like to add X and Y together I'll create a temporary variable named result just to store the result equals X Plus y so I'm going to add two numbers together let's add two and three together and let's see what happens well nothing appears to happen well we can send some data back to the place in which we call a function but we need to use this return keyword let's return the result so two plus three should be 5. after this function resolves think of this function becoming the value 5. so we'll probably want to do something with that value I'll store that within a variable let answer equal add two and three then let's console.log the answer which should be five when you return something from a function after you resolve the function think of it as becoming whatever is returned in this case it's our result or otherwise I can place this function within console.log if we don't plan to store it at all so add two and three then display the result which is five there is a shortcut too you don't necessarily need to declare a variable within this function we could shorten this to return X Plus y that is also valid so that should return 5. okay let's create a subtract function function subtract will return x minus y well we need a matching set of parameters because I forgot that okay let's see what happens when we subtract three from two that'll give us negative one let's multiply function multiply we'll multiply X and Y together return x times y we will multiply two times three which is six divide we need parameters X and Y then return x divided by y then we will invoke the divide function pass in two and three and the result is 0.66 repeating let's go over a more complex example we'll create a function to determine if a number is even or odd here's the function function is even we have one parameter a number so when we invoke the function we'll have to pass in a number so when we receive a number how do we check to see if this number is even here's one solution we'll use an if statement if our number modulus 2. modulus gives you the remainder of any division if this number divides by two evenly if this is equal to zero and yes I'm using the strict equality operator I'm trying to use that more often if our number is divisible by 2 then let's return the Boolean value true else will return false okay let's console.log let's check to see if a number is even let's start with 10 is 10 even that is true how about 11. that is false 12 12 is even so that's kind of cool if you would like a shortcut for this you can use the trinary operator that would look something like this we are going to return then a condition what are we checking is our number modulus 2. strictly equal to zero question mark so that is the ternary operator the question mark if it is true then we will return a Boolean value of true colon false if it's false is 12 even that is true is 13 Even no it's not it's odd how about 14. that is true all right last example I think we're probably getting the hang of this now we'll create a function to see if an email is valid function is valid email what kind of information are we going to send we'll set that up as a parameter we will need an email will invoke the is valid email function and pass in an email why don't you type in your email I'll just make one up bro at fake.com so when we invoke this function this string of text will become our email we'll check to see if our email contains the at character we'll use an if statement if email and there's a builtin method for this the includes method if our email includes the at character then we will return true that is a valid email they have the at character else we will return false is my email valid that is true let's remove the at character brofick.com maybe it's a website or something that is false let's try another email again we're going to invoke the function is valid email Elon Musk dot com don't actually go there I don't know what's gonna pop up uh that is not a valid email all right how about Zuckerberg at meta.com that is a valid email it contains a net character and for something like this if we're returning either true or false we can use the Trenary operator return then our condition is we're going to check if our email includes the at character then add the ternary operator if this is true return true else we will return false so these should be the same which they are all right everybody so that's an introduction to functions it's a section of reusable code you declare some code once and use it whenever you want you call the function to execute that code if you need to send your function some data you'll need a matching set of arguments and parameters and you can return something too with the return keyword we'll have more practice with this in the future don't worry and that is an introduction to functions in JavaScript
