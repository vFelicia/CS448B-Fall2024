hello everybody today we will be creating a dice roller program in Python we will be utilizing some ASCII art I'll post all of the ASCII art that we'll need in the description of this video you can copy and paste it to save time if you'd like all right let's get started everybody we will Begin by importing the random module because we will be rolling some random numbers between one through six if we're going to create some ASCII art we'll be utilizing Unicode characters to enter in a Unicode character it really varies depending on your operating system I think the easiest way would just be to use Python to enter a Unicode character type a forward slash then a given code for each character here are all of the codes that we'll need after writing these seven Unicode characters let's run this program these symbols that are output let's copy them I'll add them to a comment then we can delete this line these are the Unicode characters we'll need to build some ASCII art some dice each die will be made out of five lines let's begin with the first we'll need a left corner nine dashes then the right corner for the second line copy this vertical bar add nine spaces then a vertical bar we can copy this whole line paste it two times let's use the left bottom corner add a nine of these dashes then the bottom right corner and here's a basic box shape depending on what the number die is we can add one of these bullet points for a one we can add that right to the middle so that's good for now we'll delete this later let's create a dictionary I will name this dictionary dice art our dictionary is made out of key value pairs so the keys will be the numbers one through six beginning with one the value will be a tuple it's a dictionary made out of key value pairs where the value is a tuple within the Tuple let's add these lines each separated with the comma I'm going to format these so they form a box shape let's take our bullet point place it right in the middle then add a comma to the end of this key value pair that is the first key value pair let's copy all of this paste it again change one to two let's move this bullet point we need two bullet points about right here and here let's repeat this process for Keys three through six be sure to get rid of the comma at the end and here is our dictionary of Dysart each key is a number each value is a tuple made of strings let's create a list of dice our dice will be numbers randomly generated between one and six a total to calculate the total I'll set that to be zero then we will ask a user for a number of dice this will be some input how many dice then Typecast the input as an integer we don't want somebody to write you know 2.5 dice you can't roll half a die to generate a random number you can use the Rand int method of the random module we need a random number between one and six then we need to append this number to our list of dice dice dot append then we can move this line to within the append method we need to do this a number of times depending on how many dice the user enters in we can place this line within a for Loop for every die in our range number of dice this will be a number let's print our list of dice to see what numbers we have in here how many dice I would like five dice five three three four six okay we know that that works let's calculate a total we'll need to iterate and sum all of the elements within our list we can do that with the for Loop for every die in our list dice take our total variable plus equals the current value within our dice then we will print a total I'll use an F string total colon space our total variable let's see what we have so far how many dice I would like five dice our total is 19. now between these two for Loops we will display our ASCII art the easiest way would be to create some nested for loops the outer for Loop will be in charge of the number of dice for every die in our range number of dice the inner for Loop will be in charge of printing every Tuple for every line in than to get a value in our dictionary we would type the name of the dictionary dice art then use the get method what are we getting we're getting a value at a given key let's take our list of numbers dice at index of die our counter depending on what the user types in for the number of dice dye will begin at 1 then increment within the inner for Loop we will print the line so let's take a look how many dice I would like three dice and here's our ASCII art six plus two plus four that equals 12. if you would prefer we can display all of these dice on a single horizontal line instead of one vertical line it's a little more tricky though if you would prefer that approach let's turn this chunk of code into comments we will write this nested Loop a little different so each Tuple is made up of five elements right so if we're printing a horizontal line let's say we roll the numbers one through three we would first need to display this line of the first dice then the first line of the second dice then the first line of the third dice during the next iteration of the outer loop we would display the second line of the first dice the second line of the second dice the second line of the third dice so it's a little more complex let's create an outer loop that will iterate five times for every line in range five then the nested Loop will be for every die in dice how many dice do we have within our list we will print we're going to get one of the values found at one of the numbers that we roll take our dictionary of Dysart dot get then a number one through six that will be the value found within our list of dice get the current die remember that this is a number one through six we would then need one of the elements found within our Tuple so get the first line then the second line third fourth fifth so let's add the index operator place our counter of line within the index operator let's see what we have so far we need to add one more thing how many dice three this is an Abomination there's one more change we need to make at the end of our print statement let's set the ending character to be an empty string and that should fix that how many dice three okay we're getting better results then when we escape the inner loop we will print a new line how many dice three and there we are three plus six plus one is ten all right everybody so that is a dice roller program it is kind of complex but I thought this might be a good exercise if you would like a copy of this code I will post all of this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's a dice roller program in Python
