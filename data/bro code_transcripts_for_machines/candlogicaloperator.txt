hey yeah what's going on people logical operators there are three logical operators we will discuss in the series and or and not but in this video we're going to focus on and first the and logical operator which is represented by two ampersands checks to see if two or more conditions are true here's an example we're going to create a program that will check to see if a given temperature falls within a range so let's say we have a floating point number named temp temp short for temperature and this will equal some number in celsius let's say 25 to begin with so using an if statement let's check to see if temp is greater than or equal to zero if that is true then we will print something the weather is good else the weather is bad okay so temp is 25 therefore the weather is good okay what if our temperature is something extreme like 1000 degrees celsius so technically this condition would still be true the weather is actually not good it's fairly catastrophic so let's check to see if another condition is also true by using the and logical operator we're checking to see if temp is greater than or equal to zero and some other condition such as temp is less than or equal to thirty so if temp is at one thousand then the weather is bad this condition is true but this one is false using the and logical operator both conditions must be true in order to execute this statement now if our temperature was 25 degrees well then both conditions are true and we will execute this statement the weather is good now you can add more than one condition let's throw in another variable let's say that we have a boolean variable named sunny let's say that it's cloudy outside now if we're working with booleans include this header file at the top stdbool.h then let's add another condition and let's check to see if sunny is equal to true if you're checking the value of a boolean variable you don't necessarily have to type out equals true you can say sunny is equal to one or you can just say sunny because this would contain true or false so this time we are checking to see if temp is greater than or equal to zero and temp is less than or equal to 30 and sunny is true the temp is 25 but sunny equals false therefore we do not execute the statement these first two conditions are true but this one is false and using the and logical operator all conditions must be true now if i set this to be true well then all three of these conditions are true and we will execute this statement the weather is good so yeah that is the and logical operator it is represented by two ampersands it checks to see if two or more conditions are true and one example we used is to check to see if our temperature falls within a certain range so yeah that is the and logical operator in the next video we will discuss the or logical operator so if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
