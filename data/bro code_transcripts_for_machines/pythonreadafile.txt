hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be reading a file in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running welcome back guys and gals in this video i'm going to explain how we can read the contents of a file using python so we'll probably need some sort of file to work with i created a plain text file called test.txt it's a plain text file and all this says is omg you can read this have a nice day like comment and subscribe so what i would like to do is to read the contents of that file line by line and printed to the console window and here's how and honestly we only need two lines of code to do this so what we'll do is type with open then within the open function list the name of your file or the file path this file of mine is within my project folder so i only need to list the file name if this was someplace else you'll probably need the file path so let's say this was on my desktop well i'll probably need to list the file path of where that file is located and i'll need to use double backslashes because that's the escape sequence for a backslash but since this file is within my project folder i only need to list the file name so with open then the name of your file or the file path as file then what we're going to do is print file dot read and that is it so let's test it and it works omg you can read this have a nice day like comment and subscribe so this will actually close files automatically after opening them so that's kind of convenient and let's just test that theory so i'm going to print file dot closed if my file is in fact closed this will print true if it's still open this will print false so normally when you read a file it's normally open and you need to close it manually but if you write your program this way with open this will close the file automatically for you so using with open will close any files automatically for you after they've been opened however this does not catch and handle any exceptions that might occur like if we cannot locate this file so let's say that i mistyped the extension for this file let's say that i type in test.tx that's kind of funny because tx is the abbreviation for texas it's a texas file so this will cause a file not found error and this will interrupt the flow of our program and we would probably like to prevent that so what we could do is write a try and an accept block so we will try all of this code if we cannot find this file we can handle this exception file not found error so we'll place all of this code within the try block then if an exception happens we will catch that exception except we would like to catch any file not found air exceptions and let's handle this by printing that file was not found so if i were to run this again we will catch and handle this exception and this will not interrupt the normal flow of our program well everybody that's how to open and read a file in python if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how to open and read a file using python
