hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to explain a few useful math related functions in PHP that you might be interested in we'll need an HTML document followed by a PHP script we will enter in some user input via an HTML form so let's create a form in our HTML document open it close it we will set the action equal to B our index page index.php for the method let's use post let's create a label label close it the label will be X we'll have a user enter in a number then let's add an input tag it's a selfclosing tag the type will be text the name will be X then we need a submit button input type equals submit for the value let's say total it's a total button that's good enough for now if I'm using the post super Global variable let's say we need X Type post add a set of square brackets we would like the value of x I will cache this value within a local variable within my PHP script for convenience variable x equals whatever value for x that we receive just so that we're sure that everything's working fine let's Echo whatever X is Echo X So currently there's nothing in there let's type three hit total and there's our number X which is three so here's a few math related functions you may be interested in the first is the absolute value function let's say we have a total variable as well I'll declare this variable but not assign it quite yet I'll set that to be null then later on in my program we can assign total of value total equals to find the absolute value of a number type abs for absolute value followed by a set of parentheses semicolon whatever number or variable you put within this function ABS it will return the absolute value of that number we can either put a number in here or a variable let's put an X so variable X then I will Echo our total so I'm going to save I'll type in negative four this should return positive four which it does negative 100.123 100.123 that is the absolute value function let's cover a few more we have the round function we can round a number let's assign total equal to use the round function then we will pass in our variable X so let's save again refresh that 3.14 rounded is 3. 3.99 would be four now to always round down you can use the floor function so let's copy this line replace round with floor we will always round down so 3.99 rounded is 3. 4.99 rounded down is 4. there's also seal meaning ceiling which will always round up replace floor with seal let's save refresh everything 3.14 rounded up is for 4.14 rounded up is 5. for this next example we'll need another number let's copy our label and our text box paste it replace x with Y here and here we'll need two numbers this time let's get whatever Y is so y equals within the post super Global variable we are looking for y we can use the power function to raise a base to a given power let's take our total variable equals power we'll need two numbers or two variables what is X raised to the power of Y so what is 2 to the power of 3. that would be eight two to the power of four is sixteen what about 3 to the power of three that is 27 3 to the power of four that is 81. that is the power function you can raise a base to a given power then we have square root I'm going to put that here total equals sqrt add a set of parentheses let's find the square root of x so we don't need Y in this case what is the square root of 100 that is 10. 144 that is 12. that's the square root function we will need three variables let's create another label and a text box the third number will be Z be sure to change the name too then we will create one more variable variable Z post Z then we have the max function total equals Max whatever values or variables you place within the max function the max function will give you the greatest value what is the maximum number between variables X y and z so let's save I'll refresh that one two three the highest number is three Thirty twenty ten the highest number is 30. then we do have the Min function which will give you the minimum what is the minimum number between 10 20 30. the minimum is 10. 3 2 1. the minimum is one that's the Min function the next function is an unusual one it is the pi function total equals Pi function so add a set of parentheses this will print 3.14 and the remaining digits of pi if you ever need Pi you can use the pi function the next one's pretty useful it is the random function total equals Rand this will give you a completely random number I think up to just over 2 billion within the parentheses of the Rand function you can list two numbers for a minimum and a maximum if you're rolling a sixsided dice the minimum would be one the maximum would be six so now we're generating a random number between one and six we can either raise the minimum or raise the maximum for a random number between 1 and 100 within the Rand function the first digit is one the second digit is one hundred so we have 10 85 17 84. if I were to raise the minimum let's say 90 we'll generate a random number between 90 and 100. maybe you could use this for a game now we're going to go over an exercise for this exercise we will have a user enter in a radius the radius of a circle using PHP we will calculate what the circumference would be the area and the volume if that radius is for a sphere so we will need to accept some user input we'll do that with an HTML form So within our HTML document let's create a form then close it the action will equal our index PHP file the method will be post we will need a label close it the label will be radius let's add a text box we need a selfclosing input tag the type will be text the name will be radius because we're accepting a radius then a submit button input type equals submit for the value let's say calculate that's all we need within our PHP script let's create a local radius variable we will get the value from this text box via the post super Global variable let's access the post variable we are looking for the radius and now we have a radius we'll declare a circumference variable I think that's how to spell circumference that will be null to calculate the circumference of a circle we can follow this formula circumference equals 2 times Pi Pi we can use the pi function times our variable radius then let's Echo let's say circumference equals add a placeholder then insert our variable circumference let's say that this is in centimeters then I'll add a line break maybe the radius is 5 I'll calculate that the circumference is 31.4 and we have a lot of digits after there's one thing I'm going to change real quick I'm going to add a line break after our form for the radius let's say it's 10. I'm going to hit calculate here's our circumference 62.83 and some change centimeters we can use the round function to round to a given digit I would like to round to the second digit after the decimal before we display our output let's reassign circumference equal to use the round function then pass in our circumference but I'm going to make one change normally the round function will round a number to the nearest whole integer to round to a given digit add a comma then that digit place let's round to the second digit so our circumference is 62.83 centimeters let's also calculate the area and the volume we'll need a area variable I'll set that to be null to calculate the area let's set area equal to we'll need the pi function times our radius to the power of 2 we can use the power function enter in our radius to the power of 2. then we can round our area equals round within the round function enter in your area we would like to round to the second digit after the decimal then we will display the area area equals our area variable I think technically that should be centimeter squared so let's save I'll enter in a new radius okay so if our radius is 15 this time I'll calculate that with the radius of 15 their circumference is 94.25 centimeters the area is 706.86 centimeter squared now we'll calculate volume if the radius is for a sphere volume equals no volume equals here's the formula 4 divided by 3 times pi function times our radius to the power of 3 we can use the power function we are raising R radius to the power of 3. then we will take our volume and round to two decimal places volume comma 2. then we will display the result with Echo volume equals add a placeholder our volume centimeters I think that's cubed technically if our radius is 5 their circumference is 31.42 the area is 78.54 and the volume is 523.60 centimeters cubed all right everybody well I thought that would be some good practice with some math functions now we're a little more comfortable using them if you would like a copy of this code I'll post it in the comments section down below and well those are some useful math related functions in PHP
