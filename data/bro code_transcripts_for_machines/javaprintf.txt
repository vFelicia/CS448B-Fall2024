hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the printf method in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm hello all welcome back to another video for this topic i'm going to be explaining the printf method this is an optional method to control format and display text to the console window here's an example of the printf method and this is different from print and print line with the printf method there are two arguments we need to place within the parentheses of the printf method the first is a format string a string that you would like to display to the console window and second we can add either an object a variable or a value to keep it simple for now i just added a value of one two three so we can format some value and place it at some position within the string the position in which we want to add this value whatever it is can be added to wherever we add a format specifier which is represented by a percent sign let's say we would like to add this value at the end of our format string so we would add a format specifier at the end that is represented by the percent sign and there is a certain amount and number of combinations and characters that we can add after this format specifier and this will format our value a certain way if we simply need to display a decimal number we're going to add a d it's kind of like a secret code that's how i think of it at least so if we add a percent sign and d we will add this decimal value at this position within our format string and that will appear down here i could place this format specifier someplace else and this value would be added to wherever i put this format specifier so if i added this format specifier to the beginning of my format string then this value will appear at the beginning of my string so with the printf method you need a format string and either an object a variable or a value depending on where you place this format specifier the percent sign your value or variable will appear at this location think of it as you're replacing the format specifier with this value and depending on the combination of flags numbers and characters after this format specifier this is going to format and display your value a certain way depending on what combination of letters and characters comes after let's begin with conversion characters this is a letter that appears after the format specifier and the conversion character corresponds with the data type of the value that we're attempting to add so d corresponds with decimal numbers so we could add an integer at this location so let's go over a few of the conversion characters that are available to us but we'll need to create a few variables to do so so let's begin with a boolean boolean let's call this my boolean and i will set this to true we'll need a character so let's say char my char equals and then pick a symbol that you want to use we'll need a string string my string equals maybe your name we'll need an integer int my int and assign it a number i'm just going to pick one at random let's say 50. and let's add a double value so double my double equals maybe one thousand okay so these are not all of the data types that are available to us but a few of the more common ones for beginners so let's use the printf method and cover a few of the conversion characters so we will need to use the printf method system.out.printline printf and let's just use the format specifier so if we need to display a boolean value that would be percent then b for the conversion character to display a boolean and we need to add a second argument that is the value that we're attempting to add so let's add my boolean and we can now display whatever this value is so for characters that is actually percent c and let's display my character okay so strings are percent s so let's copy this paste it that is percent s and this will display a string should probably get rid of that line too okay and integers are d for decimal but we've covered that already so percent d for a integer let's display my int which displays 50 and percent f for a double value so that's for floating point numbers and double values so let's display my double so remember with conversion characters these are certain letters that follow the format specifier the percent sign and in order to display a certain object variable or value you need a matching conversion character to follow after the format specifier b for booleans c for characters as for strings d for integers and f for floats or doubles our next field is the width field so i already created some notes on this the width field sets the minimum number of characters to be written as output so here's an example we have a format string and we would like to display a value that is of the string data type so let's say at the end we're going to add percent s to display the string we can set a minimum number of characters to display so let's say we want to display at least 10 characters for this string so before the conversion character we can set a width and this is a number so if we want 10 spaces worth of room to display the string we would add 10 or some other number before the conversion character so before we display this i'm just going to turn these lines into comments and we will display hello plus my string which states bro so this prints a minimum of 10 characters for the name including the length of the name so we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten plus the space that was here already too so you can set a width and this will display a minimum number of characters to be written out and if you set this to be a negative number that's actually a flag that we'll get into in just a little bit that'll actually left justify the text within the space that we're allocating to display this value so this text is now left justified but all of that empty space now comes after my text my string next on our list is the precision field and what this will do is set a number of digits of precision when outputting floating point values these include the data types of floats or doubles here's an example i have a format string that states you have this much money and then we have a format specifier that will display my double this is the default so we need at least percent f and this will display one thousand as well as six zeros after our decimal we can limit the amount of digits that will display after this decimal by using the precision field so we write this before the conversion character let's say we would like to limit the amount of digits that we have after this decimal to 2 to represent cents so i'm going to add 0.2 for two digits and this will limit the amount of digits that will appear after the decimal portion and if we change this to a different number like one well then this will only display one so that is the precision field it will set a number of digits of precision when outputting floating point values and lastly we have flags these will add an effect to output based on the flag added to the format specifier here's a few we can leftjustify we can output a plus or minus sign for a numeric value we can have numeric values be padded with zeros and we can separate large numbers by the thousands by using a comma let's try a few of these out let's copy what we have for our example for precision so i'm going to copy this line and let's get rid of the precision so we have percent f let's left justify this so i'm going to set a width maybe 20 and set this to negative so this will left justify all of that although it's a little difficult to see i'm going to get rid of the left justify and this will now be right justified so this would be useful if you need to line up a bunch of numbers we can output a plus or minus sign for a numeric value so i'm going to add plus f and this should be plus one thousand if this was a negative number like negative one thousand this should appear as a minus now we can also pad our number with zeros so let's set a width of maybe 20 and we will right justify it so we do not need a negative sign and we are going to add zero so we now have a bunch of zeros before our number of 1000 and lastly we can separate each thousands place with a comma simply by adding a comma as the flag so percent comma f so at the one thousands place we now have a comma so that is all what the printf method is it's an optional method to control format and display text to the console window we need at least two arguments a format string as well as either an object a variable or a value we can add a format specifier within this format string and add a combination of characters and numbers to format our variable value or object a certain way so that is an intro more of a crash course to the printf method if you would like a copy of all this code i will post everything in the comments down below this video was a lot of work feel free to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if
