well okay then everybody we gotta talk about structs a struct is a structure that groups related variables under one name think of an array an array can store multiple values of the same data type well a struct can store multiple values of different data types we can store strings along with ins doubles booleans etc to create a struct let's do so outside of the main function type struct then we need an identifier this is kind of like the data type suppose we're going to group related variables for students i'll name this identifier student within the structure of student variables that we declare are known as members i think each student should have a name member this will be of the string data type string name i'll declare this but not yet assign it as well as a gpa that could be of the double data type then a boolean variable if they're currently enrolled or not enrolled then be sure to instruct with a semicolon our struct student is kind of like its own data type we can use this data type to declare variables i'll create a student variable of this data type and that variable will have these three different members a name a gpa and a boolean variable for being enrolled much like with creating a variable we type the data type student and then some name some identifier let's name the first student student one student one will have its own name gpa and enrolled status if i would like to assign the name member of student one i would type the name of the student student one followed by dot members can be accessed with a dot also known as the class member axis operator i'll assign the name member and set the sequel to spongebob i'll assign student one's gpa student1.gpa i'll give spongebob a solid 3.2 then i could set his enrolled status student1 dot enrolled i'll set this to be true then we could access these members i'll display them standard output student1 dot name i'll add a new line let's do the same thing with gpa and enrolled student1.gpa student1.enrolled this is what this looks like we have a student variable the name member is spongebob spongebob has a gpa of 3.2 when accessing boolean variables one corresponds with true zero corresponds with false enrolled is set to true so that would return one let's reuse the struct to create a second student i'll just copy what we have here then paste it we'll give the second student a different identifier such as student two student two will have a name member of patrick a gpa of 2.1 and he will be enrolled that's set to true let's display student two's members student2.name student2.gpa then student2.enrolled these first members correspond with student1 spongebob 3.2 one for true the second set is for student two patrick has a gpa of 2.1 and patrick is currently enrolled okay one last example let's create student three let's copy what we have paste it student student student3 student3.name student3.gpa student3.enrolled student 3's name will be squidward squidward has a gpa of 1.5 let's set enrolled to be false then display student three's members student3.name student3.gpa student3.enrolled and here are student 3's members squidward 1.5 and 0 that means false now with members you can set a default value i'll set enrolled to be true then we don't need to explicitly state that underneath spongebob patrick and squidward their enrolled member is all set to 1. with members you can set a default value so yeah those are structs it's a structure that groups related variables under one name structs can contain many different data types variables in a struct are known as members and members can be accessed with a dot the class member access operator so those are structs your assignment is to post a struct in the comments section down below and well yeah those are strucks in c plus plus
