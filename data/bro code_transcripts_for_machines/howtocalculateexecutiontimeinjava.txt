hey everybody in this video i thought i would show you all how you can get the runtime of a program i thought it might be useful now that we know how data structures and algorithms work for the most part so within the entry point of your program you'll need the start time and we'll store this within a long data type i'll name the start equals then type system dot nano time a nano second is a billionth of a second and then we have our program whatever it is and then at the end of our program we will get the duration this will be of the long data type duration equals and then we need the current time system dot nano time minus our start time this returns a time in nanoseconds if you need milliseconds you can divide this number by one million okay then let's print the duration system.out.printline duration plus milliseconds or some other unit to measure time okay so with our program let's just have the main thread sleep for maybe three seconds whatever it is you want to do and we will sleep for 3000 milliseconds and here we go so we will wait for three seconds and we are done this program took 3014 milliseconds to complete when you enter your program get the start time at the end of your program get the current time minus the start time then depending on the units you're using you may need to divide this number by a million or if you need this in seconds you would divide this by 1 billion so yeah that's how to calculate the runtime of a program if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
