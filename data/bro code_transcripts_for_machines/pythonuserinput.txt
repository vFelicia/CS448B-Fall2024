hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can accept some user input in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm ladies and gentlemen this is where the fun begins in this video i'm going to explain how we can accept some user input in python and we do so by using the input function and then we type in our input to the console window but it would probably be good practice to let the user know what we want them to type in exactly so let's ask for somebody's name within quotes inside the input function i'm going to type what is your name and now our program will wait for us to enter in some user input so you can use your own name for this example i'm going to type bro now to submit some user input you just type or press enter now you can see that my process finished with exit code 0 that means the program is done running so we should probably do something with this value we can actually assign it to a variable so we can use it elsewhere in our program so to do so we precede input with a variable like name works name equals input and when we accept some user input we will assign it to this variable that we called them and now we can do something with it so let's print a message involving our name variable that we have so how about hello plus name now when i run this program we can accept some user input and then do something with that input such as display message that says hello bro and then you can type in whatever you want for your name let's say i'm dude what is your name dude hello dude now this next part is very important when we accept user input it is always of the string data type a series of characters what if we need to accept a number well you can but you can't normally perform any math on it because it's of the string data type we would need to cast it as either of the integer data type or of the float data type so here's an example of why we can't perform any math on a string let's say we have a variable called edge age equals input and let's ask how old somebody is how old are you now i will add one to somebody's age let's pretend it's their birthday age equals age plus one this will add one to their age now let's try and run this what is your name bro how old are you let's say that i'm 21. okay we ran into an air a type error can only concatenate string to string with what i mentioned previously we cannot normally use strings for any sort of mathematical equation or operation we'll want to cast it to the integer or the float data type so let's cast our user input to the integer data type and we will surround our user input with a cast surround your input with a set of parenthesis and precede this with int and now we can use this user input in a mathematical operation so let's try it even though this won't display age yet so what is your name bro 21 and our program finished with an x account of zero there were no problems now let's attempt to display this age so i will print u r plus age plus years old we're doing some string concatenation here what is your name bro how old are you 21 alright we ran into a type error again can only concatenate string to string you cannot normally display a variable of the integer data type along with strings because we're doing string concatenation we're adding strings together we would need to convert this variable back to the string data type so we can cast it we'll surround our edge variable with a cast now this is what's gonna happen we will accept some user input it will be of the string data type and then we will immediately cast it to be of the integer data type so that we can treat it as a number instead of a character and then if we need to display this age we will need to convert it back to a string so that we can use some string concatenation and display all of these strings together and now let's try this theory so what is your name bro how old are you let's say i'm 21 hello bro you are 22 years old here's a situation what if we enter a number that contains a decimal portion so let's try this again let's say i'm 21.5 years old well now we ran into a different issue a value error invalid literal for int with base 10 that means if we cast a string as an integer it can only be a whole number a portion that does not contain a decimal and that is where the float data type would come in it is a data type that can contain a decimal portion for this example let's create a third variable called height and we will ask for somebody's height input we'll create a prompt that says how tall are you and we will cast this to be of the float data type so that our string our user input can contain a decimal portion and then we can treat it as a number instead of a series of characters and i think i will delete this line we won't really need it anymore and then let's print their height along with a message u r plus then height but we need to cast this back to being a string so we'll surround our height with a cast plus let's say cm tall all right let's test this what is your name bro how old are you let's say i'm 21 how tall are you let's pretend that i'm 250.5 centimeters tall i'm adding the 0.5 just to test to see if this will accept a floating point number hello bro you are 21 years old you are 250.5 centimeters tall not really all right everybody so that is the basics of user input in python normally with user input it will give you a value of the string data type if you need to use that value for any sort of math you'll probably need to cast it to be of the integer or the float data type so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how to accept user input in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro so you
