hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can make a very basic gui application in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right guys and gals i'm going to teach you all how to create a very basic gui program gui is an acronym for graphical user interface it's a visual program that we can see and interact with kind of like this so we'll be using the j option pane class and be creating a few message dialog boxes before we begin we'll need an import so outside your class let's type this import java x dot swing dot j option pin so we will be working with the j option pane class now what we would like to do is type in some user information into a sort of dialog box and we'll store this as a string variable called name kind of like what we did on the video on user input string name and in order to create an input dialog box we're going to type the name of the class j option pane dot and there's a few options what we would like is show input dialog and you can really just pick any of these and we can type in a message so with this message let's state enter your name and when we run this this is what we have we have the small gui dialog box and we can type in our name and submit it but it currently doesn't do anything so let's create another message dialog box that will display our name along with a message so j option pain dot show message dialogue for now you can just type in no comma and then a message let's say hello plus name and let's try it so our first dialog box is the show input dialog message and we can type in our name and submit a name and our second box here is a message dialog box this just displays some information such as a string of text and it says hello bro this time let's ask for an edge and store this value within an integer variable called age int age equals and we can just copy all of this j option pane dot show input dialog and the message will be enter your edge there is one issue though when you use the show input dialog box it's going to return a string and we're attempting to assign the string into an integer variable so what we would need to do is convert this to an integer and there is actually a method to do that so what i'm going to do is use the integer wrapper class and use the parseint method and within the parenthesis we're going to take all of this and copy it within our parseint method and then add a semicolon at the end so this will return a string based on what the user types in and the parseint method will convert it to an integer that we can store it within our integer variable of age and then we can display this so let's display this with another message dialog box j option pane dot show message dialog null will be the first argument and our message will be u r plus age plus years old and let's try it enter your name bro press okay hello bro then when we click okay again it's going to go to our next input dialog box enter your age let's say that i'm 18 click ok you are 18 years old now let's try this with a double data type this time let's create a variable called maybe height this will be a double value and the variable name will be height so since we're working with double values we're going to change integer to double double with a capital d dot parse double and the message will be enter your height and our message dialog will be u r height and let's say this is in centimeters tall so we have to be sure that we're getting the right data type because when you use the input dialog box it's going to return a string so if you're attempting to assign that string to a certain data type you have to convert it to that specific data type so let's try this enter your name bro okay hello bro what is your age let's say i'm 18 press okay you're 18 years old enter your height i don't know what a good height is 240 centimeters and then click ok you are 240.0 centimeters tall in conclusion ladies and gentlemen what we have made is a very simple graphical user interface for fun this is completely optional at this point but we will be learning more about gooeys later in this playlist so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below and if you could do me a favor down below smash the like button drop a comment and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
