what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about radio buttons in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running well howdy y'all we're gonna be talking about radio buttons in this video so the definition of j radio buttons is that these are one or more buttons in a grouping in which only one may be selected per group so let me give you a demonstration of my setup before we actually get into radio buttons i have two classes one just called main it contains my main method and an instance of my other class my frame so my frame extends jframe it behaves exactly like a jframe it also implements an action listener and within this constructor i just have this dot set default close operation jframe exit on close i'm using a new flow layout this dot pack and this dot set visible set to true and then i also have an action performed method within here so let's get started by making some j radio buttons here's a scenario for this example let's say that i'm buying you lunch because i'm such a nice guy but you can only pick one item from the menu you can pick either a slice of pizza a hamburger or a hot dog so we're going to create three radio buttons and you can select one of those choices and we're going to place all of these within one grouping so let's begin by creating a radio button for pizza so to create a radio button it is j radio button and we'll call this radio button the pizza button j radio button pizza button equals new j radio button all right let's do the same thing for a hamburger button and a hot dog button so j radio button this will be our hamburger button and then a hot dog button so we can set some text we can either use the set text method or we can just pass in a string within the constructor so just for convenience i'm going to pass in pizza then hamburger then hot dog and then we need to add these buttons to the frame so this dot add let's add our pizza button first followed by hamburger and then hot dog and this is what we should have all right we have pizza hamburger and hot dog but wait a second we've been bamboozled we can select all of these items if we wanted so we can actually limit the choice selection to only one item but we have to put all of these radio buttons within the same grouping because right now we can select all of these and i promised you only one thing for lunch today so we need to place these within a button group so let's place this here we're going to create a new button group and we'll just call this group equals new button group and then we need to add these radio buttons to this group we can do that by typing in the name of the group dot add and what are we adding all of these buttons so let's add the pizza button followed by the hamburger button so group dot add hamburger button and then the hot dog button and now we can only select one item one thing you should know every time that you select one of these choices it's actually triggering an event and we can use our action performed method to detect which button was selected so within our action performed method we can place a simple if statement if e dot get source is equal to let's begin with our pizza button if somebody selects the pizza button then they get pizza so let's do a system.out.printline you ordered pizza but notice this action performed method does not recognize our pizza button that's because we declared our pizza button within the constructor of our my frame class so this is a local component we need to turn this global so we can do that by just declaring this outside of our constructor since we've declared this pizza button outside of the constructor this action performed method does recognize it now however we want to get rid of this portion where we declare this pizza button twice but we do want to finish instantiating this and we should do the same thing for our hamburger button as well as our hot dog button so we're going to declare these but not yet instantiate them until we're within our constructor so hamburger button equals new j radio button and then we want to declare the hotdog button outside of the constructor and then instantiate it within the constructor so then the action performed method can actually recognize all of these components so if e that gets source is equal to the pizza button we'll print you order pizza then we'll do the same thing for our hamburger button and our hotdog button and let's just use an else if statement to keep this simple there's more sophisticated ways of doing this but we're still noobs so it's okay if we do if statements so if e dot get source is equal to the hamburger button i don't feel like typing all this i'm going to paste it then we will just system.out.printline you ordered a hamburger and then else if e dot get source is equal to our hot dog button system.out.println you ordered a hotdog and let's run this here we have our pizza button hamburger button and our hotdog button but wait a second we've been bamboozled again because when we select these it's not printing out our message well that's because we still need to add an action listener to each of these buttons so let's work on that next i'll just add them here so let's select each of these buttons so we have our pizza button and we need to add an action listener so pizzabun dot add action listener now since we're implementing an action listener interface we can simply just pass in this and then let's do the same thing for our hamburger button and our hotdog button now these radio buttons will be able to listen for events and when we click on one of our radio buttons we will order our selected item you ordered a pizza you ordered a hamburger and you ordered a hot dog this is entirely optional but you can actually change the icons that you're using for these radio buttons so within my project folder i have three images that i want to use an emoji of a slice of pizza a hot dog and a hamburger so i'm going to create some image icons out of these and we're going to set the icon for each of these radio buttons to that image so if you have a few in mind let's begin so let's create a few image icons so for my first icon this will be my pizza icon then i'll do the same thing for hamburger and hot dog and then within the constructor i'll finish instantiating this so pizza icon equals new image icon and i'm going to list the file path of where this is located since this is within my same project folder i can just simply list the file name so my first image is pizza.png and then hamburger then hot dog all right so i have all of my image icons set up now to add an icon to a button there is a function to do so i'll add them here so type in the name of the button uh there it is pizza button dot you can either set icon or set selected icon i'm just going to use set icon and list the icon that you want to use i want to use my pizza icon so i'll put that here and then let's do the same for the other buttons so hamburger button dot set icon hamburger icon and then lastly hot dog and now those circles are going to be replaced with our images and they work just the same so we have a slice of pizza a hamburger and a hot dog alright so that's the basics of creating radio buttons in java if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating radio buttons in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if
