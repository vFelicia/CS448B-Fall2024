hey how's it going everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about switches in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you can become a hero and save our channel by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro okay welcome back ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to explain how switches work a switch is a statement that allows a variable or other value to be tested for equality against a list of values so if you find yourself in a situation where you're using a lot of if statements back to back it's probably more efficient to use a switch statement instead here are the different data types that we can use to test for equality within a switch and according to this description one thing that we can check is the equality of a string for this program let's test to see if a string let's say it's going to be a day of the week is equal to a list of days of the week if there's a match we can display a custom message so let's say string day equals maybe friday because i like friday and we will create a switch to see if our day equals a certain day so this is how to create a switch type in the word switch a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces within the parentheses we're going to list the value or the variable we would like to test for equality against a listing of cases so our first case will be sunday this is what we're comparing our value or variable to we're going to compare this variable to our case so type in the word case followed by the value colon and if there is a match what would you like to do so i would like to perform a print line statement that states it is sunday and then this next part is important it's important to add the keyword break so we break out of the switch and continue on with the rest of our code so let's create another case for monday so i'm going to copy and paste change sunday to monday and i will print it is monday so i'm going to repeat this process a few times and it's done so i have a case for each day of the week sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and i have a corresponding print line statement for each day of the week sunday monday tuesday so on and so forth so with our string of day we're going to place this within the switch statement to compare for equality against a list of values one by one our switch is going to evaluate our day against each case if there is a match it's going to perform this subset of code if there is no match it's going to continue down to the next case and check to see if these values are equal so let's test it currently our day is set to friday so this should display it is friday alright so let's change this to monday next and this will display it is monday all right this is why it's important to have these breaks after each case so i'm going to remove this for this demonstration and show you why these are important so if we were to run this again this time we do not have those breaks as soon as there is a matching case we will perform this subset of code as well as each subset of code that comes after our matching case so that's why it's important to have these breaks within well after each case within our switch so what if there is no match let's say our day is equal to pizza which is not a day but honestly it really should be well it will basically just do nothing so one thing that we could do is add a default default colon if there is no match what do we want to do system.out.printline that is not a day so let's try this again if there is no match within our switch we will perform whatever is set within the default case which displays pizza is not a did so that's all what a switch is it allows a variable or other value to be tested for equality against a list of values if you find yourself in a situation where you're using a lot of if statements it might be better to use a switch instead so that's all about switches if you'd like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below please be sure to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
