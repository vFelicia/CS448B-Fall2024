hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can create hyperlinks a hyperlink is a digital reference to data that a user can follow by clicking or tapping a button or link to create a hyperlink we will need a pair of a tags a means anchor then we'll sandwich some text between these two tags such as click me we're missing one thing what we'll need within the opening a tag is an attribute an href attribute an attribute is typically a name value pair that modifies the behavior of an element href means hypertext reference we're referencing something within the set of quotes we can list a web page or a file to link to let's begin by linking an external website like Google let's paste the URL within the href attribute save then when I click on this link it takes me to Google or some other website of your choosing based on what's within the set of quotes there are more attributes you can add as well they're optional another is Target Target equals if you set Target to be underscore blank this link will open this URL in either a new tab or a new window depending on your settings Google has opened in a new tab for me another attribute is title the title attribute displays additional information about the element as a tool tip I'll add a message goes to Google when I hover over this link we have a tooltip that states goes to Google that's an additional option too this URL is an absolute URL you can also list a relative URL So based on the last video we have an HTML file of song lyrics within our index file we will link to our lyrics file so let's create another hyperlink we'll need a pair of a tags meaning anchor we'll need some text song lyrics is good then we'll need an hrep attribute href equals these two files are right next to each other for a relative file path all we need is the file name lyrics dot HTML I'm going to add a line break real quick PR meaning line break then when I click on this link it takes me to my other HTML file you could add these additional attributes if you would like one last link I'll create a line break we'll create a link that begins the process of emailing someone we'll need a pair of a tags the text will be email me href attribute will be set to now to send an email type mail to colon then an email address I'll make up one test at fake.com when I click on this link we begin the process of sending an email to this email address however I'm not signed in so this is as far as it'll take me currently okay now for an exercise let's go to our lyrics HTML file open with live server let me zoom out based on the last project you should have a web page with some song lyrics that you like we'll create a hyperlink to the original video let's do that after the artist that would be right here but before the horizontal rule we'll create a pair of a tags I'll add some text or original video then you'll need to find the url for the original video for your song all right I will set the href attribute to be that URL the URL for a YouTube video so when I click on the link it now takes me to YouTube all right everybody that's a hyperlink it's a digital reference to data that a user can follow by clicking or tapping a button or link and those are hyperlinks in HTML
