all right what's going on abstract classes abstract is a keyword that we can apply to classes properties and methods but in this video we're going to focus on abstract classes now you can apply the abstract keyword it's a modifier to a class and that indicates that this class is missing components or is an incomplete implementation so let's take a look we're using inheritance here so i have a class vehicle vehicle has a speed field as well as a go method and there's three children classes car bicycle and boat and these are complete implementations so car has four wheels and a max speed of 500 bicycle has two wheels a max speed of 50 and boat has zero wheels and a max speed of 100 i just made up some numbers for the max speed i can create a car object bicycle object and boat object just fine these are complete implementations but unfortunately i can also create a vehicle object vehicle vehicle equals new vehicle so vehicle is incomplete it's missing a number of wheels and a max speed so imagine that we're having a race and somebody decides to pick the vehicle but we want somebody to pick a specific implementation of a vehicle like a car bicycle or boat i would like to prevent people from creating generic vehicle objects so this is kind of like imagine somebody picks the invisible vehicle and like a racing game or something one way in which i can prevent people from instantiating vehicle objects because it's not finished it's an incomplete implementation is to precede this class definition with this abstract keyword so if i precede class with abstract i can no longer create a vehicle object cannot create an instance of the abstract type or interface vehicle so that adds a little bit of security to our programs if there's a class that you do not want to be able to instantiate objects from you can just precede that class definition with the abstract keyword and you cannot create an object from that class and that's basically what the abstract modifier does we can indicate that a class we can also apply this to properties and methods as well but that's a video for another day so when we precede a class definition with abstract we are indicating that that class is missing components or is incomplete so we should not be able to instantiate objects from this class which adds a little bit of security so yeah that's the abstract keyword if you found this video helpful help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and well yeah that's the abstract modifier in csharp
