hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate how we can create a menu bar in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right menu bars menu bars are found underneath the controls drop down menu so drag and drop one place it anywhere that you wish i'll place mine in the top left corner of my pane and by holding down one of the sides of your menu bar you can expand the dimensions of your menu bar i'll expand mine so that it takes up the entire width of my pane now if you were to head to hierarchy there's a hierarchy of nodes within a menu bar by default there are three menus found within my menu bar file edit and help you can add menus delete menus or change the text of a menu let's say i would no longer like this edit menu i can right click then go to delete and it's gone to change the text of a menu we can either double click on our menu or we can go to text and change it here let's say help is now help me with a bunch of exclamation points now you can add a menu by going to the menu drop down menu and there's a bunch of nodes related to menu bars so we are looking for a menu node and let's say we would like a new menu between our file menu and help me menu so i will drag and drop this and place it between my file menu and help me menu within my hierarchy so i will drag and drop this and place it about here and i'll give this some text of something because i can't think of anything as of now we have three menus within our menu bar file something and help me we can preview our program by going to our menu bar found within scene builder then going to preview then show preview and window so here are the three menus that we created file something and help me if you were to click on one of these menus this will display a drop down list of different menu items and these are separate nodes so to add a menu item click on the plus button of one of your menus let's say we would like to add more menu items to our menu node by default there is a close menu item so to add a menu item go to the menu item node found underneath the menu drop down menu then drag and drop it and place it underneath a menu of your choosing and we can give this some text let's say this will be a new menu item and let's preview it show in preview file new close let's add another for practice what about a save menu item so that would be menu item drag and drop it i'll place this after new change the text to save let's preview underneath file we have new save and close now there's also this separator menu item this separates different groups of menu items so this is basically just a horizontal line that is drawn across so i'll demonstrate so i'm going to go to preview show in preview and between save and close we have this horizontal line basically this will separate different groups of menu items this is a separator menu item node another interesting node is the check menu item node so this gives us the ability to toggle between being checked and unchecked let's say that we have some sort of auto save feature so i'm just going to name the text of this check menu item auto save then preview so with this check menu item we can toggle this on or off so this is a check menu item node now there's also radio menu items we can only select one radio menu item from any toggle group so let's say we have some additional options let's say we have option one and then a second radio menu item which will be named option two let me place that here and we want to be sure to include them within the same toggle group if we can only select one of these radio menu items so let's say that this toggle group will be my group i suppose and let's do the same for our other radio menu item okay let's preview it show in preview file we have option one and option two we can only select one of these options because these are radio menu item nodes and they are within the same toggle group now to link a method call to one of your menu items click on a menu item head to the code drop down menu and within on action list a method name that you plan on defining let's create a method named new method so before we head to our controller class let's make sure that our controller class is linked let's save and head to our controller class now make sure that you update your fxml file you can always refresh your project by rightclicking then going to refresh now we'll need to define that method public void new method all we'll do is print a message to our console you selected the new menu item okay let's run it here's my menu bar i have three separate menus file something help me i have a bunch of different menu items within this menu of file new save auto save option one option two so we linked this new method method to my new menu item if i was to click on this menu item it will invoke this method of new method which will print you selected the new menu item now before you go i'm going to show you all how we can use a keyboard shortcut to select one of these menu items what we need to do is add an accelerator and we can do that within scene builder so within scene builder let's head to our hierarchy and i'm going to add an accelerator to our new menu item that can be found underneath properties then go to accelerator and we need a modifier and a key let's set the keyboard shortcut to select our new menu item to be what about alt and n so the modifier will be alt let's say alt down and the main key will be n and for new okay so let's save then head back to our controller and run it make sure that you refresh your project as well now let's run it so next to my new menu item we have this keyboard shortcut of alt plus n let's try it so i'm going to hold down alt then type n you selected the new menu item well everybody that's how to create a menu bar in javafx don't be afraid to smash that like button drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a
