hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how dictionaries work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right let's get down to business a dictionary is a changeable unordered collection of unique key value pairs they're fast because they use hashing and they allow us to access a value quickly now to create a dictionary it's very similar to creating a set based on the last video except we're going to store unique key value pairs let's create a dictionary of countries and their capitals we can store those as key value pairs so let's call this dictionary capitals capitals equals then we need a set of curly braces much like what we use with sets now we need a key and a value let's say we have the usa as a key and the capital of the usa would be washington dc so in order to associate a value with the key we'll follow the key with a colon and then add some value and the data type really doesn't matter but in this case we're just using strings so the capital of the usa would be washington dc and to add another key value pair we'll separate each with a comma and let's add a few others for good measure so let's say we have india next as a key and the value would be new delhi and we'll add two more let's say we have china and the capital of china is beijing and lastly let's add russia and the capital of russia is moscow and there you have it ladies and gentlemen we now have a dictionary called capitals that has unique key value pairs so remember with dictionaries they are unordered in order to access one of these values instead of using a numbered index we're going to use the associated key with that value here's an example let's say i would like to print the capital of russia so i need to use this key of russia so in order to do this type in the name of the dictionary followed by a set of straight brackets and then instead of an index number like 0 or 1 2 3 i'm going to use the key so i would like to print the value that's stored or associated with the key of russia so when i run this this will print that value which is moscow so this isn't always safe let's say we have a key that doesn't exist like germany germany is not currently within my dictionary so if i were to run this well then my program is going to encounter an error and this will interrupt the normal flow of my program a much safer way to access a key to check to see if it's there or not is to use the get method of dictionaries so i'm going to turn this line into a comment and let's try this again but this time we'll use the get method so type in the name of the dictionary dot get and list the key that you want to use so i would like to see if germany is within my dictionary currently there isn't so this will return none and we will not encounter an error so this is a much safer way of checking to see if there is a key within your dictionary here's a few other useful methods there is a method to print only the keys so we type in the name of the dictionary capitals and here's a listing of all of the methods that we have access to i'm looking for the keys method and this will print only the keys and not the values we can also print just the values and not the keys so type in the name of the dictionary again capitals dot values and this will print only the values or you could print everything both the keys and the values and you do so by using the items method capitals dot items and this will print your entire dictionary one other way in which we can display all of the key value pairs in a dictionary is to use a for loop so at the end let's create a for loop for key comma value in capitals dot items this is going to iterate once for each key value pair in my dictionary for each key value in capitals dot items print key comma value and this will print my entire dictionary a feature of dictionaries is that they are mutable that means we can change them or alter them after the program is already running so one way in which we can do that is to use the update method of dictionaries so let's add germany as a key and give it a value of berlin so type in the name of the dictionary capitals and we'll use the update method and within the parentheses of this method we'll add a set of curly braces and now we can add a new key value pair so let's add germany and a value of berlin so if i were to run this and display all of the key value pairs found within my dictionary we now have germany as a key and berlin as its value not only can you use the update method to add a new key value pair but you can update an existing one let's say we would like to change the capital of the usa so capitals dot update parentheses curly braces list the key usa colon and then we can give the usa a new value let's pretend that the united states government has decided to relocate their capital to las vegas so this will now update our key of usa with a new value and if i were to print all of the key value pairs found within my dictionary of capitals the usa has a new value of las vegas so the last two methods i'm going to cover are both pop and clear you can use the pop method to remove a key value pair so capitals dot pop parentheses and list the key of the key value pair that you would like to remove so let's say we would like to remove china so we'll list that key and then when we use the pop method that will remove this key value pair from my dictionary and then of course we have clear as well which will just remove everything capitals dot clear and this will clear my dictionary alright everybody so in conclusion a dictionary is a changeable unordered collection of unique key value pairs they're fast because they use hashing and they allow us to access a value quickly well that's the basics of dictionaries in python if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how dictionaries work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then
