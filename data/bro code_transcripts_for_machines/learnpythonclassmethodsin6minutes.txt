hey what's going on people so today I got to talk about class methods in Python a class method allows operations related to the class itself they take CLS as the first parameter whereas instance methods will take self self refers to any object created from that class CLS meaning class refers to the class not any objects here's an example we will create a class of student we'll need a Constructor to construct some student objects all students will have a name and a GPA selfname equals name self. GPA equals GPA we will also create a class variable for this demonstration of count we will count how many students we create whenever we construct a student object we will access the class of student student take our count variable increment it by one whenever we create a student object increase count by one I will create an instance method of get info instance methods have self as the first parameter we're referring to the object we're currently working with I will return an F string where we will display the students name and and their GPA self. name self. GPA I'll add a comment that this is an instance method Now to create a class method to work with class data we will declare a class method with a class method decorator class method what we're going to do is Def find a method to get the count the class variable of count this method will be called get count rather than self as the first parameter we'll be working with a class CLS meaning class I will return ANF string total number of students at a placeholder CLS count Let's test this to call a class method you take the name of the class followed by the class method get count and then we do need to print this what is the count of my current students total number of students is zero let's create a few student objects we will create student one equals call the student Constructor we have to pass in a name and a GPA let's say that the name is SpongeBob SpongeBob has a GPA of 3.2 we'll create two more students student two student three student two will be Patrick Patrick has a 2.0 then Sandy Sandy Smart in fact she's a genius she has a perfect 4.0 now let's count the number of students total number of students is three when we call this class method we can access or modify class data this class variable of count rather than using self we use CLS for the class let's create one more class method this time I'll calculate the total GPA of all my students we'll need a class variable to hold that data let's say total GPA equals z whenever we construct a student object we will access our class of student get the total GPA then add plus equals this students GPA that we have just created basically speaking the total GPA this variable is going to accumulate all of the GPA of every student and store it as a sum to find the average we're going to divide it by the count the number of students we'll do that within a class method to create a class method again we need to use the class method decorator I will Define a method of get average GPA the first parameter is CLS for class I will check if CLS count the count variable of my class is equal to zero that means if we have no students if that's the case if there's no students we're going to return zero because otherwise we're going to divide by zero and we'll get an error else we're going to return an F string follow this formula we're going to take the total GPA of my class class. total GPA divided by class. count the number of students we have that's how to calculate the average GPA after getting the count of the number students tax us a class method we take the name of the class student call the class method get average GPA then I will print it total number of students is three the average GPA is 3.06 repeating after calculating the average I'm going to add a format specifier of. 2f just around to two decimal places and I'll add average GPA coin space then we'll calculate the average all right everybody those are class methods instance methods are best for operations on instances of the class any objects static methods are best for General utility functions which do not need access to class data class methods are best used when we're working with class level data or we require access to the class itself such as when we're working with class variables rather than using self as the first parameter we're going to use CLS meaning class and well everybody those are class methods in Python
