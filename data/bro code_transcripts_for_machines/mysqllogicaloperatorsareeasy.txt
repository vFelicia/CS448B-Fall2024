why hello again everybody guess who it's me again today I will be explaining logical operators in MySQL I would think of them as keywords that are used to combine more than one condition for my examples to make more sense I will add one more column a job column so let's alter our table of employees alter table employees add column job the data type will be varchar25 I'll add this column after our hourly pay column then select all from my table employees here is our job column let's add some jobs to our employees let's update employees set job equal to Let's select Mr Krabs he will be a manager then be sure to add a where Clause employee ID equals one Mr Krabs is a manager Squidward will be a cashier employee ID equals to SpongeBob employee ID3 he will be a cook Patrick will also be a cook Sandy will be an assistant manager let's abbreviate the word assistant manager Plankton Plankton will be a janitor how is this related to logical operators you're wondering well using logical operators we can check more than one condition suppose that our boss wants us to find any Cooks that were hired before January 5th how can we write a query that can satisfy those two conditions here's how we will use the and logical operator select all from our table employees using a where Clause we will write two conditions find any employees where the higher date is less than the year 2023 January 5th so far this would give us three results Mr Krabs Squidward and SpongeBob from these three employees how do we find any Cooks well we can add the and logical operator and we can write some other condition job is equal to cook there we have SpongeBob he is a cook that was hired before January 5th so that's the analogical operator you will return any results that match these two criteria another logical operator is or you can check more than one condition as long as one of those conditions is true that row will be true let's find any cooks or cashiers where the job is equal to cook that gives us both SpongeBob and Patrick they're both Cooks or job is equal to cashier that would also include Squidward he's not a cook but he is a cashier with the or logical operator only one condition needs to be true whereas with the andological operator both conditions must be true so that's the main difference between the and as well as or logical operators with the not logical operator not is a little different not basically reverses anything you say let's find any employees that are not a manager where not job equals manager we have all of our employees besides Mr Krabs we have cashiers Cooks assistant managers and janitors you can combine logical operators too let's find anybody that's not a manager and not an assistant manager let's add and not job equals assistant manager we have everybody besides a manager and besides an assistant manager Mr Krabs and Sandy are not within the results so that is the not logical operator it basically reverses whatever condition you write there's also between is used within a single column it's very similar to the andalogical operator except people prefer to use the between logical operator when working with the same column just because of its readability let's find any employees where the higher date is between January 4th and January 7th where higher date between two values 2023 0 1 0 4 and 2023 0 107 so we have SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Sheldon there's also the in logical operator we can find any values that are within a set let's find where job is in cook cashier or a janitor yep we have a cashier a cook a cook and a janitor there is more than one way to write a query where you need to match more than one condition really the best way depends on your data set basically speaking logical operators are used to check more than one condition but they're done so in different ways depending on the logical operator that you're using but yeah those are logical operators in MySQL
