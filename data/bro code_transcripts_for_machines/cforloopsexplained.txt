all right guys in this video i'm going to explain for loops a for loop is a loop that will execute a block of code a specified amount of times to create a for loop we type four parentheses curly braces within the for loop there are up to three statements that we can add the first is that we can create an index a sort of counter int index i'll set the sequel to be we'll start at one then finish the statement with a semicolon now what a lot of people do instead of saying index they'll just shorten this to i the second statement is a stopping condition let's count up to three i'll continue this as long as i is less than or equal to three then semicolon to finish that statement the third statement is that we can increment or decrement our counter our index i'll increment my index by one by saying i plus plus okay let's repeat something three times standard output how about happy new year happy new year this code should be repeated three times happy new year happy new year happy new year i should probably add a new line now let's try this five times we'll begin i at one we'll continue this as long as i is less than or equal to five okay one two three four five that's it this time let's count up to ten then display happy new year once we exit out of the for loop i'll move this line to outside of the for loop i'll set i to be 1. we'll continue this as long as i is less than or equal to 10. during each iteration of the for loop i will display whatever i is standard output i then i'll add a new line okay here we go we're starting at 1 then we're counting up to 10 then we escape the for loop once we escape the for loop then we print happy new year when you increment or decrement your counter you can skip iterations let's increase i by two after each iteration i plus equals two now we're counting up by twos one three five seven nine happy new year we can even set our index to be a different number let's begin at zero we're still counting up by twos zero two four six eight happy new year we could even increment i by three zero three six nine happy new year or we could decrement and go backwards i minus minus this time we will begin at 10 then continue as long as i is less than or equal to zero so this would be a countdown ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero happy new year okay let's decrement i by two after each iteration i minus equals two ten eight six four two zero happy new year so yeah everybody that's a for loop there's a lot of overlap where you could use either a while loop or a for loop for loops tend to be better in situations where you only need to repeat code a certain amount of times your assignment is to post a use of the for loop in the comment section down below and well yeah those are for loops in c plus
