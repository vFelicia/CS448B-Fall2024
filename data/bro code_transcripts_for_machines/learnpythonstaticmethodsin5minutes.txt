hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to talk about static methods in Python a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than any object from that class any instance instance methods we're already familiar with them they are methods that belong to individual objects created from that class they're best for operations on instances of that class any objects whereas static methods they're best for utility functions within a class that do not need access to class data I'll demonstrate the differences between an instance method and a static method we'll Begin by creating a class of employee we'll need a Constructor let's define that to create an employee object we'll need a name and a job position we will assign self. name equals name self.pos equals position we will create an instance method of get info we will return employee info we will return an F string where we will display self. name equals self.pos get info is an instance method each object that we create from this class will have their their own get info method to return the information on that object the object's name and the object's position now we'll create a static method to create a static method we need a decorator of static method static methods are best for General utility functions within a class we'll Define a method to check to see if a job a position is valid which we will name is valid position so static methods they don't have self as the first argument we're not working with any objects created from this class to check to see if a position is valid we will pass in a job position which I will name as position I will create a list of valid positions let's assume that our company is the Crusty Crab what are some valid positions a manager is a valid position a cashier a cook then let's say a janitor then we will return we'll use a membership operator check if position that we receive is in our list of valid positions what we have done is that we have created a static method we don't need to rely on any objects to use this method for example to use a static method we will use the name of the class rather than any object that we create from this class such as this we don't need to do that we type the class name followed by the static method is valid position then I did set this up to accept one argument let's check to see if a cook is a valid position then I do need to print this what is the output a cook is a valid position what about a rocket scientist that would probably be sy's job that is false a rocket scientist is not a valid position at the K crusty crab this is a static method it belongs to the class not any object created from that class now let's create a few employee objects let's say employee one equals a new employee we have to pass in a name and a job Eugene will be the first name that's Mr Krabs he will be a manager employee 2 equals employee Squidward will be a cashier employee 3 equals employee employee 3 will be SpongeBob SpongeBob will be a cook to call an instance method we have to access one of the instances of the class in order to use it if I want to check the info on employee 1 I will access that object that instance use the get info method then I need to print it take employee one get the info Eugene is the manager let's do this with employee 2 and employee 3 Eugene Mr Krabs is the manager Squidward is the cashier SpongeBob is the cook for an instance method you access an object then call the instance method with the static method you you only need to access that class you don't even need to create any objects from that class it's a general utility method all right everybody those are static methods they're a method that belongs to a class rather than any objects created from that class they're usually used for General utility functions that do not need access to class data and well everybody those are static methods in Python
