what is going on everybody today I'm going to show you how we can use the filter function in Python the filter function returns all elements that pass a condition some sort of test we pass in a function and a collection something that's iterable in this example we will create a list of grades such as student grades make up some numbers here is my list of grades I will filter any grades that are 60 or above and store them within a new list named passing grades if your grade is 60 or above you pass We'll add you to this new list so we are going to use the filter function we pass in a function and our collection we can either declare function or passing a Lambda function in this first example let's declare a function of is passing we will pass in a Grade now with this function we have to check a condition we will return a Boolean value by examining our grade then checking to see if the grade is greater than or equal to 60 if so you pass if not we return false we will we'll pass in the name of this function as the first argument the second argument to the filter function will be our collection of grades now here's what happens if I print my passing grades we are given a filter object it is iterable if we need to look at the elements for every grade in passing grades I will print each grade grade so here are the passing grades 91 83 75 67 all the grades are 60 or above we could convert it back into a list by typc casting it enclose the filter function within the list function and this will stay as a list I will print my passing grades and now we can see them 91 83 75 67 rather than passing in the name of a function to the filter function we don't necessarily need to think of a unique name for this function we could pass in a Lambda function instead that does the same thing rather than passing a function name we will pass in a Lambda function a small Anonymous function we type Lambda the first parameter which was grade colon then our condition we we will return a Boolean by stating is our grade greater than or equal to 60 and this would work too and it does help keep the name space clean because we don't constantly need to think of unique function names all right everybody so that is the filter function we pass in a function that checks a condition as well as a collection the filter function takes each element within that collection and runs it past a condition if it's true we can put it within a new list or other type of collection using a list comprehension is another possibility for this honestly I think a list comprehension would still be easier but you should still be familiar with both methods you don't know when you're going to run into either but hey at least you're familiar with the filter function and that is the filter function in Python
