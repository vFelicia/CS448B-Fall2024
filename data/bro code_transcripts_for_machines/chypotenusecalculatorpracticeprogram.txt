okay everybody this is going to be a practice project to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle which we can find with this formula c equals the square root of a squared plus b squared we'll begin by declaring our variables double a double b double c make sure you include c math as well because we'll be using the power function as well as the square root function at this point we'll accept some user input for sides a and b standard output will create a prompt enter side a standard input a then we'll need side b standard output enter side b standard input b we can handle this formula step by step we could reassign a equal to function a to the power of two b equals power function b to the power of two side c equals the square root of a plus b then at the end we will display whatever side c is standard output side c c okay let's try this enter side a i'll type in three side b will be four side c is five we could shorten this code too we could say the square root of a to the power of two plus b to the power of two then we no longer need these two lines that's another way of writing it in less lines of code let's try this again this time side a will be four side b will be five side c is 6.4 so yeah everybody that's a simple practice project just to get us used to accepting user input as well as some math related functions if you would like a copy of this program i'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a simple practice project in c plus plus
