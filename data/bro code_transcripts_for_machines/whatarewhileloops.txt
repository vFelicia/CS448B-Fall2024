hey everybody in this video i'm going to explain while loops a while loop is much like an if statement except we can repeat some code potentially an infinite amount of times here's an example of where a while loop would be useful let's say that we'll have a user enter in their name standard string name at first i'll use an if statement if name i'll check to see if the name is empty did the user actually type in something if name is empty we'll create a prompt standard output enter your name standard getline standard input name once we exit the if statement we'll display a message involving the user's name standard output hello name and to your name i'm just going to hit enter and not enter in anything hello and i don't have a name what if we need to force the user to do something in order to continue with the rest of the program well we could change this if statement to a while loop if this condition remains true we will execute this code a potentially infinite amount of times once we reach the end of this code block we check the condition again if it's still true we repeat the code again enter your name i'm going to hit enter enter your name no enter your name no enter your name no so i can't actually continue with the rest of my program until i type in something i'll type in my full name hit enter hello whatever your name is basically speaking a while loop is kind of like an if statement except it can repeat some code infinitely as long as this condition remains true we check this condition once when we enter the while loop then any time we finish the while loop we check the condition again if the condition is false we exit then continue on with the rest of the program you do want some way to exit the while loop let's write a condition that we won't be able to change at all while one is equal to one there's no way we can escape this while loop so this is what's known as an infinite loop i'll display a message help i'm stuck in an infinite loop then when i run this yeah we're stuck in an infinite loop and we can't actually move on or do anything so yeah that's basically a while loop everybody while some condition that you set remains true you will continue to execute some code a great use of a while loop is that you can force a user to do something in order to continue with the rest of the code your assignment is to use a while loop then post it in the comment section down below and well yeah those are while loops in c plus plus
