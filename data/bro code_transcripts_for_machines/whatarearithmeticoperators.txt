all right everybody welcome we are going to discuss arithmetic operators arithmetic operators return the result of a specific arithmetic operation such as addition subtraction multiplication and division let's say we have 20 students int students equals 20. if a new student joins our class we would like to add one student well if we're working with the variable we could say students equals whatever students is plus one then we could display this standard output i will display students the current number of students that we have are 21. there is a shorthand way of writing this too in place of saying students equal students plus one we could shorten this to students plus equals one that would do the same thing 21 if we need to add two students this would be students equal students plus two or students plus equals 2. then we have 22 students if you need to add 1 to a variable you could also use the increment operator this is another option and the preferred way if you only need to add one you would say students plus plus we now have 21 students you tend to see this in a lot of loops which we'll cover later okay now we have subtraction students equal students minus 1. there are now 19 students we could shorten this to students minus equals 1. there are 19 students if you need to subtract 2 we could say either students equals students minus 2 or students minus equals 2. that would do the same thing there are 18 students another option is the decrement operator if you need to decrement a variable by 1 you would say students minus minus this only subtracts 1 from a variable there are 19 students so that's subtraction to use multiplication you use an asterisk i'm going to double the amount of students that we have students equals students times 2 there are 40 students or we could shorten this to students times equals 2 and again there are 40 students for division you use a forward slash i'm going to divide our class in half students equal students divided by two there are ten students the shorthand way is students divided by equals two there are ten students now check this out we have twenty students what if i divide students by 3 we're working with an int variable so this variable can't hold any decimal portion 20 divided by 3 that is 6. so any decimal portion is lost it's truncated but if we change students to be a double well then that decimal portion is retained 6.66 repeating students if you need the remainder of any division you can use the modulus operator let's create a new variable int remainder equals students modulus 2. we'll divide our group of 20 students into groups of two then i'll display the remainder okay 20 divides by two evenly so there's no remainder but what if we divide students by three and get the remainder our class of students is being divided into groups of three for maybe like a project but 20 doesn't divide by three evenly therefore our remainder is 2. there will be six groups of three students and one group of two students now using the modulus operator is a great way to find out if a number is even or odd take some value or variable you would like to check modulus 2. if that number divides by 2 evenly where the remainder is 0 well it's even if the remainder is 1 well then it's an odd number 21 doesn't divide by 2 evenly so that is the modulus operator it gives you the remainder of any division these arithmetic operators have an order of precedence we resolve any arithmetic operations that are first within parentheses then multiplication and division then lastly addition and subtraction perhaps we have this formula students equals six minus five plus four times three divided by two so what do we solve first in this equation we would check any parentheses first which there aren't any of then we resolve any multiplication and division so let's go through this so we have some multiplication here we would resolve 4 times 3 first that is 12 then we have some division 12 divided by 2 is 6 then any addition and subtraction 6 minus 5 is 1 1 plus 6 is 7 and let's check to see if that's right so students should be yep students is seven now you can force operator precedence by surrounding some part of your equation with parentheses i'll surround this part of the equation with the set of parentheses the new result is negative seven well yeah everybody those are some basic arithmetic operators they return the result of a specific arithmetic operation hey if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and pin it to the top and well yeah those are some basic arithmetic operators in c plus
