hey what's up everybody so let's talk about null pointers but first we'll need to know what a null value is a null value is a special value that means that something has no value when a pointer is holding a null value that means that pointer is not pointing to anything that's what we would call a null pointer there is a keyword that represents that null ptr ptr meaning pointer it's a keyword that represents a null pointer literal one of the reasons that we use null pointers is that they're helpful when determining if an address was successfully assigned to a pointer if we create a pointer but don't assign it a value we don't know where it's pointing to it would be good practice that that pointer doesn't point anywhere so let's create a null pointer i'll create a pointer of the int data type we use the dereference operator pointer if i'm not going to assign this pointer and address right away it would be good practice to assign this pointer null ptr null pointer later on in your program if you need to assign an address let's say int x equals one two three i would just take my pointer set the sequel to the address of my variable if you dereference a null pointer it can lead to undefined behavior or if you dereference a pointer that's not assigned a value well that can lead to undefined behavior too what some programmers do is that they'll check to see if their pointer is a null pointer before continuing kind of like a system of checks and balances we assigned our pointer the address of x i would like to check to see if my pointer contains a valid address before dereferencing it so we could say pointer equals null pointer was my pointer assigned an address or is it still a null pointer if my pointer is still a null pointer that means we did not successfully assign an address to my pointer there may be situations such as when working with dynamic memory where you attempt to assign an address to your pointer and it fails this would be a good way to check to see if that failed or not if your pointer still remains a null pointer so let's say address was not assigned else standard output address was assigned so let's run this currently our pointer is pointing to the address of x address was assigned now if for some reason we did not assign an address i'll turn this line into a comment to represent that well our pointer is still going to be a null pointer address was not assigned if your pointer is still a null pointer it's not safe to dereference that pointer if i need access to the value that's at that pointer it would be safe to do so within this else statement standard output dereference operator pointer so my pointer contains the number one two three if i were to dereference this null pointer that would lead to undefined behavior i have no idea what's gonna happen don't try this at home kids null pointer is a keyword that represents a null pointer literal when declaring a pointer it's good practice that our pointer is pointing to a valid address or this null pointer keyword because otherwise we don't know where it's pointing originally they're helpful when determining if an address was successfully assigned to a pointer when using pointers be careful that your code isn't dereferencing a null pointer or pointing to any free memory that we're not using because that can lead to undefined behavior so yeah everybody those are no pointers in c plus
