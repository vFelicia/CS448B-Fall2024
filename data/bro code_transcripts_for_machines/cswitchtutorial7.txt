hey what's going on everybody Dubrow here and in this video I'm going to show you how switches work in C++ let's get into it the switch is basically a bunch of consecutive if statements however using a switch is much more efficient you could say that it's harder better faster stronger so here's an example of when we might want to use a switch in place of a bunch of if statements let's write a program where we can enter a number between 1 and 12 and it will give us a corresponding month depending on the number that we type in so before we get the started let's just include one thing we're going to type include then a set of angle brackets and then we're going to type in strength all right let's create a integer named month and we will not assign this value right away we'll just declare it and let's create a prompt to ask for a month enter the month then we'll put the numbers 1 through 12 here think I'm gonna get rid of that all right and then we are going to use CIN a month I finished typing everything so here's what you don't want to do writing an if statement and then writing an if statement or an else if statement right after and it's going to check if month is equal to 1 2 3 so on and so forth all the way till 12 so if a veteran programmer sees you do something like this where you write a bunch of consecutive if statements they're probably going to call you a noob and there's a better option and that's by using this thing called a switch this is how you write one we're going to type switch then we need an expression or we can stick a very bold within here so we want to check the month and then we need a set of curly brackets in place of if statements we use cases and we're going to check if our value is equal to some case and the first thing we'll want to check if our case is equal to one so we're going to type in case 1 colon and then on the next line we're going to type C out it is January and then this step is important too we're going to type break so if this case matches what we want to evaluate or check we're going to do this and then break out of the switch and we don't need to check anything else so we're going to do the same thing for case two so case two then we want our program to do this display it is February and then break all right well you get the idea I'm going to repeat this process for cases three through 12 so I'll just fast forward this video all right it's done so we have cases one through twelve one corresponding to each month of the year so let's test out this program enter the month well currently it is April so I'm going to type four and hit enter so four enter and it says it is April let's try a different month I'm going to type in 12 hit enter and it says it is December so we know the switch is working what happens if we type in a number that doesn't match any of these cases well let's see what happens so it says enter the month I'm going to type in the word pizza so nothing appears to happen so what we can do is that we can place a default case what do we want our switch to do by default in case there are no matching cases so we're going to write default at the end and what do we want our program to do so first make sure you write default and then add a colon at the end and let's simply display a message that says you did not enter a number between 1 and 12 enter the month it is pizza month you did not enter a number between 1 and 12 so it's similar to an else statement where it's like a last resort if there are no matching cases we'll have our program do this by default so how this works is that the switch expression is evaluated at once and selects one of these many code blocks depending if there's a matching case or not if there's no matching case we can execute whatever is within the default code block now with these break keywords these are important to have after each case and if you were to take these out we would continue on to the next case as if the next case was also true so let's try this program again and take out a few of these breaks and see what happens and for the month it is April so I'm going to type in the number 4 and hit enter and our result is it is April it is May it is June it is July it is August so if you're missing a break within a case it's going to continue on to the next case as if that next case was also true and it's not going to stop until it reaches a break and these cases don't necessarily have to be numbers let's try another example using char values two characters I have an idea let's write a program that will ask for a letter grade like in school the letters A through F and we will give a response based on what letter grade that we answer with so to begin let's create a variable that will store a single character a char value and we'll say answer and we don't need to assign this value right away next we will say C out this will function as a prompt what letter grade did you get and perhaps I'll just put a through F in here and then we will say C in answer let's create a switch so switch then this parts the expression we'll just put our answer within here and we will check this answer against many different cases in our first case instead of one we're going to type in a within single quotes so if our answer matches this case where it's a the character a what do we want our program to do perhaps a simple message such as you did perfect and then we want to break all right let's repeat the same process for the other letter grades so case B what do we want our program to do if this case matches you did good and then break and it's just a matter repeating the same process for each of these letter grades so case C C out you did okay and break case D C out you did not do so good it's still passing though and case F C out you failed and break we can add a default code block so let's do that we're going to type in default and we will display a message enter a letter grade A through F oh I guess we're missing EE but who cares let's run this program and see if it actually works what letter grade did you get I got an A so I typed in a hit enter you did perfect all right we got an A everybody what letter grade did you get I got enough you failed have a nice day alright then let's type in something that's not a letter grade like the word pizza and we get that default message of enter a letter grade A through F so we know the switch is working but yeah you're not limited to just using numbers for your cases you can also use characters and other things too so just to summarize what we did here today a switch is more efficient than using a bunch of consecutive if statements we can take a value or expression and compare it to see if it's equal against many cases at once if there is a matching case we can activate the corresponding code block and have our program do something that was by and then we can use the break keyword to break out of the switch and continue on with the rest of the program and we can also add a default code block if there are no matching cases we can have our program do something by default but yeah that's the basics if you want a copy of the examples that we worked on today I'll post it in the comments down below and pin it to the top and if you're looking for a practice or a project to work on why don't you create your own switch and then post it in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of how switches work in C++ hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down
