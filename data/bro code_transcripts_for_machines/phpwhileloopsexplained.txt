hey everybody it's me again today I'm going to explain while Loops in PHP with the while loop you can do some code infinitely while some condition remains true it's very similar to a for Loop but with the for Loop we intend to do some code a limited amount of times with the while loop it may be infinite there's a lot of overlap where you can use either a for Loop or a while loop here's how to create one type while parentheses curly braces within the parentheses we can set a condition let's say we have a counter variable we will count up to 10. keep doing this code while counter is less than or equal to 10. another difference between a for Loop and a while loop is that with the while loop we don't have three statements we just have one with the for Loop you can create an index a condition and there's another statement to increment or decrement we don't have that with the while loop so we'll have to set that manually outside of the while loop let's say we have a counter counter will equal zero while counter is less than or equal to 10 let's increment our counter by one counter plus plus then let's Echo our counter variable then add a break so simple enough that should be less than 10. there we escape the while loop when this condition is no longer true it's very similar to a for Loop honestly in this situation I would probably stick with the for Loop because you're still doing something a limited amount of times while Loops tend to be better if you need to do something possibly infinitely let's say we have um a stopwatch program we don't know when the user is going to stop the stopwatch we would need to keep on updating our stopwatch until the user presses stop so we could write a program like this instead suppose we have a variable seconds to keep track of the amount of seconds then a Boolean variable named running if our stopwatch is no longer running if somebody hits the stop button we will set that to be false our condition could be a while running is equal to true if this variable is a Boolean we can just shorten this to while running while our stopwatch is running update the time or something I haven't talked about the sleep function yet but we can make our program sleep for a given amount of seconds so let's pretend that we wait one second then after waiting one second let's increment seconds by one then Echo the current amount of seconds and I will add a break I wouldn't recommend running this code we're going to be stuck in what is known as an infinite loop our program has no way of stopping and it might crash your computer you can see that the time just goes on and on forever so let's stop that my computer might crash this code is going to run forever because we have no way of escaping this Loop if you have a while loop you'll want some way to break out of the while loop from inside of it I'm going to create a stop button I now have a stop button let's stop that before it crashes now to escape out of this loop I could write some code like this I'm going to write an if statement I haven't discussed the is set function yet but we can check to see if a button is clicked or not I'm going to access our post variable and I have created a stop button with the name of stop if I click the stop button then let's set running to be false then we can escape out of the while loop else if the user doesn't press the stop button then let's Wait Another Second and update our timer so this program is going to continue until I hit the stop button and it broke there it stopped what you should remember from this is that a while loop will do some code possibly forever while some condition is true you would need some way of making your condition false in this case I just set up a button to stop the timer there is a lot of overlap where you can use either a for Loop or a while loop if you need to do something a limited amount of times use a for Loop if you need to do something a possibly infinite amount of times a while loop might be better and well everybody those are while Loops in PHP
