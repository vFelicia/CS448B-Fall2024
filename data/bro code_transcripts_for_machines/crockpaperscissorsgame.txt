hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a game of rock paper scissors in csharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody let's create a game of rock paper scissors what i like to do is declare all the things that we'll need at the top of our program we'll need a random object to generate a random number for the computer's choice so we'll say that one equals rock two equals paper and three equal scissors so we'll need to create a random object random random equals new random and we'll create a boolean variable named play again and i will set this to equal true so if the player decides to exit they would not like to play another game we can set this to be false and we'll need a string variable to hold the player's choice i will declare this but not yet assign it so this will store rock paper or scissors and we'll need a string variable for the computer's choice as well okay that's all of the different variables that we'll need so let's create a while loop while play again equals true now if we're working with boolean variables we technically don't need this equals true portion because this by itself would evaluate to be true or false so you can just say while play again and that would work as well and then if the player decides to quit we can change that to false okay now let's ask for some user input console that right enter rock paper or scissors and we will store the user's input within string variable player player equals console dot read line now strings are case sensitive what i'm going to do is take the player's input and make it all uppercase just so that everything is consistent player equals player dot 2 upper i guess you could make this all lowercase 2. okay now let's display the player's choice with a right line statement so what if the player decides to choose something that isn't rock paper or scissors we would want some way to enforce that so let's say that i choose the gun and that's a valid response so we should probably prevent the player from doing so so what we'll do is use a nested while loop so while then surround this section of code within a set of curly braces and we will continue to prompt the user to type in something that is valid a valid choice so this is our condition while player does not equal rock and i'm just going to copy this player does not equal paper and player does not equal scissors so we'll need to assign player and computer a value let's do that at the top of our while loop for play again so player equals an empty string and computer equals an empty string so this is kind of nice when we do play another round we can reset player and computer okay let's try this enter rock paper or scissors i pick the gun enter rock paper or scissors how about a bomb fist nope okay so we have to choose either rock paper or scissors what about rock cool so that is a valid response okay so let's get rid of this right line statement we won't really need it anymore now we'll need to generate a random number for the computer player one two or three and i will use a switch so we will place the random number that is generated within the parentheses we could say like i don't know int random num equals random dot next and the range is going to be one through four so remember that this number is exclusive this will generate a random whole number between one and three okay then what i'm going to do is technically we don't need this portion like we could place random num within switch but what i like to do is kind of shorten and condense my code so i'm going to take this method of random.next and place it within the switch itself and that would work as well so let's examine some cases case one that will be rock computer equals rock all uppercase then break and we'll need case two in case the random number is two case two computer equals paper then break and case three computer equals scissors then break what i'm going to do after our switch is display the player's choice along with the computer's random choice so let's use a redline statement so player colon space plus variable player then let's create another right line for the computer computer plus computer and let's run this okay i will choose rock player rock computer scissors let's play again i will choose paper player paper computer paper and scissors player scissors computer scissors okay now we just need to examine our choices and see who wins that's the next step now what we'll do at this point is create a switch to examine the player's choice versus the computer's choice and we can decide who wins so let's create a switch and we will examine the variable player against many different cases so the first case will be rock and for now we'll just break we'll fill this in a little bit later case paper break and case scissors and break all right we're going to check to see what the computer picked so if computer is equal to rock then it's a draw so let's write it's a draw i think i'm missing a break statement all right then else if computer equals paper that means that we lose else if computer equals paper then we will write you lose else technically we don't need a condition because the only choice left is scissors for the computer else you win so let's copy these statements paste it underneath paper if we choose paper and the computer chooses rock that means that we win so let's change this to you win if we choose paper and the computer chooses paper that means it's a draw else you lose let's copy this again paste it underneath scissors so if we pick scissors and the computer picks rock you lose if we choose scissors the computer picks paper then we win you win else it's a draw all right let's test it all right enter rock paper scissors let's go with rock rock paper you lose let's choose paper this time paper scissors you lose again and let's try scissors scissors rock you lose man i kind of suck at this game let's try it again paper paper rock okay i finally won one cool now at this point we're going to let the player decide if they would like to play another round so place this code at the end of our outer while loop so i'm just going to follow the dots here so that would go right here alright so let's use a write statement would you like to play again y slash n so y for yes and for no actually i think i'm going to create another variable so let's do so at the top string answer and we should probably reset this to answer equals an empty string okay so we will add one more variable okay answer equals console dot read line then let's make it uppercase in case the player enters in something that is lowercase we'll still count it answer equals answer dot to upper then let's check to see what the player enters in if answer is equal to y then play again equals true else play again equals false all right then outside of the while loop we will display a goodbye message maybe we'll say thanks for playing all right let's try it one last time okay onto rock paper scissors always choose rock player rock computer paper you lose would you like to play again yes let's pick rock again rock paper you lose okay maybe you don't always pick rock would you like to play again no because this is a dumb game thanks for playing well okay then everybody that is a game of rock paper scissors if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below if you can smash that like button leave a random comment down below and well that's a game of rock paper scissors for c sharp
