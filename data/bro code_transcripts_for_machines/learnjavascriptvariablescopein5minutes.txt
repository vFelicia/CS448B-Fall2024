hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain variable scope in JavaScript variable scope is where a variable is recognized and accessible in this beginner's tutorial we'll be discussing the differences between a local scope and a global scope suppose we have a variable let x equals one each variable name needs to be unique within that scope I couldn't declare another variable named X where I set x t equal to if I were to run this we have a syntax error identifier X has already been declared you can reuse the same variable names in your program as long as they're within different scopes to demonstrate let's create two functions function Function One within function one we will declare a variable x x equals one then we will console.log whatever X is then let's create function 2 by copying function one and then paste it function 2 x will equal 2. console.log x if I were to invoke function 1 x equals one if I were to invoke function 2 well x equals two so we have two variables with the same name in our program that's legal as long as they have different scopes any variable declared inside of a function has a local scope or anytime you declare a variable within a set of curly braces there's no naming conflicts because they're within different scopes that way you can declare variables with the same name which we've done with X now functions can't see inside of other functions within function 2 we will declare variable y equals two then console.log X within function 1 we will console.log why if I were to invoke function 1 we have an uncaught reference error Y is not defined at Function One functions can't see inside of other functions function one has no idea what Y is we've declared that within another function it's kind of like functions are neighboring houses you can't necessarily see inside of your neighbor's house function 1 has no idea what variable Y is likewise function 2 if I were to invoke it function 2 has no idea what x is each of these variables are declared inside of a function so they have a local scope a global scope for a variable is any variable declared outside of a function with function 1 let's get rid of x and we will console.log X function two we will get rid of y console.log x if I were to declare a variable outside of these functions let x equal 3. I'll invoke function 1 will display X is 3 Let's invoke function two axis 3. any variable declared outside of a function has a global scope it's available through the whole program a global variable is recognized and accessible from anywhere hey this is bro from the future I was editing this video and I thought of a really good analogy for Global variables let's say that a function is a house we live in function one and our neighbor lives in function two we can see inside of function one but we can't see inside of our neighbor's house at function two anything that's declared in the global scope isn't found within any houses it's outside everybody can plainly see it it's kind of like a creepy stalker that's under a street light at three in the morning everybody while inside of their house can still see everything outside that's an analogy I thought was kind of accurate to describe a global scope however it's not recommended to declare Global variables in a large program just because you can have naming conflicts in a large program I might accidentally reuse the variable X or change it somewhere X is a very common name for a variable so in a large program I would stick with local variables but in a small program like this it's fine when inside of a function we'll use any a local instance of a variable first if it's not found we'll look at the global scope So within Function One let's declare X to be one within function 2 will declare X to B2 and then within the global scope we have x equals three if I were to declare function one do you think X will equal one or three well it's one if we have two variables with the same name and they're in different Scopes we'll use the local version first that's why X is one and not three if I were to invoke function two well x equals two if these local variables weren't available we would use the global version instead where x equals three all right everybody so that is variable scope it's where a variable is recognized and accessible you have a local scope that's any time a variable is declared within a set of curly braces that variable is then only accessible to anything within that set of curly braces and a global scope is where a variable is declared outside of any functions it's available throughout the whole program and well everybody that is variable scope in JavaScript
