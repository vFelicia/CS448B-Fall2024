hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to be teaching you guys about text alignment the use of the flow property and the use of the position property and CSS so let's get into it before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm everyone so for this video I would say that this is going to be three different mini topics all rolled into one video just because I don't think it'd be worth it to create an individual video for each of these topics because they really won't take too long so we're just going to cover them all in one video so if you want to skip forward look in the description for any timestamps and these are things we'd want to cover before we move on to the topics of navigation bars and dropdown menus so let's begin with the text alignment property we can use the text alignment property to position text to the left to the center or to the right but first we'll want to create some sample text so I'm just going to put this within a paragraph tag and I will give this a unique ID of maybe p1 then let's close this right away and then I will just type in the word left so now I'm going to copy this and paste it a few times and we'll create a few other lines so we'll make the second line p2 and we'll call this Center and the third line p3 and we will say right let's save reload the page and move on to our style sheet now by default all text is aligned to the left so if I were to move this window here all the text is being pushed to the left of the viewport also known as the browser window basically so one thing we can do is that we can change that using the text alignment property so if we were to target p1 and set it textalignleft there would actually be no apparent change for our word left but let's use a different position so maybe for p2 will say textaligncenter let's save reload the page see now this text is in the center of the webpage it's in the center of you port or the container that it's in so if I were to actually resize this window it's going to continue to stay in the center and for the last one take a wild guess we're going to position this to the right so let's target P 3 and we will textalignright save reload and you guessed it so the word right is now sticking to the righthand side of the webpage now let's put these within a smaller container so what I'm going to do is target all paragraph elements and we're going to set a border spell border right of one pixel that is solid and we will specify a width of maybe 250 pixels so let's try this now now you can see that since these lines these words are kind of in a separate container now they're going to align based on the container that they're in so you can see that with the word right it's stopping when it reaches the edge of this container since we've specified it with and the center word is now in the center of this box here so that's how you can use the text aligned property to align text to the left to the center to the right of some sort of box or container or the entire webpage itself alright well let's move on to the use of the float property but I'm just going to turn this all into a comment so this will be like a clean slate then basically I'll get rid of all the text here as well so let me just edit that then we'll move on okay we're moving on to the use of the float property so an element that is using the float property will have all other elements or text flow around it kind of like a river where the river has bends and it's flowing around obstacles so for this example I have a logo that I'm going to use if you want to download some picture and pause the video feel free to do so otherwise you can just watch me so I'm just going to include an image here so image source equals and for me it's called logo dot PNG and then I'll just do some inline styling just to make this simple I'll give this a width of maybe 150 pixels and a height of 150 pixels as well all right let's check out this logo yep there it is all right now I'm immediately going to add a paragraph after this since I'm using sublime text I can just type in lorem and hit tab and I'm going to surround this with a pair of paragraph tags let's say reload the page all right I have to save my stylesheet all right now you can see that there's this big blank space after the logo that's because this is a block level element so it's going to take up the entire width of the viewport now we can actually have this text start at the top here and flow around the picture by using the float property but we'll need to target our image then so I'm just going to type in IMG for image we'll say float and then we can either put this to the left or to the right so I'm going to say left let's save reload and now this text is flowing around this element because this element is floating but I think I'm going to add a little bit of a margin just because the text is really close to the logo so I'm just going to add that real quick maybe margin 5 pixels to make it look better I would say that's a little bit better now let's have this float to the right so I'm just going to switch left with right so now since this image is floating to the right all other elements are going to flow around it on the lefthand side but let me just copy this paragraph just so it's more evident because it's not enough text okay yeah you can see here that this image now has its own little space it's not taking up the entire width of the web browser then now let's make a container to contain all of these elements and we can just use a div tag for this so we're going to place a div tag here and we will end it after our last paragraph and then on our style sheet will say div and then we'll give this a border one pixel solid works like always and maybe a width of five pixels yeah let's change it maybe 300 okay that's better you can see that since this is all within a container now the image is going to float as much to the right as it can otherwise if this was floating to the left this would now be on the left hand side so that's pretty cool too so that's basically how the flow property works and we're going to move on to the use of the position property so I'm just going to comment all of this out on our style sheet and all of this on our HTML document all right well lastly we're moving on to the use of the position property and there's five different values we can place here the position property is used to position an element someplace on your webpage so we're going to be covering the fixed relative sticky absolute and static positions so we're going to discuss the fixed position first we can fix an element in place within the viewport so to begin we'll just need some sample text to work with I'll just create an h1 heading and I will just say maybe the word fixed and then let's close this I'm also going to add a paragraph too so I'll take the lorem hit tab and then surround this with a pair of paragraph tags okay let's move on to our style sheet and I'm going to go down a little bit so let's change the styling on our h1 heading real quick so I think what I'll do is put a border around this so one pixel solid maybe I'll change the background too so it's easier to see I'll make this yellow and maybe a width of 200 pixels okay that should be good then so what we're going to do now is use the position property and let's set this to fixed so we can fix this h1 element in place somewhere on our web page and we can actually give a direction like we want this 50 pixels from the top or we want this maybe 100 pixels from the right so let's say that I want this on the bottom right corner so what I'll do is that I will say bottom zero or zero pixels and zero pixels from the right so let's save and reload this and now this label is now fixed in place to the bottom right of our webpage although there's a little bit of a margin but you'll just have to get rid of that otherwise if I put left here this would be fixed in place to the bottom and to the left and you can also put pixels here too if I want this a little bit higher up so 50 from the bottom and 50 from the left that will place this slightly more up into the right then all right well next is relative positioning and we can actually update our h1 tag by just using the position property again so this old instance of us using this position property would basically become null Bend so what we're going to type in here is relative and what this does is that this will position something relative to where it's normally positioned so if I were to take out these two lines and update this all right here this is where this h1 tag is normally positioned right now if we were to put these back in this is going to move relative to this location here so if we set again bottom 50 pixels and left 50 pixels it's going to move based on this location right here where it normally is so that's all what the relative positioning is it's positioning relative to where an element normally is okay we're moving on to sticky positioning and you might need a few extra paragraphs to get this to work because we need to use the scrollbar so an element that is sticky and we'll update the position to that so position sticky what this does is that an element that is sticky we'll stick to the viewport when you're scrolling but we'll also need to set a position for this so I'm just going to say top zero pixels let's say reload the page and what ends up happening is that this element is now sticky so when we scroll down it's going to stick to some position within the viewport so this could be useful for like a navigation bar if somebody's like scrolling down through the webpage they can easily just access the navigation Bart so this sticky positioning has a lot of uses alright guys well we're on number four out of five four positions and this next one is static and this is actually probably the easiest one so anything that is static is actually what it normally is by default so you can just say that this is the default positioning for elements so if you ever need to reset be positioning for something you can just set it to static and it behaves exactly as it normally would so that's probably the easiest positioning all things are pretty much static by default okay we're on the homestretch guys so we just have one more position to cover that is an absolute position so something can be positioned relative to some sort of positioned ancestor otherwise it's going to be relative to the viewport so I think this is best explained with a demonstration so I just turned everything that we had into like one giant comment same thing for our HTML document so what I'm actually going to be doing is drawing two different boxes the outside box is going to be positioned relatively and the inside box which is going to be smaller is going to be positioned absolutely and the smaller box we'll call it box two is going to be basically positioned relative to the ancestor which is the larger box so what we're going to do is just make a diff tag and I will give this a unique ID of maybe box one alright and then I will just add some text like this is relative it's going to be positioned relatively and we'll close this all right now this is what we're going to do between the div tags we're going to create another div section so div and we'll call this ID box two and we will say this is absolute and then close this so what's going to end up happening is that this idea of box 1 this div element is going to be the ancestor of our ID box 2 let's go to our stylesheet now and actually create box one so we're going to target the idea of box one and let's draw a square and we're going to first position this relative though alright and let's set a background color maybe gray or light gray I think that'd be better and a width of 200 pixels and a height of 200 pixels and let's add a border as well border one pixel solid let's see what this looks like so far okay we still have a few more things to do too though let's work on box two now so box to and I'm actually going to copy this and paste it and make a few changes so let's make this positioning absolute and the background just gray not light gray just great and the width will be 100 and the height 100 let's say reload the page okay that works for box two then so check this out now box 1 is the ancestor of box 2 we have these two elements inside another set of div elements so box 2 is within box 1 now since the positioning of box 2 is absolute what this means is that the position is relative to its I should say positioned ancestor all right otherwise if it doesn't have an ancestor it's basically just going to be relative to the view port all right so let's center box two I would say within box one then so if we want to put this in the middle what we can do is just type in 50 pixels from the top and 50 pixels from the left that should be in the middle then since this is 200 pixels wide let's say reload the page now box 2 is now in the center of box 1 which is the ancestor now check this out if we move box 1 well box 2 is still going to stay in the center so since this is positioned relatively we can also use this top and left property or bottom and right depending on what you want to do so from the top let's say we want to move this down 100 pixels and maybe 150 pixels from the left I'm just making up numbers okay let's reload this so now this box is positioned relatively so it's normally positioned up here right well now it's moved down into the right down by 100 pixels and to the right by 150 pixels and you can still see that box 2 is still basically in the center of box one because it's positioned absolutely relative to its ancestor so even though we moved both boxes box 2 is still in the center then okay guys I'm going to be throwing in a bonus round because I'm probably going to get some questions related to this so for box 1 let's say that we want this box to stay in the center of our webpage well one way that we can do this is that we can instead of using the left property just set margin left and margin right to auto so if we were to save this and reload it now box 1 is going to stay in the center of our webpage but we'll swap to like lists where we want this position like vertically so it's depending on like how large your webpages then basically but if you want to Center something horizontally just margin left and margin right to Ottoman so you could easily replace these boxes with maybe some sort of frame and a welcome message so then when somebody visits your webpage they'll have a giant welcome message like front and center then basically so I thought I would just throw this in at the end of the video but yeah if you would like a copy of all this markup I'll post it in the comments down below I'm sorry this was a longer lesson but this is something that is I would say necessary for CSS just because there's so much that you can do with positioning but I think we're going to cover transformations and animations pretty soon so maybe that'll make up for this lesson but yeah that is how text alignment the use of the float property and the position property of work in CSS hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below
