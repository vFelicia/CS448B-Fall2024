yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how radio buttons work in java fx so sit back relax and enjoy the show now the idea behind radio buttons is that we can only select one radio button from any one group let's say that i'm going to buy you lunch because i'm a nice guy and you have to pick only one item from the menu so we'll create a group of radio buttons to represent a sort of menu we'll just create three radio buttons just to keep things simple for the first item on our menu let's say we have pizza i'm going to change the text to pizza and i'll increase the font size too just so that we can read it okay so that's our first radio button we need to add all of our radio buttons to the same group so for the toggle group let's save food because we're creating radio buttons based on food and if you want you can have this be selected by default just by clicking this check box but i will keep it empty for now now i'm going to give this radio button a unique id let's say our button 1 then on action is the method that will be called when we select this radio button we still need to define it but let's say we'll have a method named get food okay so that is it for our first radio button i'm going to copy and paste it and create our second radio button for our second item on our menu let's say we have sushi make sure that the toggle group is set to food we want all of these radio buttons to be within the same toggle group then underneath id let's set this to r button two and make sure on action is set to get food okay let's create our last radio button how about ramen and let's change the id to r button three on action is set to get food which we'll define later and this should be in the same toggle group of food okay well we have our radio buttons what do we want to do exactly with them let's say that we would like to change the text of a label when we select one of these radio buttons so i'm going to create a label drag and drop it i'll place it near the center and for the text let's say select an item or better yet select what you want to eat okay i'm going to center this increase the font size and maybe 36 okay then center it and i'm going to give this label a unique id my label okay let's make sure that our controller class is linked and i'm going to save and let's head to our controller class okay now i'm going to head to my controller class and we will inject our fxml document for each of these different ids that we have so we have a label private label my label and we also have all of those radio buttons at fxml private radio button r button one comma r button two and r button three okay we need to declare that method of get food so public void get food and the one parameter is action event event so whenever we select one of those radio buttons it's going to call this method here but we're not sure which button was selected exactly so we can check that using a series of if statements if else so let's say if radio button 1 dot is selected then let's change our label so my label dot set text we could say just the word pizza otherwise we can get the text from the radio button too that's another option so if we take that route it would be r button one dot get text okay let's write an elsif statement else if our button two is selected then we will take my label and set the text equal to r button two dot get text and then here we can use else or else if doesn't matter i suppose if r button three is selected we will change the text of my label to r button three dot get text and that should be everything let's run this okay select what you want to eat i would like pizza actually i changed my mind i want sushi but ramen's pretty good too i'll select ramen so that's kind of the idea behind radio buttons we can only select one radio button from any one group so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this to the comment section down below but yeah those are how radio buttons work in javafx
