well hello again everybody today I will be explaining how we can update documents in mongodb to do that we would type DB the name of the collection we're working with in this case students we can either update one document or update many let's update one we will use the update 1 method there are two parameters set up filter and update filter is the selection criteria for the update So within a set of curly braces we will pass some criteria let's update anybody's name that's SpongeBob it's basically just selection criteria the second parameter it's another document body is the update parameter what are the modifications we would like to apply we will utilize the set operator which is preceded with the dollar sign the set operator replaces the value of a field so after the set operator add a colon then another set of curly braces yes there's a lot of curly braces in mongodb So within this set of curly braces after the set operator that's where we can make our changes you can add or change the value of a field Spongebob doesn't have a full time field we can add that with the set operator if this field already exists we would update it so let's say SpongeBob is a fulltime student let's execute this command it was acknowledged that's true we have a matched count of one and a modified count of one let's take a look at Spongebob DB dot students dot find name SpongeBob and here he is he is now a fulltime student with your filter argument if you're working with a large data set it is possible that two people can have the same name it would be safer if we were to update by an object ID these IDs are unique for each document let's update but with the filter we will search by object ID so again that's Stevie dot students dot update one first is the filter parameter within a document body let's select underscore ID colon then paste that object ID for SpongeBob for every document the object ID is unique just in case there's two people named SpongeBob we won't update it uh looks like I have double underscore ID let me fix that real quick otherwise we'll get a syntax error so select the document that has this object ID then the second argument which is comma separated will be the changes to be made so we will set colon another set of curly braces let's set full time to be false SpongeBob already Works a fulltime job he'll just be a parttime student okay that was acknowledged let's take a look at Spongebob again using the find method db.students.bind ID colon the unique object ID and here's SpongeBob the fulltime field is set to false before it was true but we updated it now you can unset a field too let's get rid of the full time field for SpongeBob DB dot students dot update one we will search by ID then for the second argument we will use the unset operator which will remove a field so within another set of curly braces let's take our full time field colon now to remove a field for the value just set it to be an empty string let's take a look that was acknowledged let's select SpongeBob again db.students.find all right and here's SpongeBob again that fulltime field is gone now you can use the unset operator to remove a field now let's talk about update many using the update many method we can update many documents at once DB dot students dot update many this method has the same parameters as update 1. if I would like to select every document I will use an empty set of curly braces what are the changes we would like to make let's use the set operator let's set everybody's fulltime field to be false if they don't have this field one will be created for them all right let's find every student that was acknowledged db.students.find everybody should have a fulltime field that's set to false full time is false here as well yeah and that applies to everybody all right let's unset the fulltime field for Gary and Sandy TV DOT students dot update one let's select name Gary we will use the unset operator then add the changes to be made full time then we'll remove it by placing an empty string I'm going to copy this line we'll reuse it later that was acknowledged then let's remove full time for Sandy that was acknowledged as well so let's double check DB dot students dot find so SpongeBob and Patrick both have this fulltime field Sandy and Gary don't they were on set with the update many method we can check to see if a field exists or doesn't exist within the selection criteria if any student doesn't have a full time field let's update it DB dot students.update many what is the selection criteria let's say the selection criteria is full time field does it not exist we will use the exists operator exists preceded with the dollar sign then add false does this fulltime field not exist that's the selection criteria if a document doesn't have the fulltime field we'll give them one so the second argument will be the changes to be made we will use the set operator colon another set of curly braces anybody that doesn't have the fulltime field let's set that to be true full time true press enter that was acknowledged let's take a look at our students db.students.find all right so Sandy and Gary are both fulltime students now SpongeBob Patrick and Larry are not fulltime students they're parttime students that's how to update documents in the mongodb Shell you can use update 1 or update many let's do the same thing with compass hello again everybody in compass to update a field of a document you can press the pencil icon to edit the document to remove a field next to the field name you can press the trash can icon to remove it then update to add a field go to the pencil icon again after a field you can add a new field by pressing the plus button to add a field let's add a full time field for the value I will set that to be false for SpongeBob then you can change the data type here we'll change that to be a Boolean then update to change a preexisting field again go to the pencil icon select your field then you can change one of the values but I'll keep this as false that is how to update documents in compass it's fairly easy and straightforward alright everybody so that is how to update documents in mongodb you can use the update 1 method or update many you pass in a filter for the selection criteria then the modifications within the update parameter and that is how to update documents in mongodb
