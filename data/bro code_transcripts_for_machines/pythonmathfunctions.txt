hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate a few useful functions related to numbers in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay let's begin in this video i'm going to be demonstrating a bunch of useful functions related to numbers and a bunch of these functions are located within the math module now let's create a variable for this example let's say pi equals 3.14 just the first few digits of pi is fine for this example and now here's a bunch of useful functions that you guys would probably be interested in the first is round round is a builtin function and all we do is type round then add a set of parenthesis and then we can pass in a value or a variable as an argument and the round function will round that number for us so pi rounded to the nearest whole integer as you guessed it three now we can round a number up by using the seal function of the math class seal short for ceiling so let's print our result and in order to access this function within the math module we would type the name of the module dot and here's a bunch of functions that we have access to so we are looking for seal and it's actually at the top here for me and seal will round a number up to the nearest whole integer so pi rounded up is four then on the flip side we can round a number down by using floor and that is also located within the math module so let's type math dot floor and pi rounded down would be 3. up next i have the absolute value function but it's abs for short abs will give you the absolute value of a number so the absolute value of pi actually let's make this negative 3.14 the absolute value will tell you how far a number is away from zero so if you pass in a negative number it will give you a positive number so that is abs short for absolute value next we have the pow function pow will raise a base number to a power let's raise pi to the power of two so we pass in two arguments a base and an exponent pi to the power of two is nine point eight and some change so that is the pow function next we have square root so this is located within the math module we'll type math dot s q r t short for square root and the square root of pi is let's find out oh i guess we can't pass in pi uh let's round a different number like 420 oh i guess that's because i made pi negative okay so the square root of 420 is 20.4 and some change so that is the square root function all right we have two left we have the max function the max function will find the largest of a varying amount of values so let's create three variables for this example let's say x equals one y equals two and z equals three we can use the max function to find the largest of these values so within a print statement let's use the max function and pass in all of the different values or variables that you would like to compare so i would like to find the largest value between x y and z and the result in this example is three now the min function will find the lowest so min and then pass in your values or variables so i would like to find the minimum value between x y and z and in this case it is one well everybody those are a few useful functions that you guys might be interested in if you guys would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah those are a few useful functions related to numbers in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
