hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how you can create some pretty sweet shadow effects in CSS so let's get into it now there's two different kinds of shadow properties that I'm going to be discussing with you guys they are text shadows for text and box shadows for other HTML elements so let's begin by adding some sample text to our web page on our HTML document all we really need to do is just add one line here just writing shadow demo using h1 tags should suffice for this so let's save reload honestly this is all we need for this demonstration we're going to do everything else on our CSS document so let's make a few changes before we do introduce shadows so I'm going to target the h1 tag I believe I'll add a border that is 1 pixel and solid let's add a width of 200 pixels and maybe some padding of 25 pixels alright let's save this and reload the page okay this should work for now I'm happy with it so we have two different kinds of shadows to work with text shadows and I'll just set this to zero for now as well as box shadows and I will also set this to zero now with each of these properties there's four fields that we can fill in for values that we can assign and I'm going to write these as a comment so I'm going to create a cheat sheet for you guys so I'm going to write it within here the first is the horizontal displacement and you can write this in pixels the second is the vertical displacement also in pixels third is the blur effect also in pixels and lastly is the color you can choose a color name an RGB value or a hexadecimal value all right now with all of these values the same thing also applies for the Box shadow so I'm going to put our cheepcheep right underneath it and we'll fill a few of these out for the text shadow first and then the Box shadow let's begin with text shadows so this first value applies to the horizontal displacement of the shadow relative to the text and the second value is the vertical displacement of the shadow relative to the text so if we were to set our horizontal displacement to maybe two or another positive number we would have a shadow effect that is on the right hand side of our text if this was a negative number this would move to the left and the greater the magnitude the greater the displacement would be like am I set this to negative 20 pixels we would have a shadow that's very far out to the left so you can change these depending on what sort of shadow effect you want and the same thing applies to our vertical displacement so a positive number would create a shadow effect downwards and a negative number would create a shadow effect upwards and then you can combine both of these so maybe we'll pick five pixels by five pixels we'll end up with the shadow that goes down and to the right although it's a little difficult to see because the shadows black as well as the text color so we'll have to change that so we can also add a blur effect that is the third value that we can type in here and the magnitude of the blur effect is in pixels so we'll start with one pixel and see what effect this has so there's not much of a change here with one pixel let's increase this to two okay we're getting somewhere and then maybe three all right three is not too bad but I think I'm going to change the horizontal and vertical displacement back to two and that doesn't look too bad that's like a 3d effect which is pretty sweet now with the fourth value we can add a color you can pick a color name an RGB value or a hexadecimal value I think I'll just pick something simple like yellow so let's save reload and we now have a yellow shadow effect around our text and what we end up with is a yellow shadow effect that is displaced to pixels down vertically and to pixels to the right horizontally now you can actually create a glow effect if you set the horizontal as well as the vertical displacement to zero it would actually appear as if this text was glowing which is pretty cool too but I'm going to change the blur effect up lately it's kind of like a light bulb or a neon glow of some sort I think that's pretty sweet and another cool thing that you can do with shadows is that you can add more than one for example we could add a second shadow and I decided for that this demonstration I want to create a shadow effect that makes my text look like it's on fire so I'm going to add a second red shadow that's slightly above the text so what you can do if you want to add a second shadow after the first set of values just add a comma and you can add in a whole nother set of values to add so if I want a red shadow effect that hovers above the text I will set our horizontal displacement to zero pixels for the vertical displacement maybe negative five pixels then for a blur five pixels is good and then for a color I will pick red so let's save this reload and we now have this sweet fire effect for our text now let's move on to box shadows it's a very similar process to what we had with text shadows except a box shadow will target an HTML element so this box shadow is going to be displaced relative to where this border is so let's fill this in so we need a horizontal as well as a vertical positioning for this shadow I think I will set this first one to ten and the second one to ten so let's save reload we now have this very sharp black shadow but we'll probably want to add a blur to make it look more natural so I tend to like five pixels for my blur all right but it's still somewhat dark so we can also change the color and I think I will use a hexadecimal value this time so if you use all sixes so that's six sixes this will be like a nice grayish dark color and I think that's pretty sweet so that's all the Box shadow is it adds a shadow effect around an HTML element much like the text shadow adds a shadow effect around text so that's the very basics of using shadows in CSS I'm just going to add a few other changes not related to shadows but just a few properties I want to add to make the shadow really stand out and look really cool so I'm just to change the background color of our HTML element so background color black let's see what we have so far all right you can really see the shadow effect now but the text is somewhat dark so I'm going to change the color of that so the color of our text we can change that to maybe white okay that's pretty sweet it's kind of like the text is so hot that it's glowing and giving off flames but I also want to change the border color so I'm going to say border color black let's save reload all right that is pretty sweet I'm pretty happy with that so yeah I guess that is the basics of using text shadows as well as box shadows in CSS if you want a copy of all this markup that we worked on today I'll post it in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that is how you can create basic shadows in CSS hey you if you
