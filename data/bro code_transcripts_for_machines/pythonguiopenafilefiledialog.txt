hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use a file dialog in python to open and read the contents of a file so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay people so this is how you can use file dialog to open and read the contents of a file but first we'll need a second import along with this import at the top so what we're going to be importing is from tk enter import file dialog and then we'll need a window like what we usually do so window equals tk followed by window dot main loop now we'll need a button that we're going to add to the window and when we click on this button it's going to launch our file dialog so we can select a file so we'll call this button button button equals button let's set some text maybe to just open like we're opening a file and we'll associate a function to our command for this button so let's create a function called open file that's fine and then we need to pack this button so we can add it to the screen so button.pack now we need to create a function called open file and we'll do this before we create our window let's type def open file and when we call this function we're going to take file dialog and use the ask open file name function so this is going to return a string and that string is the file path of where your file is located so what we could do is store this within a variable so let's store this within a variable called file path and to test this let's just print this just to take a look at the contents of this variable so let's just print the file path now i have a file on my desktop that i want to use called test file so let's click the open button and this might not necessarily bring you to your desktop it might bring you someplace else within your file directory so this just happens to be bring me to my desktop so i'm going to click the test file that i have and click open so this prints the file path so it's going to return a string and it's the file path basically so now we want to open and read the contents of this file so we don't really need this print line anymore so what we'll do is create a file variable and we're going to use open we're going to list the file path and then we're going to use r for read so the default is normally rt for read text otherwise you can read binary uh but we can just set this to r r is the same as rt basically uh so then we're going to open this file and then we're going to read it so let's just print this to the console window so print the name of the file which is file where this is located file dot read function and then it's a good idea to close your files after you're done with them so file dot close and let's test this so i'm going to click open find the file that i want click it and then open and that text file says my name is bro i like pizza now let's say you want to make this a little more advanced so what i'm going to do is that i'm going to set the initial directory of where we begin looking for a file when we launch our file dialog so with that test file i'm going to move this to my project folder so i'm just going to paste it so now this is within my project folder now i'm going to set the initial directory within the function of ask open file name so we're going to set the initial d i r for initial directory and then we can list a file path so one thing you could do i want to get this path here this file path so if you're using pycharm what you could do is right click this copy path and then get the absolute path and then i'm just going to paste this and then with these backslashes you'll have to do double backslashes because this is the escape character for a backslash all right so this should open my project folder which it does and here's that test file thing we could do is that we can change the title of our file dialog right now the default is just open so we can change that to something else so i'm going to add a comma maybe put this on a different line so this is still within the function of ask open file name so i'm going to set the title to something else i'll say open file okay so if we were to run this again instead of just saying open it says open file okay and we can also limit the file types that we accept and look for so we can use file types so let's say that we want to initially look for a txt file so what we'll do is type in like a name for the file that we're looking for so this is what's going to appear to the user uh text files followed by an extension so we want asterisk dot txt and then we can also have an option for all files so i'm going to add a comma for a second option and then let's say all files and then an extension so comma asterisk dot asterisk this will look for all files uh but i think i am missing a parenthesis there that should be good so then when we open our file dialog it's going to initially be looking for plain text files and with this drop down menu it says text files and all files so that's what we have listed within our file types of what we want to search for so you can see that if i switch to all files our python file actually appears because we don't have any limits on the files that we're trying to open or search for so if i change this back to text files only folders and plain text files are visible so then we can open our test file again but yeah that's the basics of file dialog in the next video we're going to be saving a file so if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of opening a file using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
