all right welcome back everybody a list a list is a data structure that represents a list of objects that can be accessed by index it's similar to an array but they can increase and decrease dynamically in size during runtime which rays cannot do so here's an example of an array an array has a static fixed size and we cannot change it normally after runtime so let's create a standard array just for this example let's create an array of food string food equals new string and let's say that this array has a size of three so i'm going to add some elements to this array and then i can display these elements with a symbol for each loop pizza hamburger and hot dog so if i attempt to add another element to this array this is what happens we'll run into an exception and index out of range exception because index was outside the bounds of the array so you can't normally change the size of an array another option is to use a list a list can increase and decrease dynamically in size during runtime so let's create a list step one is that we'll need to import system.collections.generic so include this at the top i'll place it right underneath using system and this is how to declare a list list then within angle brackets list the type of object you would like to store strings and then i will name this list food equals new list angle brackets the data type again parentheses semicolon and we now have a list named food and to add elements to this list there is a builtin add method food dot add then within this method pass in the object you would like to store i would like to store let's say a pizza then a hamburger then a hot dog so food dot add pizza hamburger and hot dog and let's take a look so we have our pizza hamburger and hot dog and i bet we can add even more than three elements so it appears that our list can resize dynamically which is a bonus then to access one of these elements it's much like an array you use that set of straight brackets so i'm going to display whatever's within element number zero food index zero and that would be pizza so accessing an element is the same as an array you just type the list name and then add a set of straight brackets then the index number okay so here's a few other useful methods of lists there is a remove method food dot remove then type in what you would like to remove i would like to remove fries and let's see if that's still in here nope fries is missing pizza hamburger hot dog so that is the add method and remove method but there's a few other useful methods so we can insert an object at a given element let's insert maybe sushi at index 1 via the insert method food dot insert then we need an index and an item so at the beginning of our list at index 0 i will insert sushi sushi pizza hamburger hot dog fries we can get the current size of our array using the count property so within a writeline statement i'm going to display food dot count property and the current size of our list is four so that is the count property we can find the index of an element food dot index of and let's find where pizza is so that is at index zero you can also find the last index of a given item so what if we have fries both in the beginning and at the end food dot add fries so i have that in the beginning and at the end so i'm going to use the last index of method food dot last index of fries and the last index surprise is at four zero one two three four so let me get rid of that okay we can check to see if our list contains a given item using the contains method food dot contains pizza this will return a boolean true if pizza is within our list and false if not pizza is within our list so that returns true and that is the contains method then we have sort food.sort this will sort our list alphabetically so our list in alphabetical order is fries hamburger hot dog pizza and we can sort in reverse order food.reverse and our list in reverse order is fry's hot dog hamburger pizza we can clear our list food dot clear and now our list is empty and lastly we can convert our list into an array so i'm going to declare a new array string let's say food array equals food dot two array string item in food array so we have pizza hamburger hot dog fries well okay then everybody that is a list it's similar to an array it's a data structure that represents a list of objects that can be accessed by index it's similar to an array but they can increase and decrease dynamically in size but they waste more memory so yeah those are lists in c sharp if you found this video helpful please be sure to give it a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and as always subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
