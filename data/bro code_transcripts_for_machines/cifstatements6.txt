hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here and in this video I'm gonna teach you guys how we can use if statements in C++ let's get into it if statements are pretty sweet because it's like a basic form of decisionmaking we can specify some condition and then if our condition that we specify is true we can have our program do something if that condition is not true we can skip that or have a program do something else so in C++ this is what you do to create an if statement you just type in if then you need a set of parentheses and then a set of curly brackets so anything within the parentheses will be our condition it's like the rule we're going to do whatever is within the subset of code between these two curly brackets if this condition that we specify is true so there's many different things we can use as a condition but I think we'll just start with something simple let's say that we want to check to see if somebody's age is equal to 18 first let's create a variable we can say int age equals 18 and then within the parentheses of the if statement we can check to see if age is equal to 18 honestly we can really do anything with this statements we can check just about anything but let's check to see if age is equal to 18 now if you're checking to see if one value is equal to another you don't just use a single equal sign that is the assignment operator so if you were to say age equals 18 well C++ thinks you're attempting to assign the value of 18 to the variable age so if you want to compare if two values are equal you need to use two equal signs and this is also known as the equals to comparison operator so basically if our age is equal to 18 we're going to do whatever is within the subset of code let's place AC out statement within these two curly brackets so we can just verify that the if statement actually worked so we'll say C out then use the insertion operator then let's display a message Congrats you are eighteen years old I'll just say Y oh four years old yo all right so let's try this out and our result is congrats you are eight years old so what if we changed age to a different number like 17 well let's see what happens when we try this so it doesn't appear to do anything and this is the reason why within our if statement within the condition of the if statement we're checking to see if age is equal to 18 since our age does not equal 18 it's 17 this is going to evaluate as false and it's going to skip over anything within your subset of code there's other comparison operators they should also be aware of 2 so this is the equals 2 of comparison operator it compares to see if two values are equal if you use an exclamation point then an equal sign this is the not equals comparison operator this will check to see if two values are not equal if both of these values are not equal then this entire condition will be true then so if we check to see if age does not equal 18 it will execute whatever is within our if statement so a more appropriate see out message would be something such as you are not 18 years old so let's try this out and see if a message displays this time yeah and it says you are not 18 years old and if we were to go back and change our variable age to 18 and then rerun this program well we don't get any result this time because we're checking to see if our age does not equal 18 currently it does equal 18 so this entire condition will become or evaluate as false so then if this is false we will skip whatever is within this subset of code for this if statement and we continue on like it never even happened there's other comparison operators to these you'll probably be a little more familiar with we can say things such as greater than or less than less than or equal to greater than or equal to so I'm thinking what we'll do for this will change our if statement to say if our age is greater than or equal to 18 will display a message Congrats you are an adult so we can basically change our age to anything our age variable that is let's say that we are 90 years old and we're going to check to see if our age is greater than or equal to 18 and it says it Congrats you are an adult well you know we're 90 years old so we've been an adult for a long time but yeah you can check to see if like numbers are within a certain range too and stuff and if we were to say our age is like perhaps 12 you know then run this well it's gonna skip over this if statement because our age is less than 18 it's not greater than or equal to 18 let's move on to phase 2 of if statements so there's this thing called an else statement if our condition turns out to be false normally we'll just skip over whatever is within the subset of code for the if statement we can use an else statement if we want our program to do something else so after your if statement just type in Els e4 else and then it has its own block of code then so basically our if statement is going to check to see if somebody is greater than or equal to 18 years old if it is or if that's true we will do this if not we will do something else so let's display a different message let's make a see out statement that says you are not an adult okay let's test this theory so our age is currently 12 so it says you are not an adult and remember before when we didn't have this else statement it just gift over the if statement completely but if you have an else statement it's going to instead do whatever is within the code block of the else statement so it's like you're at a fork in the road and your program is going to decide which path it's gonna take so I'll give you a visual example of this so here's a visual if this helps you understand it I actually copied this from a few other lessons on the same topic that I made in other programming languages so don't tell anybody but basically it works just the same so we have our variable age and when we reach our if statement if our age is greater than or equal to 18 we're going to go down this path and do something else with our program if our if statement is false we are going to use this else statement and our program is going to take this path and display a different message so this is like a visual representation if that helps you so with that being said I'd like to introduce a variation of the same program or something similar to it now with this if statement this condition will evaluate or return a answer of being true or false so what if you had a boolean variable we could create a boolean variable such as adult boolean adult equals and we can assign this value of true or perhaps false and that instead of having a condition such as age is greater than or equal to 18 you could just put the boolean variable name within here and it's kind of like the same thing it's going to check to see if this evaluates as true or false if adult evaluates to be true then we will display congrats you are an adult if adult evaluates as false then we will do whatever is within this else statement and since our boolean variable is set to false it displays you are not an adult but then if we were to set this to true then it's going to perform whatever is within the if statement then where it says congrats you are an adult so that's an alternative way to write something within an if statement because basically it's going to return a result of being true or false and if you are just to stick a boolean variable in here you can check to see if this variable contains the value of true or false let's move on to phase three on this topic of if statements and we're going to cover the else if statement so I think this is best if we were to create a entirely new program so what I think we'll do is that we will prompt the user to enter an eight temperature and if the temperature falls within a certain range we will display a message depending on what the user typed in for a temperature so to begin let's create a variable perhaps an int called temperature and we can just declare this we don't need to necessarily assign it a value right away and let's create a prompt to ask for a temperature and we will say please enter the temperature perhaps we'll put this in Celsius then we need to place AC in statement after this we will say temperature all right so this will prompt for a temperature and depending on what the value of temperature is we will display a particular message so let's write an if statement if I'm just gonna copy temperature because it's not that fun to type this out if temperature is greater than perhaps thirty degrees Celsius we will display a message so we'll say C out it is hot outside maybe I'll add an emoji here it's not required but I think it's silly it's a dude sweating alright so if our temperature is greater than thirty we will display a message it is hot outside so what if we want to check something else too before actually using an else statement well we can use an else if statement it's kind of like if our if statement turns out to be false we can check one more thing or a few more things before we result to the else statement so let me give you an example let's check to see if our temperature is less than zero so I think that's the freezing point in Celsius let's display a message that says C out it is cold outside BRR and then let's have an else statement actually no what I think I'm gonna change this to greater than or equal to 30 and than or equal to zero all right so let's add an else statement so basically if our temperature is not greater than 30 greater than or equal to 30 and our temperature is not less than or equal to zero it's going to fall within a certain range of 1 to 29 degrees Celsius so anything that falls within that range we could say it is perhaps warm outside it is warm outside ok let's test out this program ok please enter the temperature it is 50 degrees Celsius outside it is hot outside let's try a different answer please enter the temperature perhaps negative 20 degrees Celsius it is cold outside now if our temperature falls within a certain range that's basically how we set this up it's going to just rely on the else statement because it's checking one if statement after another first it checks to see if our temperature is greater than or equal to 30 and if it's false we're going to use the elsif statement and it's going to check to see if our temperature is less than or equal to zero if that's also false then we resort to the else statement and that's kind of like a last resort so if it's not hot outside and it's not cold outside then it must be warm outside so let's try this one last time just to verify if that's true so please enter the temperature perhaps 25 degrees Celsius it is warm outside well that's the fundamentals of if statements it's a basic form of decisionmaking we can check to see if some condition that we specify is true then we can have our program do something if it's false we can have our program do nothing or something else entirely all include copies of the programs that we made in this video and I'll post it as a comment down below and pin it to the top but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started using if statements in C++ hey you if you and this lesson then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down
