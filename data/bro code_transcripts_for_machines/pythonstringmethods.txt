hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate some useful string methods in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right let's do this in this video i'm going to be explaining and demonstrating a few useful methods available to us for strings now let's create a variable called name for this example and you can use your own name if you want so we now have a variable called name and for my first example let's print the length of our name variable so to do that we can surround our name variable with the length method and this will print and return how long the length of our string is and for me the length of my name variable is three for three characters if i were to increase the size of my name well then that's going to change to a so that is the length method and i'm just going to turn this line into a comment and let's move on so next we have the find method i just copy and pasted print name so i can reuse it name dot and actually if you have intellisense setup if you add dot after your variable you'll get a suggestion or a few suggestions of different methods and other features that you have access to so let's find find which is uh screw this i'll just type find find then we can find the first index of where this character is let's say i would like to find where capital b is well that is at index zero because computers always start with zero so this first character would be zero then r would be one and then o would be two for this example alright so that is how to find a character within a string moving on so let's capitalize our name and i should probably make this lowercase so name dot capitalize and this will make my name capitalized but if there's any spaces and then additional words it's not going to capitalize that only the first letter in your string next we have upper this will make your string all uppercase name upper and now it is uppercase guess what's next lower name dot lower and i should probably make this capital again and everything is lowercase we're making some good progress today next we have is digit this will return true or false depending on if our string is a digit which it's not so this will print false if i changed my string to a bunch of numbers like 1 2 3 then this will return true let's change that back and move on next we have is alpha are these alphabetical characters oh make sure you add the parentheses afterwards my bad false because we added a space within here now it's true so you can use is alpha to check to see if your string contains only letters alphabetical letters next we have count we can count how many characters are within our string i would like to count how many o's are in here and this should return two that's right okay we're almost at the end we can replace characters within our string so we use the replace method and we pass in two arguments the character we would like to replace and the character we would like to replace our character with i would like to change all o's to a's and now my name is brockhod oh you guys are gonna like this next one this isn't technically a method but it's a really neat feature so one thing that we can do that's available to us with python is that we can display a string multiple times by multiplying that string by a given number so let's say i would like to display my name three times i can just take my string variable then add times three and this will print my name three times bro bro bro like i said not technically a method but it's a useful feature that you might be interested in that's related all right everybody so that is a few useful methods available to us for strings if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah those are a few useful methods available to us for strings hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
