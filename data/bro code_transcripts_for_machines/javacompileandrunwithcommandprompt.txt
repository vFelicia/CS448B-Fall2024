how's it going everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how we can compile and run Java programs using command prompt so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey everybody so we're going to compile and run a Java file with command prompt and I made this cheat sheet here and I'll keep this off as we're going through the steps and I'll also post this in the comments down below if you'd like a copy of all the steps so let's begin with step number one we have to make sure we have a Java JDK a Java development kit installed and we did this in Lesson one so let's just be sure that we have it this is how to find your JDK so I'm going to go to my C Drive that is located right here it's within Program Files the Java folder and here are the JDK s so I actually downloaded the most recent version that came out recently so that's why I have two so if you're missing the JDK just go to any web browser and look up Java JDK download it's gonna be this first link and then go to JDK download and select the appropriate file for your operating system and that is step one now with step number two this is completely optional but we don't always necessarily need to rely on an IDE like eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA to create a Java file for us we can write Java code using a text editor such as notepad so let's actually do this for practice let's create a simple hello world program so I'm just going to open up notepad and then we're going to type in public class and the name of a class so let's call this class hello world then we need a set of curly braces and then we need to create a main method within this class and this is the starting point of the program so that's public static void main parentheses within the parenthesis we type in the string straight braces Arg s I think I'm gonna zoom in a little bit so I'm just holding ctrl + to zoom in and then we need to add a set of curly braces for this main method okay and then let's create a print line statements so system dot out dot print line parenthesis semicolon at the end and let's display a message within double quotes so maybe bro says to subscribe or else and now once you finish your code what we're going to do is save this to a convenient place so I'm just going to save this to my desktop and what we're going to type for the file name is the name of the class match this exactly it is case sensetive as well so that's hello world and the important part is to type in dot java so we're using the java file extension and we'll click Save alright and here is my Java file I'm just going to open this up and here it is alright let's move on to step three we're going to open command prompt or if you're using Mac I believe that is terminal on your computer so I'm going to look up command prompt okay now the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to set the path to where our Java development kit is so we can actually look this up so I'm going to go to my C Drive that is here it's within Program Files within the Java folder then click the latest JDK that you have and then we're going to go to the bin folder then we want to copy this address so I'm just going to right click copy address and then we're going to set the path to this address so set half equals the path to your JDK the bin folder and hit enter alright so that is step four now step five is that we're going to change the directory so it's pointing to your location for your Java file so CD and then let's get the address this file so properties and I'm going to copy this location so CD and the address so the directory changed to my desktop here now we can compile this Java code to bytecode which is actually portable so on step six we're going to type in Java C for Java compile and we're going to compile our hello world dot Java file so make sure you get the capitalization right and make sure that this ends with dot Java and hit enter so nothing appears to happen but that's okay though so now we have this class file and this is actually bytecode so it looks like it's in an alien language so this is Java bytecode if you remember from the very first lesson we take a Java file and compile it to bytecode and bytecode is actually portable between different operating systems and machines so if I wrote this with a Windows computer this file is portable to let's say a Mac but that Mac would need a JRE a Java runtime environment but that usually comes with the JDK that we installed so let's actually run this now so this is a dot class file and let's take a look at that and our java file was a dot java file so if we want to run this dot class file what we type in is java and the name of the file so that's hello world and hit enter and it runs our program and here it says bro says to subscribe or else no here's another thing that you can try it let's take a java project that we've made in the past I'll take this stopwatch program that I made and there's actually a GUI component with this so this contains at least two different files so I'm going to copy this and place this on my desktop all right and then we can actually run this using command prompt so what we actually need to find is the class file that contains the main method so that is located within the bin folder of this project and that is right here for men all right so here's that class file and actually if you look in the source folder these are the Java files that we compile so we need to run this main file within this folder so let's go through the steps we have a JDK installed we're going to open command prompt which we have we'll need to set the path so let's do that real quick so we'll make sure we set the path ok we're good and then we're going to change the directory of where this file is located so let's find the address for this so that is within here so I'm just going to copy this address and we're going to type CD and the address of this file alright and then this is already compiled so we can skip this step because it's a class file already so there's no need to compile all we need to do is type in Java and the name of the file that contains the main method so that is for my a project folder main and when I hit enter it's going to run my stopwatch program so that's the basics I'll post these steps in the description and in the comments down below if you would like a copy for yourself but yeah that's how to compile and run a Java program with command prompt hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below
