all right what's going on people so today I'm going to discuss for Loops a for Loop will repeat some code a limited amount of times with the while loop a while loop can repeat some code infinitely with the for Loop we can do something a certain or limited amount of times here's an example let's say we would like to display the word hello three times with the for Loop we can write something like this now to create a for Loop Type 4 parentheses curly braces within the set of parentheses we have up to three statements the first is that we can create a temporary counter much like we're assigning a variable let's create a counter named I let I I is a common naming convention for counters within a loop I'm meaning index so let I equal what number would we like to start at let's start at zero then semicolon this is the first statement we'll create a counter to keep track of the number of iterations the next statement is the condition in which we continue the for Loop we will continue this for loop as long as I is less than or equal to two that's if we're going to execute this for loop three times zero one two that would be a total of three then the third statement we can increment or decrement our counter I so let's increment our counter by wandering each iteration by typing I plus plus and that's a for loop I is set to zero will continue as long as I is less than or equal to 2 then during each iteration we will increment I by one that means we will execute this for loop three times what are we going to do when we execute each iteration let's console.log hello so this should display the word hello three times yep hello three now if I were to instead console.log I we can see what I is so during the first iteration I our counter is zero then one then two if I wanted to count up to ten I could change my condition to be this I is less than 10. so we begin at zero then we count up to nine so if I need 1 through 10 I'll set I in the beginning to be one then continue as long as I is less than or equal to ten there so we have numbers 1 through 10 using a for Loop we can even increment by a different number instead of incrementing our counter by one let's increment by two so I plus equals two so then we should count it by twos one three five seven nine if I want to start at 2 I can change our counter to start at 2. count from two to ten but increment by two four six eight ten if we would like to count down let's start at 10 then count down to zero let I equal ten will continue as long as I is greater than zero then I minus minus to decrement hey for fun after we escape the for Loop let's console.log Happy New Year it's as if we're counting down to midnight on New Year's Eve ten nine eight seven six five four three two one Happy New Year or we could count down by two I minus equals two ten eight six four two or three or whatever number ten seven four one happy New Year or whatever number you want now I'm gonna cover continue and break this time we will count to twenty we need a for Loop we'll create a counter let I equal I'll set I to be one that's our first statement our condition is we'll continue as long as I is less than or equal to twenty then increment I by One during each iteration so to test this let's console.log I so we have the numbers one through twenty so with continue we can skip an iteration I'm going to write an if statement if I is equal to now there is a Superstition that 13 is an unlucky number let's say if I is equal to 13 we will skip that iteration I know it's a weird example so if I is equal to 13 let's continue we'll skip this iteration of the loop else we will console.log whatever I is so now when I run this program when I run this program we skip over 13 we jump from 12 to 14. so if you ever need to skip an iteration you can use the continue keyword now there's break break will break out of the loop entirely we've seen this keyword in switches to break out of the switch if I equals 13 then just exit the for Loop entirely so in this example we count up to 12 but since I it now equals 13 we break out of the loop entirely we don't continue the rest of the iterations all right everybody so those are for Loops you can repeat some code a limited amount of times there's up to three statements we can write we can create a temporary variable that serves as a counter a condition in which we should continue then we can increment or decrement our counter and those are four Loops in JavaScript
