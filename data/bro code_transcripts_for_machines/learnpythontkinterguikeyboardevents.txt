what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create key events in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running welcome back everyone in this video we're going to be discussing at key events we can bind a key event and a function to a widget or a window so that when we press a certain key or do something we can trigger a function to be called that will perform some sort of task for us so we can actually do this by using the bind function so widgets and windows have access to a bind function so when our window or our widget is selected and then you press a certain key or do something then it's going to call a certain function to perform a task for us so there's two arguments within the bind function this takes an event as well as a function name let's say that when we press the enter key we want to call this function to do something so for this event what we type for that is a set of quotes angle brackets and the name of the button so for example if you want to press w to move forward like you're playing a game this would be w a s d there's also up down and then let's say we want to press enter to do something that is actually a return and then we will call this function so let's create a function called do something and let's define this at the top def do something now pay attention to this part we need to set up one parameter for this do something function this needs an event so be sure to include that and it's easy to forget so what do we want to do after we press enter let's just print a message you did a thing and this should work now so let's try it so while this window has focus ability we can actually uh have this respond to events so right now i'm pressing all sorts of keys you can probably hear me right now going crazy on my keyboard but now i'm going to hit enter and it says you did a thing and you can bind all sorts of keys to this window let's say that i want to press q to quit so we'll just replace this with lowercase q so i'm typing all sorts of keys but now i'm going to press q and it says you did a thing kind of like we're quitting the game you can actually have this respond to all keys well almost all of them so to do that you just type in key with the capital k so i can pretty much press on any key then it's going to trigger or call our function kind of like that so one thing that we could do we can display the key event that was pressed so i'm just going to add that here maybe i'll change this message you pressed plus and to display what key was pressed that is event dot key sim i believe that's for key symbol so this will actually display what button you pressed so wasd here's a unique idea for practice let's say that we want to add a label to our window and we're going to change the text on the label to reflect whatever key that we press so let's create a label label equals label we're adding this to our window and let's change the font as well to something massive like helvetica and a size of 100 that should be good then we need to pack this label so label dot pack then within this function let's turn this into a comment and we're going to use label dot config and we're going to update our text and the text is going to be whatever key that we press so we can do that with event dot key sim so now this label is going to display whatever key that we press so for example w a s d backspace escape up up down down left right left right b a start all right so that's the basics of key events if you could do me a favor and in the comments down below just press f to pay respects so if you want a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of key events in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
