hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the find method in mongodb to use the find a method type DB the name of the collection you're working with then add the find method that will return all documents within this collection but at times you might not want all documents you might want specific documents here's how we will add some arguments to the find method db.students.find the first argument is a document object the parameter is the query parameter it specifies selection filters maybe you just need one student well you would just list that criteria here I would like any students with the name of SpongeBob that would return any document where the first name is SpongeBob that would return everybody that has that name I'm just going to copy this let's find any students that have a GPA of 4.0 within our document the search filter is GPA 4.0 that would give us Sandy let's find if any students are not fulltime full time I will set that to be false there is one student Larry full time is set to false the query parameter is very similar to a where clause in SQL you can even use more than one filter search for any student that has a GPA of 4.0 each filter is comma separated as well as fulltime being true with my data set this does not return any results but to add more than one filter they're comma separated within a document body with the find method there is a second parameter that is the projection parameter we would pass another document body they're each comma separated if you don't specify the query parameter you would just return all documents with the projection parameter you can return specific Fields maybe you don't want all the information that's available perhaps I would just like each Student's name so we would set the field to be true you can use one as well but my own preference is true just because it's more readable return every document but only give their name and here they are mongodb will give you the ID regardless you can set that to be false within the projection parameter underscore ID false I just want everybody's name there we are SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Gary Larry let's get every student's name as well as their GPA so ID I will set that to be false I don't want that name will be true I would like that GPA will also be true I would like that here is every student's name as well as their GPA so that's the projection parameter if there's a field you would like or don't want you can set that to be either true or false when you display your data all right let's do the same thing with compass with compass this text box is for the find method So within a set of curly braces I would like to find any name that's SpongeBob then press find that returns one result return any student with the GPA of 4.0 that Sandy return any students that are not fulltime full time is false that gives us Larry now if you go to more options there is a projection parameter if you only want some data let's find every student but for the projection parameter I would only like their name I'll set that to be true and their GPA that's true as well again that still gives us the ID let's set that to be false if you don't want that ID false and that should get rid of the IDS here's each Student's name and their GPA alright everybody that's the find method two optional parameters that we can send arguments to are the query parameter that's selection criteria it's similar to a where clause in SQL we're trying to limit the results and the projection parameter that's similar to selected columns in SQL you're looking for specific Fields alright everybody and that is the find method in mongodb
