hey everybody in today's video I'm going to explain how we can create functions in PHP with a function you write some code once then reuse it whenever you need it it's reusable code if you ever need to call a written function you type the function name followed by a set of parentheses for example we could have an add function we have a function name then two parentheses I like to think of the parentheses as two telephones talking to each other in order to invoke a function you call it like with the telephone some examples of functions could be add subtract multiply divide you can create all sorts of functions to do various things here's how to create a function we'll create a function to sing Happy Birthday to create a function type function then we're declaring a function name what would you like to name this function I will name it the happy birthday function add a set of parentheses a set of curly braces any code you would like to reuse you place within the set of curly braces I'll create some Happy Birthday song here's my function we write this code once then reuse it whenever we need it if I would like to execute the code within the function I would type the function name in this case it's happy birthday then add a set of parentheses like it's a pair of telephones talking to each other that's how you call a function and here's my birthday message um I forgot some break lines let me put those in real quick that's much better happy birthday dear you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear you you are X years old I know it's kind of a lame song I just made it up on the spot I can call this function as many times as I need it if I would like to sing Happy Birthday three times I would just invoke this function three times there we have sung three verses of happy birthday I'm gonna add another break statement though there so a function is just a section of reusable code you write it once reuse it whenever you need it with coding we try not to repeat code if we don't have to with the function you can send your function some data some values or variable I'm going to send my happy birthday function a string a first name let's say SpongeBob if you send your function some data a value or a variable this would be known as an argument we need a matching parameter a parameter is kind of like a temporary variable let's create a parameter named first name this parameter only exists within the scope of this function when you escape the function this variable no longer exists let's replace U with the placeholder then we will add our parameter our variable first name happy birthday dear first name let's do that here as well then let's try this again happy birthday dear SpongeBob happy birthday to you happy birthday dear SpongeBob you are X years old I could call this function again and pass on a different parameter like Patrick we have a verse of happy birthday but we have sent a different argument Patrick instead of SpongeBob let's do it one more time we will invoke happy birthday then pass in a first name Squidward happy birthday dear Squidward you can pass in more than one argument to a function let's send an age so separate each argument with a comma I don't know how old SpongeBob is according to the lore let's say that he's 30. let's do that with Patrick as well let's say he's 35 then Squidward he seems older maybe he'll be 45. we have two arguments when we invoke this function we should have two parameters for the second parameter let's store these values in a variable named age then we can use this variable for something let's replace x with variable age happy birthday dear SpongeBob you are 30 years old Patrick is 35 years old and Squidward is 45 years old that's how to invoke a function and pass arguments to it but you would need a matching set of parameters now with the function you can return something you'll typically see a return statement at the end of a function let's go over a different example we will create a function to check to see if a number is even or odd function let's name this function is even we will need one parameter a number to invoke this function you type the function name then add a set of parentheses if there's a parameter you need to pass in a value or a variable let's see if the number 11 is even now within our function we need to write some code let's say we have a variable result equals that to see if a number is even or odd you take that number or that variable modulus 2. modulus gives you the remainder of any Division if number divides by 2 evenly the results should be zero if it's odd the result is one then we'll use a return statement and return some value what would we like to return let's return the result now if I Echo after executing this function whatever is returned kinda takes its place then I'm just going to Echo it is 11 even or is it odd that returns one is 10 even or odd that returns zero it's even you could shorten this too let's get rid of our result variable take this section of code and we are returning whatever the outcome is that works too let's write something a little more complicated let's create a function to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle so let's define our function function let's name this function hypotenuse we'll need sides A and B as arguments so set up these matching parameters to find side C we need to follow this equation square root function variable a to the power of 2 plus variable B to the power of two then we will return whatever variable C is I'm going to invoke this function but we need two arguments side a and side B let's say side a is three side B is 4. now this doesn't print anything C should technically be five so after executing this function after it's complete just imagine that we're returning five so let's Echo whatever the result is or we could store it within a variable so now the result is five let's do two different numbers side a will be four side B will be five side C is 6.4 and some change one last thing I should mention with your parameter names you can declare a type that needs to be passed in for example if I was to send in like a string like find the hypotenuse of pizza and taco well that really doesn't make sense right fatal error uncut type error unsupported operand type string you can list a data type before the variable name to force the arguments to be of that data type I could say these need to be integers I would type int or float for floating Point numbers if I try this again we receive a different type of error uncut type error now I haven't discussed error handling yet but this will come in handy when we get to that point just be aware of that with parameters you can list a data type beforehand then you need to pass in an argument of that exact data type all right everybody so that's a function it's a section of reusable code whenever you would like to use this function you type the function name add a set of parentheses if there are parameter setup you need to pass in a matching set of arguments then you can return something and well everybody those are functions in PHP
