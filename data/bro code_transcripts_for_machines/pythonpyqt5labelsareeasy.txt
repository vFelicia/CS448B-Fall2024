what's up everybody in today's topic we're going to create some labels using pi qt5 we will import the widget of Q label this label class is used to create label widgets that can display text or images within the Constructor of our main window this is where we'll create a label we will declare a label object label equals call The Constructor for Q label for the text of the label we'll pass in a string that's the first argument let's say the word hello for the second argument we will pass in self self refers to this window object that we're calling and instantiating all right let's do a test run here is my label although you can barely see it the font is really small but it does say hello let's set the font we'll need another import from PI qt5 do QT GUI import Q font by importing the Q font class we can begin working with fonts we're going to take our label call the set font method within this method we will call the Constructor of Q font pick a font that would like I will pick aial but feel free to choose really any font then the second argument is a font size I'll pick 30 let's do another test run that's much better let's increase this to 40 for the font size now I'm going to set the geometry of this label such as the positioning and the width and the height let's let's take our label use the set geometry method we will pass in X and Y coordinates 0 0 corresponds to the top left corner for the width let's set the width to be 500 and the height to be 100 that's better I'll cover more advanced alignments momentarily let's add a Styles sheet pqt does have styles that are very similar to CSS if you would like to learn more about CSS I do have a full course on that topic we will add some CSS like Properties by accessing our label object call the method of set style sheet within this method we will pass in some CSS like properties such as a color for the color let's say blue these CSS like properties should end with a semicolon and now the font color is blue you could also use RGB values or heximal values you could always look up a Color Picker and pick a very specific color let's pick something green we can either use RGB values or heximal values so I will copy this value so I will paste that heximal value and now we have a very specific shade of green but I think I'll go with something dark such as that so this color is going to be a dark gray color we could set a background color this will be a new string background dasc color and I will pick a new color I will pick something blue that's a decent color we have a blue background with dark gray text we can set the font to be bold font weight will be bold so the font is now bold the font style can be italic font style italic so our font is italic and we can underline text decoration underline the text on our label is now underlined let's work on positioning next currently my text is left Justified and set to the center vertically to work with alignments we need this import from Pi qt5 QT core import QT the class of QT is used for alignments to Center the text of our label at the top vertically we will take our label use the set alignment method then pass in a flag access the class of qot access the flag of align top this will align our text vertically to the top so then our text is aligned vertically to the top rather than the center for the bottom we will use the flag of Al line bottom we will align vertically on the bottom the text is now on the bottom to align vertically in the center align V Center this will be vertically Center which it was originally now for horizontal alignment we can add the following okay to align right we will pass in a flag of align right or is onally align right the text is now all the way to the right for the center align H H for horizontal Center the text is now horizontally aligned in the center for the left Al line left the text will be aligned to the left we could combine both horizontal and vertical positioning here's how take our label call the set alignment method we will align horizontally in the center follow this with the or or bitwise operator which is a vertical bar this allows us to combine Flags we will align horizontally in the center then vertically let's align to the top so our text should be aligned horizontally we're aligned in the center and vertically we're aligned to the top align bottom vertically horizontally we are in the center vertically we're on the bottom then for the very center of our label Al line horizontal Center and Al line vertical Center our text will now be in the very middle of our label both horizontally and vertically now there is a shortcut for the very center we don't need both of these flags the shortcut is the following set alignment align Center that will align the text both horizontally and vertically so that is Center and Center all right everybody so that is an introduction to labels in pi qt5
