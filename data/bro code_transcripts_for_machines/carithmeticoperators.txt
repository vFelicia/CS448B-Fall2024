well well well welcome back so we need to talk about arithmetic operators because well this wouldn't be a full course without them so as you probably know arithmetic operators are well addition subtraction multiplication division and there's a few others too unique with programming such as modulus increment and decrement so let's go over a few let's say that we have int z and if we need to add two numbers we could say x plus y equals z and then display the sum which of course is seven so subtraction is well minus five minus two is three multiplication is an asterisk five times two equals ten okay now pay attention to this with division so 5 divided by 2 equals 2.5 right well that's where you're wrong it's 2 because we're storing the results within an integer and with integers we can only store whole numbers so we will lose that decimal portion it will be truncated there's a few things we'll need to change first we'll need to store the result within a float or a double and then let's display this percent f for a float okay another thing that we need to change too and that involves integer division if we're dividing by an integer we'll truncate that decimal portion there's one of two things we can do we can either change our divisor to a float or a double and that will solve that problem 2.5 or if we would like to keep this as an integer we can convert this integer to a float or double by preceding the divisor with float or double either one so if i would like to keep y as an integer and we divide x by y we will convert 2 into a float so 2.0 and store the result within float z and the result is 2.5 so if you're performing division with any integers you need to pay attention to integer division and you may need to cast your divisor as a float or as a double now we have modulus modulus gives you the remainder of any division five does not divide by two evenly int z equals x modulus y and if we display z so make sure to change your format specifier if you didn't the remainder of five divided by two is one if this was four four divides by two evenly and the result is going to be zero modulus gives you the remainder of any division it's actually pretty helpful to find if a number is even odd all you do is say modulus 2 or some variable containing the value of 2 either way and then we can increment or decrement a number by 1. if i need to increment x for some reason you'll see this when we get to the video on loops i could say x plus plus and then let's display x x incremented by one would be six and then let's decrement y y minus minus and y decremented by one equals one so yeah everybody those are a few arithmetic operators a lot of these are fairly simple you know addition subtraction multiplication and division do pay attention to integer division because that can throw off your program then there's also modulus increment and decrement if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
