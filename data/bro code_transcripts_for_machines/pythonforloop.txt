hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain for loops in python and at the end of this video we're going to create a countdown timer so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right guys and gals let's talk about for loops a for loop is a statement that will execute its block of code a limited amount of times it's similar but different from a while loop because a while loop could iterate an unlimited or infinite amount of times depending on the condition a for loop will only iterate a limited amount of times and before we start executing its block of code we already know how many times we're going to repeat this block of code so for this example let's create a for loop that will simply count it to 10 and then we'll create a few more sophisticated examples so to create a for loop that will count up to 10 this is what we'll type four and then we need some sort of counter people usually either write index or they shorten it to just i i for index four i in and we can set a range range 10. so we will execute this for loop 10 times and to finish this for loop just add a colon at the end so the next line or lines will be indented so that's the block of code for the for loop what do we want to do during each iteration let's just print what i is and let's take a look to see what would happen so we executed this for loop ten times except with computers computers always start with zero so when we said four i in range ten we're counting numbers zero through nine so it's as if this number is exclusive so there's two ways we can change this we could say range ten plus one or what i would do is say print i plus one so this will give us numbers one through ten so that's a for loop it will execute a limited amount of times this time let's count a range between two numbers not necessarily 0 to 10 but something else so let's say 4i in range maybe the numbers 50 through 100 so within my range function i will pass in two numbers the first number will be the starting point and the second number is the ending point this first number is inclusive and the second number is exclusive so let's print this print whatever i is so this will count 50 through 99 actually if you wanted to include this last number since it's exclusive what we could do is just add one to the end so this would give us 50 through 100 except that this will iterate 51 times since we're counting 50. so you just have to pay attention to your range and the numbers that it's counting now one thing that you can do with the range function is that you can add a third argument and this will function as the step how much you want to count up or down by so this time let's count up by two so i'll add comma two we're passing in a third argument this time so this program will now count up by two starting at 50 and go all the way to 100. a benefit of for loops is that we can iterate through anything that is considered iterable this could include a string the letters in a string or any sort of collection so this time let's create a for loop that will iterate once through each letter in maybe a name so for i in and let's type a name here type in whatever your first name and last name is and then we will print whatever i is for i in whatever your name is print each letter in the string so when i run this each letter within my name will be printed to a new line all right people for my last trick we're going to create a program where we will simulate a countdown starting at 10 and count down to zero and then maybe once we reach zero we can print something such as happy new year so to create this program we'll need an import so at the top we're going to import the time module because we'll be waiting one second after each iteration of this for loop so to create this program let's say four you could say i but you can really write anything here and to demonstrate that let's say four seconds four seconds in range so the starting point is going to be ten the ending point will be zero and we'll add a step what do we want to count up or down by let's set this to negative one so this will be a countdown starting at ten and ending at zero so after each iteration let's print whatever i is or in this case seconds and then we can sleep have our thread sleep for a number of seconds too so after we print seconds type time dot sleep and pass in how long you want to sleep for i would like to sleep for one second and then at the end let's print happy new year make sure this isn't within the for loop print happy new year and well that's it let's test this so we'll begin at 10 and count down to zero and you can see that my thread that is running this program is sleeping for one second after each iteration of this for loop then once we reach zero it will display happy new year well everybody that's the basics of for loops a for loop is a statement that will execute its block of code a limited amount of times it's different from a while loop because a while loop could execute an infinite or unlimited amount of times with for loops they execute limited amounts of times and before we enter the for loop we already know how many times we're going to iterate this for loop if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's how for loops work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
