hey what's going on everybody so in today's lesson we're going to create a project where we Generate random passwords this will help us solidify our understanding of functions and random numbers this will be an exercise for beginners by setting different options we can change the format of the password and well let's begin everybody all right let's begin we'll need to let our program know what the length of our password is going to be let's create a constant to store that const password length set this equal to maybe 12 but we can adjust that accordingly we'll create a Boolean to specify if our generated password is going to contain lowercase characters we'll create a constant include lowercase do we want to include lowercase characters we can set this to be true or false we will set this to be true do we want to include uppercase characters include uppercase I will again set this to be true do we want to include numbers const include numbers I will set that to be true do we want to include symbols const include symbols we'll Define a function at the top of our program function to generate password we have a lot of parameters to set up we're going to pass all of these constants as arguments so we have a length include lowercase include uppercase include numbers and include symbols when we call this function we have to pass in all of these arguments so we will call our generate password function pass in our password length include lowercase include uppercase include numbers and include symbols at the bottom of our function we will be returning a password but for now I'm just going to write an empty string because we still need to determine what that password is going to be after finishing the generate password function this will return a string a string password we will store that within const password equals whatever is returned from the generate password function and just so that this is more readable although not necessary I'm going to place each of these arguments on a new line because I'm OCD about things being in alignment and then at the very end of this program I will display a template string of generated password I'll add a placeholder then we'll display our password that we generate so so right now it's not going to display anything we're returning an empty string but that is everything we need outside of this function to generate our password basically we're passing in options when we generate our password do we want to include lowercase characters uppercase characters numbers and or symbols we have a number and a bunch of Boolean values within our password we're going to create a few constants within this generate password function we will create one long string of all of the lowercase characters chars equals I'm going to go through the alphabet we will have one long string of alphabetical characters and I think I got all of them so there should be 26 now we're going to do this with uppercase characters const uppercase chars equals I'm going to turn on caps lock go through the alphabet we'll create a constant of number characters number chars equals 0 through 9 and symbols const symbol chars which symbols would you like to include I'll just add a bunch that's probably good enough for now feel free to add more or less we will create a variable for allowed chars meaning characters and an empty password let password equal an empty string if some of these constants are true we would like to take that corresponding set of characters and concatenate it to the allowed Char string so what we'll do is take our allowed characters variable you string catenation by using plus equals we'll check to see if include lowercase is true or false we can use the etary operator for that if we would like to include lower case characters we will string concatenate our lowercase chars our lowercase characters otherwise we'll concatenate an empty string let's do this with uppercase characters with our allowed characters let's string concatenate and check if we're including uppercase characters question mark if this is true we will concatenate all of the uppercase characters we've declared otherwise we'll concatenate an empty string so we don't include them let's do this with number chars include numbers are we including numbers within our password if so we will return our number Char string and then symbols are we including symbols within our password if so concatenate our string of symbol characters all right just to test everything afterwards I'm going to console. log are allowed characters so right now I'm going to switch all of these constants to be false so right now we're not including any characters if I were to set include a lowercase to be true we would include all of the lowercase characters that's one long string Let's test uppercase yep we are including all of the uppercase characters include numbers yes that works works and include symbols that also works at this point in the program we're going to have one gigantic string of all of the possible characters before we move on with the program I do want to run some checks using some if statements first let's check to see if the password length is zero or less than zero right now it's set to 12 using an if statement if the length the length of the password is less than or equal to zero we need to let the user know that the password length must be at least one we will return a string password length must be at least one right now we're not generating a password we returning an empty string if I set the password length to be zero we will generate this message password length must be at least one or even a negative number like1 password length must be at least one let's set that back to be 12 what if we don't select any options what if all of these character options were false we can check the length of our alloud characters variable so if our loud characters length property is strictly equal to zero this will only be possible if all of these options are set to false we will return a template string at at least one set of characters needs to be selected and let's see if this works yes it does at least one set of characters needs to be selected I can select any options that I would like I will set these all to be true now here's the hard part for as many iterations as our password is we will select a random character from all of the different possibilities we will use a for Loop we will let I be our index our counter we will continue this for loop as long as I is less than the length the password length then increment I by One during each iteration if our password length is 12 we will execute this for Loop a total of 12 times now we will generate a random index const random index equals we will use the random method of math this generates a random number between 0 and one I can multiply this number that's randomly generated by the length of our allowed characters let's say we're including only lowercase characters well this is a total of 26 characters in the alphabet but if I'm taking math.random * 26 I'll be given a random number between 0 and 25 but I will need to round it down let's enclose this equation with the floor method of math to round down math. floor we'll use string concatenation with our password currently our password is an empty string but we will use string concatenation we will string con anate a randomly chosen character from our string of allowed characters password plus equals are allowed characters at the index of random index then at the end of this program we will return our password and let's see if this works let's close out of this function we don't need it anymore and let's see if this works yeah there's our password so every time I run the program I get a new random password and I can turn these options on and off let's set all of these options to be false to begin with and I will set the length to be zero let's see what happens password length must be at least one all right how about a password of 10 10 characters long at least one set of characters needs to be selected let's select only lowercase characters yep we only have lowercase characters let's allow uppercase characters now let's allow numbers I didn't get any of that time let's do it again okay there's a number I guess numbers don't come up very frequently and let's include symbols and there's a few symbols in there all right everybody so that was an exercise to Generate random passwords it should give you some practice with functions and working with random numbers and well everybody that was a random password generator in JavaScript
