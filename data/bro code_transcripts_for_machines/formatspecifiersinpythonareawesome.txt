hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain format specifiers format specifiers when used in the context of an fstring they allow us to format a value based on what flags are inserted following your value you would type a colon and then some Flags depending on what flags you insert it will format your output a certain way you could add decimal point precision allocate space zero pad values left justify right justify Center align all sorts of things let's have some practice I'll create three prices price one price two price three price one will be 3.14159 these values aren't ten dollars and cents yet but they will be price two will be negative nine eight seven dot six five as you can see I'm just making up numbers here price three is twelve dot three four let's display our prices using some f strings price one is placeholder price one then we will do this for price two and price three price two is price two price three is price three within our placeholder following the value we can add a colon then some Flags those flags are the format specifiers they will format our value a particular way depending on what we insert after the colon to add a decimal point Precision you would type after the colon Dot then the amount of decimals to be displayed maybe two then F meaning floating Point number let's do that with price two and price 3. colon dot two f price one is now 3.14 price 2 is negative 987.65 price 3 is 12.34 I think I'm gonna add some dollar signs before the placeholder yeah that's much better for Less Precision maybe one decimal place you can change the two to a one so point one f each number only displays one decimal point one point six point three whereas in point three F would display three decimal places 0.142 0.650.340 even though price two and price three only have two decimal places in the original numbers we will concatenate some additional zeros to allocate space to display a value after the colon add some number some number for that many spaces how about 10. each value now has a total of 10 spaces to display the output 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. if you were to precede a number with zero well these numbers would be zero padded each number is now zero padded two left justify a value you would use a left angle bracket all these numbers are now left Justified then we have all of the space after they're all uniform right justify would be a right angle bracket and I believe that's the default Center align I believe is the carrot symbol yep our numbers are now centered if you have any positive values and you would like to display a plus sign just use Plus any positive number is preceded with a plus sign any negative number is preceded with the negative sign or you could use a space for any positive numbers so colon space these numbers are lined up evenly even though we have a negative number in here there is a thousand separator which is a comma we should probably increase the value of our prices 3000 negative nine thousand eight hundred seventy one thousand two hundred each thousands place is now separated with a comma we could also mix and match Flags I would like a thousand separator along with decimal point Precision of two decimal places and why not I will precede each number with a plus sign if it's positive yep here we are So based on what you're looking for you can add some combination of flags so yeah those are format specifiers everybody within your placeholder insert your value a colon then certain Flags based on what you're looking for exactly but yeah those are just a few format specifiers in Python
