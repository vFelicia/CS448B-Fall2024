hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the index operator in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people let's begin i'm going to be explaining the index operator which is represented by a set of square brackets now they give access to a sequences elements they include but are not limited to strings lists and tuples for this example we're going to be working with strings because strings are easy to work with let's say we have a name and name equals whatever your first and last name is we can use the index operator to access an element of the sequence our string so let's check to see if the first letter in our name is lowercase and i should probably change that to lowercase for this example so within an if statement if name and we can add a set of square brackets after our sequence which is a string and we can check a given element of our sequence let's check to see if the first letter is lowercase now with computers they always start at zero if you need to access the first element in a sequence that would be index zero and then the next sequence well the next element in the sequence would be one then two then you followed that pattern so i would like to check to see if name at index zero that would be the first character is lowercase so there is a method to check that dot is lower this will return true or false if the first letter is lowercase then our if statement is going to be resolved to true and what i could do is that i can perhaps change it to uppercase then so let's reassign name to equal name dot and there is a capitalize function here and then let's print our name print name so when we run this the first letter in my name is now capitalized so if you need to access an element within a sequence a string or list or a tuple you would add a set of square brackets afterwards and then you list an integer of the element that you're trying to access so here's a few other examples i'm going to turn this as well as this into a comment and let's say we would like to create some substrings and we can do so using our index operator so i would like to create a substring from the first part of my name so what i'll do is create a new variable first name equals name index operator so you can specify a range for an index operator so you would set the starting position on the lefthand side followed by a colon and then your ending position so i would like the substring to begin at index zero and end at three so that would be zero colon then three all right and then i would like to make this all uppercase for some reason and then let's print my first name so with the index operator we specified a range we would like to access elements 0 through 3. turn them up your case and assign them to a new variable of first name here's a shortcut that you might find useful if the index for your range begins with zero you can actually delete that you don't even necessarily need that zero now we just have colon three and this would work the same as it did before so that's a useful shortcut and we're going to bring it up later if we need to access the last element in a sequence this time let's create a substring of last name so last name equals name index operator this time i would like to access the element at index let's see 0 1 2 3 4. all right so i'm going to say for colon and we're not really sure where our name our last name is going to end so what you could do is just say colon and then leave the next index blank so that will be the index beginning at four and everything afterwards and let's say two lower to make this all lower case for some reason so let's print our last name print last name so this should take everything starting at index 4 and after that and turn it into its own substring of last name now you can access the last element in a sequence by using what's called negative indexing so let's add a exclamation point to the end of our name so let's say we have a new variable called last character and i would like to store the last character in my name to this new variable this new substring so to access the last element in a sequence within the index operator we can use negative indexing so the last element would be negative one all right and then let's print whatever our last character is so this should print an exclamation point yep which did so then if this was negative two that would be the second to last element in a sequence so now that would be e because e is in the second to last element in my sequence all right everybody so that's the basics of the index operator you can add a set of square brackets after a string a list or a tuple and then list an integer or a range of the elements that you're trying to access so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post everything in the comments down below don't be afraid to help me out and smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
