hey it's you bro I hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be covering some basic coloring techniques using the style attribute in HTML let's get into it the HTML style attribute is an in line attribute that contains some information about how to style a whole or part of a webpage this is going to be more of a hybrid HTML slash CSS topic because it's about time we begin to pivot towards learning CSS since we are nearing the end of this HTML tutorial series we're only going to be covering basic color is using styling there's way more that we can do with styles but we'll save it for the CSS series to begin let's create some sample text for our web page between the body tags let's type some sample text let's add a heading I'll use an h1 heading since it's the largest and perhaps for a title I will type I like colors and then let's close this alright let's save refresh I like colors alright let's add a sample paragraph to work on if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem and then hit tab and then you'll have all the sample text to work with otherwise you can type in whatever you want here it doesn't matter I'm going to save refresh and I believe we should add a pair of paragraph tags before and after this whole paragraph alright then I'm just going to copy this and let's paste it and have a second paragraph alright that looks good enough for me all right the first thing that we're going to do is that we can apply an inline style attribute to nearly any HTML element so let's begin with the background color we'll want to place this style attribute within the opening body tag so we're just going to type style equals and then we have a few options here let's say that we want to change the background color we can just type in background color and notice that the text color is changing this is a CSS property and we'll type in a colon and let's pick a color the first one that comes to mind for me is like green but you don't have to pick the same color that I do so let's save this refresh the page and the background color of our webpage is now like green and actually that's not too bad if a color I would say it's kind of nice it's like nature II and with picking colors you're not limited to only placing the color name you can use hexadecimal color values and if you don't know how those work or if you need to find a value I would recommend going to any search engine and just look up hexadecimal color picker and then you can choose any color that you want let's say we want like a really dark blue color maybe like a navy blue of some sort I don't know that's probably good enough for me alright something you can just take this hexadecimal code and we're going to copy it and replace light green with this value and make sure to get that hashtag symbol let's save this and reload and the background color is now that dark blue color however we can't see our text anymore because the background is too dark the point being with colors you can either use the color name or you can use the hexadecimal color value and place that instead of the color name I tend to prefer these values just because you can adjust these depending on the exact color scheme that you want or if you're trying to match like a logo or something you can get the exact colors instead of just some of the basic generic color names like red or blue you can actually get a specific value now we can use this in line style element and place this somewhere else within another tag let's say that we want to change the font color of our title mostly because we can't see it anymore because it's blending in with the dark background we're going to type style equals same process as before let's start with the font colors so we could just say color and I'll just pick red let's save reload the page and we can now see the header for our web page and the font color is red let's add a background color to this so we're going to place this within the double quotes of our style attribute and we're going to add a semicolon to separate this and we're going to type the background color and let's add a background color I'm gonna pick something that would kind of clash with red just for an example let's say blue let's save reload alright so we can change the background color of this area specifically as well however one problem that I have with just using color names is that these colors tend to be very sharp and if you use these together it's probably going to hurt your eyes and be difficult to read so I much prefer to use these hexadecimal colors instead of these color names but it works for this example for learning purposes we can also change the font color and the background color of paragraph elements as well so we're going to use the inline style attribute and it's gonna be the same process as before let's change the color so color and I actually picked out a few colors already that I kind of like so this is what I'm going to type but use whatever colors you want so I'm going to type for F C 1 FF and let's see what this looks like that's kind of cool and let's add a background color as well so separate this with a semicolon background color and for this color for the background I picked 0 2 6 3 B yeah that's not too bad um I'm not an artist though okay this next one's gonna be fun let's do this again but pick some random values so I'm just going to copy this place it within our next paragraph and I'm just going to choose two colors at semirandom so whoo alright we're going with blue I guess and I'm going to paste that here for the font color let's do this one more time I guess red I don't know that was my poor attempt at being pseudorandom all right let's see what these semi random colors look like okay that is horrible so do not do anything like this the colors really clash together okay this color scheme was hurting my eyes so I changed the colors to something that's actually a little bit better I would say just green text on a black background it's fairly simple if you would like a copy of this code we worked on today I'll include a copy of this in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that is how you can do basic coloring for your website using the inline style attribute in HTML hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three
