hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a temperature conversion program as an exercise we'll Begin by asking what the current unit of measurement is unit equals will accept some user input is this temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit C slash F then we will ask for the temperature I'll store the temperature in a variable named temp meaning temperature temp equals input enter the temperature then we should cast our user input as a floating Point number if unit is equal to C I'll fill this in momentarily I'm just going to write pass as a placeholder else if unit is equal to F we will do something else let's print something just an error message of some sort using an F string unit is an invalid unit of measurement Let's test this else statement is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit what if I were to type K for Kelvin I'll make up some temperature like 100 K is an invalid unit of measurement all right we know the else statement Works let's convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using this formula we will take our temperature equals 9 times our temp divided by five Plus 32. I'll take all of this and use the round function we'll round to one decimal place then we will print the current temperature in Fahrenheit I'll use an F string that temperature in Fahrenheit is our temp variable degrees Fahrenheit Let's test the if statement is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit it is currently in Celsius what is 33 degrees in Celsius converted to Fahrenheit the temperature in Fahrenheit is 91.4 degrees all right so this section is working let's work on the else statement else if our unit is currently in Fahrenheit we'll convert to Celsius that formula is temp equals our temperature minus 32. times 5 divided by 9. then I will round the result to one decimal place then we'll print the temperature in Celsius the temperature in Celsius is 10 degrees C for Celsius is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit it is currently in Fahrenheit enter the temperature 91.4 the temperature in Celsius is 33.0 degrees Celsius well everybody that is a simple temperature conversion program in Python I thought we could use some practice with if statements edit the next video we're going to create a calculator program
