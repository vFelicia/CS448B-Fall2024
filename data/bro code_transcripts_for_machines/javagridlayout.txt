what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about grid layouts in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's discuss the grid layout manager so this places components in a grid of cells in a number of rows and columns with each component taking all of the available space within itself and each cell is the same size so to begin we'll need a frame we're going to add buttons to our frame the frame is going to have a grid layout so to create a frame like always we just say jframe we give it a name like frame equals new jframe frame dot set default close operation jframe makes it on close give it a size the size doesn't matter and frame dot set visible to true so let's create a whole bunch of buttons i don't know how many maybe nine so to create a button we just type in j button we can give this a name like button one equals new j button and then when we instantiate this we can set some text to the button so let's just pass in one and then we can add this button to the frame so frame dot add button one so there's a shortcut you can do that we learned in the last video on flow layout managers this will still work but just to save time i'm going to shorten the lines of code that we have to write so instead of creating a button with a name we can create an anonymous button so all we need to pass in when we add this component to the frame is instead a new j button and then you can set the text right away too the other way works just fine that just requires more lines of code but do what you prefer i'm just shortening this to save some time for us so we're going to add a bunch of buttons to the frame to demonstrate a grid layout so i'm going to create nine separate buttons all of them will be numbered and once you have a whole bunch of buttons it doesn't matter how many we're ready to move on with frames by default they use a border layout manager so the components like to take up as much room as possible so with this button this number nine but it's taking up the entire frame and all the other buttons are hidden underneath so we need to change the layout manager that we're using for the containing class which is our frame so frame dot set layout and we're going to pass in a layout manager which layout manager a new grid layout well because that's what we're learning about and when we run this all of these components all of these buttons are all arranged in one row and one column for each component that we have but we can specify the amount of rows and columns that we want for this grid we could say the first number is the amount of rows and the second number is the amount of columns so here we have nine rows and one column so they will all be stacked vertically like this and then they will expand to fit the size of the frame but all of the components will also stay the same size as each other let's say we want three rows and three columns this is what this might look like so we have three rows and three columns and later on in the series we do create a calculator program as well as a game of tictactoe so a grid layout works perfect for those programs now when we create our instance of a graded layout we can also add some arguments for the horizontal margins and vertical margins between these components so let's add two more arguments and we'll just set them to zero for now so this third position is the horizontal spacing between components and the fourth one is the vertical spacing so if i were to set this third argument to 10 we're going to have 10 pixels worth of margin between these components between each column and this fourth argument is the vertical margin so if you combine these both together you have 10 pixels worth of margin around all of the components now what happens if you have an uneven amount of components that you add to a grid layout so we have three by three so that works perfect for nine components let's say that we add one more we're going to add a tenth button like that so what happens now is that this will actually create a new column for us so we have three rows and four columns and it tries to make this as evenly balanced as possible so that's the basics of grade layout managers if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of grid layouts in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
