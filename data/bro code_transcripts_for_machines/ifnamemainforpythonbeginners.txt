hey everybody so today I got to talk about this if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main when you see this if statement it's usually followed by a call to a function named main or something similar a majority of the driving code behind a program is usually found within some sort of main method when you see this if statement basically speaking it means that this script can be imported or it can run Standalone functions and classes in this module can be reused in other programs without the main block of code running sometimes you would like the functionality of a program without executing the main body of code a good example could be a library in a python Library we would like to import some of the useful functions such as the math module but if we were to run that Library directly instead of importing it we could instead display a help page but if we're importing that Library we don't necessarily want to display that help page only if we're running it directly in many python scripts you'll see the statement of if Dunder name is equal to main if we're not running this program directly don't do it in this example we're going to delete our main python script be sure to recreate it at the end of this topic in case I forget to mention that we will create two new scripts go to file new python file script one file new python file script 2 we have to add new run configurations for script one and script 2 so if you go to the top go to run edit configurations we will add a new run configuration select python select a new script path to script one okay apply again we have to do this with script 2 add python select a script path of script 2 okay apply then okay using this drop down menu we can select which run configuration we would like would we like to run our main python file but we have deleted it do we want to run script one or script two for the time being we'll select script one within script one if I was to print then call the dur function dur meaning directory python has all of these builtin attributes if you're not familiar with object oriented programming for now think of an attribute as a variable Dunder name is a special type of variable Dunder meaning double uncore if I was to print what's contained within Dunder name we would receive a string of Dunder main that's why in a script you may see the statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if so then you usually call a function named main to start your program I'm going to undo that so let's import script 2 from script 2 import everything asterisk means everything within script 2 I will print Dunder name and we'll see what's within it again I'm running script one within script two Dunder name is equal to a string of script 2 the name of the Python script however within script one Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main this means I am running script one directly let's delete this import then go to script two import script one from script One Import asterisk meaning all we're now going to change our run configuration from script 1 to script 2 we are running script 2 directly now Dunder name within script one is the name of the Python script script one Dunder name within script 2 is now Dunder main so by adding this if statement of Dunder name is equal to Dunder main we can check to see which file is being run directly if Dunder name equals Dunder main we will call a function of main to contain the main body of our program but we need to Define this function define main our main function will contain the majority of our python code anything that's not already within a function so let's print this is script one then we'll Define another function of favorite food we will have one print of food let's print the following message I'll use an F string your favorite food is add a placeholder add our parameter of food within our main function let's call the favorite food function pass in your favorite food as a string I'll type in pizza then let's print the word goodbye we're going to run script one run it here's the result from the top down all of our code is within functions we skip over it because we're not calling it quite yet the first thing we do in this program is check this if statement if Dunder name is equal to Dunder main are we running this program directly which we are we're running script one if so call the main method to start the program we print this is script one your favorite food is pizza goodbye now I'm going to go to script 2 delete our print statement change the Run configuration to script 2 and run it nothing should happen that's good now if we were missing this if statement of if Dunder name is equal to main then we delete our main function here's what would happen we're importing script one but we're running script 2 this is script one your favorite food is pizza goodbye I don't want this code to execute we're not running it directly that's why we have that if statement if under name is equal to main I only want to run this code if we're running it directly so what we'll do within script 2 now is Define a function of favorite drink there's one parameter of drink I will print use an FST string your favorite drink is I'll add a placeholder we'll add our parameter of drink let's print the message this is script 2 we will call from script one the favorite food function pass in your favorite food this time I'll say Sushi let's call our favorite drink function favorite drink I'll pass in coffee then we will print goodbye okay we are running script two this is script 2 your favorite food is Sushi your favorite drink is coffee goodbye we're running script 2 but we're importing the functionality of the favorite food function from script one sometimes from another python script you want to borrow something but you don't want to run the main body of code directly I just want to borrow this function from script one and that's it script 2 can be run as a standalone program but I can't import it without this body of code running I can add that if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if we're running this program directly execute this code so let's call a function of main Define main then Place main body of code within it if I run script 2 we have the same message so by adding this if statement of if name is equal to main this script can be run as a standalone program or it can be imported a more practical example of this could be a python Library you can import the library for functionality but if you run the library directly you could instead display a help page it is good practice to include if Dunder name equals Dunder main it makes your code more modular helps with readability leaves no Global variables and avoid unintended execution and well everybody that is the purpose of if Dunder name equals Dunder Main in Python
