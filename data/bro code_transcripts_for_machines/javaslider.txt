hey I was it going everybody it's a bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm gonna be teaching you guys all about Jay sliders in Java and at the end of this video we're going to create a project where we can use a slider to adjust the temperature so let's get into it before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm alright everyone so AJ slider is a GUI component that lets the user enter a value by using an adjustable sliding knob on a track so to best demonstrate this let's create another class to keep things organized so go to your source folder go to file new class and let's call this class slider demo click finish and then we're gonna go back to our main class and create an instance of this slider demo class so we're going to type slider demo and we'll call this slider demo with a lowercase s equals new slider demo parentheses semicolon so let's head to that class and start working here so we're going to need a few things to import so make sure you have these three imports java.awt asterisk Java xwing dot asterisk and Java xwing dot event asterisk now with this class we're going to implement the change listener interface so next to our class definition we're going to type implements change listener so then with our slider we can actually update something whenever we make a change now we're going to add an unimplemented method and it's going to be state changed but we're going to save that for the very end first let's work on our constructor for this slider demo class so we'll just copy this and paste it at a set of parentheses and the set of curly braces now what we'll do is actually declare a few global objects here so the first thing is that we'll want a frame so jframe and we'll call this frame and that's it for now we'll actually instantiate these within the constructor we're also going to want a J panel so jpanel and we'll call this panel we'll need a label so J label label and lastly a slider which is the I guess the main piece of this lesson so to do that you need to declare a J slider J slider and we'll call this slider all right now going within our constructor here we're going to instantiate these objects so the first thing that will create is our frame so frame equals new J frame and let's set the text to slider let's spell it right slider demo and then we will want to instantiate our panel because we're gonna add the panel to the frame so panel equals new J panel will instantiate our label so label equals new J label and then lastly our slider so slider equals new J slider parenthesis semicolon okay now with the slider there's a few values that we can add so with sliders we can have a spectrum of ranges and then we can have the user add just a knob and then they can enter in a value that way so the first set of values is the minimum and the maximum set of numbers for our slider so let's say that we want somebody to adjust a knob on a track between the numbers 0 and 100 so what we'll do for the first number the minimum is enter in 0 and then separate it with a comma then you can enter in the maximum number so let's say 100 so maybe we're finding the temperature of maybe water between the temperature of 0 and 100 degrees Celsius so we're going to set a minimum of 0 and a max of 100 and now there's a third value can add this is the starting point for the slider let's say we want this to start in the middle well we could say 50 for the starting point now before we get ahead of ourselves let's add everything to the frame so first we'll add the slider to the and later we're going to add the panel to the frame so we'll start with panel dot add slider and we're also going to add the label to the panel so panel dot add label and then frame dot add panel and then let's set the size for our frame so frame dot set size and I like to pick for 20 by for 20 and then we need to set the frame to be visible so frame dot set visible true alright so first let's work on our slider then so let's set the preferred size for this slider so we type in the name of the slider dot and then we're going to use the set preferred size method we're going to type in new dimension and we're going to give a width and a height so for hundreds of decent height I mean with so 400 for the width and 200 for the heights pretty decent I would say let's actually see what we have so far okay yeah here's our slider then so it's just a bar that's adjustable there's no markings or anything so we need to add that later all right now what we're going to do is add paint tics so slider dot set paint ticks and within parenthesis we're going to place the word true so let's see what this looks like now all right so we also need to add the tick spacing so these are little I want to say notches that kind of give you an idea of the range of numbers so what we'll type in here is slider dot set minor tick spacing so how often do you want a notch in this slider let's say every 10 units every 10 of whatever you're counting by in our case it's degrees Celsius so let's try it now so these are numbered yet but you can see about every 10 we should have at least like 10 ranges starting at 0 then they go all the way up to there's a little like not cheer now we're going to set some major tick spacing so that comes next so I'm just going to copy this and we're going to change a few things so set paint track and we want this to be true and the next thing is set major tick space and let's set this to 25 okay now after each 25 units there's a larger tick these are major ticks and the small ones are minor ticks then and now with the slider we can actually add values to each of these major ticks and let me show you how to do that so I'll add that maybe right here so what we're gonna type is slider dot set paint labels and we're going to set this to true now we have our numbers for each of our major ticks but not the minor ticks and it gives our whole range between 0 and 100 and you can see that when we started this program it begun like right in the middle at 50 because we set this value this argument the third one to 50 the first one is the minimum which is zero and the second value is the maximum which is 100 so if you adjusted these numbers it would also adjust the numbers on our slider let's also change the font down here too so maybe I'll do that next so slider dot set font new font I really cannot spell today and maybe I'll give this a font of MV Bohle because that's one of my favorite fonts and then font dot plain we don't need to do any styling and I will pick a font size of 15 and let's see what this looks like now not too bad not too bad looks more modern now I would say so one trick you can do with this slider bar is that by default this is horizontal so we could actually change this to a vertical slider bar and that kind of resembles eight there rahmanir since we're taking the temperature so in order to change that to vertical then type the name of the slider dot set orientation and then within here we're going to type swing constants and then dot vertical and let's take a look yeah I would say that would fit a thermometer of sorts then if you want to change it back it's gonna be the same process but change vertical to horizontal and this is what we had previously but I think for this demonstration I'm going to keep it as vertical but I'll just turn this into a comment just so you have it for your notes alright let's add a label so we'll have a label underneath that will display the current temperature whatever this is set to so let's add that right underneath our slider but before we add everything to our panel and our frame now to set the text for the label type in the name of the label and we're going to use the set text function and then we're going to change the text so I'm going to insert the degree symbol I actually don't know how to do this normally so I copied it from Google then degrees C equals and then if we want to retrieve what the current value of the slider is set to we can add + slider and we'll use the get value function of the slider all right let's take a look at this now so it says it's set to 50 degrees Celsius but I think I'm going to increase the font so I'm just going to copy this paste it and change slider to label and let's set this to maybe 25 so it's more visible that's better okay so it's currently set to 50 but if we adjust this this number doesn't change so I'll teach you guys how to do that and we're going to do this within our state changed method so what we're gonna type in here is label dot set text actually we can just copy this and paste it that'd probably be easier so whenever the state changes for the slider it's going to execute this line of code and update it now the last thing that we need to do is that we need something to trigger our state changed method so we need to add a change listener to our slider and we can just add that here so type in slider dot add change listener and then within parentheses type in the word this so this should work now let's try it okay so the midpoint is 50 degrees Celsius the minimum is 0 which we have here in the max is 100 and now if we adjusted this slider this value is also changing whenever we adjust the knob on this track so it has a minimum of 0 and a max of 100 like we intended and it's adjusting whenever we actually moved the knob on this track then so that's how J sliders work it's a GUI component that lets the user enter a value by using an adjustable sliding knob on a track so if you're looking for extra practice your assignment is to post the code for a slider that you've made in the comments down below but yeah that's one of a few ways you can create a J slider in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that
