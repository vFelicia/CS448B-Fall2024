hey how's it going everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create and customize our own check buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right my fellow bros in this video we're going to be creating and customizing our own check buttons in python i sometimes refer to these as check boxes so in case i do that's what i'm referring to as always we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and let's call this button just check button and in order to create this check button we type in the name of the check button equals check button and within the constructor what are we adding this check button to we're adding this to our window and also within the constructor we can set the different options for how we want to customize this check button let's begin with the text text equals i agree to something and last but not least we need to add this check button to the window one way in which we can do that is to use the pack function of this widget so follow this with check button dot pack when we run this we have our check button within our window and we can toggle this on or off right now i'm agreeing to something i'm not sure what i'm agreeing to but hopefully it's not anything bad now currently this doesn't do anything so we'll need to associate a variable with this check button so we'll add that as an option variable equals and let's create a variable called x and we'll need to define this within the window so after we create our instance of our window let's say x equals now with check buttons they store a 1 or a 0 by default within our variable our variable that we call x so with x we're going to set this equal to a int var if this were to return a string we would say string bar but normally by default this returns a 1 or a 0 and we can actually change that using the on value and off value options so the on value is what's going to be stored within our variable if it's toggled on so by default this is one and the off value is the opposite this is what is stored within our variable if this is toggled off all right now let's have some fun with this so let's associate a command with this check button command equals and let's create a function called maybe display and then let's define this before the window def display and we're going to check the value of x to see if it's one or zero so within our display function we're going to check to see if x and to get the value of x we're going to use the get function so if x dot get is equal to 1 that means that somebody clicked on the checkbox or toggled it on so if they check the check box or check the check button then they agree so print you agree if it's zero and we can do this with an else statement else print you don't agree frowny face and let's test this theory so we have our check button when we click on this it's actually going to call our display function i agree to something and it says within our console window you agree and if i were to toggle this off it says you don't agree let's change the font of our check button so we'll add that as an option font equals and we can pass in a font that we want i'll say maybe ariel and then a size of 20 and now this should be readable i agree to something let's also color this because well i like coloring let's begin with the foreground color so that is fg for short fg equals and then we can pass in a color name or a hex value i like hex values so i'm going to stick with those i want a green foreground color so that is zero zero f zero zero but feel free to adjust these values however you want so our text should now be green that is a very bright green and it hurts my eyes so i'm also going to change the background color which is bg and i'm going to set this to black so we'll have green text on a black background okay now when you click on this it flashes that's kind of annoying that's the active foreground and active background if we click on this or hold this down the color scheme switches to our active foreground slash background and we can change those too so i'm going to set those options active foreground i'm going to set this the same as my foreground color and the active background will be the same as our normal background so that's active background equals black and this should no longer flash when we click on it not too bad not too bad let's add some padding pad x i'll set this to 25 and pad y i'll set this to 10. we have a little more padding around our check button one feature that's available to us is that we can add an image next to our check button i downloaded an image of the python logo that i want to add so we'll use the image option to add a photo image to this check button but first we need to create a photo image from our image file so within the window let's call this python photo but you'll probably use something different for your project python photo equals photo image and within the constructor for our photo image we can set the file path or the file name since this image is within my project folder i only have to list the file name and this photo of mine is python.png and now we set the image equal to our photo image that we have image equals python photo but when we run this it's going to overlap the text we still have our image though and this still works as intended so in order to display the image as well as the text we're going to need to use the compound option and let's add that at the end compound is where we're adding this photo relative to the text i want this photo on the left hand side of the text so i'm going to set this to left and now when we run this surprise surprise our image is on the left hand side one thing that you should know is that with the on value and the off value data type if you were to change this to a noninteger value let's say we're going to replace the on value with a boolean value of true and the off value is false with this variable make sure to change the data type as well to reflect what you're storing within it so with our int var variable we want to change this to a boolean var value so replace int with boolean and this will work much the same now with this display function we'll need to account for that so within the if statement here we'll say if x dot get we don't need to say is equal to one this will return true or false and this will work just the same as it did before and if you replace this with a string let's say the on value is yes all caps and the off value is no this is now a string bar and we'll change our display function to say if x dot get is equal to yes and this should work you agree you don't agree you agree you don't agree and i'll change that back to one so one and zero is the default for this but you can edit these based on what you need all right so that's the basics of check buttons in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of check buttons in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and
