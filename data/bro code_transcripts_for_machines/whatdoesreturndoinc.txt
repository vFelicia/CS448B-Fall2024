all right everybody we are on the return keyword the return keyword will return a value back to the spot where you called to the encompassing function the return keyword is commonly found at the end of a function much like the main function when we invoke a function we can return some value back here's an example i'll create a function that will calculate the area of a square but we'll need to pass in a length the length of one side this will be a double length assign some value 5.0 is good then we'll need to declare and define a function at the top of my program i'll add a function declaration for the time being we'll write void but that will change soon void i'll name this function square we will square a length list any parameters we will accept a double value which we will name length then i'll need a function definition i'll add that after the main function void square i'm going to create a temporary variable named result it will be of the double data type we will take length times length to calculate the area then i will use that return keyword return what are we returning we're returning our result if we're returning a value we need to change this keyword void to match the data type of what we're returning we're returning a double so i will change void to double and then make sure you change that within the function declaration as well double square you could do this in one line of code you don't necessarily need to we could simply just return length times length that is also valid that's probably how i would write it we now have this function that will calculate the area of a square once we pass in a length i'm going to create a new variable called area it will be of the double data type and i will set the sequel to then let's invoke the square function pass in our length variable as an argument at this point of the program area should be assigned a value let's display it standard output area i'll add my area variable then add centimeters squared then new line the area of our square is 25 centimeters squared and i could change this to a different number like six the area is now 36 centimeters squared let's create another function this function will find the volume of a cube if we know the length of a side we'll return a value of the double data type but i will name this cube we will still accept the length of the double data type let's copy this paste it change square to cube return length times length times length double volume equals we'll invoke our cube function pass in our length then i will display whatever the volume is volume my volume variable centimeters cubed if the side of a square is 6 centimeters the area would be 36 if it was a cube the volume would be 216 centimeters if you need to return a value back to the spot in which you invoked a function be sure to list the data type of what you're returning let's try another example involving strings i'll create a function that will add a user's first name their last name and create a new string called full name let's declare our variables standard string first name equals add your first name standard string last name equals add your last name then i'll create a function to concatenate two strings together we're returning a string i will list the data type as standard string i'll name this function concat strings we will have two arguments two standard strings standard string i'll name the first string string one standard string string misspelled string string two so we have our function declaration now we just need to define it i'm going to return string one plus i'll add a space between the first name and the last name plus string two i'll create a third variable standard string full name equals i will invoke my concat strings function then i need to pass in two strings as arguments i'll pass in my first name and my last name then let's display the full name standard output hello the user's full name hello bro code or whatever your first and last name is so yeah everybody that is the return keyword wherever you invoke a function you can return a value back to that spot in which you invoked that function if you're returning a value just be sure that you change the return type of that function to match the data type of the value being returned in this example i returned a string a standard string so the return type of this function would be a standard string so that's the return keyword everybody your assignment is in the comment section to post a function that returns some value so yeah that is the return keyword in c plus
