hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain es6 modules in JavaScript a module is an external file that contains reusable code that can be imported into other JavaScript files let's say you write a really difficult program well any part of that program you can import into a different application if you don't feel like rewriting it modules can contain variables classes functions and more es6 modules were introduced as part of the ecmascript 2015 update using modules we can create some reusable code that can be used in different programs different JavaScript files so what we'll do in this example we will create a new file I'll create a module for some math utility functions this file will be math u. JS it's a separate Javascript file from our index file we will import this module math u.j but in order to do so within our HTML file we have to set the type attribute equal to module we'll now treat our index file as a module we can Import and Export other modules freely but we have to be sure to include this attribute and set it equal to module So within our math util module we can write some reusable code for other programs so let's define what Pi is Pi = 3.14 4159 we'll create a function to get circumference you have to pass in a radius though that's going to be the parameter function get circumference we need a radius we will return 2 * pi * radius then we'll create a function to get area get area we still need a radius we will return Pi * radius time radius then get volume to get the volume of a sphere function get volume again we need a radius we will return 4 * PK * radius * radius I can reuse these variables and functions for any JavaScript program that I have I can import them in order to do so though we need to be sure that we prefix each variable function or class or anything else with the export keyword so that we can import it elsewhere so let's be sure we do that all right be sure to save everything we can close out of this module then from our index CSS file I will import then we're going to use object destructuring we need a set of curly braces from the location of that module so these files are right next to each other relatively speaking they're right next to each other I would need slash the name of that file math util and this is a Javascript file now anything I would like to import I'll place within the set of curly braces we're going to be using object structuring from this JavaScript module I would like Pi comma separate each entity then I would like get circumference get area get volume I can now use these variables and functions as if they were already part of my Javascript file for example I'm going to console.log Pi and pi does have a value because we imported it let's get the circumference but we do need to pass in a radius this is a function that we have imported from that mathutils module I will store the result within a variable const circumference equals we'll invoke the get circumference function from that module I'll pass in 10 then we're going to display the circumference I'll use console log I'll use a template string include a placeholder display their circumference plus a unit of measurement like centimet 62. 8318 CM this isn't necessary but I'm going to round this number to two decimal places using the two fixed method of numbers let's round to two decimal places let's create an area variable const area equals get area I'll pass in 10 for the radius let's copy this line and paste it because I'm lazy let's display our area variable with cm cubed 31416 cm cubed then we'll create a volume variable const volume equals get volume I will pass in 10 and then we will display the volume volume cm cubed and our volume if we pass in a radius of 10 would be 1,256 64 cm cubed all right everybody so those are modules they're external files that contain reusable code that can be imported into other JavaScript files you can write variables classes functions and more that can be reused in other programs you just have to be sure to import them and well everybody those are es6 modules in JavaScript
