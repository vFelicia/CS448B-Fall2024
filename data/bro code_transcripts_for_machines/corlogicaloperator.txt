hey again it's me so we're going to talk about the or logical operator the or logical operator which is represented by two vertical bars checks if at least one condition is true let's take the small program for example it's kind of similar to the last video so we have a variable named temperature for temperature we will first check if temp is less than or equal to zero if that's true we will print the weather is bad else if temp is greater than or equal to 30 the weather is bad else the weather is good so you know this program does work the weather is good but another way of writing this is that we can use the or logical operator and we can check to see if at least one of two or more conditions is true so let's take this condition get rid of this else if statement so we will check to see if temp is less than or equal to zero or temp is greater than or equal to thirty so if our temperature is negative one thousand degrees celsius then the weather is bad this is true but this is false and using the or logical operator only one of these conditions needs to be true if both are true that's fine as well or our temperature could be positive 1000 degrees celsius the weather is also bad this is false and this is true and only one of these conditions needs to be true but if our temperature is 25 well neither of these conditions are true at least one condition needs to be true in order to execute the statement so yeah that is the or logical operator it checks to see if at least one condition is true and you can check more than one condition by adding another set of vertical bars for the or operator so if you found this video helpful please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
