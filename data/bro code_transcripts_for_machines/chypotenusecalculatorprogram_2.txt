hey what's going on people it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a small program to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show everyone i thought for practice we could create a small program to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle this will be more or less just for practice so we'll need some prompts let's ask four sides a and b let's begin with a enter side a and then we'll store the user's input within a double double a equals and we'll convert the user input to a double convert to double then within the parenthesis console.read line then another set of parenthesis make sure there is a semicolon at the end too okay then for side b we can just copy what we have change any instance of a to b enter side b double b and we'll have to calculate whatever c is double c math dot square root then we need to multiply a times a that's effectively a to the power of 2 plus b times b and let's display the result console.writeline the hypotenuse is plus c and let's give it a go okay enter side a how about three enter side b four the hypotenuse is five well everybody that was a very small practice program if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well that is a very small sample program in csharp
