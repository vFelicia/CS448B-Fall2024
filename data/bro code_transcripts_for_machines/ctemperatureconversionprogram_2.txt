hey uh everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a small program where the user will type in a temperature and we can convert that temperature from fahrenheit to celsius or celsius to fahrenheit so sit back relax and enjoy the show now before we begin this video make sure that you include these two imports at the top we'll be working with string functions and many of them can be found within this import see type dot h so let's declare the variables that we'll need char unit unit will be either c for celsius or f for fahrenheit and float temp short for temperature let's prompt the user to enter in some user input print f is the temperature in f or c and then we will accept some user input so we will be accepting a character so use the appropriate format specifier for characters and we will use the address of operator which is an ampersand unit and then let's use an if statement to check to see if unit is equal to the character c else if unit is equal to f we will use the formula to convert fahrenheit to celsius if it's c celsius to fahrenheit and we should probably add an else statement as well okay let's actually test these right now okay this will only be temporary i'm going to print a message the temp is currently in celsius and with fahrenheit the temperature is currently in fahrenheit so if the user did not type in c or f well then what the heck did they type in so within our else statement let's yell at the user let's say that whatever they entered in is not valid input so format specifier c is not a valid unit of measurement and then we will display whatever the user typed into our unit variable so let's test this is the temperature in f or c so f the temp is currently in f let's try it again is the temperature in f or c see the temp is currently in c okay this time we will not type in f4c how about the word pizza this only accepts the first character p is not a valid unit of measurement here's one situation that we may run into c programs are case sensitive if i type in lowercase f or lowercase c well technically neither of these conditions would be true for example if i type lowercase c c is not a valid unit of measurement to avoid that problem i can take my user input and use the two upper function to make it uppercase or you could set these conditions to check for lowercase characters instead and use the two lower function uh so let's take our unit variable and i'm going to reassign it after using the two upper function and then pass in our unit to make it uppercase and now if i type in lowercase c or lowercase f this user input will be made uppercase the temp is currently in c so this is optional but i thought it'd be a good thing to add to this program now what we'll work on next depending on the unit there's going to be a different formula a different calculation now we will need the user to enter in the current temperature so let's begin with our if statement if unit is equal to c celsius enter the temp in celsius this time we are accepting a floating point number we will use scanf the format specifier for floating point numbers address of operator temp and then we need to calculate the new temperature after it's converted from celsius to fahrenheit and we will reassign it into the same variable temp temp equals and here's the formula temp times 9 divided by 5 plus 32 and then let's print the temperature print f the temp in fahrenheit is and i'm going to use a format specifier percent f but i would only like to display one digit after the decimal so i will add dot one and then we will insert our temperature temp okay let's try this enter the temperature in f or c currently we only have the celsius portion set up so see enter the temp in celsius how about zero degrees celsius the temp in fahrenheit is 32.0 okay so we know that it's working let's fill out our else if statement else if unit is equal to f and let's copy some of this enter the temp in fahrenheit we will reassign our temperature variable temp equals and here's the formula temp minus 32 times five and we will divide all of this by nine then let's display the temperature in celsius the temp in celsius is our format specifier then the temp variable is the temperature in f or c this time it is in fahrenheit enter the temp in fahrenheit so 32 degrees in fahrenheit should translate to zero degrees celsius which it is so yeah everybody i thought that would be a useful practice program for us to get used to accepting user input i'll post all of this code from this program in the comments section down below if you would like a copy so if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
