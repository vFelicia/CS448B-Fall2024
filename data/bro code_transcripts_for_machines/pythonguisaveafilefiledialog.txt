hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use python's file dialog to save a file someplace on your computer so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody so this is how we can save a file we're going to be reusing a file dialog again kind of like what we did with the video on opening and reading a file so from tk enter import file dialog we're going to be creating a window and adding a button as well as a text area to this window so let's create our window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop let's create a button so button equals button let's set the text of the button so text equals save it's going to be a safe button and then a command so we'll need to link a function to this command so let's create a save file function and then we need to pack this button so button dot pack now let's create a text area this is just called text so text equals text we're going to add this to the window and we need to pack this text so text dot pack and now let's create a save file function so at the top of our program d e f save file and then we're going to take file dialog and use the ask save as file function and we're going to store the contents within file file equals file dialog dot ask save as file let's run this just to test it out so we have our window a save button and this is our text area we can type in multiple lines of text yay and let's try and save this just to see what we have so far so this will bring me to my desktop it might bring you someplace else for your computer uh so i'm just going to save this as test file now with this drop down menu save as type there's nothing set up so we'll need to do that manually if we were to save this and here's that test file on my desktop so let's take a look at the properties we did not list a file extension so the type of file just says file so we'll get to that later on in this video and if we were to open this with a program like notepad well it's currently empty that's because we need to write some text to this file so let's do that next let's store all of the text from our text area to a variable let's call this variable file text file text equals and then we need to get all of the text from our text area so text dot get and we're going to list the starting index as well as the ending index for this function so we're going to begin at 1.0 that is the beginning of this text area and the ending we can just put end and then we need to convert all of this into a string so let's surround this with str and then we can store all of the text from our text area within this variable file text and now we just need to write our text to this file so file dot right and we're going to pass in file text and then it's a good idea to close your files when you're done using them so file dot close and let's try this again hello my name is bro let's save this i'll call this hello and click save and we still can't save stype so we'll work on that next let's go to my desktop here's the test file that we created i'm going to open this with notepad and it has all of the text that we added to that text area now let's list some available file extensions that we can have the user save this file as so let's begin by setting the default extension so default extension and let's set this to a text file that is dot txt and then we can list all of the available file types so file types and we're going to place these within a set of straight brackets and i'll just separate these line by line so let's begin with a plain text file so this will take two strings the first is the message that will appear within that save as type drop down menu so let's place text file and the second string the file extension and that is dot t x t then let's add another let's say html so i'm going to copy this and paste it and let's say html next dot html and then lastly you can do just all files so all files and that is dot asterisk and let's try this again so hello my name is bro i like pizza and ice cream and this time i think i'll save this as an html file and this is we'll call this pizza and ice cream i guess and click save now let's go back to my desktop here's that file pizza and ice cream and it is an html file let's just verify that yep.html for the type of file so we can open this with notepad and it has all of the text i could even open this with sublime text as well kinda like that all right let's change the initial directory for saving a file let's change it to my project folder for uh this python file that we have so that is and i'm just going to organize this a little bit initial d i r equals and then we can list a file path so i'm just going to copy this so copy path paste it then i want to make sure that these are double backslashes and i need to add a comma at the end okay let's try this again so testing one two three and this should go to my project folder which it does testing one two three and let's save this as a plain text file click save and here's that plain text file testing one two three another option available to you is that you don't necessarily need to use a text area to get some text to write to a file you could use the console window to accept some text so to demonstrate this i'm going to turn this line into a comment and we're instead going to use the console window this time so we'll say file text equals input and then let's just have a prompt here enter some text i guess and then let's run this again so we still need to click this save button and select a file location i'll just save over our file testing123 i'll click save yeah i'll replace it alright so we need to enter some text i guess so i will write a message such as the cake is a lie and hit enter so then our file testing123 now says the cake is a lie so you don't necessarily need to use the get function for a text area you can use the console window as well here's one last thing to consider before you go so what if we begin the process of finding a file location to save a file to and then we exit out of this window well we're going to encounter an exception so one way that we can prevent this is to add this line if file is none return so then if we were to try this again begin saving a file and then exit out of this there is no exception that we encounter so that's just one little extra i thought i would throw in but yeah that's the basics of saving files in python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to save a file using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
