why hello again everybody today I need to explain a raise in PHP think of an array as a special type of variable which can hold more than one value at a time in my example I have four different variables food one food two food three food four we have an apple orange banana coconut it can be very inconvenient to have to work with so many variables it would be really nice if I could store all of these values in one place which is what we can do with an array let's delete these variables we will create a special type of variable which is an array to create an array you'll need a variable name to begin with let's say Foods Foods equals to create an array type array add a set of parentheses then the semicolon at the end this is a function which we'll discuss more in the future whatever values you're going to squeeze into this variable just place them within the parentheses we had four variables Apple orange banana coconut separate all of your values with the comma there we go we now have what appears to be a variable but it's technically an array it stores more than one value in one convenient place if I was to Echo my array which I named Foods this is what happens warning a rate to string conversion we can't directly print this array instead you would need to access one of the elements an element is a given position within an array currently we have four elements because there's four values to access one of the elements found within your array after the array name add a set of square brackets then an element number with the raise the first element has an index of zero I would like the first element within my array so the element is going to be zero that will display Apple which is the first element in my array let's do this with the others for practice let's Echo Foods at index one I should probably add a line break so let me do some string concatenation real quick I'll add a line break do that here as well we have apple Orange let's do this with the others Foods at index 2 is banana Foods at index three that would be coconut what if I attempt to access an element that doesn't exist we only have four elements if I access our array Foods at index 4 well then we have a warning undefined array key for that is something you do need to pay attention to if you need to display all of the elements of an array there's an easier way of doing this instead of echoing every single element line by line we can use a for each Loop for each add a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces for each take your array Foods as now what we need is a temporary name for each element within the array my personal naming convention if I'm accessing a single element within an array I like to take the array name and set the variable name to be the singular version if we're working with Foods well each element is considered a food for every food in foods if we were working with different values let's say cars my for each Loop may be for every car in Cars but that's just my naming convention So within this for each loop I will Echo each food then I'll add a break line okay let's see what happens here are all the elements in our array to display all of the elements in your array a convenient way to do so is to use a for each Loop there are a lot of useful utilities related to arrays to change one of the elements of an array type the name of the array then we'll list an index number I would like to change the first element in this array to be a pineapple type the name of the array followed by a set of square brackets the first element in my array is zero I will set that to equal a new value Foods at index 0 is now a pineapple pineapple orange banana coconut there is a push function which will add a new element to the end of your array array underscore push function within the set of parentheses type in the name of your array comma then a value at the end of my array I would like to add a pineapple Apple orange banana coconut pineapple you can add more than one value too let's add a kiwi as well Apple orange banana coconut pineapple kiwi that is the array push function you can add one or more elements to the end of your array after you create one then we have the pop function array underscore pop pop will remove the last element in your array place your array name within the set of parentheses array pop Foods now we have apple orange banana our last element coconut was removed then we have shift array underscore shift shift will remove the first element in your array then shift all of the elements over by one within the set of parentheses list your array name we now have an orange banana coconut our Apple was removed it was shifted shifted out of the array we can reverse an array array underscore reverse place your array name within the set of parentheses now this isn't going to work I'll explain why our array is still in the same order Apple orange banana coconut this function returns a new array we can assign the result to a new array such as reversed Foods equals the array reverse function then I could display this our array is now reversed coconut banana orange Apple otherwise the array that's returned we can reassign it to the same array which is what I'll do that does the same thing if you would rather reuse the same array that is how to reverse an array we can count the elements in an array I will Echo use the count function place your array name within the function let me cut this real quick we have four elements within our array use the count function to get the current number of elements within your array all right everybody so that's an array think of it as a special type of variable that can hold more than one value at a time it's a convenient way to store multiple values that are similar or related in place of creating many different variables it's a lot easier to work with an array than several variables and well everybody those are arrays in PHP
