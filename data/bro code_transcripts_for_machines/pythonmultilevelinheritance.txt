yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how multilevel inheritance works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right welcome back everybody let's talk about multilevel inheritance this is a concept where a derived class also known as a child class inherits from another derived class here's an example let's say we have a hierarchy of classes there will be three levels to this we'll create a family tree of living organisms so at the very top we're going to have a class called organism any class that inherits from the organism parent class will receive one attribute one variable named alive and this will be set to true so if you are an organism you begin by being alive now let's say we have a child class that will inherit from the organism parent class let's say animal class animal inherits from organism so any animal that we create will have this alive attribute set the true and all animals eat so let's define a function that does that at least i believe all animals eat let's pretend that they do so this animal is eating and now why stop there let's create a class for a specific type of animal i like dogs so let's create a dog class class dog inherits from the animal class and all dogs should be able to bark so let's create a function to do that and we'll print this dog is barking okay so what we just did here is multilevel inheritance we had a derived child class inherit from another child class so it's kind of like this dog class is the child animal class is the parent and then the parent of the parent class would be like a grandparent right and then if you added another layer on top of that to this hierarchy well then the parent of the grandparent would be like a great grandparent that's how i think of it at least now let's create a dog object just to verify that everything's working so let's call our dog dog and our dog object should have access to an attribute named alive and our dog object receives that attribute from the organism class and this will print true if i were to print whatever this attribute contains and our dog should be able to eat because it receives this method from the animal parent class and lastly our dog should be able to bark and that method is defined within its own class so that's how multilevel inheritance works it's a concept where a child class will inherit from another child class i like to think of it like a family tree where a child class will have a parent and the parent of that parent would be like a grandparent basically so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how multilevel inheritance works in python
