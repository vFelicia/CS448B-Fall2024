hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all a few different ways in which we can format output in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody here's a few different ways in which we can format output in c sharp as we covered in the last video to display something to our console window we would type console.writeline then you need a set of parentheses then a semicolon at the end you place your message within the parenthesis this is known as a method and we have a semicolon at the end the semicolon is kind of like the period at the end of a sentence when we finish a statement in programming we end it with a semicolon so to display a message within double quotes you would type something so this is known as a string literal we're literally printing something to our console so we kind of covered this in the last video this will display the word hello now there's another way in which we can display output that is just right console dot right parentheses semicolon and within quotes let's display something else what about hey now let's take a look at the difference between the two all right we have hey immediately followed by hello all in the same line in the last video we used two right line statements each string literal had their very own line but in this case it's all one line so with writeline after you finish your string literal it's going to hit enter like we're hitting the enter key and we'll move down to a new line right doesn't do that so you have two different ways in which you can display output to the console window right and right line write does not hit the enter key after the end it doesn't create a new line and right line does so you can use either one depending on what you need now there is a shortcut to create a writeline statement you type c then hit tab twice and that will auto generate a right light statement for you okay so the next topic to cover is comments we can add a comment to our code and this will not be displayed as output so to write a comment within your code you need two forward slashes and you can see that the color of our text changed to green so i'm going to tell you this is a comment and this has no effect on our output this comment will not be seen all we see here is hey and hello you can also write a multiline comment you would type forward slash asterisk this is a multiline comment then to end a multiline comment you would end it with asterisk then forward slash again and last but not least we have escape sequences we can add an escape sequence to a string to format our output so let's create a writeline statement and type whatever your name is okay now to create an escape sequence we need to add a backslash followed by a certain character depending on what character you select it's going to have a special effect on your string so if i typed backslash t that will add a tab escape sequence before displaying my name all right so we have a tab before my string so let's change this to maybe a backspace i'll add that here so backslash b that will add a backspace and my name is now br code alright so we can also do new line backslash and for new line so my first name is on one line and my last name is on a second line now you may have noticed that there's all this garbage at the end of my console window when my program is done running so one way in which we can hide that at the end of our program type console.read key so basically this will prevent our program from ending until we type a key and it should be hidden now so if i hit the enter key well then my program is going to finish running all right everybody so those are a few ways in which we can format output in c sharp if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well those are a few ways to format output in c sharp
