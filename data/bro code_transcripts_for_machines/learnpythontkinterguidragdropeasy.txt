hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can drag and drop widgets in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people let's just dive into this so we'll need a window and then we're going to be adding widgets to the window so window equals tk followed by window.main loop now you can drag and drop all sorts of widgets but let's just stick with the label because creating a label is simple so let's define a label label equals label we're going to be adding this label to the window and let's set a background color so we can actually see this label pick i don't know your favorite color i'm going to pick red and then i'm going to set a width and a height because normally if you have a label without any text it's really small so let's set a width of maybe 10 and then a height of 5. that should be good and we want to place this label someplace within the window so label dot place and we can pass in some x coordinates as well as y coordinates so x equals zero and y equals zero so that this is going to appear in the top left corner of our window so this is what we have this is our label and we want to be able to drag and drop this label someplace within the window what we're going to need to do is actually bind this label twice but let's begin with just the first binding so in order to bind a widget you type in the name of the widget followed by calling the bind function so this bind function can take two arguments it can take an event as well as a function name so for the function name let's call this drag underscore start but you don't really need to name it the same that i do and for the event that occurs this is going to be a left button click with the mouse so that event is within quotes and within angle brackets button dash one so if we were to click someplace within the label using the left mouse button it's going to call our drag start function but we need to define this so at the top of our program let's define this function def drag start and this takes one parameter the parameter we have is our event so what we're going to do is actually get the coordinates of where we click within this label and we're going to assign these to a new variable or attribute of our label so label dot let's create an attribute called start x equals our event dot x so this is where we click within the label and not necessarily the window and let's repeat the process for y so label dot start y equals event dot y so we're going to have some coordinates of where we click within this label and we can actually use that for our next function so we're going to bind this label a second time so i'm going to copy this line and paste it the second binding let's say is drag underscore motion for the function name and this event is going to occur if we were to hold down the left mouse button and then drag so that is b one dash motion and then we need to define this function so at the top d e f drag underscore motion and this takes our event as a parameter so this part is going to be a little funky we're going to get or create new x and y coordinates so let's begin with x x equals the name of our label or widget label dot w info underscore x this is a function so add some parentheses this will get the top left x coordinate of our label relative to the window that we're in minus label x well labeled.startx plus event dot x all right so we're going to do the same thing for y well we're going to replace x with y for the second line all right so this is the top left corner the x coordinate of our widget relative to the window this is the place where we click within the label itself and this is where we begin dragging our widget to it's a little difficult to explain but if you can combine all of these together you'll get the new coordinates of where you want to drag this component this widget to so we need to replace this widget so label dot place x equals x and y equals y so then when you combine all of these together we have our widget and we can drag it and drop it someplace else within the window now wait a second what if we have more than one widget well with the way that our functions are written now they wouldn't be compatible with more than one widget just this label itself so what if we were to create a second label so i'm going to call this second label just label two so i'm just going to rename them and let's change the background color to maybe blue and i'm just going to place this somewhere else within our window so maybe where x is 100 and y is 100 and we'll need to bind label two as well so make sure to bind label two so we have label one binded it's just called label and the same thing with label two all right let's see what happens i'm going to attempt to drag label 2. the label 1 is moving that's because with our functions we stated we're getting the coordinates and we're storing them within the attributes of label 1 and not necessarily label two so in order to make these functions compatible with all widgets we can actually add one line of code widget equals event dot widget so this is going to get the widget of the event that we're dealing with and we're going to temporarily rename this as widget so now we're going to replace all instances of where we use label and replace it with widget so be sure to do the same thing too with drag motion and then we will need to add this line at the top of drag motion so now these functions are now compatible with any widget that we create and we should be able to drag and drop both widgets all right well that's the basics of dragging and dropping widgets in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of dragging and dropping widgets in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like
