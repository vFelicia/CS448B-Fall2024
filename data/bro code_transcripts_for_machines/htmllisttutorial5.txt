hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here and in this video I'm gonna teach you guys all about making lists using HTML let's get into it in this video I'm gonna explain three different types of HTML lists they are unordered lists ordered lists and description lists each has their own specific tags for example unordered list uses a pair of ul tags for unordered list ordered list uses a pair of olt eggs for ordered list and description list has a pair of diello tags for a description list and then I'll give you guys a bonus at the end of how you can make a nested list which is basically a list inside of a list but that'll make more sense near the end of the video let's begin by creating an unordered list so this is useful if you need to make it list and the order really doesn't matter and I'm thinking a perfect example of us using an unordered list is a grocery shopping list you don't need to buy items within a certain order on a grocery shopping list so if we need to make an unordered list we need to use a pair of ul tags so we need a closing tag and an opening tag all right so for each item that you want to add to this list you need to make a list item so just type in Li then the item that you want to add to this list let's say that we want buy ingredients from the grocery store to bake a pizza well one ingredient that we could use is dough or bread so we could say bread dough work with me guys alright so the next time we can add to the list is perhaps tomato sauce and then make sure you close each of these list items as well alright and then let's add some cheese so list item cheese and then let's close this and how about one more list item how about a topping how about peppers personally I don't like peppers on my pizza but a lot of people do alright so let's save this refresh the page and here is our list and by default these are all bullet so that's pretty cool right you can also add a heading or title to this list so let's use perhaps an h3 heading and you need a closing tag for this and we'll say grocery list let's save this refresh the page and it says grocery list and notice that all the items in this list are indented so before we get too ahead of ourselves I'm just going to add a note in my HTML document that just states that this is an unordered list so I'll post all the code that I have in the comments down below so feel free to copy this but I'm just gonna leave a comment in case anybody's curious actually having the name of grocery list probably wasn't the greatest idea cuz I don't want to confuse anybody grocery shopping cart might have been better but I'll just keep it alright guys so there's a CSS style that I'd like to introduce to you guys at this level I know that we're in an HTML tutorial and we're going to cover CSS later but this is actually the perfect time to introduce a CSS topic involving designing lists and changing the bullet points so don't tell anybody that I'm introducing some CSS topics at this level just keep it a secret between us ok all right so if you want to change these bullet points to something else you have a few options so what you're gonna do in the opening tag for the unordered list type in style equals and then you need a set of double quotes and this is what we're gonna type in within the double quotes list style type colon now we have a few options to pick from I'll show you the first the first is circle so all of these disks will become empty circles another is square so let's save this refresh the page and all of these are now squares you can also put none in here if you want no bullet points whatsoever although I do prefer some sort of bullet points and the original by default is disk so that is the original bullet point that we had so that's the basics of an unordered list next I'll show you guys ordered lists and it's going to be a similar process to this so first let's create a heading so how about we create a heading such as a todo list and remember with ordered lists the order does matter so I'll give you an example let's just create a title for this list actually better yet let's call this my todo list all right so if we want to create a ordered list you need to use the OLT egg which is short for ordered lists then we need a closing tag and it's going to be a similar process where we want to add an item to this list we need to use the Li tag list item so we need to type in Li and add a closing tag all right so what's first I might to do list for today well personally for me I need to record a YouTube video let's save this refresh the page and here's my todo list and it has number 1 by default for the first item in your ordered list so remember that the order does matter so let's create another item so li for list item and next on my todo list is go work out then let's close this and here it says number 2 on my todo list is to go work out and let's add one last one Li for list item and the last thing on my todo list for today is bake a pizza let's save this refresh the page and number three is to bake a pizza now we also have the capability to change the markings for each of these list items within an ordered list so what we'll do for the opening ordered list tag we'll type in type equals and then within double quotes we have a few options so we could say capital and this will change our list to the letters of the alphabet all capitalized otherwise you can change this to lowercase a save this and all of these are now lowercase there's also Roman numerals so we can use capital I and these are Roman numerals now I forgot the name of this lowercase I these are I believe lowercase Roman numerals don't quote me on that I can't quite remember and the default is just one where you have basically a numbered list starting from 1 and you can also start from a different number as well let's say that you want to begin this list with the number 100 for some reason and count up from there so what you'll do is within the opening Oh well tag you'll type in start equals and then within double quotes the number that you want to start at so if we want to start at 100 for some reason we'll just type in 100 here save this refresh and our first item in this list starts at 100 the number we specified and each list item this number will increment by 1 for each list item and if you change type to a different symbol or numbering system let's say that we go back to Roman numerals and save this and refresh the page we have a different symbol for our Roman numerals and I believe the letter C is 100 so this would be 100 101 and 102 actually what would happen if we went back to the alphabet I'm actually kind of curious oh so you get double letters that's kind of cool but you know what I don't like that so let's go back to what we had originally where type is just 1 and let's get rid of this start attribute here but just so you know you have the capability of starting at a certain number or in this case like Roman numeral or whatever you're using for your list all right so let's save that refresh this and we go back to our numbered list so what I'm gonna do is just leave a note that says this is an ordered list and we'll move on to description lists then alright so description lists sometimes they're also referred to as definition lists basically it's a list of terms or items with a description for each specific item so what we'll do is that will create another heading and how about we create a list of web development languages mostly because I kind of ran out of ideas so what we'll type in here is web dev languages then a closing tag and then I'm going to copy this comment and change this to description list all right so with description lists you need a DL tag short for description list and a closing tag all right so there's going to be one change compared to the other lists that we worked with instead of using Li for list item what you're going to type instead is DT for description term or definition term you might hear people call it and then you need a closing tag as well for this all right so let's think of a few web development languages we have HTML we also have DT then you need a closing tag CSS and then lastly DT Java Script except I spelt it wrong all right let's save this and check this out so far all right here is our heading and then we have three items three description terms within our description list now if you want to add a description after each of these items in your description list what you'll do after each pair of these DT tags is add another set of tags the DD tag no that doesn't mean designated driver it actually is short for description details or sometimes known as definition details so we'll type in a closing tag for this as well so what we'll add in here is description that we want to add for our HTML list item so or definition term so what we'll type in here you can type in whatever you want here basically but I think I'll type in something that describes what HTML does so I'll say adds structure to web page let's save this and see if it works yeah and we have a description for this definition term or a description term so let's do the same thing for the other terms in our list in our description list so we'll type in D D for description details and then for CSS this adds style to web page then we need to close this and then JavaScript D D and a closing tag adds functionality to web page all right let's save this refresh and here we have a description for each term in our description list so that's basically how description lists work okay it's time for that bonus round so these are the basic types of listen HTML unordered lists ordered list and description lists so there's a concept of a nested list which is basically a list that's inside of another list and you can apply this to any type of list for example I'm going to copy our unordered list the grocery list and I'll show you an example of a nested list so what I'll do is change the description for unordered list two example of a nested list maybe I'll call this grocery list 2.0 alright so let's say that I want to add a bunch of different toppings so what I can do is that I'll change peppers to toppings all right so between the list item tags I can actually create an entirely new list within these two list item tags so I can do any sort of type a list here so let's say I want another unordered list within here well you can actually do that so let me make a closing tag for this too all right so we have our list item for toppings and then we're gonna put tags for an unordered list between here then we're going to add some list items so let's say that I want to add peppers for the first item so let's check this out just to be sure it works then so here grocery list 2.0 we have bread dough tomato sauce cheese toppings and then we have peppers underneath our toppings category or list item and you can see that it has a different type of marking or a bullet point so you can actually add a couple different list items and it will fall under this toppings list item so we'll say perhaps mushrooms let's save this try it out and we have mushrooms but I spelt that wrong and how about we add pepperoni I probably spelt that wrong too but sue me all right let's save that refresh the page and we now have pepperoni so basically a nested list is this concept of having a list that's already inside of another list and this nested list doesn't have to be the same type as the list that it's contained within for example I could change this to ordered list and this would work just the same all of these open circles would become numbers then so this video is becoming very long I'll give you a super quick conclusion you can create an unordered list a ordered list or a description list you can use the UL tag the Oval tag or the DL tag and for each item within the list you can use a list item tag to list it as an item within the list except for the description list you can use a DT tag short for description term and didi short for description details and then you can style these however you want to depending on what you put within the opening tag for that specific list and then a nested list is just a concept of having a list that's already inside of another list so if you guys would like a a copy of this HTML document I'll post it as a comment and pin it to the top then and if you guys are looking for a practice or a project to work on why don't you guys create your own unordered list ordered list description list and an example of a nested list and then post it in the comments down below but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started using lists in HTML heyyou if you enjoyed this
