hey everyone twodimensional arrays it's an array where each element is an entire array it's useful if you need a matrix grid or table of data let's begin by creating a simple onedimensional array of maybe some numbers so the data type is int the array name will be numbers and let's initialize this array with a few numbers one two and three something simple so if i would like to store a grid or matrix of data these elements will be the first row and i can add a second row so separate each row with a comma then another set of curly braces and then you can add more values so let's say four five and six and we'll stop here with these separate arrays we will surround with a set of curly braces and preceding the first set of straight brackets we will add a second set of straight brackets so this is now a two dimensional array however with a twodimensional array we have to specify a maximum size of elements within each of these arrays let's say that each of these arrays will have a maximum size of three elements a piece so within the second set of straight brackets i will list three and you can although it's not necessary set a maximum amount of arrays within your twodimensional array so let's say two because we have two separate arrays within our twodimensional array now to better visualize how this is more or less a table of data i'm going to rearrange these so this may be a better visualization this first set of straight brackets is for the number of rows and the second set of straight brackets is for the number of columns so we have two rows and three columns within our twodimensional array now you can declare a twodimensional array but not assigned values quite yet but you'll need to set a maximum size so right now i'm just going to turn this into one giant comment and let's declare a two dimensional array with two rows and three columns and here's how to assign some values we will type the name of the array followed by two sets of straight brackets we need a row number and a column number so the first column within the first row is going to be zero zero because computers always start with zero and let's assign this a value of one the second column within the first row would be zero one and let's assign two there then zero two and that will be number three so the first column within the second row would be numbers one zero and this will be four then we will follow the same pattern so where five was that would be one one and six is one two so this is another way to initialize an array you can set a maximum size and then assign some values later or you could assign all of the values right from the beginning if you know what they are okay now how can we display the elements of a twodimensional array we'll have to use nested loops so let's create a for loop and i will declare an index of i set the sql to zero and for the time being i'm going to say i is less than the number of rows that we have so right now we have two rows but we're going to change this value later to something that's more flexible that will calculate the amount of rows that we have and then i will increment i by one now let's create a nested loop that's in charge of keeping track of the columns and let's use an index of j because we do not want to reuse i so set j equal to zero we will continue this as long as j is less than however many columns we have three a maximum of three and then increment j by one so during each iteration of the inner for loop let's display one of these elements so we will use the format specifier for an integer d is fine followed by our array numbers and then we have two indices so the row is going to be i and this will begin at zero and the columns is j this will also begin at zero so after each iteration of the inner for loop we will increase j when we finish the inner for loop we will increment i by one so by using nested for loops we can iterate over all of the elements of this array so i'm just going to add a space after our number and we should probably add a new line after each row so i'll add a new line let's test this here we go we have our table of two rows and three columns now there's one situation that we may run into what if we change the amount of rows and columns that we have so let's say that we add one more row our 2d array of numbers will have three rows and three columns row two column zero equals seven row two column one will equal eight and row two column two will equal nine so if i were to run this again well this last row is not going to be displayed so it would be better if we can calculate how many rows and columns are within our twodimensional array and here's one way to do so i'm going to declare two new variables int rows and into columns and i will set the condition of the outer for loop to be as long as i is less than rows and the inner for loop will be j is less than columns now we just need to calculate what these numbers are going to be to calculate rows we can use the size of operator and then pass in the entire size of our twodimensional array and we're going to divide this by the size of one of our rows they're all going to have the same size so we can pass in our rain numbers and then specify one of the rows let's say the first row they're all going to be the same okay so that's how we can calculate the number of rows that we have now to find the number of columns we can copy what we have here and then just make a few changes so we will say the size of the first row row 0 divided by the size of one of the elements found within the first row so we can say zero zero and let's print the amount of rows and columns that we have just to test it so we have rows and columns i'm just going to add a new line character real quick okay so we have three rows three columns and here's our table three rows with three columns a piece so yeah that's basically a twodimensional array it's an array of arrays where each element is an entire array it's useful if you need a matrix grid or table of data and in this example we made a table of integers just the numbers one through nine so there's a couple different ways in which you can initialize a twodimensional array but you'll need two sets of straight brackets it's optional to set a maximum number of rows but it is necessary to set a maximum number of elements within each row and then to access one of the elements you use two indices one for the row one for the column so yeah those are two dimensional arrays if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are twodimensional arrays in c
