hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use the entry widget in python to accept some user input so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's discuss the entry widget what this is is that it's a text box that accepts a single line of user input a comparable example would be let's say that you're logging into a website with your user information and password well those text boxes that you enter your information into and hit submit could be an example of something similar to an entry widget for python so before we begin make sure you have this import at the top and then we'll create a window to add this entry widget to so we'll create a window called window window equals tk and then window.main loop to actually display this let's just test this yes it's working so in order to create the entry widget we'll create a name for this instance of the entry widget so let's just call this entry entry equals entry and we don't necessarily need to pass in any arguments at this time and then we're going to either pack this entry or place it on the window so entry and let's just use pack for now so this should display our entry widget however you can barely see it and it kind of blends in with the background but you can still type in something all right so let's mess with some of the configurations for this entry widget so let's begin by changing the font size so we can do that by typing in entry dot config font equals and then we can mess with the font style or the font size so i think i'll pick ink free but pick whatever font you want and then a size so font size 50 and let's try this again that's a little bit better let's type in something bro code blah blah blah all right not too bad so let's change the background color now well there's not really any good reason to but you can so let's try it entry dot config bg for background color then you can always list a name like black you know blue red whatever you want uh but let's pick a hexadecimal value so you can always look those up i will pick all ones so that looks something like this so let's type in something again but you can barely see the text so let's change the foreground color so that is done with fg entry dot config fg for foreground and i will pick green so the hexadecimal value for that is 0 zero f f zero zero otherwise you can just put something like green here and that works just fine too but make sure you take out the number sign and let's try it again bro i think i'll make this a very bright green though because that's kind of dull uh so that's zero zero ff zero zero and let's try it again what up bro all right that's not too bad let's also insert some text so this is some default text so we can do that with entry dot insert we'll place a positional argument we'll start with zero and then we can enter in some default text like spongebob so then when we run this the default text says whatever we type here so now it says spongebob but i think i'll remove that for now you can also disable this text box as well so we can do that with entry dot config state equals disabled so we can no longer type in anything within this entry text box so i'll add a comment that this is either active or disabled but i'll turn this into a comment because we still got a lot more to do with this we can also set a width so this width is in number of characters so that is entry dot config width and let's set the max to maybe 10. so this doesn't cap or max out the number of characters that you can type in it's just really for the size of the entry box so it's only going to display a max of 10 characters at once but let's test it out so one two three four five six seven eight nine zero all right so if we type in more numbers than that more than ten it's going to kind of scroll through the numbers but yeah i'll keep it at time that's fine oh i got a good one for you guys so this next one is entry dot config show show equals a certain character so let's set this to asterisk so this will hide all of the characters within the text box and it's going to replace them with whatever character you have here so this would work perfect for some sort of password so if i were to type in something it's only going to display whatever character that we have here so this works perfect for a password so we can actually change this to it doesn't necessarily have to be an asterisk let's replace this with the dollar sign so when we type in something it's only going to display as whatever character we placed here so that's how you can create a hidden password of some sort now what good is an entry text box if we can't actually submit something so let's create a submit button so make sure you've seen the video on buttons for python before you dive into this portion so let's create a button we'll call this submit it's going to be a submit button so submit equals button we're adding this to our window and let's set the text text equals submit and then we're going to set the command for this to equal submit so we're going to create a function called submit uh so we'll do that right before we create this window i think so d e f submit what do we want this button to do when we click it so we'll create a variable maybe username equals and then to retrieve the text from a entry widget we type in the name of the widget entry dot get so this retrieves the text that we entered in and stores it within a variable called user and then let's just print this print user name all right and then we need to add the button to the window so we can just simply do that with pack submit dot pack and let's take a look alright so this button is on the top we can actually change uh the position in which it's in so within the parenthesis of pack what we can do is place this on a particular side so let's say that we want this on the right side so side equals right and that's a little bit better let's type in a name like bro hit submit and it displays our name in the console window here's a crazy idea when we print our username let's concatenate this with another string so maybe we can display hello before the username so hello plus username so type in whatever your name is bro submit and it says hello bro pretty cool right now let's create a delete button so honestly we'll just copy all this that we have for our submit button and we'll change submit to delete and we'll change the text here as well to delete and the command to delete so we'll make a delete function so delete delete delete delete then let's create a delete function so def delete all right so to delete the text in an entry widget we can do entry dot delete we place two positional arguments within here so we want to clear everything with this delete button so the first positional argument is going to be zero the second is going to be end and what this does and i'll just make this a comment is that this deletes the line of text and we'll set this to the right side right next to the submit button and let's test this my name is bro something and we're going to delete this and everything is cleared out and even if we hit submit it doesn't really do anything it just displays hello let's create a backspace button so we'll copy this we'll change delete to backspace we're only going to delete one character at a time and that character is going to be at the very end of our string of text so backspace backspace text equals backspace and command backspace and we'll create a backspace function so we'll do that at the top d e f backspace all right so this is going to get a little bit tricky entry dot delete and we're going to place two positional arguments the second is going to be end because we want to delete the last character in our line of text and the first character the first positional argument is going to be entry dot get basically what we have here except we're going to take the length of this place this all within parentheses and then subtract one and this will delete last character and now let's test this so we have backspace delete and submit let's type in our name so for me that's bro code then when i hit backspace it only deletes the last character however the delete button will still clear everything and then for the last time let's check submit so bro code then submit hello bro code cool so all of our buttons are now working well ladies and gentlemen that is the basics of the entry widget for python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the entry widget for python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down
