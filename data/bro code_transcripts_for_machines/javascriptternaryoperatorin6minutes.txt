hey uh welcome back so today I'm going to explain the Trenary operator in JavaScript you write a condition then add a little question mark kind of like you're asking a question how is this useful well it's a shortcut to if and else statements it helps to assign a variable based on a condition you write a condition then use the ternary operator as if you're asking a question you can write some code if that condition is true what would you like to do then add a colon then some code if that condition is false here's an example let's say we have a user's age age equals 21. I would like to check to see if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 18. age greater than equal to 18 then I will use the ternary operator kind of like I'm asking a question is age greater than or equal to 18 if this condition is true we can write some code I'll create a string you're an adult then what if the condition is false I'll add a colon then I will execute this code if the condition is false you're a minor this is helpful if you need to assign a variable based on a condition so I'll create a new variable let message equals then we write our condition so if age is greater than or equal to 18 if that's true we will assign this string to this variable this message if it's false instead we will assign this one it's an alternative to writing something like this so with programming we try not to repeat ourselves if we don't have to here we're assigning message to be either this string or this one our ternary operator is more condensed and I feel like it's easier to read than that if else statement it's a shortcut if you choose to use it I tend to use it a lot then just to test it let's console.log our message just to be sure that it works fine console.log our message our age is 21 you're an adult if my age was 12. you'll remind her let's go over a few more exercises this time we will have let time time will be between 1 and 24 like a 24 hour clock I will set time to be 16. 16 I think would be 4 P.M we will assign a greeting equals then we'll write a condition is time less than 12. the enternary operator like we're asking a question if the time is less than 12 it's the morning good morning we'll use a colon then write some code if it's false if it's not the morning it's at least the afternoon good afternoon then let's console.log our greeting good afternoon because it's 4 P.M what if it was 9. good morning all right I have a few more examples foreign student this will be true or false if you're a student let message equals now with the Boolean variable you can just write the Boolean variable itself is student question mark are you a student if so you are a student if not you are not a student then let's console.log our message we are a student you are a student let's set this to be false you are not a student it's very easy to read with Boolean variables you write the Boolean variable then add a question mark here's a challenge round we will have a purchase amount as if somebody's buying something if somebody's purchase amount is over one hundred dollars they get a 10 discount so let purchase amount equal let's say 125 dollars or some other unit of currency of your choosing let discount equals then the condition is we're checking if purchase amount is greater than or equal to 100 100 question mark is somebody's purchase amount greater than one hundred dollars if so they will get a 10 discount colon if that's false they get no discount zero so then let's display the total console.log I'll use a template literal your total is I need a dollar sign for our unit of currency then I need a placeholder so I need another dollar sign the purchase amount minus the purchase amount multiplied by let me scoot over a little the discount divided by 100 so the total since we get a discount is one hundred twelve dollars and fifty cents if our purchase amount was ninety nine dollars well we don't get that discount your total is 99. all right everybody so that's the Trenary operator it's a shortcut to an if else statement it helps to assign a variable based on a condition you write a condition add a question mark as if you're asking a question do this code if that condition is true else do this code if that condition is false I'll be using the ternary operator a lot just because I feel like it's helpful and well that is the ternary operator in JavaScript
