hey guys in this topic i'm going to explain overloaded functions in c plus plus and actually with many other programming languages you can have different versions of the same function here's what i mean i have a function to bake a pizza because well i like pizza bake pizza this function will have no parameters all i'm gonna do within this function is display the words here is your pizza then i'll add a new line uh then i should probably add a declaration at the top void baked pizza then to invoke this function i would type the function name here is your pizza this time i would like to bake a pizza that has toppings right now we just have a plain pizza with no toppings and that's kind of lame i'm going to create an additional version of this baked pizza method but it's going to have different parameters void bake pizza we will accept a string standard string i'll name this string topping one we'll accept one topping as an argument standard output here is your i'll add my topping here topping one pizza then be sure to add your function declaration to bake pizza then this time we are accepting a string it is valid for functions to share the same name but you need a different set of parameters a function's name plus its parameters is known as a function signature i can bake a pizza that has no toppings here is your pizza or i could pass in a topping like pepperoni here is your pepperoni pizza let's create an additional function that accepts two toppings so we have topping one topping two here is your topping one and topping two pizza then add your function declaration topping one topping two now i can bake a pizza that has two toppings i would like pepperoni and mushrooms here is your pepperoni and mushroom pizza so yeah everybody those are overloaded functions functions can share the same name but you need a different set of parameters a function's name plus its parameters is known as a functions signature and each function signature needs to be unique kind of like an id so yeah those are overloaded functions if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah those are overloaded functions in c plus plus
