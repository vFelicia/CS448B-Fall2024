hey how's it going everybody today I need to explain the span and div tags in HTML the span tag is an inline container to group elements for styling purposes the div tag it's very similar except it's a block container to group elements for styling purposes here's an example let's create two H1 titles this is a span title then close it let's copy this line of markup then paste it the second line will be this is a div title I'm going to enclose my first sentence with a pair of span tags so we need an opening span tag and a closing span tag somewhere alright with this set of span tags we are enclosing this text within a container it's an inline container we can apply some CSS styling to the sentence whatever is sandwiched between the pair of span tags let's change the background color of the title I will set the style attribute to equal background Dash color then pick a color how about red than a semicolon there so the background of my title is red but you know what that red is a little bright let's do tomato I think that's a better color whatever is enclosed with a pair of span tags we can apply some inline CSS styling too now with div this creates a block level container so I will surround this sentence with a pair of div tags div meaning division let's apply that same styling I'll copy my style attribute paste it let's change the color to B maybe cyan alright here we are this is a title using span this is a title using div span is an inline container div is a block level container it takes the entire width of my document you can see that this is all blue let's create a pair of paragraph tags this is a span sentence then close it let's copy this paragraph paste it again then change the second sentence to div all right let's enclose our first sentence with a pair of span tags all right I will set the style to be red well tomato tomato color technically it's kind of like we're highlighting the text much like the mark tags in the last topic let's copy this tag change span to div then the color how about cyan and then we need to close the div tag there we are all right now let's create two large paragraphs we need a pair of paragraph tags in vs code to generate some sample text you can type lorem then tab so I will copy this line paste it again let's say after the first sentence I would like to add a background color so right here I will add a Spam tag an opening span tag then where would I like to close it let's do so before the closing paragraph tag then I will change the background color all right we have highlighted the second sentence let's do this with div tags now with our next paragraph let's create an opening div tag then we'll need to close it somewhere let's close it before the closing paragraph tag and then I will change the background color within the opening div tag I will set the background color to be cyan what we have done is created a block level element for the second sentence within our paragraph basically speaking we can use the span and div tags to group together HTML for styling purposes span is an inline container div is a block level container we'll be using these more when we reach CSS and well everybody those are the span and div tags in HTML
