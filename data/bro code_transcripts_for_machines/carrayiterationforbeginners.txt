all right guys in this video i'm going to show you how we can iterate over the elements of an array suppose we have an array of students these will be strings standard string i'll name this array students set the sequel to some student names pick a few spongebob patrick then squidward suppose i would like to display all these students normally to do that i would type standard output my array followed by an index number so the first student would be spongebob which has an index of 0 and my first student is spongebob if i need to display all of the elements of this array i would have to one by one access each element then i'll just add a new line we have spongebob patrick and squidward if i need to display all of the elements of an array a better approach would be to use a for loop i'm going to type four parentheses curly braces we'll need an index int i i'll set this equal to zero because the first element in our array has an index of zero i'll continue this as long as i is less than the length of our array currently it's three increment i by 1. during each iteration i would like to display each element standard output students now instead of an index number like 0 1 2 or whatever i'm going to use my counter variable i students at index of i during the first iteration i will be 0 then 1 then 2 once we reach 3 we'll stop i'll add a new line this for loop will print the elements of my array spongebob patrick squidward there's one issue with this though what if we add another student such as sandy well this for loop will stop once i reaches three if we make any adjustments to this array we would have to go into our code and make some changes such as setting this for loop so that we discontinue when i reaches 4. this would work but it's not the best solution for our stopping condition in place of just setting i to be less than some number let's calculate how many elements are within this array to do that we can use the size of operator i'll type size of my array this will give me the total size in bytes of my array to calculate the number of elements i can divide size of students by the size of the data type string or even an element this will loop through all of the elements of this array spongebob patrick squidward sandy if we change the number of elements well then there's no need to touch this for loop it will calculate the size automatically see now we just have spongebob and patrick let's create one last example i'll create an array of grades char grades we have an a b c d then f if i need to iterate over this array of characters i would find the size of my array grades divided by the size of a character the character data type during each iteration i will display grades at index of i our counter and this will display all of the elements of this array so yeah that's how to iterate over an array using a for loop in the next topic i will explain the for each loop which has different syntax and well yeah that's how to iterate over an array using a for loop in c plus plus
