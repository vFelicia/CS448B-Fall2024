hey everybody today we will be discussing the server super Global variable it contains headers paths and script locations it's an associative array that's created by the web server it contains nearly everything you need to know about the current web page environment to access the super Global variable you type dollar sign underscore server then you can access one of the key value pairs so for this demonstration I'm going to create a for each loop we're going to iterate over all of the pairs all of the key value pairs let's take our server as key Arrow value then I will Echo each key value pair key equals value then add a line break let's take a look all right we have a lot going on here here are the key value pairs found within my server super Global variable we're still beginners a lot of this is more for advanced PHP developers I more or less just want to raise awareness that this exists two keys that we're going to be interested in are PHP self and request method phpself is the location of this page the request method is either get or post the default is get if we have an HTML form that has the method set to post after clicking the submit button the request method would equal post let me demonstrate how we can use phpself I am going to create an HTML form let me get rid of this for each Loop the name of my PHP file is index.php the action attribute of my form is set to index.php any information that's posted will be sent to my PHP script however if I were to change the name of this file let's rename our file as home well our action attribute isn't going to be updated I'm going to navigate to our home page localhost.website slash home if I were to type in my name then press submit we're sending our form data to a file that doesn't exist it would be kind of nice if we could update this automatically that's where our server super Global variable can come in in place of a file name let's write a PHP script within the set of quotes we are going to access the server super Global variable at the Key of PHP underscore self this key contains the value of the current file path for this file save and reload everything you may need to navigate to our home page because right now it's set to index okay type in a username press submit and that should work then if we update the name of this file let's rename it to um start I guess that's all I could think of at the moment okay let's navigate to start .php type in a username press submit and that works just fine that's how we can use phpself to get the current file name however with phpself it is vulnerable to something called The crosssite Script we learned about crosssite scripts on the topic of Sanitation and validation if you do use phpself I do recommend enclosing this variable within a filter one that I recommend is HTML special chars so be sure to enclose that 'll avoid any crosssite scripts just be aware that this is something you might see in the future in your own studies at least you know what it is now the other key that we're going to talk about is request method request method is either get or post so if I were to reload everything but not submit anything the request method by default is get so another way to detect if a form is submitted is to access the request method normally we're used to saying if is set then access post then we access our submit button one problem with this is that at least in older web browsers you can submit a form without hitting the submit button there's ways around that a more reliable solution is to take a look at that request method within an if statement let's access our server super Global variable we will take a look at our request method and see if this is equal to post if it is then let's Echo I don't know hello type in a username it doesn't really matter I guess hit submit and we will display hello in the future I would prefer if we stuck with this way of handling post requests just because it's more reliable alright everybody so that's a basic introduction to the server super Global variable they're still way more advanced stuff involving it but I thought I'll at least give you an introduction just so that it doesn't freak you out in the future we'll have a little bit more practice with this when we create our own login form and well everybody that is the server super Global variable in PHP
