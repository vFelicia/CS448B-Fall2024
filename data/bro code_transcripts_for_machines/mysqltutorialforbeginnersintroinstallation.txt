hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to show you how we can start writing SQL using the MySQL workbench so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's get started everybody SQL it's an acronym meaning structured query language SQL is used to create retrieve update and delete data from a database suppose we own a business like the Krusty Krab from SpongeBob if we had to manually track all of the transactions by pen and paper well that would be a lot of extra work if we had a database we could keep track of these records electronically and save ourselves a lot of trouble right there's two types of databases I'll discuss relational and nonrelational a table in a relational database it resembles an Excel spreadsheet there's rows and columns tables within a relational database can form well relationships with one another and that is done by this concept of keys which I'll explain in a further topic then there's nonrelational databases that's where our data is organized in any format but a table this could include Json files key value pairs graphed data structures entities of that nature to utilize data in a relational database we would use SQL then with a nonrelational database we would use a different language named nosql meaning not only SQL but since this is an SQL series we will be working with SQL and relational databases not nonrelational databases to write SQL statements we would need the help of a special piece of software known as a database management system people shorten this to Simply dbms it's a workspace for us to write SQL statements and generally just work with our database it'll make our lives easier there are different dbms systems you can use one of which is MySQL Microsoft SQL Server Oracle and postgres SQL but there's still many more out there each of these database Management Systems all use SQL but there's subtle nuances between these syntax of each database management system if you're familiar with one database management system transitioning to another will take little to no effort at all in this series we will be working with the mySQL database management system and I'll show you how to download that for both Windows and Mac OS hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain how we can download MySQL using the Windows operating system first of all head to this website mysql.com then go to the downloads tab scroll down look for MySQL Community downloads we'll click on that click on MySQL installer for Windows make sure that we have our Windows operating system selected then download the first installer no thanks just start my download we will open this download once it's complete there are various setup types depending on what packages you need for this series all we need is the server and the workbench we'll select the custom radio button click next we will need the most recent MySQL server add that to products to be installed open applications go to mySQL workbench we will add the most recent workbench we can close out of that there is a shell if you're interested in using that but I will be sticking with the workbench in this series once we have our server and our workbench I will click next then execute looks like there's an error downloading the workbench I'm going to try again and it worked this time for some reason let's click next execute give it some time once the installation status for the server and the workbench is complete we can click on next next I'll keep these default configurations next use strong password encryption for authentication let's click next here we're going to set the root password to access the server think of some password you would like I'm just going to set mine to be password I'll keep it simple yeah of course the password strength is weak you can add user accounts but that'll be outside the scope of this series click next you can start the MySQL server at system startup if you would like I'll keep that on click next then execute then finish then next yeah we might as well start the MySQL workbench after setup if this window doesn't pop up you can easily just search for it just look for MySQL workbench now we should have a local instance we can click on this to access our server let's pretend that this wasn't here I'm going to right click delete connection if you need to set up a connection hit this plus button we'll need a connection name I'll name this Local Host connection method should be standard TCP IP the host name is 127.0.0.1 at Port 3306 then press ok so now that we have our connection set up we can click on it type in the password you set for the server mine was simply password you could save the password if you want I might as well then okay and here we are within the MySQL workbench all right everybody in this topic I'm going to explain how we can download MySQL using the Mac operating system first head to this URL mysql.com we will go to the downloads tab scroll down look for MySQL Community downloads we'll need both the server and the workbench but let's start with the server click on this file Mac OS 12 DMG archive click the download button click on this link no thanks just start my download when this DMG archive is finished downloading we can double click on it just give it a second double click on the DMG archive allow click continue you can read the license agreement I'm going to pretend I did hit continue install type in your computer's password if this prompt comes up use strong password encryption hit next then we'll need a password for our server type in whatever password you would like to keep it simple for this lesson I'm just going to set my password to be well password by checking this box MySQL server will start once the installation is complete you might as well keep this checked but for demonstration purposes I'm going to show you how to start the server manually then close I'll go ahead and move the installer to the trash bin we have the server downloaded next we need to download the workbench again head to mysql.com go to downloads scroll down to mySQL Community downloads click on MySQL workbench then hit the blue download button no thanks just start my download then we can double click on this DMG archive when it's finished downloading so double click drag and drop the workbench icon into your applications folder before we access the workbench let's be sure that the MySQL server is running click on the top left Apple logo go to system preferences at the bottom left corner look for MySQL click on it then start MySQL server if it's not started already and you can check this checkbox so that your computer starts up with it running all right you may need to type in your password the server is now running to run the workbench we can go to finder then applications look for the MySQL workbench icon double click on it and here we are within the MySQL workbench to access the server you can click on this local instance connection then type in the password that you originally set for the server but if you're missing this connection you can hit the plus button then create a new connection name I'll name this Local Host use standard tcpip for the connection method hostname should be 127.0.0.1 and Port 3306 then press ok but I already have my connection set up click on your connection type in the password you set for the server then press OK and here we are within MySQL workbench
