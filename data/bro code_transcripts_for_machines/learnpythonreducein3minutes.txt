sup people today I'm going to talk about the reduced function the reduced function in Python reduces elements in a collection to a single value kind of like we're getting a sum we're adding everything together just so you know a for Loop tends to be better in most cases using the reduce function is an alternative it provides a more functional approach and has better readability honestly I prefer to use four Loops rather than the reduce function but you should still be familiar with both you'll understand the reduce function in case you run into it to use the reduce function we'll need to import it from the module a funk tools import reduce in this demonstration we will create a list of prices using the reduce function we will sum up all the prices together to give a total let's make up some numbers just type in whatever numbers come to mind these will all be prices here is my list of prices I will sum them all together using the reduce function with the result we will assign it to be total what is the total price that we're paying after adding all these prices together maybe this is a shopping cart program of some sort we will call the reduce function we have to pass in a function and a collection so for the function let's say we have a function to add x x will be the first parameter y will be the second then I will return x + y we will pass in the name of our function to add let me zoom in a little then we pass in our collection of prices then I will print my total I'll use an F string add a placeholder display my total then prefix this with the unit of currency such as American dollars here's my total $50.7 rather than defining a function I would rather pass in a Lambda function so let's delete our function and instead use a Lambda function to do so we will type that keyword of Lambda we have our parameters of X and Y what would we like to do we would like to add X and Y together and that should work too the total is $50.7 So this can get a little confusing with how this works X is going to be the first value y will be the second we're going to add them together we're returning the result and using it as the parameter for the next iteration by doing doing so we're going to reduce all these values into one single value all right everybody so that is the reduce function we reduce the elements in a collection to a single value there is a lot of overlap where you could use a for Loop or the reduce function honestly I still think a for Loop is better in most cases however the reduceed function gives a functional approach and it has better readability so if you see the reduce function you'll know that it reduces the elements in a collection to a single value and that is the reduce function in Python
