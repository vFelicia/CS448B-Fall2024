hello again everyone today I will be explaining functions in MySQL a function is a stored program that you can pass parameters into to return a value if you look on mysql's main website there is a huge comprehensive list of functions in this video I'll only be showing you a few of the more useful ones for beginners but just so you know there's a lot of functions out there that do all sorts of things what if I would like to count how many transactions took place on a certain date to do that we can use the count function select count parentheses within my set of parentheses I can place a column then calculate how many rows are within that column let's calculate amount we will count how many rows are within the column amount then we will need a table from our table transactions so you could add a where Clause too like where transaction date is on a certain date but I want to keep this video as simple as possible this function will return all of the rows within this column amount which is five we have five transactions within this table now this column header is kind of ugly the column name is count the amount column you could give a column an alias by adding as then some nickname let's say count it's not necessary but if you want to make the column header look pretty or rename it as something you could do that count five we could even rename this column as today is transactions that works too do whatever you want to do let's find you the maximum value of our column amount by using the max function within the set of parentheses pass in your amount column I will give this column an alias of maximum and that is the maximum amount the largest order was 4.99 there's also Min to find the minimum as minimum the smallest order was for one dollar you could do average which is AVG as average the average order is three dollars and 45 cents we can find the sum of a column by using the sum function as some the sum of all of our transactions was 17 and 25 cents for this next example we're going to concatenate the first and last name of our employees select all from employees we have two columns one for a first name the other for a last name we're going to combine these two columns together with the concat function then create a new column named full name here's how to do that select concat first name last name then I'll add an alias as ball name here's what we have so far so we are concatenating the first and last names of our employees uh however we should separate each name with the space within our concat function I'll add a space character surrounded with commas to separate each argument there that's much better so that is the concat function we can concatenate values together such as if you need a column for somebody's full name but yeah those are just a few functions there's still many more we haven't covered but these are a few of the beginner ones you may be interested in but yeah those are functions in MySQL
