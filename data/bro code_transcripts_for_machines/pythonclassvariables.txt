hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the basics of class variables in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm here's a super quick video on the differences between class and instance variables for this example let's say we have two car objects named car 1 and car 2 and i'm just passing in a bunch of values to each of these car constructors now within my class car i have my init method also known as the constructor and what i'm doing is assigning all of these values to the variables found within my car constructor these variables declared inside the constructor are known as instance variables and each object can have their own unique values assigned to each of these variables now where a class variable is different is that a class variable is declared inside the class but outside of the constructor and what we can do is set some default values for some variables let's say we would like to add an additional variable let's say wheels wheels equals and we can set a default value for all instances of this class for each car object that we create so we set wheels to equal four this is an example of a class variable whenever we create a car object we can pass in a unique make model year in color but by default they will all have four wheels now if i was to print the amount of wheels that car 1 and car 2 have they will both have 4 wheels it's as if we're setting a default value if i change this to two wheels well then these cars have two wheels maybe they're motorcycles or something now you can actually change these values each object will have their own copy of this variable but you can set it to a default value so let's say car one is a motorcycle car one dot wheels equals two so if i were to print car ones wheels along with car two car one will have 2 wheels but car 2 is still using that default amount of wheels which is 4. now there's another way in which you can access a class variable you don't necessarily need to create an object to do so you can just use the name of the class so what i'm going to do is turn all of these lines into comments and i will print the amount of wheels that our class has so type in the name of the class car with a capital c it should be the same name as your class name followed by the name of the class variable car dot wheels but make sure you spell it right all right so this will display for wheels now what if we decide to change the class variable through our class well that will affect all instances of our class so let's say car dot wheels equals two it's as if we change our mind and we have decided to create motorcycles instead of cars well if we were to change the wheels class variable through the use of our car class well then it's going to affect it for all instances of this class you can see that both car 1 and car 2 now have two wheels when we just changed car 1's wheels it did not affect car 2 at all so that's the main difference between a class variable and an instance variable an instance variable is declared inside of constructor and they can be given unique values with class variables they are declared within a class but outside of the constructor and you can set a default value for all instances of this class for all unique objects that are created and then you can change those values later too so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of class variables in python
