hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to be teaching you guys about 2dimensional array lists and Java so let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey everybody so we're gonna be discussing 2d array lists and what this is is that it's a dynamic list of lists it's a list of separate lists so you can actually change the size of these lists during run times so that's kind of an advantage of array lists over just standard arrays so before we begin make sure you have this import at the top and what I'm thinking for this video is that we're going to create separate shopping lists and at the end we're going to add these separate shopping lists to an ArrayList it's going to be a list of separate lists so let's create a ArrayList for maybe bakery goods like things we need to buy at the bakery at a grocery store so we'll create an ArrayList and then we need some angle brackets and then with array lists these store objects so we need to use the wrapper class of the data type that we're storing so for example if you need to store integers you're going to use the wrapper class of integer well let's store some strings because we're storing the names of things we need to buy so let's call this ArrayList Bakery list and we're going to set this equal to new array list alright let's add a few things to our bakery list so bakery list dot add and what do we want to buy it maybe some pasta and maybe two other things how about some garlic bread everybody loves garlic bread and doughnuts because I like doughnuts okay so we have an array list called bakery list and it has these three items we can actually display our bakery list by using a print line statement and we're going to place our bakery list within here and we have pasta garlic bread and donuts now if you want to retrieve a certain element of this list we use the dot get method and we specified index so zero would be pasta so let's create a few other lists so I'm just going to copy this and for the next list let's have this be a produce list so fruit and vegetables so produce list and we need to change this here as well so we'll change bakery list to produce list for this next ArrayList and let's add some Tomatoes and what goes the pasta maybe some zucchini and maybe peppers okay and then we'll just add one more so what about a drinks list so we'll change produce to drinks and let's say we only want two drinks so these lists don't have to be the same size as each other because they're all independent lists so let's say that we want soda and we want coffee and let's display our drinks list oh we should probably change this here as well so make sure you do that okay we'll display our drinks list which has just soda and coffee now we have these separate array lists one for each aisle of a grocery store well at least just a few of them so what we can do is actually add all of these separate lists to one list and we can call it maybe grocery list it will contain different lists of what we need to buy at the grocery store and they're all kind of organized by their section we have one for bakery goods we have one for produce and we have one for drinks so let's create a 2d array list to contain the separate array lists so what we're gonna type is array lists and then within the angle brackets we list the data type of what we want to store and what we want to store this time is array lists of strings so we're going to place this within angle brackets so array lists and within the angle brackets array list again and this store strings so we need a name for this 2d ArrayList and the name should be descriptive of what it contains so we'll just say grocery list because it contains separate lists of things we need to buy at the grocery store and they're all organized by section so grocery list equals new array list and then we need to add these separate array lists to our 2d array list so what we're going to do is take our grocery list and then we're going to add whatever lists that we want to add so we need to add our Bakery list and we're going to do the same thing for our produce list and our drinks list so we'll change bakery to produce and then lastly we need drinks so drinks list so then if we take our grocery list and then display this what we end up seeing is that we get the total sum of everything that's within our grocery list and they're all arranged by section or ArrayList you can see that they're all separated with a comma so it's a list of Lists now let's say that you want to retrieve just one list from this ArrayList well you can use the get function and then you can retrieve something by its index so let's say that we want the first list in this 2d ArrayList we're going to get index 0 and this will retrieve the first list now let's say that we want the first element of our first list we're going to add dot gap again and then the index for the element of this inner list so if you want the first element of the first list we type in dot get 0 and dot get 0 again and then when we run this we have pasta now if we want the last index so this is let's see this is list 2 item number 1 so all right get to item number one and this retrieves coffee so that's the basics of 2d array lists it's just a container for separate array lists you can do this with other collections too but we've only really covered array lists so if you want a copy of all this code I'll post this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to dimensional array lists work in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps
