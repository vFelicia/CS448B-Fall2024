hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be teaching you guys about buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running buttons you click them and then they do stuff that's pretty much it so before we begin make sure you have this import at the top so first we'll begin by creating a window so we can add this button to the window so we'll create an instance of a window called window equals tk parentheses and then we'll need to display this window by typing in window dot main loop so this will create a window for us however we'll create a button next to add to this window so let me think of a descriptive name for this button maybe something unique like button so button equals button parenthesis and then we're going to list the component that we're adding this button to we're adding this button to our window and then let's also set some text so the text equals maybe click me let's make this a very aggressive button by adding some exclamation points and then we're going to pack this button so we can add this button to the window so button.pack and let's try it here's our button it says click me but when you click it it doesn't do anything so we can link this button to a function in our program so we use the command property so button dot config and then we're going to say command equals and then a function name but first we'll need to create a function so let's define a function maybe i'll call this click and what do we want to do when we call this function let's say we want to print hello that's good enough so with command we're going to set this equal to the function name make sure you do not include the parentheses so make sure you don't write this but this so that's the proper way to do this so what this does is that it performs callback of function and let's try this here's our button when we click this button it displays hello cool let's customize this button so let's change the font so button dot config and i'm going to copy this because we'll be using this quite often font equals let's say ink free for the font style and then a size maybe 50. and i'll make this bold it's a very aggressive button let's change the background color so button.config bg for background color and we can place a hexadecimal value here so let's pick a color it's an aggressive button so let's do something like an orangish red color that'll work so i'm going to copy that place this value here there we are let's also change the font color so button.config this time it is fg for foreground color and for this color maybe a bright neon yellow of some sort so copy this value paste it here and the font of the text should change now when we click this button it's white and black so we'll want to change that too so there's different properties for those active background and active foreground so let's change those next so button dot config and first we'll change active background equals another value so i'll just pick red that is ff000 so when we click this button the background should now be red i think i'll change the font color after we click the button too because the default is black so this is active foreground and i will set it to be the same as our base foreground so it's this number there we go so the text is staying the same the same color but the background is changing now instead of some text let's add a image here instead so i have one image that's within my main folder this time so first we'll create a photo image so i will call this image equals photo image file equals and then the file path so since this file of mine it's called point emoji.png it's within my main folder the same place where my python file is located i can just list the file name here so that is point underscore emoji.png and then we're going to take button dot config and this image is going to be set to whatever the name of our images which is also image and let's run this so here is the picture that i have it's called point underscore emoji.png and it does the exact same thing however it replaced the text with the image that we listed if you need to display text as well as an image on your button what you could do is use the compound property so button.config compound and we can set this to top bottom left or right or none so let's try top so this places our picture on the top and the text on the bottom and we can reverse that with bottom left right and this is none which is what we had before basically however i believe i'm going to set this to bottom all right well up next let me teach you guys how we can disable a button so button dot config state equals either active or disabled so if this is set to disabled we can no longer click this button it doesn't do anything so this disables button and it's either active or disabled but i'm just going to turn this whole line of code into a comment because we still have work to do on this okay guys it's project time so we're going to create a project that's going to display how many times we have clicked this button since we ran it so instead of printing the word hello let's display a variable such as count but first we'll need to declare this so count and we'll set this equal to 0 to begin and then we're going to make count a global variable so within our function click we're going to say global count and then after we click this button we're going to increment count by one so count plus equals one and then let's just print count for now just to be sure that this is working okay so one two three cool that's working then so now instead of displaying our count variable in our console window let's actually display this on our window so we're going to create a label to do this for us so i'm going to call this label label equals label we're adding this to our window and then we're going to set the text to equal count and then we're going to pack this label so label dot pack so it's up here you can't really see it though so let's change the font so label dot config font equals and i think i'll pick model space and 50 for the size okay it's up here however the label doesn't change so we're going to work on that next so within the function instead of print we're going to add label dot config text equals count and then that is pretty much it so let's try it again one two three all right you can also display a picture too why don't we create a second label so we'll do that here we'll call this label 2 equals label and we're adding this window or this label to our window and let's set the image to equal our point emoji image again we're just going to reuse this so what we're going to do after we click the button and we call this click function we're going to pack label to label2.pack so now when we click this button it's also going to display an image for us so that's your introduction to buttons in python if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post everything in the comments down below but yeah that's an introduction to buttons in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below
