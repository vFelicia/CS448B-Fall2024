hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about objectoriented programming in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey welcome back this video is the start of the objectoriented programming portion of the series the abbreviation people use is oop also pronounced as oop now objects they can be intimidating but they're really not that bad once you get to know them so look around you right now you are surrounded by different objects next to me i have a phone a desk a computer and a coffee cup you can hear me knocking on it right now unfortunately it's empty so we can use programming to imitate objects in the real world anything you can think of really an object uses a class for example i have a class called car and we're going to be constructing some car objects so with objects they contain attributes and methods think of attributes as the characteristics that this object has and methods as the different actions that this object can perform for example let's list some of the attributes of a coffee cup these are the characteristics of my coffee cup so for example let's say that the color of this coffee cup is white i could store this within a string variable within the class called color and we can assign this a string value such as white what about a temperature that could be a double variable and let's say that this is room temperature at 20 degrees celsius and then what about a status like if it's empty or is it full this could be a boolean value such as true or false and unfortunately my coffee cup is empty so empty well equals true now what kinds of methods what kinds of actions can this coffee cup perform let's say we have to a drink method and when we call this method we can print a message such as you drink from the cup or what about a spill method if we were to call the spill method in case i decide to spill my coffee everywhere we could say you spilt your coffee everywhere so all an object really is is a bundle of defining attributes and methods the characteristics of an object and what actions that this object can perform and for today's video we're going to be creating some car objects why because well i like cars so we need to create a different class another class so you can either do this within the same java file or a separate java file so if you were to create a class within the same java file make sure that you declare this class outside of the main class that you're working with but i like to keep my code organized into different java files so for me i'm going to create another java file so within my project folder i'm going to go to file new class and i'm going to call this class car because we're constructing car objects and then click finish so i have two classes within my project folder one called main for you it may be named something different and a car class so we're going to be using this card class to define the attributes and methods of what our cars should have but if you decide to write this within the same java file you'll probably write something like this but i'm just going to keep these as separate files now what kinds of attributes should our car have let's start defining a few let's say a make and model these could be string variables so let's say string make and pick one of your favorite cards let's say string make equals chevrolet and we could also have a model like string model equals corvette because i like corvettes what about a year this could be an integer int year and let's say this is a 2020 chevrolet corvette what about a color string color equals maybe blue and what about a price this could be a double variable such as double price let's say that this car is 50 000 us dollars and zero cents probably enough attributes for this example now what kinds of actions what kinds of methods would we like our car objects to be able to perform let's define two methods a method for drive and a method for break so let's define these let's say void drive and what do we want to do when we call this drive function let's have a simple print line statement that says you drive the car let's also create a method called brake void brake system.out.printline you step on the brakes and that should be good for this example so these are all of the attributes of the car the defining characteristics and these are the methods what actions our car object can perform now let's head back to our main class this is how to construct an instance of another class we're going to be constructing a car object so first we begin with the name of the class which is car next we can create a unique name for this instance of the class this unique car object and i will just call this my car to keep it simple equals new and then the name of the class again by a set of parentheses then a semicolon so my car now has these attributes it's a 2020 chevy corvette that's blue and the price is 50 000 and it has two methods a drive method and a break method so let's display some of the characteristics of this car we can do that within a print line statement and if we want to display or access one of the attributes of this car we type in the name of the car which is my car dot and then whatever attribute you want to display let's display the model so when we run this we'll create a car object and it's called my car and we're going to print the model and in the console window it's going to display the model let's display a few of the other attributes too so let's repeat the process we type in the name of the object the name of this object is called my car i would like to access the make this time and the make is an attribute a variable found within this class so this is going to print the make and the model and this is a chevy or chevrolet corvette now what if we want to access or perform one of these methods it's the same process as before really so we type in the name of the object dot and then the method we would like to call so we are looking for the drive method and that is right here and let's turn these two lines into a comment so we're going to call the drive method of my car and it says you drive the car in the console window now let's apply the brakes so we type in the name of the car or the object dot and we're going to use the break method this time you step on the breaks now with classes we can reuse a class to instantiate multiple instances of this class meaning that we can reuse this class to create multiple objects not just one so let's reuse this car class to create a second car let's pretend that we own two cars now so let's repeat the steps for creating a car so we type the name of the class car and we need a unique name for this car object let's call this car my car 2 i guess equals new car and i think i'm going to rename my car as my car one so my car is no longer recognized so let's just change the name to my car one so this will display the make and the model of my car one and it's still a chevrolet corvette now let's display the make and the model of my car 2 following these same steps so in order to display these let's write this within a print line statement so we are working with mycar2 we are going to type that name mycar2 followed by whatever we want to access we would like to access the make as well as the model so i'm going to change this to my car 2 dot model and i'll add a print line statement just to help separate these within the console window so what we get is that both of these cars my car 1 and my car 2 are both chevrolet corvettes so the reason behind this is that with our car class it's acting as a blueprint and we're saying that whenever we construct an instance of this class a car object all of them are going to be chevrolet corvettes the year 2020 they're blue and they are all 50 000 and they only have a drive and brake method and to solve this problem because we don't want all of our cars to be chevrolet corvettes i mean that wouldn't be a bad problem to have in real life though but it's not practical for programming so what we're going to be doing in the next video is learning about constructors how we can construct objects that have different characteristics different attributes so that all of our objects are not the exact same so if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's an introduction to objectoriented programming in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a
