hey everybody so today I'm going to explain match case statements in Python if you're familiar with other programming languages this is also known as a switch match case statements are alternatives to using many LF statements we execute some code if a value matches a case the benefits of using a match case statement is that they're cleaner and the syntax is more readable in this sample program I have a function there is one parameter a day day will be a number ideally a number 1 through 7 depending on this number we'll return a string corresponding to the day of the week if day equals 1 then it is Sunday two it is Monday all the way up to 7 where it will be Saturday I do have an else Clause if we pass in something that's not valid like pizza pizza is not not a day but it really should be not a valid day a cleaner and more readable alternative is to use a match case statement instead of many l if statements here's how I'm going to take my if and many l if statements and enclose them within a match case match case the case is going to be the value we're examining the case will be day colon we're going to to examine our value of day against matching cases we're going to replace if day equals with the following just simply case so let's do that with each of these statements if you have an else Clause you're instead going to have a case of underscore an underscore and a match case statement is a wild card we will perform this case if there are no matching cases this case would function as the else statement here's what we're working with now if I pass in one and return the day of the week we would get Sunday two would be Monday 3 Tuesday s is Saturday and then let's try that day of pizza that is not a valid day a match case statement is an alternative to using many LF statements I find this much easier to read than the many LF statements both would technically function let's go over a second example we will create a function of is weekend we have to pass in a day this time our day is going to be a string such as Monday the value for each case instead of a number is going to be a string if our day matches a case of Sunday let's return how about a Boolean of true we're checking to see if it's the weekend if our day is equal to a case of Monday then we will return false let's do this with the other days I'm going to fast forward the video we will call the function of is weekend then pass in a day of the week such as Monday so is Sunday the weekend that is true Monday that is false Saturday that is true and we do have a wild card case if there are no matches is pizza a day of the weekend that is false there is a way we can modify this match case too we tend to be repeating ourselves a lot the days Monday through Friday all return false we're going to use the orical operator which is represented with a vertical bar if the case of Saturday or Sunday return true if the case is Monday or Tuesday you can get rid of that or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday then we will return false we can keep our Wild Card case so is Saturday part of the weekend that is true is Monday false Sunday true Friday false and pizza we have our Wild Card case that gives us false all right everybody so those are match case statements they're similar to switches in other programming languages they're an alternative to using many lsip statements we execute some code if a value matches a case the benefits is that the code is cleaner and the syntax is more readable and well everybody those are match case statements in Python
