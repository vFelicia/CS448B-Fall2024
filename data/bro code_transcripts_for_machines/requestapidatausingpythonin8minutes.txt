hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can connect to an API using python in this demonstration we're going to connect to the Poke API to get some information on a Pokémon of our choosing I'm assuming that most of us are familiar with Pokémon I thought it'd be a fun example so according to this API we can look up a Pokémon such as Pikachu then we can get the stats for Pikachu such as Pikachu's name height ID number and all sorts of moves and abilities that a Pikachu may have we will need this URL but we'll handle that later our first step is that we're going to import the requests library to make an API request however when I run this I have a module not found error no module named requests requests is one package will have to install it's not normally included with the standard python download if I was to go to my folder go to my virtual environment library site packages there is no package for requests we'll have to download that with pycharm and vs code there is a builtin terminal that we can use to download the request package we can use pip pip is a package manager for python it's normally included when you install python we'll type pip install requests it'll take just a second and now we have that package of requests within our project folder if I run this again that error goes away process finished with exit Code Zero that means there were no errors going back to our Pokemon API we will need this URL let me zoom in so you can see it I'm going to store that as a base URL so it's easier to work with for convenience I'm going to create a function name get Pokemon info to get some info on a Pokémon we'll have to pass in the name of a Pokemon for now I'll write pass outside of this function let's say we have a variable of Pokemon name pick a Pokemon I will pick Pikachu for now then I will call the get Pokemon info function then pass in my Pokémon name remember that your parameters can be named different than your arguments when you send data to a function you can rename it to something else temporarily now that we have the name of the Pokémon we would like to look up we can complete the URL this will be an F string so with our Pokemon API we have the base URL followed by the word Pokemon then the name of a Pokemon so we have the basee URL I'll add a placeholder and insert it forward slash the word Pokemon slash the name of that Pokémon in this example it's going to be Pikachu we now have the full URL we'll access the request module use the get method and pass in that URL this method is going to return a response object which I will assign to response response is a response object and I'm just going to print our response just to see what we're working with here's our response object it has a status code this is an HTTP status code of 200 200 means the response was okay here's a few examples of response codes you're probably familiar with 404 not found so we are looking for 200 the response is okay after we get our response I'll add an if statement if our response our response object does have an attribute of status code to read what the status code is if this status code is equal to 200 that means the response is okay but for now I'll write pass else I'm going to print the following else I'm going to print failed to retrieve data and I will print the status code of the response object so temporarily I will print data retrieved if it was successful I can't spell okay we have our data data was retrieved if our status code of our response object is equal to 200 I will take our response object and use the Json method our response is a Json format using this method we'll convert it to a python dictionary it will consist of key value pairs much like a Json file but I'm going to assign that to a variable of Pokemon data so it's easier to work with then I will print our Pokemon data so here's the data on Pikachu it's really difficult to read all this you can see some keywords we have abilities base experience this is an extremely large dictionary once we have our dictionary I will return that dictionary of Pokemon data back to the place where we called this function and I will store that as a variable Pokemon info equals get Pokemon info pass in a Pokemon's name and now we should have a dictionary that we can work with let me zoom out if our dictionary exists we can use the if keyword if Pokémon info if that's true if it exists this will be true I will print the following I'll use an F string to access the value of a dictionary we can access it by a key we'll take our dictionary of Pokemon info access the key of name let's see what happens exactly we get Pikachu let's get Pikachu's ID number we will access the key of ID the given value is 25 Pikachu is the 25th Pokemon in the franchise let's get Pikachu's height Pikachu's height is four I don't know what unit of measurement they use in that franchise 4et or 4 Ines I don't know let's get Pikachu's weight Pikachu's weight is 60 60 lb 60 kog I don't know just to make this look nice I'm going to add Name ID height and weight that looks much better let's pick a different Pokemon I will pick my favorite Pokemon of tyion failed to retrieve data does that have to be a lowercase yes it does okay so name tyan I'll follow the name with the capitalize method to make it capital there we go so my favorite Pokemon is tyan ID is 157 Ty loan's height is 17 and weight is 795 all right everybody that is one way in which we can connect to an API using python also tell tell me what your favorite Pokémon is in
