hey hey hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to explain rest parameters in JavaScript rest parameters is a parameter prefixed with three dots they allow a function to work with a variable number of arguments by bundling them into an array it's very similar to the spread operator which we talked about in the last video the spread operator expands an array into separate elements rest parameters do the opposite they bundle separate elements into an array spread will spread an array into separate elements rest parameters will bundle separate elements into an array it effectively does the opposite how could rest parameters be useful let me give you an example say we have a bunch of different food const food one food one equals Pizza we'll create a few different food variables let's start with four food one food two food three food four we have pizza hamburger hot dog and sushi I'm going to create a function that uses rest parameters it's going to Output all food that I send it we'll pretend that we're opening a fridge imagine that all of this food is in a fridge open fridge fridge short for refrigerator to use rest parameters I need three dots we're going to stick all of this food into an array but what should the array name be let's say Foods that's descriptive then I'm going to console.log my array of foods now I'm going to call this function open fridge I will send this function a variable number of arguments this method is going to display an array we have food one pizza food 2 hamburger hamburger is also within our array food three hot dog food for sushi let me add one more food let's add Ramen food five will be Ramen then I will add food five you can see that I can send this function any number of arguments that I would like this function is designed to accept any number of arguments I could combine this function with the spread operator when I'm displaying my Foods array all of these elements are in an array but I could separate them back into separate Elements by using the spread operator which is the same three dots as the rest print parameters rest parameters are used as parameters the spread operator is used whenever you have an array or any sort of collection of something so now when I combine the rest parameters and the spread operator I can display all of my separate elements you can even use rest parameters to stick all elements within an array so this time I'm going to create a separate function to get food we will use rest parameters our array name will be Foods all we're going to do is return Foods take all of these separate elements stick them within an array then return that array so I'm going to create a new array const Foods equals call our get food method pass in a variable amount of arguments let's pass in food one food two food three food four and food five and then we got to display it console.log my array Foods so that's how the rest parameters can be used to combine elements and bundle them into an array then if you want you can return the array or do whatever you want with it let's go over a second example we'll create a method to sum a bunch of numbers together function sum sum we will use rest parameter so we can accept any number of arguments our array name will be numbers what we'll do within this method is have a result result equals z we'll keep track of the current sum within our result I'll create a for Loop to iterate over our array for every let number of numbers take our result Plus plus equals the current number and then we are going to return our result now we'll have const total equals invoke our sum function pass in as many numbers as we would like let's start with one oh then I should probably display the total console.log I'll use a template literal your total is I'll add a place holder total your total is $1 let's add a few more arguments two the total is now $3 three $6 four is 10 5 is 15 let's create a function to calculate an average let's copy our sum function let's name this function get Average all we have to do when returning our result to get the average is divide our result by the length of our numbers array divided by numbers. length property that will give you the average so now const total equals get the average maybe these are test scores one student got a 75 another got 100 another student has 85 90 and a 50 let's console.log the total the average is 80 let's go over example three you can use the rest parameters to combine strings together we will create a function to combine strings we'll send in a title like Mis a first name such as SpongeBob a last name Square Pants he's the third we still need to make this function though but const full name equals whatever string is returned all right let's work on this function function combine string let's make this plural strings we need to use rest parameters let's name our array strings an easy way to do this is to return our array of strings and use the builtin join method to join all of the strings together but we'll add a space between each string all right we should now have a full name variable that's all of the strings combined so let's console.log our full name Mr sponge Bob SquarePants the third that's one way in which you could use the rest parameters to combine a bunch of strings into one such as if you're creating a full name all right everybody so those are rest parameters they allow a function to work with a variable number of arguments by bundling them into an array it's the opposite of the spread operator the spread operator expands an array into separate elements the rest parameters bundle separate elements into an array and well everybody those are rest parameters in JavaScript
