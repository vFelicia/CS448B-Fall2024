hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can detect key events in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people so this is how we can detect key events in javafx there's one of a few ways in which we can implement this i found that the easiest way is just to add an event handler to our scene directly within our start method but there's a few changes that we're going to make to our current code we're going to instantiate an instance of a loader object using our fxml file so let's precede the parent root with this line of code fxml loader we will call this object loader equals new fxml loader and within the constructor pass in git class get resource the name of your fxml file and mine is named scene.fxml now we're going to change parent root equals get rid of all this and we will use the load method of our loader object this will load an object hierarchy from an xml document one way in which we can access the properties and methods of a controller is to create and instantiate a controller object within our start method so let's add that maybe here controller whatever the name of your controller class is let's call this controller equals and we need to use our loader object dot get controller so this will create an instance of a controller object for us and this controller object has access to any properties and methods found within your controller class that are defined within so let's define a few methods let's say we have a method named moveup and let's print something system.out.printline moving up move down moving down move left moving left then move right probably all we'll need here moving right okay now with our scene we're going to add an anonymous event handler so after we declare our scene let's type scene dot set on key pressed and we can pass in an event handler new event handler and we're going to list a generic type of key event then add a set of parentheses then curly braces and be sure to add any unimplemented methods so when our scene detects a key event it will call this handle method i'm just going to rename this argument as event now within our handle method let's just be sure that everything's working by testing it let's display the code of the event that occurs that is handled so type the name of your argument event dot get code so when we run this if i was to press on a key it's going to display the key code so wasd up down left right space enter feel free to play around with that this means that we can use the get code method of our event argument so we can detect what key is pressed so within our handle method let's write a switch so let's create a switch and we are going to examine event dot get code and depending on what key is pressed we will call a method from our controller and we already instantiated an instance of our controller so we have access to these properties and methods found within this class so let's create a switch and we need a couple different cases case up so what we'll do is take our controller object that we instantiated near the top here and we will call the move up method and then break okay let's do the same thing for down left and right but i'm just gonna copy this so we have up down move down then we have left move left then right move right we should probably add a default case too so default just break okay let's test this i'm gonna press up down left right moving up down left right cool we can also change this to different keys as well let's say to move up we're going to press the w key down will be s left is a right is d this time i'm going to press w a s d that's one way in which we can detect key events is to add an anonymous event handler directly to our scene now you could shorten this to a lambda expression if we were to do that we would write event then an arrow get rid of your handle method but keep the code within and let me just move this together so this would also work too w a s d so in conclusion everybody that is one way in which we can detect key events we can add an anonymous event handler or a land expression directly to our scene using the set on key pressed method if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how to detect key events using javafx
