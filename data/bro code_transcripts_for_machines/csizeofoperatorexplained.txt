you guys ready all right let's talk about the size of operator the size of operator determines the size in bytes of a variable data type class objects etc whatever you would like to find the size of you stick within the parentheses of the size of operator here's an example let's create a double double gpa our gpa will be a solid 2.5 to determine the size in bytes of my variable or a data type i will just place within the set of parenthesis i'll display this standard output size of operator i would like to return the size of my gpa variable then i'll just add a string bytes new line let's take a look the size of my gpa variable is 8 bytes that's the maximum size allocated to my double variable if i was to replace gpa with a data type such as double well this would be the same 8 bytes this will be helpful in the future when we begin working with arrays so let's try a couple other variables i'll create a string standard string name assign some name then i will find the size of the string size of name the size of a string is 32 bytes because a string really just holds an address to where some text is located the address of where the string of text is located is 32 bytes even if i were to change the size of the string bro code is awesome well this size is still going to be the same 32 bytes because a string is a reference data type let's try a couple other examples how about a character char grade my grade will be an f i will find the size of this character grade the size of a character is one byte let's try a boolean boolean student is somebody a student true or false i'll play student within the size of operator a boolean variable also takes one byte of memory this time let's find the size of an array in bytes i'll create an array of characters char grades this will be an array i'll set the sequel to some grades a b c d then f i'll place my array within the size of operator the size of this array grades is five bytes remember that characters take up one byte of memory an array of five characters would be well five bytes we can use the size of operator to calculate how many elements are within an array if we have the total size of our ray we could divide this by the size of one element size of grades at index of zero or otherwise we can find the data type we'll divide the size of my array grades divided by the size of a character so i should have these many elements five elements within my array of grades if i were to add one more grade like an e even though that's not a typical grade well then the total elements within that array would be six elements that's a useful trick to calculate the size of an array how many elements are within that array one more this will be a bonus question i'll create an array of strings i'll name the students we'll enter in some student names such as spongebob patrick then squidward to calculate how many strings are within this array how many students we have we can find the size of my array students divided by the size of a string i have three elements within this array of students then i could add one more and this equation should calculate that i'll add sandy size of students divided by the size of a string would give me four elements so yeah that's the size of operator everybody it will return the size and bytes of a variable data type class objects all sorts of things it will be really helpful when working with arrays because we can determine the size of an array but we'll get some practice with that in the future and well yeah that's the size of operator in c plus
