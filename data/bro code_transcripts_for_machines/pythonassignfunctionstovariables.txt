hello what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you guys how we can assign a function to a variable in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if i could have just a moment of your time please like comment and subscribe i would greatly appreciate it hey all in today's video i will show you all how we can assign a function to a variable this video will be a prerequisite for a few videos i have coming up regarding functions now let's say we have a function named hello and all we'll do is print the word hello and as you know to call this function you would type the name of the function followed by a set of parentheses and this will print the word hello the set of parentheses that comes after a function's name is the portion that will call the function if you were to remove that set of parentheses afterwards we would not in fact call that function now with python python will pretty much treat everything as objects including functions so there's something i want to show you guys if i was to print the name of my function hello what will be displayed is the memory address of this function this is the memory address of where this function is located within my computer's memory and it's in hexadecimal think of it like a street address such as 123 fake street this is the address of where this function is within my computer's memory and each time that i run this program this number can change as you can see it here now one thing that we could do we could assign this address to a variable let's say hi equals hello and be sure that you're not adding that set of parentheses afterwards because then you would be calling the hello function and returning the result to high so high equals hello no parentheses and if i was to print hi well the address of hello and hi will be at the same memory address both of these numbers are the same now what do you imagine would happen if i was to call the high function after we assign the memory address of hello to hi well then what we'll end up doing is calling the hello function even though we're listing that we would like to call the high function even though it doesn't exist so it's as if this hello function has two names you can either use hello or you can use hi and let me demonstrate that so you can call either hello hi or both for this example that's because we're assigning the memory address of hello to this variable of high so we could treat high as a function it's kind of like an alias where this function has two names now here's another demonstration let's say that we would like to assign our builtin print function to a variable so let's say maybe say say equals print and when i say print i'm referring to the print function and be sure you're not adding that set of parentheses afterwards now if i need to print something to the console window i can either use print like what we've previously been doing or i could use say because say has the same memory address let's say perhaps whoa i can't believe this works surprise face all right so we can call the print function by saying the word say say all of this text and this will print all of this text well say all of this text to the console window under normal circumstances i'm not sure why or when you would need to assign the print function to a variable but you can and well that's kind of cool so i thought i'd show you guys that so everybody that's how to assign a function to a variable like i said we'll be building upon this topic so you want to be sure that you understand this all right then well if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that's how to assign a function to a variable in python
