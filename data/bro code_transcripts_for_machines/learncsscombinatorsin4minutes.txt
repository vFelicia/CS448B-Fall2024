hey what's going on everybody today we're going to discuss combinators in CSS combinators explain the relationship between listed selectors there's four we'll discuss today descendants which is just a space a child which is a right angle bracket a tilde which is a general sibling and plus which is for adjacent siblings you would type something like this you'll have selector one a combinator for example the child combinator then another selector if I said div child combinator then p we're applying CSS properties to any paragraph elements found within the stiff section what we'll do in this example is create a div section I will give this div an ID of container we'll create a few paragraphs for paragraph one let's say this is number one we'll create another paragraph then we'll create an inner div section this div section will not have an ID but within this inner div section we'll have another paragraph This is number three outside of our div with an ID of container we'll create two more paragraphs this is number four this is number five that's all we'll need for now just to make it a little more clear that this is a div section I'll take our container then give it a border border two pixels solid paragraphs one two and three are within a div section four and five are not I would like to highlight all paragraphs within my ID of container I will take my ID of container then I will use the descendant combinator which is an empty space then list another selector I'm going to highlight all paragraphs within my div section that would be my div section space then what am I applying CSS properties to my paragraphs let's take the background color and set that to be yellow something like that's fine all paragraph descendants of our container change the background color to Yellow that is The Descendant combinator it's just an empty space then you have children children is a right angle bracket highlight any paragraph children of our container class only one and two are highlighted that's because three is not technically a child it's a descendant think of it like a grandchild in this case paragraphs one and two are direct children of our container but our third paragraph is One More Level deep because it's wrapped within another div section it's a descendant but not a child all children are descendants but not all descendants are children that would apply to number three that's why only one and two are highlighted that is the child combinator then we have General sibling which is represented with a tilde take any paragraphs that are General siblings of our container that would highlight four and five paragraphs four and five are both siblings to our container they're both considered Children of the body of my document therefore their siblings like brothers and sisters but if I were to wrap these two paragraphs within a div section foreign well now they're no longer siblings this div section is now a sibling to this first div section think of it this way paragraphs four and five are nieces and nephews to the First Development all right let's reverse that then we have adjacent siblings using a plus sign we will select only adjacent siblings four is selected but not five the adjacent sibling is the next direct sibling but not all siblings that's why four is selected and not five but if I change their positions around 5 is now selected alright everybody so those are combinators they explain the relationship between listed selectors you have descendant child General sibling and adjacent sibling and those are combinators in CSS
