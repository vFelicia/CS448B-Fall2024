hello everybody so in today's topic I'm going to be discussing some basic arithmetic and PHP I'll divide this video into different sections first we have arithmetic operators then the increment and decrement operators followed by operator precedence let's begin with arithmetic operators in my example we have three variables X will equal a number like 10. then we have Y which I'll set to be 2 then Z we'll assign z a value later I will set that to be null if I would like to add X and Y together then store the result within Z we'll have to use some addition I could write something like this Z equals our variable X Plus our variable y then I will Echo whatever Z is so 10 plus 2 that's 12. so that's addition I'll go through these pretty quick they're fairly straightforward so 10 minus y would be subtraction x minus y store the results in z the result is 8. now multiplication that is an asterisk 10 times 2 is 20. division is a forward slash 10 divided by 2 that is 5. to raise a base to a given power you use double asterisks 10 to the power of 2 is 100 10 times 10 is 100. then we have the modulus operator that will give you the remainder of any division X modulus y well 10 divides by 2 evenly the remainder is zero if y was 3 imagine that we have a group of 10 students and they need to break into groups of three there is going to be one student that's remaining so the percent sign the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division it's really helpful for determining if a number is even or odd you would just say modulus too if the remainder is 1 that number is odd if it's zero then it's even so those are basic arithmetic operators now we'll cover increment and decrement operators I have a variable which we will name counter I will set counter to be 0 to begin with if I need to increment this variable by 1 as if we're counting normally I would have to write an expression such as this our counter equals our counter plus one then let's Echo our counter variable so the result is one this can be cumbersome to write a shortcut you could do if incrementing a variable by one is replace this part of our expression with plus plus take the variable then add plus plus that will increment your variable by one plus plus is the increment operator for decrement you would use minus minus our counter is now at negative one if I were to set our counter to 10 after decrementing it's now nine use plus plus to increment minus minus two decrement you can increment by a given value too if I would like to count by twos let's set counter to be zero instead of plus plus you would write plus equals then some number counter plus equals two will increment my variable by two plus equals three would be three on the flip side to decrement by a given value you would use minus equal some number so zero minus equals two will decrement my variable by two minus equals 3 would be well 3. so that is the increment and decrement operators lastly we have operator precedence given a complex arithmetic expression such as this example in which order do we solve each part of this expression we would begin with parentheses beginning from left to right if there's anything within parentheses we would solve that first for example with my expression let's Echo whatever the total currently is so the total for me is 2.999 beginning from left to right solve anything within parentheses first we currently don't have any parentheses then comes any exponents so beginning from left to right look for any exponents we do have 5 to the power of six let's see what that is 5 to the power of five do it a third time fourth time fifth time sixth time fifteen thousand six hundred twenty five beginning from left to right solve any multiplication division then modulus modulo is that the right term so we have addition subtraction here we go we have multiplication three times four that's twelve then we have division 12 divided by fifteen thousand six hundred twenty five is point zero zero zero seven six eight foreign then lastly addition and subtraction we have some addition one plus two is three three minus this number point zero zero zero seven six eight is our result 2.99232 that's operator precedence if you have a complex equation solve anything within parentheses first then any exponents multiplication division modulus then lastly addition and subtraction all right everybody in conclusion we have discussed arithmetic operators addition subtraction multiplication division exponents and modulus incremented decrement operators you can take a variable add plus plus to increment it or minus minus two decrement it then lastly operator precedence and well everybody that is basic arithmetic in PHP
