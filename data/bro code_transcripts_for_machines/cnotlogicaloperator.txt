hey yeah let's discuss the notch logical operator which is represented by an exclamation point its purpose is to reverse the state of a condition let's write a small program let's say that we have a boolean variable named sunny and this will be either true or false let's say it's true to begin with so to work with boolean variables include this header file at the top and we will write an ifelse statement to check to see if it's sunny outside and print a custom message so if sunny is equal to true then we will print it's sunny outside else it must be cloudy outside so this does work it's sunny outside another way of writing this is that we could say sunny is equal to one because true represents one false represents zero this would also work or you could just say sunny this would work as well so by using the not logical operator this will reverse the state of condition by using the not logical operator we're checking to see if something is not true so if i try this again this program states it's cloudy outside so i think it would be better if we were to switch these print statements around now what we're checking is if it's not sunny if it's not sunny then we will print it's cloudy outside else it's sunny outside it is sunny outside and if i change this to be false well then it's cloudy outside so yeah that's the not logical operator you can just precede a condition or a boolean variable with the not logical operator and that gives you a few more options in the way in which you can write a program so yeah that is the not logical operator if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
