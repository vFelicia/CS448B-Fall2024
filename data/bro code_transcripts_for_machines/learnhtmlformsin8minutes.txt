hey everyone i'm going to try and explain everything i can about forms in about eight minutes to create a form element we'll need a pair of form tags there's an opening form tag and a closing form tag and depending on the user input that you need there is an input element and you can set the type attribute to whatever you need let's say we need some text from a user like a first name within our form there is a text box where we can enter in some user information so we should probably let the user know what we want them to type in i will precede this input element with a label let's say first name and a user can type in their first name now it is considered good practice to fill out a for attribute within the label and set this to whatever you want let's say fname and within the associated input elements i will set the id also equal to fname whatever's within the four attribute this does a couple things one if i was to click on this label this will select my input box it's also helpful for people that are using screen readers so that they can easily navigate your form there is also a name attribute when we submit this data what sort of name do we want to give that data think of it like a variable i will also name this fname as well within the input element there is a placeholder to display some default text to a user by setting the placeholder attribute equal to some text like spongebob so if i was to click within this input field and type something that will get rid of my placeholder let's create an input field for a last name and really we can just copy this and make a few changes to it so copy both the label and the input element uh let's change this from first name to last name change four as well to lname id will be i'll name and let's make name l name as well and the placeholder how about square pants these labels and input elements will appear on the same line to separate them and treat them as block level elements i will add each of these pairs to their own div element perhaps i'll add a line break as well okay now with forms there are builtin buttons too we will set the input type equal to reset so if i were to type in some text and click reset that will reset whatever's within my form and there is a submit button as well i will set the type equal to submit so currently our data doesn't have any place to go to so if i were to click the submit button this data is not going to go anywhere so if i need to send this data to a page i will list that page within the action attribute of my opening form element so we'll need the help of a dynamic programming language php for example we're not going to focus on functionality in this video but rather the structure of a form so if i need to send this to a php page i will list that php page within the action attribute there is also an associated method attribute two common values are get and post get is considered insecure it's going to append your data to the url of your web page so for example if i set the method to get and type in some information and click submit it's going to append my data to the end of my url so it's going to add a question mark then all of my data if you need to submit some secure information like a password do not use get i would say that this is useful for things like search boxes if a user needs to navigate your web page for maybe some sort of keyword so it's better to use post to submit some secure information but this isn't going to do anything obviously because we do not have a server set up now there is a required boolean attribute you can add if somebody needs to submit some information they are required to fill out any input elements that have this boolean attribute of required so if i just attempt to submit this without typing in anything there is a small popup box that says please fill out this field all right i'm going to go kind of quick through these next input elements just because i think we have the hang of the general context of input elements so next we have password fields you set the type equal to password so if somebody types in characters they will be hidden if you need to set a max size of your password there is a max length attribute let's set this to maybe 12 so we can type in no more than 12 characters for a password and you can also add that required boolean attribute too for an email element set the type equal to email in order to submit an email we need an app character within our email otherwise we cannot submit this information and perhaps i'll add a placeholder as well placeholder equals s pants at gmail.com so there is our placeholder for a telephone number you're going to set the type equal to tell and i do have a placeholder as well if you need the user to type in a date like a birth date there is a type date which includes an interactive calendar to select a date a user can type in a number if you set the type equal to number let's say that the user is buying something from a store there are some arrows where they can increase or decrease the quantity but we should probably place some limits they can type in basically whatever number they want they want negative one billion items so we can set the min and the max i'll set the min equal to zero and of the max equal to what about 99 and you can also set a default value too i'll set the default value equal to one next we have radio buttons with radio buttons we can only select one radio button from any one group perhaps we'll have the user select a title are they a mr a miss or a doctor so i'm going to create a pair of labels and input for each option that we have so we will have a mr option miss and phd okay i will set the input type equal to radio and then do that with each of these pairs so we can select more than one because these are all not within the same group to set them all within the same group we will all have them have the same matching name let's say that the name will be title so therefore we can only select one now since they're all within the same group and that's kind of the idea behind radio buttons you can only select one and we will set an associated value of let's say mister for the first value misses for the second and doctor for the last one then i'm just going to precede all of these with a separate label uh let's say title and i will set the four attribute equal to title and within each of these radio button labels when i click on one of these labels i also want to be able to select one of these radio buttons so i will set the for attribute equal to a unique id so let's say mr the id will be mister and repeat the same steps okay so when we click on these labels we should be able to select our radio buttons nice with drop down menus instead of a type we are going to use a pair of select tags so there's an opening select tag and a closing select tag and we list individual options within the select element we'll give our user three options from this drop down menu they can pay with a visa a mastercard or a gift card and i will give each of these a value okay we now have a payment field and the user can select an option from this drop down menu and the last input type i will explain in this video is the checkbox type so let's say we have a subscribe button and you can go ahead and smash that subscribe button so just set the type equal to checkbox for well a checkbox well yeah everybody that's how to create an html form there's still some more advanced input types we did not cover but these are the very basics i would say if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
