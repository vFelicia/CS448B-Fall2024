all right welcome back everybody in this video we're going to write a small practice program to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle we'll need the help of our math.h header file because we'll need access to some useful math functions more specifically the square root function let's declare all of the variables that we'll need we'll need sides a b and c and these will be of the double data type a b c we'll ask the user to enter in sides a and b print f enter side a and then we will use scanf so the format specifier for a double is l f then i would like to insert a value within a so i need to use the address of operator then our variable a okay let's do the same thing for side b enter side b and store the user input within variable b the formula to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the square root of a squared plus b squared so we will set c equal to the square root function and within the parentheses we will say a times a plus b times b and then we will display c side c and the format specifier for a double is l f and we are displaying c and well let's try it so side a let's say is three side b is four that means side c is five so yeah i thought that would be a good practice program for us to get used to accepting user input if this video helped you out help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
