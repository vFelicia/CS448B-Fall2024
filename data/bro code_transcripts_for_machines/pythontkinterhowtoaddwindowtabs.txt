hey what's going on everybody to bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create separate tabs for our gui applications in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay let's begin so in order to create tabs for our python gui application we're going to need access to a widget called notebook and that's found in a different module so this time we're going to need two imports so at the top from tk enter import just everything but the notebook widget is found within a separate module so we'll need a second import from tk enter import ttk so this ttk import gives us access to several different widgets that are normally not available to us so once you have these two imports you're ready to begin so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and we need to create a notebook widget so right after you create your window we're going to create a notebook we'll call this notebook equals ttk dot notebook and we want to add this notebook to our window so let me add a comment here what this widget does so this is a widget that manages a collection of windows and displays and that's really all there is to it so in order to create different tabs we're going to create some frames so for the first tab i'll call this tab 1 equals frame and we want to add this to the notebook and with our notebook we're adding this notebook to the window all right so this will be a new frame for tab one and let's create a second tab and we'll call this tab two and you can create more tabs if you want but that might be overkill so this is a new frame for tab two after you finish these two lines of code we're going to follow this up with notebook dot add so notebook dot add what widget are we adding we're adding our tab one frame and we can set some text for this tab so text equals and i'll type in tab 1 and we'll repeat the process for tab 2. so notebook.ad tab 2 and we'll change the text to tab 2. and then we need to pack this notebook notebook dot pack and let's take a look to see what we have all right we have tab one and tab two but we'll probably want to actually add something to each of these tabs so that the content is visible so let's create some labels so after we pack our notebook let's create some labels i don't really feel like giving these names because we don't really plan on using them for anything else so we'll just say label tab one that's going to be the parent widget and let's set some text text equals hello this is tab number one then i think i'll give this a width and a height too just so it's more visible so for the width i'll make this 50 and the height 25 so this will be roughly a square shape and then we need to pack this so i'm just going to add pack and let's create a second label for tab two so label tab two maybe i'll say goodbye this is tab number two okay we should have some actual content for these labels now for these tabs so here's the label this is tab one and this is tab two and you can switch between these and they display each of these separate labels however with the way that this window is arranged if we were to expand the size of this window well our frames and our tabs kind of stay in the top and in the center so i'm going to add a few lines within the pack function of our notebook the first thing i'm going to do is use the expand option and set this to true so what this does and i'm just going to add a comment that expand this will expand to fill any space not otherwise used so what happens now is that this will actually expand and it's staying in the center of the window but there's one more thing we're going to add fill equals both normally this is x or y or you can do both so i'll add a comment as to what this option does so fill will fill on x and y axis so if you combine both of these together what you get is that these tabs will stay in the top left corner and if you were to expand the size of this window the tabs aren't going to move they're going to stick to the top left but the size of the window will expand all right so that's the basics of creating tabs in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating tabs in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
