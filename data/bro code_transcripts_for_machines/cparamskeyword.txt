oh yeah ladies and gentlemen do you know what's better than overloaded methods the params keyword now a methods parameters can take a variable number of arguments if we use the params keyword and the parameter type must be a single dimensional array what's the benefit of this let me explain so let's say that we have an online store we have a method to check out where we will basically sum up a customer's prices and return a total and we'll tell the customer you have to pay this total what if the person checking out has a variable number of items that they would like to buy well we would have to set up a bunch of different methods like what if they only buy one item well there's a checkout method that accepts one argument another checkout method that accepts two arguments then three and then we continue on and on and on so yeah don't do this a better solution would be to use this params keyword where we only need a single method and this one single method can accept a varying number of arguments we don't need like several copies of the same method then so to use the params keyword precede our data type with the word params then after the data type follow this with a set of square brackets now this parameter a is now an array i'm going to name this as something a little more descriptive like prices because we're working with prices so we need to iterate over the elements of an array and create a total so i'm going to create a local variable named double total so you can have variables with the same name but they need to be within a different scope so these are in different methods so they are not visible to each other double total i will set the sequel to zero to begin with and we'll use a for each loop to iterate over the elements of this array for each double price in prices total equals total plus whatever price we're working with but i'll shorten this to plus equals price then at the end we will return total and this should work the same okay the total price is 24.74 but there's some formatting that we'll have to do in a future video and then i can just keep on adding items to my you know fictional shopping cart like i would like to buy a bottle of water for a dollar and a tshirt for ten dollars and 25 cents so you see by using this params keyword a single method can accept a varying amount of arguments so method overloading isn't always necessary if you're working with a lot of different arguments you're not really sure how many arguments are going to be passed in okay then everybody that is the params keyword it can be applied to a method parameter so that it can accept a variable number of arguments but the parameter type must be a single dimensional array and that is the params keyword if you can help me out by smashing that like button drop a random comment down below and well yeah that's the pram's keyword in csharp
