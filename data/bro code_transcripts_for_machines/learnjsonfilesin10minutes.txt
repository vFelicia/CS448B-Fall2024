what's up everybody so today I got to talk about Json files using JavaScript Json means JavaScript object notation it's a data interchange format most of the time it's used for exchanging data between a server and a web application they can have a few different formats usually you'll see a Json file as an object an object made up of key value pairs or you may see them as an array an array of values or some combination of both you can have an object where one of the values is an array and or you could have an array of objects like this just to understand the format we'll create a new Json file let's go to our website folder create a new file we'll create an array of names the file extension is Json we'll Begin by writing an array with a set of straight brackets let's add a few names just some first names SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy this is a valid Json format let's create a new Json file just for a single person this will be an object new file person. Json this time we will create a single object this object will have key value pairs we will have a name key and a value of SpongeBob each key value pair is going to be comma separated SpongeBob will have an AG key of 30 and a Boolean of is employed is SpongeBob currently employed that will be true this is also a valid format our Json file contains one object an object made up of key value pairs objects can even have arrays as one of their values we will create an array of hobbies what does SpongeBob like to do this will be an array jelly fishing karate and cooking let's create one more Json file we will create a Json file for people this will be an array of objects people. Json we're going to create an array of objects within this array we'll create one object what key value pairs should this object have we'll just reuse what we have for SpongeBob excluding the array to keep it simple okay that will be the first object let's create another object we need another set of curly braces the second object will have a name property of Patrick age 34 is employed will be false the next object this will be for Squidward age 50 is employed loyed true he works at the Crusty Crab one last object name Sandy h27 is employed false Sandy is selfemployed all right we have an array of objects each object can have its own unique key value pairs so let's close out of these Json files but we'll hold on to them so Json formats they're one long string to represent that object or array using the stringify method of Json we can convert a JavaScript object or an array into a Json string so let's copy what we have for names I will create a constant of names equals that array we'll convert it to a Json string const Json string equals access Json Json is a builtin object that's provided to us to work with Json files we will use the stringify method then pass in our array or our object currently if I were to console.log my names before stringifying it here's the result we have an array of strings to work with after using the stringify method on names we'll be given one long string to represent this array if I was to use this on an object let's copy what we have for person I will create a const of person this will be an object I'll just paste what I have for SpongeBob first let's console.log person here's my person object then let's stringify it and display the Json string Json files work with one long string that represents an object or an array let's stringify our people it's an array of objects const people equals paste what we have let me show you what happens when I console.log people before stringifying it we have an array of objects each object has its own key value pairs then if I was to stringify it here's the result one extremely long string now we'll use parse parse converts a Json string to a JavaScript object so let me reformat these to convert these objects or arays into a string we can surround them with a pair of back ticks so let's rename these let's say Json names Json person then Json people these objects and arrays are all in a Json format to convert them to their original form we can use the parse method of Json I will create a constant of par data equals Json parse pass in our data of Json names and then let's console.log let me show you Json names first before parsing it we have a string representation of an array but after parsing it it becomes a JavaScript array let's do this with our string representation of an object Json person normally it looks like this then after parsing it we have a JavaScript object and then Json people it's an array of objects then we'll parse it and here's the result an array of objects now I'm going to show you how we can fetch a Json file we'll talk about fetch more in the next topic fetch is a function as an argument we can pass in a relative or absolute file path or a URL we'll discuss that in the next topic I would like to get my Json file of let's go with person so I will list the relative file path these files are right next to each other I just need to type person. Json fetch returns a promise we will follow this with the then method then do this we'll be provided with a response object take our response Arrow do this we will take our response object convert it to a Json format using the Json method then let's display what we have currently then take the value arrow console.log that value let's see what we have yep there's SpongeBob we have successfully fetched a Json file let's do this with our array of names we have an array of strings of first names and people people. Json we have an array of objects one object for each person if you would like to iterate through all the objects let's rename value as values we'll use the builtin for each method of arrays values. for each take each value Arrow do this console.log each value now we're iterating through and printing each object if you would like some of the specific properties like name follow the value with name SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy or age or is employed oh and another thing that I'm forgetting be sure to add a catch method to catch any errors just in case we can't fetch this Json file for some reason console.log or console. error the error message we'll talk about fetch more in the next topic all right everybody so those are Json files Json means JavaScript object notation it's a data interchange format it's mostly used for exchanging data between a server and a web application Json files are usually objects or an array or some combination of both to convert a Json object to a string you can use the stringify method to convert a Json string to an object you can use the parse method to fetch a Json file you can use the fetch function which we'll talk about next and get more in depth with and well everybody those are Json files using JavaScript
