what's up everybody so in today's video I got to explain the concept of method chaining in JavaScript method chaining is a programming technique it's where you call one method after another in one continuous line of code I'll give you two examples of the same program one that uses no method chaining and another that does then we'll be able to see some of the benefits of method chaining what we'll do in the first version of this program is create a variable for a username and I will ask the user for some input using window prompt the text will be enter your username after typing in some username I would like to trim any white space around the username take the first character make it upper case take all of the other characters make them all lowercase and then display the output so this program will have a few steps let's reassign our username equal to username use the trim method to remove any Whit space before or after the name then I will get the first character of my username to capitalize it we'll create a variable of let letter equals our username follow this with the Char at method the character at index0 letter is going to be a variable it will hold the first letter of my username to make my letter uppercase I will reassign it letter equals letter use the to uppercase method to make that letter uppercase now with the rest of the characters I would like to make them lowercase anything besides the first character I will create a separate variable for extra characters let's say extra chars short for characters equals take our original username use the slice method we will slice our username everything after the first character if my name was bro code and I cre created a slice of everything but the first character extra characters would be row code without the B so then let's take our extra characters make them all lowercase extra characters equals extra characters followed with the two lowercase method then we will combine the first letter which is uppercase and the extra characters which are lowercase then store them within our username username equals our letter plus the extra character then we will display our username console.log our username so this program does have a lot of steps we will run this program enter your username I will enter a few Whit spaces type in my name but I'll mix up the capitalization press okay and there's my username the first letter is uppercase the rest of the letters are lower case so this program does work but it is a lot to write now with method chaining we can combine some of these steps together and avoid creating variables that we don't need such as letter and extra characters so with method training what we'll do is start to combine some of these steps after getting our username we will take our username equals take our username again use the trim method we're not going to end this method with a semicolon we're going to end it with a DOT write another method after trimming the username get the character at index zero and then why stop there let's method chain again make that letter uppercase following the two uppercase method so this will work it's kind of like in a video game how you can have a combo well this is a three hit combo boom boom boom take our username trim it get the first character and then make an uppercase all in one line of code not only that let's use some strink conation we need to take the rest of the characters in my username make them all lowercase then combine them together again let's take our username use the trim method method chain the slice method slice the string after the first character then method chain again use the two lowercase method and that should work console.log my username we're using a lot less L of code and I'll zoom out just so you can see everything and to your username I'll throw in some white spaces then mix up the capitalization and that has appeared to work so that's method chaining it's a programming technique where you can call one method right after another in one continuous line of code it's like a video game combo so to say so in this case trim our username give me the first character and then make it uppercase we did method chaining here here and then we combined the results using string catenation which is something separate entirely by using method chaining this helps you avoid creating named variables but if your method chain is too long it can become difficult to read like here I am kind of pushing the limits and well everybody that is Method chaining in JavaScript
