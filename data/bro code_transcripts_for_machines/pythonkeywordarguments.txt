what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain keyword arguments in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's discuss keyword arguments these are arguments that are preceded by an identifier when we pass them to a function the order of the arguments doesn't matter unlike positional arguments which do matter and we've been working with positional arguments already and python knows the names of the arguments that our function receives when we use keyword arguments here's an example of us using positional arguments and then i'll demonstrate the benefits of keyword arguments let's say we have a function called hello that accepts three arguments a first name a middle name and a last name and the output will be hello first name middle name last name so if i were to run this this will display hello bro dude code so we're using positional arguments the order of the arguments does matter what do you think is going to happen if i were to replace some of these values let's say i will swap the first argument with the third argument so let's try it again hello code dude bro so obviously the order of the arguments matters and now if we were to use keyword arguments then the order of the arguments doesn't matter but with each argument we need to precede each argument with a unique identifier and that identifier is the name of the parameter we want to associate each argument with so for my intended last name i will use an identifier of last to match this parameter so dude will be middle middle equals dude and bro will be first even though they're not in the correct order so let's try this again and my output is hello bro dude code so that's all about keyword arguments they are arguments preceded with an identifier when we pass them to a function the order of the arguments doesn't matter unlike positional arguments which do matter and then python knows the names of the arguments that our function receives when we use keyword arguments so that's it for keyword arguments if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how keyword arguments work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
