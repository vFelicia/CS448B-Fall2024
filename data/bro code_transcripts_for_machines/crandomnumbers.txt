hey uh what's going on everybody so in this video i'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers in c just as a disclaimer these are pseudorandom numbers they are a set of values or elements that are statistically random so don't use these for any sort of cryptographic security now before we begin include these two header files at the top stdlib and time the first thing that we're going to do is use the current time to generate a seed which we need for random numbers so we can use the s rand function s for seed rand for random and then we will pass in the current time time function pass and zero so we will use the current time as a seed for random numbers and then the function that you need to generate a random number using this seed is the rand function so let's store our number within a variable maybe number one int number one and i will set this sequel to then invoke the rand function now the rand function will give you a random number between 0 and 32 767. so i'm guessing we probably don't need a number that large so depending on the range of numbers that we need we can use modulus and then the maximum number that you would like so if i'm rolling a six sided dice i can say modulus six so the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division so technically this gives us a random number between zero and five because computers always start with zero but you can add an offset so if i need the numbers one through six i can just add plus one to the end and then maybe i'll surround this section with a set of parentheses just to make this more readable so generate a random number between zero and five add one that gives us a random number between one and six and let's just test that theory so i'm going to use printf and we are displaying an integer and let's display number one so we should have a random number between one and six and our random number is two and if i run this again this will be a different number probably yep six okay now if i need to generate a couple different random numbers i can just use this rand function again so let's say we are rolling three dice number one number two and number three and then i'll print these as well so number one number two and number three and i'll add a new line character after each of these print statements okay so this will give us three random numbers between one and six one three one three five six now it is important that we're generating a random seed let me show you what happens when i take this out so this will give us the same numbers over and over again 665 665 and 665 so that's why it's important that we use a seed for random numbers now another thing too if you need a larger number you can just change this number for example i play a lot of dungeons and dragons so i may need to roll a 20sided dice so i can just set this to 20. so 288 and let's try this again 1254 so yeah that's how to generate some random numbers and see if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to generate some random numbers in c
