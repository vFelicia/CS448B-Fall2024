hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be explaining quarks in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right everybody let's talk about quarkx now this is a parameter that will pack all arguments into a dictionary it's useful so that a function can accept a varying amount of keyword arguments it's identical to args except with args args will accept a varying amount of positional arguments and pack them into a tuple with quarks this will accept a varying amount of keyword arguments and pack them into a dictionary so here's an example of why this would be useful let's say we have a function called hello that accepts two keyword arguments a first name and a last name all this will do is output hello your first name and last name but what if somebody has more than two names let's say somebody has a middle name and for this example i'll just say my middle name is dude so if i were to run this well this hello function is no longer going to work as you can see in the console window we have a type error the hello function got an unexpected keyword argument middle one way in which we can solve this we can use this quark's parameter so we can accept a varying amount of keyword arguments so what we'll do is replace our parameters with two asterisks then quarks now if i would like the same output as i had before i'm going to need to change a few things around in order to access a value within a dictionary you type the name of the dictionary square brackets and then within quotes list your key so i would like to access the value at this key first and let's repeat the process for last name so the key is going to be last we'll access this value at this key and this should work the same as it did before now let's take this a step further let's say we would like to display somebody's full name based on the amount of keyword arguments that they pass into this function well there's a few different ways in which we could do this one easy way is that we could write our program like this let's print the word hello and we will need to iterate once through each key value pair within this dictionary and we can use a for loop to do that so to iterate once through each key value pair in your dictionary we'll type for key value in the name of our dictionary quarks in this case dot items and then we will print each value so there's one more thing that we need to do this kind of works as intended but it's going to print each value including our word hello on a new line so with a standard print statement this will print a new line character after each print statement as if we're hitting enter we can actually change that so after your string add end equals and we can replace that new line character with something else maybe a space and let's do the same thing for our for loop so value comma end and then just add space now this will print all of your names on the same line hello bro dude code and now we can pass in a varying amount of keyword arguments based on how long our name is perhaps we have like a title title equals mr and we can print that as well hello mr bro dude code here's a fun fact of the day you don't necessarily need to name this parameter as quarks the important thing is to have these double asterisks that preceded kwargs is just a common naming convention it's short for keyword arguments you could name this as something else perhaps something more descriptive like names since we're passing in a bunch of names so the name of our dictionary is now names and this would work the same as it did before the important thing is to have these double asterisks that precede the name your dictionary but quarks is the common naming convention well everybody that's all about quarkx it's a parameter that will pack a varying amount of keyword arguments into a dictionary if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how quarkx works in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
