hey what's going on everybody so in today's video I'm going to show you how we can work with dates and times using python we will import the date time module this allows us to work with dates and times using our system clock our computer's clock this video serves as more of an introduction to create a date object we will assign an object of date let me zoom in a little bit we will access the datetime module called the date method within the date method we will pass in the following arguments a year of our choosing so for me I'll say 2025 a month one corresponds to January these are numeric months and a day a day of the month I will say the second if I was to print the state object here's what it outputs the year is 2025 January 2nd to get the date right now let's say today this will return a date object that represents today access the date time module access the class of date then call the today method to return the date of today let's print today currently I'm recording this video July 14th 2024 for me that is the result of my today object when I print it now we'll work with time I will create a Time object Act access the date time module call the time method we have to pass in hours minutes and then seconds so for the hour let's say 12 30 and 0 seconds I will print the current time it is 1230 now to get the time right now on our system clock I will create a datetime object of now equals access the date time module now within the datetime module there is a date time class we have to access we will access that I know it looks kind of silly date time. dat time doth now method so we're accessing the datetime module there's a builtin datetime class we have to access then within that class there's a now method what is the time right now according to my system clock this returns a date and a Time July 14th 2024 it is just after 900 a.m. we can format the appearance of the string here's how I'm going to reassign our datetime object of now our datetime object has a string format time method stf time we're going to pass in a string and include some format specifiers let's say I would would like to display the hour first I'm going to add a percent these format specifiers you can find according to the datetime documentation online so I will display the hours that would be percent H percent M for minutes percent s for seconds let's see what we're working with we have the hours the minutes and the seconds I will separate each of these with the colon that's better now I'll add the date I'll start with the month I will add a format specifier of lowercase M then the day a format specifier of D then the year format specifier capital Y here's the result we have the month the day and the year I'll add a dash to separate these that's better or if you prefer the day first rather than the month we can switch this around it depends on how you read dates in your country now we're going to cover an exercise we're going to see if the current date and time has passed a Target date and time so we are going to create a Target date time equals access the date time mod module we will create a new date time so now we have to pass in a date and a time for my date time let's say it's something far into the future like the year 2030 January 2nd for the hour it will be 12 30 and 1 second I'm going to get the time right now which I will name current date time equals access the datetime module access the datetime class call the now method to return the current date and time right now using an if statement I will see if our Target date time is less than the current date time have we already pass this date if our Target date is less than the current date that means this date and time has already passed I will print the following if that's the case Target date has passed else I will print Target date has not passed here's the result Target date has not passed what if I set the target date to the year year 2020 well then the target date has passed so that's how we can check to see if a date and time has already passed has it elapsed all right everybody so that is an introduction to working with dates and times using python
