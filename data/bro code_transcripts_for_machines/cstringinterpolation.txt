all right what's going on people string interpolation string interpolation allows us to insert variables or values into a string literal we precede a string literal with a dollar sign and then any placeholders within a string literal that is interpolated we can use to insert values or variables within so here's an example of where string interpolation could be useful let's say we have three variables first name last name and age let's declare those string first name make up a first name string last name make up a last name and then an edge okay so what if we would like to display somebody's first name last name and their age let's use a standard string literal first and we'll look at the differences so if i would like to display something like hello plus first name plus i'll add a space plus last name and then maybe add like a period at the end well i would have to concatenate all of these separate strings together and then let me display age two console.writeline u r plus age plus years old so this works fine but an easier way is to use string interpolation so what we're going to do is create a string literal and then preseed this with a dollar sign and then write a string normally hello wherever you would like to insert a value or variable add a set of curly braces as a placeholder and i would like to insert first name here then add a space and here within my string literal i will insert last name and then maybe add a period to the end and let's do the same thing with our second line so we need a string literal a double set of quotes precede this with the dollar sign you are curly braces age years old and this will do the exact same thing however it's less work so hello first name last name you are edge years old another thing that you can do too is that when you display one of these values you can allocate some room after the variable name add a comma and then how many spaces you would like to allocate let's say that when i display my age i would like to allocate 10 spaces worth of room to display my age and this is what that looks like you are then i have 10 spaces including the two digits in my age and if this was negative this would be left aligned so my age is all the way over here then i have eight spaces afterwards so yeah that's string interpolation it allows us to insert variables into a string literal we precede a string literal with a dollar sign and then curly braces within as placeholders for values or variables so yeah that's string interpolation in c sharp if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
