hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain a few useful methods of the random module so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay people in this video i'm going to explain how we can generate some random numbers as well as a few other useful methods of the random module now we're not going to be creating true random numbers but something called pseudorandom numbers which are fairly darn close so the first step is to import the random module at the top import random we now have access to everything that the random module has to offer let's begin by generating a random number between 1 and 6 like we're rolling a dice so what i'm going to do is say x equals random dot brand int and we can generate a random integer between a certain range if i want one through six i will state one comma six and then we can generate a random number between one and six like we're rolling a dice so if i were to print the value of x then we will get a random number between one and six for example i just got a one a two a three and a six all right we can also generate a random floating point number two let's say y equals random dot random so this will give us a random number between 0 and 1. this time i'm going to print y so we have 0.49 and some change 0.145 and 0.858 we can also generate a random choice from a list or other collection let's say we're playing a game of rock paper scissors so let's create a list i'll just call this my list equals square brackets and we will have three choices rock paper and scissors so let's say z will be the random string that we generate z equals random dot choice and we will pass in my list and let's print z so this will generate a random choice from my list called my list so we got scissors paper and rock we can also use the shuffle method of the random module to shuffle a list or other collection let's say we're working with a deck of cards cards equals let's say one through nine and we have a jack a queen a king and an ace this won't be a full deck of cards it'll just be one suit so we can actually shuffle this list by using the shuffle method random dot shuffle what do we want to shuffle we want to shuffle our cards and i will display my cards with a print statement so the shuffle method will shuffle a list or other collection for you well everybody that's a few useful methods of the random module if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments down below don't be afraid to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
