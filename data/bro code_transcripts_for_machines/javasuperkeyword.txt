hey what's going on everybody to bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be creating some superhero objects using the super keyword in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you too can become a hero and save our channel by punching the like button throw a comment down below and smash the subscribe button well okay everybody let's talk about the super keyword this refers to the super class also known as the parent class of an object that's assuming that you're using inheritance it's very similar to the this keyword this refers to the class that this keyword contains and super is referring to this object's parent class so here's an example i have two additional classes a class called person and a class called hero like a superhero that extends the person class so let's set these two classes up what are some attributes that a person would have they would probably have a name and an age so string name and edge then let's also create the constructor for this class but we'll set the parameters up later and then for heroes let's assume that all heroes have a superpower so this will be string power and let's also create the constructor for this class called hero now when we create a hero object let's say that we want to pass in some arguments so let's create our first hero object hero let's call this hero hero1 equals new hero and then we'll send some arguments to our constructor for hero so let's say we want a name an age and a power in that order so our first hero will have a name of batman and then an age of maybe 42 and batman's power is well he's rich so his power is money all right now we need to set up the parameters for our hero constructor so we need a string an integer and a string again string name ins age and string power and we are going to assign these values to each of the attributes that our heroes have so this dot name equals name this dot age equals age and this dot power equals power now the way that i have written this does work but it's actually not the best way to do this since we declared our name and age variables within the person class we should really assign these values within the constructor for the person class and with our hero class we only declared a power variable so we should assign the power value within the constructor of this specific class so what we would like to do is send our name value and age value to the super class to the constructor of the superclass and if you want to get the attention of the superclass you have to use the super keyword and the super keyword works very similar to the this keyword this refers to this class that we're in super refers to the super class also known as the parent class which in this case is person so we would like to call the constructor of the superclass person so we have super setup that's referring to our person class and now we need to call the constructor so all we do after super is add a set of parentheses and that is it and we would like to pass in the name and age value as arguments so let's do that name and age and we no longer need these two lines we can simply put these within the constructor of our superclass person and our person constructor will take care of that for us but we also have to set up the parameters for name and age string name and int edge and that's it so you can see that that error went away so when we create a hero object we're going to pass in a name an age and a power and when we construct a hero object we have our parameters set up a name an age and a power because all heroes should have a name and age and a power so we're immediately going to send our name and age values to the constructor of the super class which is person and the person constructor will take care of that for us because that's its job to assign names and age values to those variables so then we can actually print out all of these values system.out.printline hero1 dot name and let's do the same thing for age and power hero1.age and hero1.power and this should display everything batman he's 42 and his power is money so let's create another hero for another example so this will be hero2 and this will be superman i don't know how old superman is but let's say he's 43 and his power well he can do a lot of things so let's just say his power is everything and let's get rid of these print line statements because we won't need them anymore all right so one thing we can do too is use the super keyword to call a method within the superclass so let's say our person class has a tostring method to display the name and the age variables so let's create that so we need to add the public keyword to this there's a separate video on that public we're returning a string and this is the two string method and all we're going to do is return our name and our edge so return this dot name i'll add a new line just to format this plus this dot edge and a new line and we should be good so here's where the super keyword comes in let's say we have a tostring method within our hero class as well and i'm just going to copy this and make a few changes so we also have a tostring method within our hero class so what we could do is first return the name and the edge so we would like to call the tostring method of our super class so we're going to use the super keyword dot and use the to string method but we would also like to add the power that we have so we're just going to tack on plus this dot power and that's it and let's display hero 2's attributes so system.out.printline hero2.2 string and this should display all of the attributes that our hero has superman he's 43 years old and his power is basically well everything so that's the basics of the super keyword it's really referring to the superclass of an object whereas this refers to this class well that's the basics of the super keyword if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the super keyword in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a
