all right welcome back everybody the tostring method the tostring method is an inherent method of objects its job is to convert an object to its string representation so that it is suitable for display so i have a class car cars have four fields i make a model a year and a color and i have a constructor to assign some of these fields so what we could do if we would like some of this information we can override the builtin tostring method of objects that includes cars too so let's create a car object car car equals new car then i need to pass in a make model year and color let's say that this is a chevy corvette the year is 2022 and the color is blue so within a writeline statement if i type the name of my object car there's actually a two string method and when we invoke this method let's take a look to see what happens so this displays the namespace followed by the type of the object that we're working with so we can actually override this method so that when we use the tostring method we can return a string representation of this object maybe we can display the make model year in color somehow so we'll need to override this method to string so let's do that here we're going to public then to override a method we have to use that override keyword then type to string and this might autogenerate for you so we're returning a string and by default this will return base to string what we can do instead is return something else we can return some sort of string representation that's suitable for display let's say that when i use the tostring method of my car object i'd like to return a sentence that says this is a make plus model a chevy corvette so let's do something like this let's say string message equals this is a plus make then i'll just add a space plus model really you can do whatever you want and then i'm going to return this string or i could take all of this copy it and then return this is a make plus model i could do that too and that would work so when i use the tostring method it's going to return this sentence and insert make and model this is a chevy corvette one thing you can do too you don't necessarily need to directly invoke the tostring method you can just type the name of the object and that will do the same thing so this will behind the scenes called the tostring method so before when we displayed our object with a writeline statement it would display the namespace plus the type of the object but if you were to override the tostring method you can return some sort of sentence or string representation of your object that is suitable for display so yeah that is the tostring method it converts an object to a string representation that is suitable for display and really you can type whatever you want here just be sure to return a string so yeah that is the two string method if you found this video helpful please be sure to give it a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
