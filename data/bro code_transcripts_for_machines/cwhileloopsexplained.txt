all right everybody do while loops a do while loop it does some block of code first and then you repeat that block of code if a condition is true here's an example let's write a program that will ask a user to enter in a positive number first we'll use a while loop that i'll demonstrate how a do while loop would actually be better for the situation we have an integer number int number i'll write a while loop while number is less than zero we will prompt the user to enter in a positive number enter a positive number okay standard input number outside of the while loop at the end of our program let's display the number standard output the number is number so this isn't going to work normally here's why let's run this the number is zero so this is what's going on we've declared our number but have not assigned a value quite yet when we reach the while loop we check the condition if the condition is true we execute this block of code since we've declared an integer variable but have not assigned it a value it's defaulting to just zero zero is not less than 0 so this condition is false that means we skip the while loop and continue on another way in which we could write this but it's not the best solution is that we could copy what's within this block of code then run it once if number is still less than zero we would then execute this block of code repeatedly let's try this again okay enter a positive number one two three the number is one two three let's type in a negative number negative one enter a positive number negative one enter a positive number negative one so i can't actually continue until i enter in a positive number you know this does work but there's a much better way of writing this because you know we're repeating at least two lines of code when we really don't need to we need to run this block of code once and then repeat it if this condition is true well you know what would be great for that a do while loop let's eliminate these two lines of code to create a do while loop we will move this condition to the end while then our condition preceding the left curly brace write do do this code once and then check the condition make sure you have a semicolon at the end let's try it again enter a positive number i'm just going to type in a negative number negative one nope negative one nope how about a positive number one two three the number is one two three so that's a do while loop you do some block of code first then you repeat it again if the condition is true it's an optional way to repeat some code one good use of a do while loop that comes to mind maybe we're playing a game we would like to run the game once at the end of the game a user can choose if they would like to play again based on the user's input if they would like to play again we can run the game one more time repeatedly so that's a do while loop everybody i'll post this code in the comments section down below and well yeah that's a do while loop in c plus
