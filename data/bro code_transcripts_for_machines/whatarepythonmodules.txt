Hello friends it's me again today I'm going to explain modules a module is just a python file containing code you want to include in your program you use the import keyword to include a module you can use builtin modules or create your own sometimes it's useful to break up a large program into reusable separate files for a list of all the modules found within the standard python Library you can use the help function pass in the word modules and then we would need to print this here are many of the different modules available to you a few you may recognize would be math string time one of my favorite names of a module is the pickle module unfortunately it doesn't have anything to do with Pickles it's used for serialization to list all of the different variables and functions found within a module you can place that name of the module within the help function for example with the math module here are a few different variables we would have access to and a few different functions to include a module we would type import the name of the module for example math I now have access to everything found within the math module including those variables and functions to access those variables and functions I would normally type the name of the module dot the name of the variable or function such as Pi then let's print this PI from the math module is 3.14 and some change another way to import is to type import the name of the module as you can give your module a nickname an alias whatever you think of such as m m short for math we would no longer refer to this module as math we would refer to it as our Alias m using an alias would reduce some of the typing you have to use if you have a very long module name another way to import is to use from the name of the module import something specific Pi for instance you would no longer need the module name from math import Pi Pi would be included within our namespace however I tend to not use from import as much just because it's possible there could be name conflicts here's an example let's say from math import e e is an exponential constant e is 2.71 what if I was to create a program where we have four variables named a b c d a equals one b equals two C equals three D equals four then I'm going to print E from the math module to the power of a that would give me 2.71 then let's do this with b c and d e to the power of b e to the power of c e to the power of d here are the results let's say we have a different variable e e will be five then I will print e to the power of E we have imported E from the math module when we have declared all of these variables I have unintentionally reassigned E from the math module without realizing it all my results are now different and it's possible you may not realize it I like to be more explicit I'm going to import math if I'm using a variable or function from a module I much prefer to prefix that variable name or function with the name of the module in which it's from math.e to the power of a to the power of B to the power of C to the power of D math dot e to the power of our variable e and these results are to be expected Now to create a module what we're going to do is right click on our project folder go to new python file think of a module name maybe example then click python file we now have two tabs Main and example declare whatever you would like within this module let's create our own variable Pi Pi equals 3.14159 then a few functions let's create a function to square an argument that's passed in Define Square we will accept an argument which we will name X then return x to the power of 2. let's define a cube function we will accept one argument then return x to the power of three maybe a circumference function Define circumference we will accept a radius then return 2 times pi times radius then an area function to calculate the area of a circle we will accept a radius as an argument then return pi times radius to the power of 2. all right here is our example module within our main Python program let's import the name of our module which we named example we now have access to everything within this module I'm going to declare a variable result and set it to the name of my module dot Pi then I will print the result which is 3.14159 let's utilize the square function result equals example dot Square let's Square three which is nine let's use the cube function that would be 27 circumference that would give me 18.8 then area that would be 28.2 that's how to create your own module it can be useful at times to separate your program into individual files alright everybody in conclusion a module is just a file containing code you want to include in your program you use import to include a module you can use builtin modules or create your own if you do need a list of the modules available to you again you can use the help function then pass in the word modules and well everybody that's how to get started with modules in Python
