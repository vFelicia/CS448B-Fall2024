hey what's going on everybody so in today's video I'm going to show you a few ways in which we can format currency in JavaScript it involves this pretty sweet method the two local string method basically what this method does is that it returns a string with a language sensitive representation of a number depending on which country you're in you format numbers a different way for example I'm in the United States we separate every thousand's place with a comma then follow any decimal numbers on the right hand side however if you were in let's say Germany you would format it this way personally I have no idea how to read this number sorry Germany representing numbers to a foreign audience is fairly important because honestly if I saw this number it would confuse me now in today's video we're going to be covering the two local string method another way to format currency is with international number format but that's a little Advanced for us once you're at the intermediate or advanced level I would definitely take a look at international number format but that will be outside the scope of today's lesson the two local string method is a simple and beginner friendly way to format currency and other numbers so you have a number numbers have a builtin two local string method the first argument is a string representation of a location a local it specifies the language to use if you set this to be undefined you'll use the default set in the viewer's browser that's a good option for the second argument you can send an object an object of formatting options I'll give you an example let's say we have a number let number equal 1 2 3 4 5 6 789 to format this number I will take our number reassign it equal to number use the builtin to local string method we have two arguments a string location and an object let's start with the string location for a United States local that would be n for englishus Capital then we should display our number console.log number yep and there is United States formatting let's pass in a string local for India again following the same format we will change the location to be hi for Hindi Das I in based on that geographic location there's different number formatting let's cover Germany D capital de to use the viewer's default set for the browser you're going to pass in undefined so I will pass in undefined for me personally that will give me the United States formatting now you can pass in options we can can take this number with this formatting and give it a unit of currency so again we're going to reassign our number number equals number use the builtin to local string method my location will be the United States feel free to pick a different one if you would like the second argument is going to be an object we need to set a curly braces to represent an object objects can have properties properties that hold values if you need currency you will set the style property you'll set the style property to have a string value of currency the next property would be currency colon I'm going to zoom out a little bit for United States dollars that would be USD and let's see what we have there we go we have American dollars with United States number formatting let's do this with Indian rupees so again number equals number to local string the local will be hi I comma for the next argument we're passing in an object I'm going to zoom in again the style property will be currency We'll add another property this property will be currency colon space for rupes that would be I NR and here is our new number with different currency formatting okay then I think Germany uses zos number equals number to local string what's the location Germany that would be dde Capital comma space the next argument is an object the style property will be currency the next property will be currency and the currency is going to be EU for euros and that has appeared to work all right everybody so that is a beginner friendly way in which you can format currency in JavaScript
