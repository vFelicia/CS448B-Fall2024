all right welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you while a few extra things that we can do with format specifiers using a format specifier within a printf statement we can define and format a type of data to be displayed to use a format specifier you use a percent sign then follow that percent sign with a certain character depending on the type of data you would like to display let's say that we have three variables maybe we have an online store or something like that so let's say that these are of the float data type and we'll have three items for sale item one and make up some price let's say that the first item is five dollars and seventy five cents and we have item two and this will be ten dollars even and then we have item three and this will be one hundred dollars and ninety nine cents so let's display item one item two and item three with a printf statement printf and within a string let's say item one colon space then i'll add a dollar sign wherever you would like to insert a value or variable you will use that format specifier the percent sign so after my dollar sign i'll add item one so that would be percent then for floats you need f and then after the string add comma item one then let's just make sure that this works so we're going to be formatting this output what if we don't want all the zeros we can set the decimal precision of a float or double after the format specifier add a dot and the amount of digits you would like to display if i would only like to display two digits after the percent i will add point two and this will only display two digits for the amount of cents that we owe okay now let's do the same thing for items two and three so item two item two item three item three okay then let's add a new line character because i forgot so new line new line and new line much better another thing that we can do with format specifiers is that we can set a minimum field width so just add a number after the percent sign let's say that i would like to allocate eight spaces worth of room to display my number so after the percent sign but before the decimal add how many spaces you would like to set for the minimum field width let's say eight and let's see the new output okay there we go however it's all right aligned if you would like this left aligned you would use a negative sign after the percent to left align all this this would be negative whatever number you would like to allocate so the number is left justified but we still have all of this room after so that's what a format specifier is it defines and formats a type of data to be displayed so place a format specifier within a string use a certain character for the type of data you would like to display you can set decimal precision for floats and doubles you can set a minimum field width to display your output if you would like to line things up like you can see here and you can left or right align your output so yeah those are format specifiers if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
