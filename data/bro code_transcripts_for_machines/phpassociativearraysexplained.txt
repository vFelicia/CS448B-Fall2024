hey welcome back everybody today I'm going to explain associative arrays it's an array where each element is a key value pair for example we can make an array where each element is a country that's the key and the value is a capital A few other examples could be an ID and a username or an item and a price these would be examples of key value pairs here's an example let's start with a basic array I will create an array of capitals capitals equals we will use the array function we'll begin with keys each key needs to be unique I'll think of four examples we have the USA Japan South Korea then maybe India right now capitals is an array it's not an associative array to change this array into an associative array after each key add an arrow for readability I'm going to place each element on a new line it's not necessary but it's a lot easier for me to read following the arrow we will give each key a value the value in this example will be each country's respective capital the capital of the USA is Washington DC Japan that's Kyoto South Korea that is Seoul India new Delhi we now have an associative array it's made of key value pairs if you need one of the values at a given key we would then access our associative array capitals at index then place your key within the set of square brackets let's find the capital of the USA then let's Echo whatever the result is and the result is Washington DC if I change the key to Japan we will be given the value at this key of Japan to print all of the key value pairs of our associative array we'll use a for each Loop within the parentheses we're going to write something a little different first we need our associative array capitals as key Arrow value this for each Loop will Loop through all of the key value pairs let's print them Echo I'll add a placeholder let's print each key and each value then I'll add a break line here are the keys and here are the values I'll add an equal sign before key and value just so it's more readable that's how to use a for each Loop to Loop through all the key value pairs in this associative array to change one of the values we need to access this array by a key I'll change the capital of the USA to be maybe Las Vegas let's take our associative array then I would like to access using square brackets USA set this equal to some new value the new value will be Las Vegas when I run this program the value at this key is now Las Vegas that's how to update a key value pair First Look up the key then you can set the value equal to some new value to add a new key value pair we will access our associative array add a set of square brackets then place a new key within a set of quotes within the square brackets let's add China will equal Beijing there's our new key value pair the key is China the value is Beijing the pop function will remove the last pair in this array array underscore pop we will pop our associative array capitals our pairing of India and New Delhi is gone that's how to remove the last pair in this array the shift function will remove the first element array shift pass in your array the USA and Washington DC pair is now gone it's shifted out of the array if you ever need all of the keys in this associative array there is an array Keys function array keys pass in your array of capitals this will return a new array I will assign that to a new array let's name it keys then I'm going to display all of the keys within our array using the for each Loop so let's change this a little bit we have an array of keys and I would like to display as key for every key in Keys let's Echo each key then I'll add a line break here are all of the keys within our associative array if you need the values instead there's a values function array values I'll create a new array named values for every value in values print each value and here are the Capitals all of the values within our associative array you can flip the keys and the values by using the flip function array flip pass in your array within the set of parentheses this function will return a new associative array we can either create a new associative array or reassign it I'll reassign our associative array then we need to change our for each loop again so we have capitals as key Arrow value then we will display every key and every value key equals value our values are now switched with our keys the capitals are now the keys the countries are the values that is the array flip function if you need to reverse the order of your pairs you can use the reverse function array underscore reverse pass in your array this will return a new array I will reassign it the order in which we originally placed these key value pairs is now reversed India is now at the beginning the USA is now at the end then if you need the amount of key value pairs you can use the count function Echo count capitals let me get rid of this for each Loop to demonstrate we have four pairs within our associative array one two three four all right everybody so it's time for some practice I will delete everything but our associative array we'll create an HTML document so preceding our PHP script using vs code I will type an exclamation point then hit tab to create some sample HTML we'll create a text box a user is going to type in a country hit submit then we will return the value for that Associated country that capital will need a form be sure to close it right away the action will equal index.php the method will be post let's create a label enter a country then we'll need a text box input type equals text the name will be country then a button input type equals submit here we are within our PHP script we have our associative array we'll need to access whatever's within this text box I'll store that within a new variable named Capital singular Capital equals dollar sign underscore post the value we are trying to access is the name country let's see what we have so far just for testing I'm going to Echo our capital if I type in USA then click submit this should return USA to get the value associated with this key USA I will take our associative array capitals at index of a country so in this example it's USA right I can copy this post variable delete this line within the set of quotes I will place the post variable then get rid of the quotes I will reassign Capital to equal whatever value we receive so I will type in this time Japan then this returns Kyoto we could even put this variable within a sentence the capital is our Capital variable if we type India then click submit the capital is New Delhi all right everybody so that's an associative array it's an array made of key value pairs you could create an associative array of countries and capitals ID numbers and usernames or items and a price those are a few examples and well everybody those are associative arrays in PHP
