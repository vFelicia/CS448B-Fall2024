hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate a few simple animations using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey yeah let's create some very basic animations i'll create a simple box i'll use a div element and give this element a unique id of box one and within this box let's say hi and within our style sheet let's set the box one element to have a width of 250 pixels same thing goes with the height let's change the background to maybe red i'll give the font a size of 225 and text align center to use an animation we first well have to create an animation and we can do that by using the key frames rule so at keyframes and then follow this with a unique name for your animation for this first example let's have this element slide into place from the right i'll name this my slide something unique two keywords that we can add to our animation are from and two and follow each with a set of curly braces from will be any properties you would like to apply to this element when you begin the animation the two keyword are the ending properties let's have margin left begin at 100 percent so the margin on the left of our element is going to take up 100 of the width of our window and this animation will end with margin left being zero percent there will be no margin on the left of this element this will be a gradual transition between these two properties but we have to set a length of time that this animation is going to take but before that we have to specify an animation by setting the animation property to the name of your animation mine is my slide and we need to set a duration animation duration let's say that this entire animation will take five seconds five s and there we go with our keyframes there is a gradual change between these properties anything within from and two we can repeat this animation as many times as what we would like animation iteration count you can set this to 1 2 3 or infinite so this animation will loop when you set the animation iteration count to infinite a couple other things you can do too you can add animation play state and the default is running but you can set this to paused and the animation will pause in place but let's keep that at running you can add a delay animation delay maybe we'll have this begin after one second so it's been one second then the animation begins i'll keep that at zero okay this next one is animation timing function so right now our animation is occurring linearly we could have this is in so this accelerates but doesn't slow down ease out where we begin quickly and then slowly decelerate ease will do both it accelerates and then decelerates near the end or linear where it's a constant animation there is a shortcut where you can apply all six of these properties and just to demonstrate i will place all of these within one giant comment block so beginning in this order we begin with the duration this time let's say three seconds then the timing function linear a delay if you need one i will keep that as zero the iteration count that will be infinite the place date running then the animation my slide so this is a shortcut where you can combine all six of these separate properties you can also place this animation within a pseudo class in this next example i would like this element to only be animated while i have the cursor over this element so i can use a pseudo class for that so box 1 and the pseudo class of hover and i will place my animation within that pseudo class and then we should probably switch these margins around so that it slides to the right instead this animation will begin if i place my cursor over this image or we can set this to active it's going to play if i click on it box 1 colon active and then let's place our animation within it so nothing's happening until i click down on this image but once i let go the animation ends so you can combine animations with pseudo classes let's create a couple more animations how about a rotation let's name this my rotate so you can use percentages too you don't necessarily have to use both from and to let's say that once this animation reaches 100 i would like to apply the transform property and we will perform an x rotation of 360 degrees so let's set the animation to my rotate so that is an x rotation let's do this with y and let's get rid of that here is a y rotation and a z rotation let's change the opacity so at key frames my opacity okay this time we will set this to 50 then your animation will have these properties revert to what they originally were when you began the animation so at fifty percent let's set the opacity to zero so this will fade out then fade in see if i set this to one hundred percent this will fade out slowly and then snap back into place but if you set it to 50 there will be a gradual transition and then it's going to revert back after 50 let's change the scale of our element at keyframes my scale let's have our image shrink and then grow back in place using transform scale 0.5 0.5 so this will shrink and then grow and lastly let's change the colors this will be a challenge round keyframes my color change we'll go through the colors red orange yellow green blue and purple so let's have this begin at zero percent we will have the background color be red then at 20 this will be orange 40 will be yellow 60 will be green 80 will be blue and 100 will be purple actually since our element is beginning as the color red we don't necessarily need this specific portion okay let's try this my color change so we should be able to go through these colors and then it becomes red again at the end so yeah those are some simple animations in order to use an animation you have to create an animation so you use at keyframes and then come up with a unique animation name and then set some properties on what you need exactly so yeah those are some very basic animations in css if this
