hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a list box in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right you wonderful people let's create a list box a list box is a listing of selectable text items within its own container so as always we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop let's create a list box simply called list box big surprise there right so list box equals list box what are we adding this list box to we're going to place that here within the parentheses of the constructor we're adding this to our window and then we're going to follow this with listbox.pack you can also do listbox.place as well and place some coordinates but we've always done pack let's just stick with that for now all right so this is what our list box looks like it's a small rectangular box and we're going to add some text items that are selectable and eventually we'll be able to submit a choice so i have an idea let's create an online menu like we're ordering food from a restaurant let's say it's bros italian restaurant so let's add some food items to our menu and somebody can submit an order so we'll need to use the insert function of the list box to add some items so list box dot insert we place an index and a text item so let's say for index 1 we'll have pizza and this is what we end up with we have the item pizza it's selectable and well that's really it we'll need to create a submit button and populate the rest of this list box so let's add a few other items for our menu so let's say we'll have five items and we need an index for each so one two three four and five so we have pizza for the first item for the second item let's have pasta and third let's say garlic bread because garlic bread is awesome and restaurants usually have appetizers so why not soup and salad and that should be enough for this example and this is what we have we have our menu and we can select an item from this menu so let's customize the appearance of this menu well because we can so let's do that let's change the background color so we do that with the option bg for background and you can set this equal to a color of your choice or a hex value so i have a hex color value already picked out it is f7ffde and this has the appearance of i would say paper like it's kind of faded i think that would fit some sort of menu for a restaurant but pick whatever background color you want so let's change the font next so we can do that with the option font and i will pick the font constant it's somewhat fancy i think it would fit like a restaurant menu and then a size of 35. yeah we're getting somewhere we can also change the width and the height so width equals let's say 12. that's not too bad for a width let's also change the height so we can do that with a function of our list box so let's get the current size of the list box and let's actually do that after we insert all of the items within our list box so to change the size of our list box what we do is type in list box dot config you usually use config if you need to change any uh options and we want to change the length of or the height of this list box so we're going to say height equals listbox dot size function so then this will adjust the size of our list box dynamically even if we were to remove an item then the size of our list box is going to shrink just like that but let's keep salad in there for now because we need salad all right so how do we actually submit one of these options we'll need to create a submit button so let's do that after we create our list box so near the bottom we'll call this submit button submit button equals button we're adding this to our window let's set the text to submit and we'll need a command so we'll create a function called submit and then we need to pack this submit button submit button.pack now at the top of this program let's create a submit function so at the top def submit so to retrieve or get the current selected item of a list box there is a certain function that you can use so we'll begin by saying list box dot get what are we getting we want to get anything that is currently selected and there is a function for that so what we're going to do within the parentheses of the get function is type in listbox dot current it's shortened to cur selection all right and then we can either store this within a variable or we can just print this but i think we'll just print this to keep it simple now when we select an item and click on the submit button it's going to submit our order actually better yet let's actually uh print you have ordered whatever item that we select so garlic bread you have ordered garlic bread cool what we're going to work on now is a way to submit or insert an item to our list box after this program is compiled and already running so we'll create an entry box within our window where we can submit a custom item to this menu so let's create an entry box and let's do that before the submit button that would be a good spot for this so let's call this entry box where somebody can type in something to add to the menu so entry box equals entry and we're adding this to our window and then entry box dot pack then we're going to create a button called add and i'm just going to copy everything from the submit button and we'll change submit to add we're going to add an item to the menu so we'll change the text to add and command add add button dot pack then we're going to create a function called add and we'll do that at the top def add parentheses colon so to add an item to the list box first we need to get what is currently in the entry box so we can do that by typing in list box dot insert then within the parentheses we need to get an index number as well as a text item so for the number what we can type here is the listbox dot size so this will give us the current position of the index that we're currently on for the list box and then we need to get the text in the entry box so we type in the name of the entry box entry box dot get and this will insert a new item within our menu our list box so let's try it again so we can type in an item let's say soda we want to add soda to the menu and then we click add all right there's our soda but we have to scroll down to see it so let's change the size of our list box so there's actually a line of code that we did that already list box dot config height equals list box size so let's add that within the add function at the very end so then the height of our list box will adjust so currently there's no soda within our menu let's type in soda or some other item click add and then that item will appear and the size of the list box will change to accommodate any new items let's say now that we serve sushi we're now an italian and japanese restaurant now we have sushi on the menu you know what why stop there let's create a delete button to delete an item from this menu so we'll create a delete button i'll just copy everything for add and change this to delete so delete button text equals delete command equals delete as well and delete button dot pack and then at the very top we'll create a delete function so we'll do that here d e f delete and to delete an item from a list box there's actually a function to do that so listbox dot delete and then within the parenthesis of the delete function we can pass in list box dot current selection or just cur selection for short and then we want to readjust the height of this list box after we delete an item so we'll just add listbox.config height equals listbox dot size because the size of all the items within the list box is going to shrink after we delete an item so let's try this so here's our menu let's say we no longer want salad because salad is healthy well we can delete it same thing with soup and you know what let's also delete the pasta and the pizza so we're only left with sweet sweet garlic bread well ladies and gentlemen we're going to get into some more advanced stuff with list boxes what if you want to select more than one item from this list box we're going to need to change a few things so when we create our list box there is a select mode select mode and we are going to set this equal to multiple so now we can actually select multiple items from this list box like i want to select one of everything but what happens when we submit this well we're gonna run into some problems so we're going to need to change this program around so let's begin with the submit option so what we're going to do within the submit option is first get rid of this line let's say we no longer need this anymore and then before we print out the items that we ordered let's create a list called food and we'll just leave this empty for now we'll fill this later so we'll create a for loop for index in list box dot current selection what we're going to do after each iteration food dot insert our index number as well as list box dot get the item name at this index what this for loop is doing is that it's going to iterate once for each item that we select so since we have three items that are currently selected this is going to iterate three times get the index number as well as the item at that index number and now we just need to display the contents of what we have within our list of food so we can do that with another for loop so let's add that after you have ordered then for index in our list food all we'll do is print index so this will print out everything that we ordered so let's say that we want one of everything and submit this you have ordered pizza pasta garlic bread soup and salad now what happens if we try to delete multiple items so let's say we want to delete soup and salad and we click delete well we're going to run into an error because our function is not set up to accommodate for multiple items so we'll need to change a few things around so let's get rid of this line for now list box dot delete list box dot current selection and we're going to place a for loop here so for index in list box dot current selection then after each iteration what we're going to do is use listbox.delete and we're deleting the item at whatever index we're currently on so you would think this would work at first glance let's say we want to delete pizza and pasta we're going to click delete so pizza was deleted but not pasta that's because the indexes are changing after we delete an item so when we use this for loop we should actually reverse this so with listbox.currentselection we are going to enclose this with reversed so then we're going to start at the last index and work our way to zero in that order so now if we want to delete pizza and pasta i don't know why we would because they're amazing and we click delete it deletes pizza and pasta but we still have garlic bread soup and salad then we can add an item let's say we want to add sushi against the menu we can do that and then we can order one of everything because we're really hungry you have ordered garlic bread soup salad and sushi so that's the basics of creating a list box in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of list boxes in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
