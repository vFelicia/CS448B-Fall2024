well well well everybody we have a pretty important lesson today today we're going to talk about functions a function is a block of reusable code if you ever think that you're going to use some section of code more than once you might as well stick it within a function here's an example i'll create a function to sing happy birthday currently our program is within the main function to begin the program we call the main function before the main function we can create a new function for the time being we're going to type void then a unique function name the function name should be descriptive of what it does if i'm going to sing happy birthday let's name this function the happy birthday function then add a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces you can see that this is almost identical to our main function except with the main function we have a return type and return zero what would we like to do when we invoke this function let's sing some of the lyrics to happy birthday standard output happy birthday to you i'll add a new line i'll repeat this a couple times happy birthday dear you happy birthday to you to invoke this function all we have to do is within the main function type the function name followed by a set of parentheses this will call or otherwise known as invoke the function i like to think of the parentheses as a pair of telephones that are talking to each other to use a function you have to call the function call it up on the phone so when i run this code we have the lyrics to happy birthday this function is reusable i can call this function as many times as i want i'll call this function two additional times just to separate these lyrics i'm going to add an additional new line character okay we now should have three verses of happy birthday one two three that's because i called the function well three times a function is just a block of reusable code now what a lot of people do is that they'll declare and define their functions after the main function because it's more readable to many people but there's one issue with this happy birthday was not declared in this scope our programs are read from the top down since we're invoking the happy birthday function before we even know what it is well the compiler doesn't recognize it a solution to this is that before the main function you can declare functions but define them later let's declare happy birthday before the main function then make sure you add a void or a return type so void happy birthday we can now use this function even though it's after the main function a lot of people like to define their functions after the main function it's another way in which you can write it just be sure to at least declare them before the main function now check this out what if we have a variable standard string name assign this whatever your name is i'm going to use this name that's declared in the main function and use it within the happy birthday function let's replace you with the user's name happy birthday to name i'll add a new line then i'll copy this paste it and let's change this line as well all right now when i run this here's the issue name was not declared in the scope think of each function as a house the main function is your house functions outside of the main function would be your neighbors their house functions can't see what's going on inside of other functions you can't see what's going on inside of your neighbor's house you're only familiar with what's going on inside of your own house in order for the happy birthday function to use the main function's name variable it needs to be made aware of it to do that when you invoke a neighboring function you can pass that variable or some other value as an argument so within the parentheses when you invoke that function place your values or variables i would like to make my happy birthday function aware of this name variable within the main function when you send some data over to a function that data is also known as an argument however the receiving function needs a matching set of what are called parameters if this function is going to receive this data this name you need a matching parameter to set up a parameter you first list the data type we will receive a standard string then we can list a parameter name let's say name now this happy birthday function can use this name variable within the main function if you have a function declaration at the top of your program you'll have to add that parameter there as well so happy birthday standard string and we can run this happy birthday to whatever your name is functions aren't aware of what's going on inside of other functions but you can make them aware of any local variables or values by passing them as an argument but you'll need a matching set of parameters the name or otherwise unique identifier of your parameter doesn't necessarily need to have the same name so to say you can name it something else instead of naming our parameter name let's say birthday boy or birthday girl happy birthday to birthday boy and that should work the same so you can rename parameters but let's revert that back now let's pass an age int age equals make up some age i would like to send my age over to the happy birthday function so i will pass that as an additional argument separate each argument with a comma we'll send our name as well as age now we need a matching set of parameters right now the happy birthday function is only equipped to receive a name so we list the data type and age and if you have a function declaration change that there as well then i'll add one more line you are age years old then this should work okay happy birthday to whatever your name is you are whatever your age is years old so that's a function everybody it's a block of reusable code if you think you're going to perform some code more than once you can stick it within a function whenever you need it you just simply call it if you need to make your function aware of any variables you can send them as arguments to that function but you'll need a matching set of parameters in the function definition and the declaration so yeah those are functions everybody your assignment is to create a unique function and post it in the comments section and well yeah those are functions in c
