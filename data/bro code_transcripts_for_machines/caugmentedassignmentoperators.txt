hey welcome back everybody here's a super quick video on augmented assignment operators they're used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable now what the heck does that mean okay so let's say that we need to increment the value of x by one without using an increment operator we could say x equals x plus one so writing this out can be somewhat redundant there is a shortcut by using an augmented assignment operator whatever variable you would like to perform an operation on you will list that variable use an arithmetic operator equals and then some value so writing this would increment x by one so let's go over a few examples we have into x equals 10. so i could write x equals x plus 2 to increment x by 2 right or i could say as a shortcut x plus equals 2 and that will do the same thing and that's 12. now let's try minus x equals x minus 3 using the augmented assignment operator that would be x minus equals 3 which is 7. what about x equals x times 4 well that would be x times equals four x times four is forty and division x equals x divided by five the augmented assignment operator of this equation is x divided by equals five which is two and lastly modulus so what about x equals x modulus two that would be x modulus equals two x modulus 2 equals 0. well yeah everybody those are augmented assignment operators they're basically a shortcut they're used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable it's a shortcut if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
