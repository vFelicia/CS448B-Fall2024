well hello again friends today I got to explain layouts in pi qt5 we'll discuss vertical horizontal and grid layouts but we'll need the following Imports we will be importing Q label Q widget I'm going to put these Imports on a new line just because we have a lot QV for vertical box layout and I'm just going to copy this qh for horizontal box layout and Q grid layout let's be sure that we have all these Imports these classes deal with layout managers they aren't widgets we'll be writing a majority of the code within our main window class however it can get disorganized really quick what will help keep things organized is if we declare a separate function within the main window class this is a common practice that you'll see within Pi qt5 there will be a function for innit for initialize UI for user interface no other arguments besides self and for now I'll write pass when we construct a window object we will call self. init UI to initialize the user interface so anything that deals with the user interface we're going to be writing within this function to help keep our code clean and organized Norm normally we can't add a layout manager to a main window object main window widgets have a specific design and layout structure that's normally incompatible with layout managers what we would need to do is create a generic widget add a layout manager to that widget then add that widget to the main window in order to display the layout within our method to initialize our user interface we are going to create what is called a central widget called The Constructor for Q widget this is a generic widget then we will take self self is our window call the set Central widget method then pass in our Central widget when working with layout managers we will add that layout manager to the central Widget the central widget is then added to the main window So currently this is what we're working with we will need some widgets to organize because right now it's empty let's create a few labels let's say label one equals Q label I'll pass in some text number one okay let's create four additional labels 1 through five I'll just do some copying and pasting all of our labels are overlapping let's add some colors let's take label one use the set stylesheet method then pass in a background color as a CSS property backgroundcolor will be red let's copy this line of code paste it four additional times for labels 1 through 5 we have a label that is yellow another that is green blue then purple here are the labels they're all overlapping one another that's why we can only see five this is where a layout manager comes in we'll start with the vertical layout we will create a vertical layout manager which we will name V box vbox equals call The Constructor for QV box layout we are calling the Constructor we will take our layout manager call the add widget method then pass in a widget such as label one near the top here we'll do this with the other labels we'll do some copying and pasting add label two 3 4 and five there's one last step we will take our Central widget which we have declared at the top of this function call the set layout method we are setting the layout of our Central widget with the layout manager of vbox vertical box here's the new layout all of our labels all of our widgets are arranged vertically for horizontal we will use qh box layout for horizontal replace any instance of vbx with hbox for the set layout method pass in hbox this allows for a horizontal layout then we have grid Q grid layout replace hbox with grid so what we have to do with grids after adding a widget we have to specify a row and column with separate arguments the row and column both begin with zero so Row one column 1 would be row 0 column 0 for label two let's say row 0 column 1 label three will be Row one column 0o four will be Row one column 1 then five row one column 2 so here's the current layout we have labels 1 and two both within row zero labels 3 4 and five are both within the second row let's say label five is Row 2 column 2 that would result with something like this we have label five which is purple in row two column too so it depends on how you want to arrange your widgets all right everybody so that is an introduction to layout managers in pi qt5
