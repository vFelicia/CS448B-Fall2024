all right people so in this video i'm going to show you how we can read the contents of a file someplace on your computer you can either place this within the same folder as your c program or someplace else i think it would be cool if we read a file from our desktops so i'm going to create a new file and this is going to be a plain text file and i'll write a poem i'll name this poem.txt here's my beautiful poem roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rockin everywhere okay i'm going to save and then i'll need the file location of where this is located i'm going to right click go to properties and copy this file path and save it for later now to read a file on your computer we'll need to create a pointer the data type is file and i'll name this p f and i will set the sequel to then invoke the f open function pass in your file mine is poem.txt so if this file is not within the same folder as your c program you'll need a relative or absolute file path since this file is on my desktop i could use an absolute file path so preceding my file name i will paste that location and then each backslash may need to be a double backslash because that is an escape sequence for a backslash character okay the second argument is the mode this time we are going to read a file so pass in r for the second argument then it's good practice at the end of your program to close any open files we will invoke the f close function pass in our pointer do not dereference it and we will need one more thing a buffer a buffer is going to act as a container an array of characters to hold one line of our text document one line at a time so let's declare an array of characters named buffer and i'll set the size to 255 our buffer is going to hold one line of our file one line at a time and to read a single line from our file we will use the f gets function and there are three arguments our buffer this is what we're inserting a line of text into a maximum input size i'll set this to be 255 to match our buffer and then a pointer to the file that we're opening and again make sure to not dereference it so this will read a single line of text and then let's print our buffer so we're printing a string and we are displaying whatever is currently within our buffer so after running this this will read a single line of text whatever's at the top roses are red now if i need to read all of the contents of my file i can place this section of code within a while loop so with our condition i'm going to move the f gets function within the condition if we reach the end of a file f gets will return null so let's continue this while loop while f gets does not return no if we do not return null then we will print whatever's within our buffer now if i run this this will display all of the lines from my file roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rocking everywhere and if you would like you can add a little bit of file detection so before we reach our while loop let's check to see if that file even exists before we attempt to open and read it so let's check to see if our pointer equals no if it is null that means we could not locate this file so i'm going to print unable to open file and we'll create an else statement else let's read and print the contents of this file okay so let's say i get the file extension wrong let's say i'm looking for an html file named poem and i try and read this unable to open file but if we are able to locate this file we will open it and read the contents and then close this file so yeah everybody that is how to read the contents of a file line by line if you found this video helpful please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
