if you do need an mp3 file to work with for this video i recommend heading to the youtube audio library and then you can search and download a song of your choosing so after you find an mp3 file you can use a wav file too just drag and drop it to your folder containing your index.html file and then we can head to vs code now to add audio to our webpage we need an audio element so within angle brackets audio and list the source equal to the name of your mp3 or wav file we're going to need some controls so this is a boolean attribute we don't need to set the sql to anything it's either true or false and to set it equal to true you just type the name of the attribute so within the audio element type controls and up top here we have our controls for our mp3 file with these controls we can play some audio file of our choosing and we can mute here's a couple other boolean attributes we can have our audio autoplay by using the autoplay boolean attribute if you would like this to be muted originally type muted so this is playing but you can't hear it because it's muted if you need this to loop just type loop yep and it's looping you can have backup audio files just in case your web browser doesn't support a given format so if you would like some backup audio files we're going to change this around a little bit so let's get rid of our source and we'll create an audio closing tag and we will create multiple nested source elements type source source equals the name of one audio file you would like to use primarily if you have a backup let's say we have the same song as a wav file you can do that too if for some reason the browser using doesn't support these first two audio files you can always display a message this browser does not support html5 audio so yeah everybody that's how to add audio to a web page you just have to use this audio element and set the source equal to an audio file of your choosing and there's a bunch of boolean attributes that you can add to if you would like some controls if you need to set this to autoplay if you need it muted and if you need it to loop so yeah that's how to add audio to a webpage if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
