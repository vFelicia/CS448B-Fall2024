hello everybody today I will be explaining the group by Clause the group I Clause will aggregate all rows by a specific column it's often used with aggregate functions such as the sum function Max Min average count just to name a few for my example I have a table of transactions now if you've been following along in my video series I did add an additional column named order date and filled in a few dates as well as two additional rows if you would like to follow along I would recommend pausing the video adding a new column for order date add these order dates then add to additional rows that's all the data that we'll need in this topic now our boss Mr Krabs he needs us to tell him how much money he made per day what is the sum of all of the amounts per day we have three different dates January 1st January 2nd January 3rd what is the sum of every amount on these days so we can use the group I Clause that would help us we will select the sum of every amount as a column we will also display the order date from transactions then we will Group by we are grouping by our order date Group by order date column yeah look at that there we are here is the sum of every amount that is grouped by these dates here's the total amount we made January 1st the total amount January 2nd the total amount January 3rd let's try a different function how about the max function what was the maximum amount on each day these are the maximum transactions that have occurred on these dates what about men these are the minimum amounts grouped by order date what's the average order every day you're the averages maybe count how many transactions have taken place each day we have two orders on the first two orders on the second three orders on the third let's try a different column let's Group by customer ID this time how much has each customer spent total we will select the sum of every amount we will also need a column for customer ID from our table transactions then we will Group by the customer ID column this time here is the sum of every amount that each customer has ever spent we do have some rows that don't have a customer ID so we would sum those amounts as well so far the customer with an ID of three they have spent the most amount of money at our establishment what about the max here is the maximum order that each customer has placed the min the average then count here is the amount of times that each customer has ever visited our establishment what if we would like to use a where Clause well using a where Clause along with the group I Clause normally doesn't work for example I would like to display all customers that have visited more than once who are the repeat customers so if I attempt to use a where Clause where count our amount column is greater than one well we would run into an error if you need to use a where clause and you're using the group by Clause you would want to instead use the word having that would do the same thing Group by customer ID where the customer ID has made more than one purchase we are also aggregating all of the customer ideas that are null let's use the and logical operator to remove that and customer ID is not null there we are the customer that has an ID of three they have visited our establishment two times they meet the requirements of this having Clause they have visited our establishment more than once and their customer ID is not null so if you ever need to use a where Clause if you're already using the group I Clause you would instead use having so in conclusion the group by Clause will aggregate all rows by a specific column it's often used with aggregate functions such as sum Max Min average count for example you could Group by an order date what are the total sales per date or by a customer ID how many times has each customer visited our establishment those are just a few examples and well yeah that is the group by clause in MySQL
