hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain for loops in csharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay for loops a for loop will repeat some code a finite amount of times unlike with while loops a while loop will execute an infinite amount of times as long as its condition remains true for loops are limited so let's create a for loop to i don't know count a ton so let's create a for loop by typing four parentheses curly braces and within the for loop the parenthesis of the for loop there's three separate statements we're going to fill in the first is that we need some sort of counter or index to keep track of which iteration we're on within the for loop so let's declare an index int index and i will assign 0 to begin with so people usually just shorten index to simply i for short so that is the first statement the second statement is our condition when do we want to stop so let's stop when i is greater than or equal to 10. so we'll just say i is less than 10. so it's kind of like we'll continue this for loop as long as i is less than 10 and once we hit 10 we'll stop and then the third statement is how much do we want to increment or decrement our index by so you can write i plus equals one to increment by one or another variation is just i plus plus so after each iteration we'll increment i our counter our index by one and during each iteration let's display whatever i is so after running this code we will execute this for loop ten times and we will count the numbers zero through nine so if we want one through ten we can change our index to one into i equals one and we will continue this for loop as long as i is less than or equal to ten and then our for loop will execute a total of ten times and count the numbers one through ten and you can also skip iterations too like we can increment our index i by two i plus equals two now this for loop is going to execute five times we're incrementing our index by two during each iteration let's change this to three i plus equals three and this will execute four times one four seven ten okay let's do something a little bit different let's count down let's pretend that we're counting down to a new year so we'll start at 10 and count down to one then display happy new year so four parentheses curly braces we'll set index i to equal 10 to begin with we'll continue this as long as i is greater than zero then we will decrement i by one during each iteration so you can use minus minus or minus equals one either variation works okay so after each iteration we will display i then when we exit our for loop we will display happy new year within a rightline statement so happy new year let's try it okay 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 happy new year so everybody those are for loops they will repeat some code a finite amount of times unlike with a while loop a while loop will execute some code infinitely as long as its condition remains true a for loop is limited in that regard well everybody those are for loops if you can give this video a big fat thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well those are for loops in c sharp
