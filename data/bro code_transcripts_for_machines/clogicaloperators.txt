hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain logical operators in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right logical operators we can use logical operators to check to see if more than one condition is true or false we'll use two logical operators and as well as or and is represented by two ampersands and or is represented by two vertical bars we'll create a small program to ask the user what the temperature is outside and depending on what the user types in will display a custom message so we'll need to work with ranges of temperatures so let's begin we'll ask the user for some input so console.writeline what's the temperature outside and you can write this in fahrenheit or celsius but i'll use celsius okay then we'll store our input within a double variable named temp short for temperature and we'll need to use console.read line and then we'll need to convert this to a double using convert dot to double method so convert dot 2 double then within the parenthesis place your read the line method within here okay now we need to check to see if our temperature falls within a certain range using an if statement and using the and logical operator that will help us with that so let's check to see if our temp is greater than or equal to 10 degrees celsius and if our temperature is less than or equal to what about 25 so both of these conditions must be true in order for us to execute this if statement if one of them is false we will skip over this if statement so this condition needs to be true and this condition needs to be true so our temperature has to fall within that range so we will display a custom message like it's warm outside it's not hot it's not cold it's just warm let's try it okay so what if the temperature was like 35 degrees celsius while nothing appears to happen we did not execute this if statement even though this condition is true this condition must also be true because we're using the and logical operator so let's try this again and type in a temperature between that range what's the temperature outside let's say that it's 15 degrees celsius it's warm outside now using the orological operator only one of these conditions needs to be true in order for this entire expression to evaluate to be true unlike with the endological operator both conditions must be true so let's check for some extreme temperatures using an else if statement else if temp let's say is less than or equal to negative 50 or temp is greater than or equal to 50 then we will display do not go outside let's try it okay what's the temperature outside let's say that it's negative 52 degrees celsius do not go outside so even though this condition is true and this one is false using the or logical operator only one of these conditions needs to be true in order for our entire expression to evaluate to be true so let's do the same thing with a very high temperature this time what's the temperature outside let's say that it's like a kajillion degrees celsius maybe our sun explodes or something do not go outside well okay then everybody those are logical operators we can use them to check to see if more than one condition is true or false so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well those are logical operators in c sharp
