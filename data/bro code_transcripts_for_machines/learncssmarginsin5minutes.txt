hey how's it going people today I'm going to explain margins in CSS margins are the space around an element I'll create an H1 element type in your name or something that's kind of short and we'll need a paragraph I'll generate some text by typing lorem then hitting tab let me just zoom in a little bit to give you a diagram of margins I'm going to right click our H1 element and go to inspect at the bottom of my elements window we have this diagram it kind of resembles an onion because it has layers we have the element itself and its Dimensions padding border then margins padding is between the element itself and any borders margins are the area outside of any borders today we'll be working with margins the area outside of any elements let's close this window naturally there's a few pixels of margin around our body the letters in our H1 element and our paragraph aren't directly next to the border of our window so we can eliminate that we will select the body element within our CSS style sheet we will set the margin to be 0 pixels so now the letters are directly next to the edge of the web browser and if I were to expand this you can kind of see that so that's all that margin is it's the area outside of an element to give you another example let's delete our H1 element along with our paragraph we'll create two div boxes we need two pairs of developments I'll create a class for each of these divs class box then they will each have a unique id id equals box one the ID for the second box will be box two and then I'll give each of these some text box one box two all right now let's style these boxes so after our body element let's select the Box class anything that's a box let's add a border 5 pixel solid is fine I'll change the font size to be 5 em with 250 pixels height 250 pixels and I'm just gonna zoom out a little bit until our view is at 100 let me color box one in box two we are selecting the ID of box one for the background color let's set that to be red but let's select a more custom red because it's cool all right then box two will be blue all right there are marginal directions we can apply margin to the top of an element the right the bottom or the left or all sides with box one I will set the margin top property to be 50 pixels that's going to add 50 pixels of margin at the top of this element box one there's also margin bottom now there's 50 pixels a margin after box one margin left the margins now on the left margin right the margins now on the right but you can't see that because divs are Block Level elements they take up the entire horizontal space you could apply margin to all sides evenly just with margin so margin 50 pixels that applies 50 pixels of margin to the top right bottom left so if we were to apply this margin to a class like the Box class both box 1 and box 2 will have 50 pixels of margin around each element there's also margin Auto it is possible to set an element's margin to take up the entire space I can take any of these elements such as box one and push it all the way to the right of my web browser using margin left margin Dash left then I will set it to be Auto the margin on the left side of box 1 will take up as much room as possible so box one is going to stick to the right hand side of the web browser margin right won't appear to do anything because it's already left Justified now if you would like an element to stay in the center of your web browser you can just set margin to be Auto so box one is going to stay in the middle of my web page if I were to apply this property to the Box class that will affect Box 2 as well so now box 1 and box 2 should stay in the middle of my web browser alright everybody so those are margins in simple terms it's the space around an element and that is an introduction to margins in CSS
