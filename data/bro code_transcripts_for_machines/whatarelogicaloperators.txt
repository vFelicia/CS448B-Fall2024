hey guys in this video i'm going to discuss the and or as well as not logical operators we'll begin with and the and logical operator will check to see if two conditions are true here's an example we'll ask a user what the temperature is int temp short for temperature standard output this will be a prompt enter the temperature standard input temp with the andological operator we check to see if two or more conditions are true let's see if our temperature falls within a certain range if condition then a set of curly braces we'll check to see if our temperature is above zero if temp is above zero and temp is less than let's say 30. in order for us to execute this if statement both of these conditions must be true this condition and this condition must be true if one of them is false we skip over this if statement so if our temperature falls within that range the temperature is good else standard output the temperature is bad okay let's try it enter the temperature uh let's say it's 25 degrees this will be in celsius the temperature is good let's try it again uh what about negative 100 degrees celsius uh the temperature is bad yeah no kidding one more time uh positive 100 degrees celsius the temperature is bad so with the and logical operator we check to see if two or more conditions are true there's another way of writing the same program too we can use the or logical operator which is represented by two vertical bars it checks to see if at least one of two conditions are true if temp is less than or equal to zero or temp is greater than or equal to thirty the temperature is bad else the temperature is good in order for us to execute this if statement only one condition has to be true if both of them are false we don't do anything what's the temperature the temperature is 25 that's within that range the temperature is good one more time enter the temperature it is negative 100 degrees celsius the temperature is bad all right so that's the and as well as the or logical operator there's one more the not logical operator which is an exclamation point it reverses the logical state of its operand meaning if a condition is true it becomes false if it's originally false it becomes true let's create another variable this will be a boolean sunny sunny can be true or false i'll write another if statement if sunny is equal to true now if you're examining to see if a boolean variable is true you don't necessarily need to say equals true you could just type the name of the boolean variable if sunny if sunny is true we'll display a message standard output it is sunny outside else standard output it is cloudy outside okay one more time enter the temperature it's 20 degrees celsius i should probably add some new line characters there enter the temperature it's 25 degrees celsius the temperature is good it is sunny outside if we use the not logical operator we can precede a condition with an exclamation point we're checking to see if it's not sunny that means we would want to change our output it is cloudy outside else it is sunny outside let's change sunny to be false enter the temperature it is 50 degrees celsius the temperature is bad it is cloudy outside so yeah everybody those are logical operators and or not your assignment is to use either the and or or otherwise not logical operator then post it in the comment section down below whatever you wrote so yeah those are logical operators in c plus
