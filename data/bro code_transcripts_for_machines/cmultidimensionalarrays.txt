all right what's going on multidimensional arrays so just a fair warning this is a difficult topic if you want you can skip this video you won't hurt my feelings but if you'd like to know what a multidimensional array is well here we go so a multidimensional array is an array of arrays so i have three standard arrays i have different car manufacturers ford chevy and toyota so each array has three different kinds of cars a multidimensional array is good if you need like some sort of grid or matrix of data so what i would like to do is to create an array of arrays to simulate maybe like a parking lot to park all of these cars so to create a multidimensional array this will be a twodimensional array we need to list the data type of what we're storing strings then a set of straight brackets and then within the straight brackets add a comma so now i'm going to name this array let's say parking lot equals and then we add our curly braces much like what we do with standard arrays however i'm going to add each array within the set of curly braces and then separate each with a comma so this can be somewhat difficult to read i like to kind of condense it all and just make it look nice so you can see that this resembles sort of like a grid with rows and columns and that visual is going to help us so to access one of these elements we need to list an index for the row and an index for the column so let's say i would like to change this explorer to something else so in order to access this element i'm going to type the name of our multidimensional array straight brackets and then i need a row and column so these always start with zero this would be row zero row one row two i need to access row one so that would be zero then comma for column and then i need to count the row number zero one two so that would be zero comma two for this element within my twodimensional array so i'm going to change this to something else so let's say that this is a ford fusion and then let's display these elements we can use a for each loop for each the data type is string let's say car in parking lot and then i will just iterate through this console.writeline card so this will iterate nine times one for each element within our twodimensional array so we have a mustang f150 then fusion so we updated explorer to fusion so let's update maybe this corolla to something else so let's count the row number that would be zero one two parking lot two and the column number is zero and let's say that this is a tacoma and try this again okay we have instead of a corolla a tacoma now if you would like to display this as like a grid we can use nested for loops for that so let's get rid of this for each loop i'll just turn this all into one giant comment okay so to display this as like a grid we'll use nested for loops the outer loop will be four and i equals zero we will continue this as long as i is less than parking lot dot get length method and then pass in the dimension so pass in zero for the first dimension i plus plus and then we need a nested for loop so change i to j get length one so this represents the second dimension remember that these always start with zero and then change i to j plus plus so during each iteration of the inner for loop let's change this from right line to right i will display parking lot straight brackets i comma j then i'm just going to add a space to separate each car and then when we escape our for loop we need to go down to the next row so i'll use an empty right line statement so by using nested for loops we can display our twodimensional array as sort of a grid or matrix so we have our mustang f150 our fusion corvette camaro silverado tacoma camry and rav4 so if you ever need like a grid or matrix of data you can always use a multidimensional array and these are kind of the steps to set it up so yeah those are multidimensional arrays if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
