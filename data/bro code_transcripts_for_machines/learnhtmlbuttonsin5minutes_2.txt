what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you how you can create a button using html so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey in this video i'm going to show you how we can create buttons using html we'll need a pair of button tags there's an opening button tag and a closing button tag here's our button to add some text between the button tags we can add whatever text we want to the button like click me you can set this up as a hyperlink when you click on the button to do so just around your button element with a pair of a tags there's an opening a tag and a closing a tag and i will set the href attribute of the opening button tag to a url or relative file path of my choosing to make this simple let's set the url to google.com and then when i click on this button it takes me to google you can disable a button by adding a disabled boolean attribute to the opening button tag and we can no longer click on this button if you know a little bit of css you can add some css properties directly to a button by setting the style attribute equal to and list some css properties of your choosing let's change the background color you can pick a color name you can use rgb values or you can use hexadecimal values i think i'll set this to a dark gray color so maybe six threes four rgb values and hexadecimal values you can always use a color picker online so if you would like to add multiple css properties separate each css property with a semicolon and next i will change the color that's the font color and maybe i'll pick green one color i like is zero zero ff zero zero that's just a bright green color you can also round these borders too by using the border radius property so again separate each css property with a semicolon and i will set the border radius property to 5 pixels just around the corners okay cool that's a pretty fancy looking button if i do say so myself and yep it still takes us to google just by us using html this adds structure to a webpage but it doesn't necessarily add functionality that's where a language like javascript comes in when we click on a button we can have this button execute some function from a javascript file i'll show you how we can create a very simple javascript program but of course we'll cover this more in the javascript series so let's get rid of this hyperlink and have our button do something else there is an on click attribute that we can set to a javascript function so we just place the name of the function between a set of double quotes we haven't created a javascript function yet but let's say that we'll have a javascript function named do something and then follow that name with a set of parentheses and let's create a paragraph element and we will say hello and then close it with this paragraph element i'm going to set the id attribute equal to let's say test here's how we can code a very simple javascript program you're going to create a pair of script tags there's an opening script tag and a closing script tag and within the script i will say function do something parentheses curly braces so this function will perform some subsection of code so when we click on our button what do we want this program to do we will take document dot get element by id parentheses list the id of our paragraph element test dot inner html and i will set the sequel to good bye then add a semicolon at the end okay so when we click on this button it's going to execute this function do something and then perform whatever code is between this set of curly braces so you may need to save refresh your webpage and if done correctly when you click on this button it will change this text from hello to goodbye so that is a very small javascript program so there is an on click attribute that you can set equal to a javascript function but of course we'll cover more about javascript well in the javascript playlist but that's one way in which you can add functionality to a button in this video we were more focused on actually creating the button itself so yeah if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
