hey what's good everybody so in today's video I'm going to give you a lesson in destructuring in JavaScript destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays and objects then assign them to variables in a convenient way we can use straight brackets to perform array destructuring or curly braces to perform object destructuring I'll give you five different examples example one swap the value of two variables we'll have let a equal 1 let b equal to use array D structuring we need a set of straight brackets add the variables a comma B this will equal we're creating a new array on the right hand side B comma a on the left hand side of our equals we're using destructuring on the right hand side we're creating an array let's see what's within variables A and B console.log variable a then variable B so if these values are swapped we should have two then one not one and two that's example one we can use destructuring to swap the value of two variables example two we can swap two elements in an array let's create an array of colors const colors equals an array pick some colors I'll go with RGB so that would be red green blue let's add black and white suppose I would like to swap the position of the first element and the last element this first element has an index of zero this particular last element has an index of four again we're going to use array to structuring we need a set of straight brackets we'll take our array colors at index of zero comma array at index of four we want to swap red with white 0 1 2 3 4 that's the fourth index equals we're creating a new array by using Straight brackets colors at index 4 comma colors at index0 then let's print our array console.log R array of colors there we go we have white green blue black red that's how we can use destructuring to swap two elements in an array example three we can assign array elements to variables we'll declare a bunch of variables const we'll use destructuring we're destructuring an array we need a set of straight brackets we'll create some variable names first color Second Color third color I will assign this equal to our array colors let's print these variables console.log our first color we have red second color green third color blue you could combine a radi structuring with rest parameters we have two colors left let's assign that to a new array we'll use rest parameters I will name this array EXT ra colors then we will console.log extra colors and that should be a new array that has the remaining colors black and white that's how to assign array elements to variables using destructuring example for extract values from objects we'll create two people objects const person one person one will have a few properties first name will be SpongeBob last name will be SquarePants age will be 30 and a job meaning occupation not John job his job is that he is a fry cook all right let's copy person one looks like that n should be capital in last name all right let's copy person one paste it change person one to person two the first name of person two will be Patrick last name star age will be 34 person two is not going to have a job property he's unemployed using destructuring I can extract values from these objects we'll create a few variables const we'll use object destructuring we need a set of curly braces this time we'll create these variables first name last name age and job now this equals let's start with person one let's display these variables console.log first name is SpongeBob last name SquarePants age 30 job fry cook let's do this with person two Patrick Star his ages 34 person two does not have a job property person one does though our job variable is undefined as you can see here you can set default values when using destructuring if somebody doesn't have a job property we'll set job to equal unemployed let's see if that works yep Patrick Star age 34 his job is he's unemployed that's how you can extract values from objects values extracted can even have default values all right last example we can destructure in function parameters we can pass an object to a function and destructure it when it's passed in let's create a function we will create a function to display a person with the parameters we'll use destructuring we're destructuring an object we need a set of curly braces we'll receive an object such as this I'm going to invoke display person we'll pass in person one as an argument when we receive person one as an argument we'll destructure that object right away we will create a first name parameter last name age and job all we'll do is print a few lines using console.log I'll use a template string let's say Name colon space I'll add a placeholder first name and last name let's add a new line age call in space add a placeholder age then lastly job job colon space add a placeholder job we're passing in person one and D structuring it we should display name SpongeBob SquarePants age 30 job fry cook let's pass in person two as an argument name Patrick Star age 34 job is undefined again we can set a default value when destructuring if an object doesn't have a job property we will set that equal to be unemploy employed Patrick Star age 34 job unemployed then if we pass in person one again his job should not be unemployed he's a fry cook there is a job property so we do not use the default value all right everybody so those are a few examples of destructuring there's a lot you can do with destructuring you use a set of straight brackets to perform array destructuring or curly braces for object destructuring they allow you to extract values from arrays an object then assign them to variables in a convenient way and well that is destructuring in JavaScript
