hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain variables in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show do you all remember back in middle school when we learned about algebra we had to solve an equation to find the value of x and x as some representation of a number well with programming we can create our own variables but we are not limited to just numbers we can store characters words and even these things called booleans which are either true or false so i'm going to show you all how we can create our own variables in c sharp creating a variable takes two steps declaration and initialization to create a variable we first have to declare what type of data we'll be storing if we need to store a number we'll type int short for integer and we'll need a unique name for this specific variable so let's just call this x and then end the statement with a semicolon because with programming semicolons are kind of like periods when you finish a sentence okay so this step was declaration and i'll just add a note here so this step is declaration and now to assign a value we will initialize this variable so to assign this variable x a value type x equals and then some value let's say one two three then semicolon okay so we now have a variable named x and this step is initialization now you can combine these two steps so to do that we would say int let's say y this time equals 321 semicolon so we have two variables x and y so this step right here is both declaration and initialization now these variables behave as the value that they contain so let's display some of these so within a console console.writeline statement i'm going to display x and then with a second rightline statement i will display y so console.writeline y and we have one two three three two one now you can use these for like math two we could say like int z equals x plus y and then display whatever z is console.writeline z and the result is 444. so these names for these variables really aren't descriptive x y and z we can give some more unique names that describe what kind of value that these variables contain so let's say int edge and i'll assign this variable age a value of 21 and then i can display my edge within a writeline statement or use it for something so let's say console console.writeline and then i can display a message along with my age so let's say your age is so this part is within quotes to display the value of my age i will add plus edge make sure age is not within quotes because then we're printing a string literal and not the value contained within edge so this should display your age is 21. so there's more data types than just int this time let's use a double a double is really just a decimal number it's like a floating point number but with more precision there are floats in c sharp but i don't really think they're that important for beginners so with a double we can store a decimal number and int only stores a whole integer so if i try to display like 21.5 and then display it this is what happens so we'll run into a build error so with int we can only store whole integers but with a double we can store something that includes a decimal so let's say we have a double height and i'll assign this a perfectly average height of 300.5 centimeters i guess and now since this variable is initialized we can use it for something we can change the value or we can use it within a message so let's use console.writeline and i'll display my height within some sort of message let's say your height is space plus height plus another string let's say cm 4 centimeters then let's try it okay your age is 21 your height is 300.5 centimeters so a double variable can store a decimal number unlike with integers they only store whole numbers now the next data type is boolean and to declare a boolean variable we type bool then a variable name so booleans can only store true or false so this might be good if you need something that only has like two options like a light switch it's on or it's off if somebody's online that could be true if they're offline that's false or maybe somebody is alive let's say bull alive either true or false but the last time i checked i am alive so i'm going to say that is true and then we can use this boolean variable for something so let's use this within a console.writeline statement console.writeline and what should we say are you alive plus alive are you alive that is true so if i change this to false this would display are you alive that is false so that is a boolean variable it's only true or false so for practice i'll encourage you to try and type something besides true or false like the word pizza we can't shove a whole pizza into a boolean variable it can only be true or false so let's change that back okay the next data type is char it's a character a single character what about symbol char symbol and we need to place this within single quotes so let's say our character is the at sign and then let's display it console.writeline your symbol is plus symbol your symbol is at sign so make sure that this is within single quotes when you assign a value so with chars we can only assign a single character if i attempted to add like a different symbol too well this wouldn't work then see we're getting an error here so that's where strings come in with a string we can store a series of characters and to declare this we type string with a capital s string let's say name string name and this value is within double quotes so type whatever your first name is and then we can use our name for something let's display a message that says hello whatever your name is console.writeline hello plus name okay hello bro your age is 21 your height is 300.5 centimeters are you alive false your symbol is at sign let's say that we have a username and i'll say string username equals symbol plus name and then i'll display this console.writeline your user name is colon space quotes plus user name whatever you typed here okay your username is at bro those are variables they're containers for values but you can store more than just numbers you can store boolean values characters and strings and a string is a series of characters so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well those are variables in c sharp
