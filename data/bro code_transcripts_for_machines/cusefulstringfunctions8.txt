how's it going everybody it's you bro here I hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you some useful functions related to strings and C++ let's get into it this video is going to be more of a showcase of the different string functions that are available to us so we're going to be covering a lot of them if there's any that you want to see in particular look in the description for any timestamps and you can hop around if you want we're going to kick this off with the string dot length function this returns the length of a string that you specify so let me show you how this works then we're going to create a string named perhaps first name and we're not going to assign this quite yet because we're going to accept some user input now we're going to see out a prompt enter your first name and then we're going to use get line CN comma first underscore name we can use the length function to determine how long our name is and we can actually store this as an integer variable or we don't have to but I'll show you a good use so length equals whatever string that we want to determine what the length is so first name dot length and then a set of parentheses so you'll notice with a lot of these functions that they will end with a set of parentheses so pay attention to that alright so we have our length now what well I'll show you a good use then we can check to see if somebody's name is too long like if they create a username we can determine if it's too long or not we can have them choose something else so perhaps if do this within parentheses length is greater than or equal to 12 then what we will do is display a message your name can't be over 12 characters long okay else see out welcome then we'll display your first name alright let's try this into your first name I'll just type in bro welcome bro alright so that worked just fine but I just want to change something real quick because it's bothering me I just want to give him a space when you enter your name in okay let's assume that we have a very long username so let's try this again then bro my username for other things is usually bro Matias so let's use that Prometheus 4 2 0 6 9 WTF bvq that looks like a good username to me your name can't be over 12 characters long so that's a good use of the length function oh and another thing with the length function and actually many functions is that you don't necessarily need to assign this to a variable we could just take this delete it and then place this within our if statement so this would actually work just the same within less steps even though it's a little more complex I would say but it takes up less lines of code so let's try it so bro 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 let's move on to the empty function so you can use a strings empty function to determine if any characters were placed within that string and a good use of this is that if you prompt for a name and somebody just skips it by hitting Enter we can actually determine if that string is actually empty done so let's try this then we'll put this within our if statement first underscore name and we're going to use the dot empty function and then we need a set of parentheses so if the first name is empty it's going to execute our if statement if not it's going to use the else statement so we can create a prompt such as you didn't enter a name okay let's see if this actually works then and to your first name I'm just going to hit enter you didn't enter a name then let's try it again but put a name in so bro welcome bro the clear function will clear the contents of a string so it's useful if you need to reset something so in this little program I wrote we just have a basic welcome message that display is welcome and then your first name or username whatever you enter it'll say that your name has been cleared will actually clear it by typing in the string that we want to clear so first underscore name dot clear parentheses then a semicolon and then we will display that welcome message one more time then so let's see if this works unto your first name bro welcome bro your name has been cleared and then it says welcome and then nothing after that because our first name string is now cleared or update so that's useful if you need to like clear out a form or some user input just use the clear function the append function will allow you to add one string onto another so a good use for this is that imagine that you are prompted for a username and then we can actually append an email extension to the end of that to create an email address so let's create a string called email and this will hold the newly appended string so we will append our username so user name so this is the string that's getting a pendant to dot then append pred this is semicolon make sure it's outside the parentheses though all right so we can put a string in here to append to this username our first string so let's add a gmail.com email address and then we're just going to display this okay enter your user name I'll type in bro your email is now bro at gmail.com I'm pretty sure that's taken the app function will return a character at a given index that you specify so we're going to write a program that will extract the initials from a first name a middle name and a last name so let's create a chart variable so this returns a character value so we'll call this char value perhaps letter 1 equals then your first underscore name then at the next we need to place a position of which letter we want to check or extract if you want the very first character or a letter just put in a 0 because it's a computer science thing like all arrays basically or strings start at index 0 all right so then let's do the same thing for the middle name and the last name so let's call this letter two middle name ladder three last name and then let's display this see out your initials R then we will display letter one letter two and letter three okay and to your first name bro and to your middle name I'm going to make up something Mac's like maximum and last name Washington your initials are BMW and if we change the index for this app function we would actually extract a different letter so let's see what our initials are now so bro max Washington my initials are raw because it's the technically the second character within each of these string variables now so that's how you can check to see which character is at a certain position in a string and then this function will return that as a character that you can use for other things the substring function will return a portion of a string and it's called a substring so an example of this let's create a program that you'll enter in a first name and then we'll take a small sample of that and create a nickname for you so let's create a string named nick name let's say that we want to take the first three letters of your name and create a substring out of it called nickname so we'll type in the string that we want to use so first underscore name dot sub STR for substring then a set of parentheses semicolon okay so there's two things that we're going to want to fill out the first is the starting position so let's say that we want to start this substring at the first character of your first name we're going to put 0 here let's say that we want to retrieve the first three letters perhaps so we'll put three here if you want four letters then just put four so let's stick with three then and then we're just going to display this nickname let's try this and to your first name let's type in my full user name of burrow me feeis and it says your nickname is bro hello bro okay so we can actually change where we want to take our sample for our substring let's say that we want to move this to position three and we want to extend this for five characters now so we're going to take another sample of our first name our string and we'll get a different substring then so Prometheus I don't know what this is gonna be your nickname is meth like crystal meth I guess the insert function is very similar to the append function but we can take a string and then place it anywhere within another string we just have to give the position in which we want to insert this other string so this actually doesn't return anything and this insert function doesn't actually return anything it currently edits the string that you're currently working on so let's take our username dot then insert set of parentheses so there's two fields to fill out the first is the position in which you want to insert something so let's say that we want to insert a string or a character at the very first position so we're going to put 0 comma then what we want to insert let's say that we want to insert the @ symbol like we're replying to somebody so we'll just put this index at 0 then and then we'll insert this at sign this string so let's try this enter your user name bro code and it inserted a @ symbol before our actual user name at index 0 so let's place this somewhere else how about at position 3 so let's try this again fro code and to place this at symbol at position three within our string so it's kind of like we pushed these two parts of our string to the side and it inserted this right in the middle this find function is very useful because you can search for something within another string and it will return the first instance of that substring that you specify so let's create a program where we have somebody enter in their first name or a username and then we can search for a certain character or a string and return where it found that certain character so this is kind of like you're on a web page and then you can use that find feature to find some sort of text on the web page and it's going to return where it found that first instance of that certain text that you specified so it's the same concept really so this will return a integer value and we'll call this position equals we want to search our first string that was called first underscore name dot find and what we want to find we'll find a substring our variable substring all right so let's run this so we can actually decide on what we want to search for with this enter your first name I'm just going to type in bro code which search for which character I want to find any C's in here capital C's it found this character at position 3 so 0 1 2 3 that's kind of cool right so this is the erase function we can erase a portion of a string one use for this so do you know with phone numbers how they usually begin with an area code well let's prompt for the user to enter in a phone number and then we'll erase the area code leaving whatever the rest is so we'll use the string phone number dot erase then we need to place a starting position of starting index let's say we want to erase the first four characters so it's going to start at position zero and we're going to erase four characters from the string okay and then we'll display it at the end okay and to your phone number I'm just going to make up something with an area code so perhaps one zero one one two three four five six seven okay our new phone number is one two three four five six seven and it erased the first four characters of our phone number so it erased that area code basically so we're about out of time there's still many more functions that we haven't covered but if we did we'd probably be here all day so instead I'll link a resource to basically a web page that contains more functions that you may or may not be interested in but there's still a lot more that we haven't covered these are just a few and then if you have some free time feel free to browse the resource I'll give you if you want to learn a few more I'll post the source code that we worked on in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that's the basics of using string functions and C++ heyyou if you enjoyed this
