hey everybody in today's video I need to explain for Loops a for Loop will repeat some code a certain amount of times for example I will display the word hello then I will add a line break I can write code once then repeat it however many times that I want with the for Loop to create a for Loop Type 4 parentheses curly braces then place your code you want to be repeated Within These set of curly braces I would like to display the word hello a certain amount of times that's the nice thing about for Loops you can write code once then repeat it but we'll need to calculate how many times we're going to repeat it within the parentheses of the for Loop we can write up to three optional statements each separated with a semicolon the first statement is that we can create a counter it's as if we're assigning a variable a common naming convention for a counter is variable I I meaning index I can set this equal to zero to begin with the next statement is a stopping condition when this condition is no longer true we escape the for loop I would like to display the word hello five times my condition will be variable I is less than five once I is no longer less than five we will escape the third optional statement we can use to increment or decrement our counter after each iteration I will increment I by One I plus plus this code will be repeated five times here we are one two three four five instead of displaying the word hello let's display our index I then add a line break I currently holds our counter we set the counter to begin at zero and it will stop when I reaches five zero one two three four maybe we would like to start at one and continue as long as I is less than or equal to five then we're no longer beginning at zero we could change this condition to be ten we will count up to ten or one hundred we will count up to one hundred when you increment your variable you can increment by a different number like two I plus equals two we are now counting up by twos one three five seven if we change our counter to be two we'll start at two then count up by two or maybe we can count up by threes two five eight eleven now to decrement let's begin at ten our counter will be at ten we'll continue this for loop as long as I is greater than zero then to decrement take I then add minus minus so now we begin at 10 and decrement by one during each iteration or we can even decrement by twos I minus equals two so we begin at ten and we're decrementing by twos so that's a for Loop you repeat some code a certain amount of times there are three optional statements within the for Loop a counter we can declare a condition then we can increment our counter by a certain amount or decrement let's go over an exercise we will create an HTML form in vs code hit exclamation point tab that will generate some HTML code we'll create a form the opening form tag will have an action attribute of our PHP page index.php the method let's assign to post we'll create a label label close it enter a number two count two we will add a text box input type the type is text the name will be counter then a submit button input type equals submit for the value let's say start the user is going to type in a number to count up to we'll need to get that value from the text box let's say variable counter we will access the post super Global variable we would like our counter then we'll create a for Loop four parentheses curly braces we'll need our index for our for Loop so variable I equals zero to begin with we're counting up our condition will be variable I is less than or equal to our counter then we will increment variable I by 1 during each iteration during each iteration let's Echo whatever variable I is then add a line break let's see what happens let's refresh this let's count up to ten I'll enter ten Press Start then we count up to 10. if you would like to exclude zero we can set I to be one there we are we have counted up to ten or I could pick a different number like 100. Press Start we now count up to 100. now what we're going to do is count down from a number enter a number to count down from we're going to change our for Loop a little bit we will set our counter of I to equal the number that we receive our counter variable will continue as long as I is greater than zero then we will decrement I so let's save you might have to refresh let's count down from 10. Press Start and here we are we have started at 10 and we have counted down to one or I can enter a different number like 100 so we start at 100 then count down to one so that's a for Loop everybody you can repeat some code a certain amount of times you only have to write it once then repeat it however many times that you need and well everybody those are for Loops in PHP
