hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to help you get started with python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn python it's the easiest programming language to learn as well as being the most popular in the world right now and according to glassdoor the salary for new python developers in the united states is 64 000 if any of this sounds good to you well then let's get started if you need to download python go to python.org downloads and click this yellow download python button open when done check add python 3.9 or another version to path install now and then give it a little bit it stays here that setup was successful so let's close out of this our next step is to download an ide that's an acronym for integrated development environment think of it as software that helps us write other software one ide that i recommend is pycharm you can find it at jetbrains.com pycharm go to download if you would like to pay for a professional version you can click this download button but since i don't like to pay for things i'm going to use the free community version at this point we just have to follow the standard installation procedure click next you can pick a destination folder but i'll keep the default next if you would like a desktop shortcut then check this i would also recommend updating the path variable next install and then give it a minute or two then after finishing i have a desktop shortcut so i can just click on this to run pycharm let's create a new project name this project whatever you like i'm going to name this project hello world and i recommend not creating a main dot pi welcome script right now i'll show you how to do that manually and let's create if you need a python file to work with this is how to create one go to file new python file and i'm going to name this main and then click python file all right ladies and gentlemen we now have an empty python script that we can use to begin coding now if you checked this box create a main.pi welcome script and then created a new project then your main python file will probably look a little something like this but that's completely fine we can just delete this i don't know about you guys but the font is very small for me so let's change that we can change that by going to file settings editor font and you can increase the font size let's say 25 you can also change the font too what's a good one uh how about that then click apply and okay much better we can actually see something to run a python script just click the screen play button in the corner alternatively you can go to the run tab and then go to run okay so this box that appeared at the bottom this is referred to as a terminal window this will display any output that your program has and this line at the end process finished with exit code zero that just means that there were no errors in this program so currently this program doesn't do anything but let's change that let's print something let's print a message so to print a message to the terminal window type print and then add a set of parentheses and then you can type a message but it has to be within quotes either double quotes or single quotes it doesn't matter so let's think of a message i don't know i love pizza then let me run this and in my terminal window it says i love pizza to print another line just add another print statement print and then your message within quotes it's really good and well what do you know it printed i love pizza it's really good so ladies and gentlemen you just wrote your first python program by the way you can change the font as well as the font color of your terminal window by going to file settings then go to editor color scheme console font and console colors let's change the font let's say i would like whatever this font is then click apply let's change the font color too by going to console colors for any output you can click number two and select a color let's say i would like bright green that should be decent and for anything else let's say this will be a dark color so i can barely see it so then let's click apply and okay oh yeah that's much better well everybody that was your very first python program i'll post any useful links and time stamps for this video in the comments section down below but yeah welcome to coding with python
