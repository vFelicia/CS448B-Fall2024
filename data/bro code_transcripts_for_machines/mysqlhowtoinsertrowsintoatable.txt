hey everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can insert rows into a table we have a table named employees I will select everything from my table employees here are the columns we have an employee ID first name last name hourly pay and higher date to insert a row into a table we would type insert into the name of the table followed by values parentheses semicolon between this set of parentheses we will add all of the data for a row we will follow this order beginning with employee ID first name last name so on and so forth but we do have to pay attention to the data types too each piece of data will be separated with a comma let's begin with an employee ID the first employee will be Mr Krabs he's the first employee I'll give him an employee ID of one then we'll need a first name I'll put that within quotes because the data type of our first name is varchar basically speaking that's text Mr crab's first name is Eugene according to SpongeBob lore then we have a last name last name crabs hourly pay this is a decimal Mr Krabs hourly pay will be 25.50 I'm just making up numbers here higher date here's the format for a date with anesthetic quotes we will list the year followed by the month then the day I'll set Mr Krabs hired date to be January 2nd 2023 now we can execute these statements yeah here we go here's the first row employee ID one first name Eugene last name crabs hourly pay 2550 higher date January 2nd 2023 it can be somewhat tedious to manually insert each row one statement at a time let's insert multiple rows at once to do that after my set of parentheses I will add another set of parentheses each separated with a comma depending on how many rows I would like to enter so I have four employees I would like to enter I will add four sets of parentheses each separated with the combo and let me just do some formatting to make this look pretty each set of parentheses corresponds to a new row so let's enter all the data that we'll need for this table employee ID number two will be Squidward tentacles Squidward's hourly pay will be maybe a solid fifteen dollars Squidward's higher date the year 2023 January I think January 3rd is good all right so that is the next row let's work on employee number three employee number three will be a SpongeBob last name will be Square Pants SpongeBob's hourly pay will be 12.50 SpongeBob's higher date is the year 2023 January 4th employee for will be Patrick star Patrick's hourly pay will be 12.50 as well higher day 2023 January 5th okay last employee employee ID number five first name Sandy last name cheeks Sandy's hourly pay will be 17.25 she'll be an assistant manager Sandy's start date will be the year 2023 January 6th we can execute this statement to insert multiple rows all at once yep here's our table we have five rows each corresponding to a different employee we have Mr Krabs Squidward SpongeBob Patrick and Sandy I'm going to demonstrate what happens when we attempt to insert a row with missing data I will insert employee number six their first name is Sheldon last name Plankton but we will not insert an hourly rate of pay or a higher date here's what will happen so we have an error column count doesn't match the value at count at Row one we're missing data for our hourly pay and higher date you could insert just select columns that is done by adding after the name of the table add a set of parentheses then name the columns you would like to insert data into all we're adding is an employee ID first name then last name okay now we've inserted a new employee but there is data missing and that's okay we plan on hiring Mr Plankton but we have not yet negotiated an hourly pay or start date we still need to run a background check on him but we want to add him to the system at least so if you ever need to insert data into a row but you need to Omit certain columns you can simply just list the name of the columns you would like to sort data into all right everybody that is how to insert rows into a table in MySQL
