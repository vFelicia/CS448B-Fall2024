all right what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to help you get started with html so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm gonna tell you why you should learn html html is an acronym for hypertext markup language it's the most basic building block of the web it allows you to add change and remove website content and that's a good thing to know it's mandatory to know for web developers if you would like to enter that career field it's useful for software developers marketing and sales professionals if you need to edit a listing for your company business owners you could make your own website and freelancers people would pay good money for a good website heck you might as well add html to your resume can't hurt and learning html is super easy this full course is only going to be about an hour anybody can learn html even you yes whoever's watching this video learn html it's super easy what do you have to lose building a website is a lot like building a house first we need a solid foundation and we need to build a skeletal structure that's where html comes in it's the most basic building block of the web then after that we can add css css is cascading style sheets with css we can style color and change the appearance of a webpage and lastly there's javascript javascript adds functionality to a webpage so in a house this could be like plumbing heating and air conditioning and electricity so it adds functionality and when you combine these three levels you have a good functioning webpage but you need to start somewhere so that's why you're gonna learn html first what will you need you'll need a web browser use whatever web browser that you like just please do not use internet explorer and we'll also need a text editor to write html code you can use vs code sublime text heck you can even use notepad but i prefer vs code so i'll show you where to download that head to code.visualstudio.com and download the correct version for your operating system i'm running windows so i'm going to install the windows version then i will open when done accept the agreement yes i actually did read it that fast i would recommend creating a desktop icon and make sure add to path is selected next and install and then you might as well launch this bad boy so finish we are now within vs code the first thing i recommend is to download the live server extension so that after saving an html document we can immediately refresh a web page so underneath the search box for extensions we are looking for live server and install this version then after downloading the live server extension we will create a new folder under the explorer tab open folder wherever you want create a new folder i'll create this on my desktop just for convenience i'm going to create a new folder i'll name this website or whatever you want doesn't matter then select folder and within our website folder we're going to create a new file name this index.html whatever file you would like to be the home page of your website you'll want to name that as index.html when a connection is made to a website without a specific file in the url most servers by default will return the index.html file as a landing page so this index.html file will be the home page the landing page of our website at the top of our document we're going to type this within angle brackets exclamation point doc type html html documents should start with this declaration to be compliant with basic html standards it lets a visitor's web browser know that this is an html5 document and following this text will create a pair of html tags tags are the keywords within angle brackets that a web page uses to define how your web browser will format and display content and usually these come in pairs so we'll need an opening html tag and a closing html tag all of our html code will be within these html tags so the html element represents the root of an html document and there's two major sections head and body so let's create a pair of head tags head represents information about a web page and there is also body as well so create a pair of body tags the body is what you would like to display to a user the head is information about the web page one thing that we can add to the head of our document is a title so we'll need a pair of title tags and let's create a title for our website my first website and then let's save let's open this document so i'm going to right click open with live server so the title of this web page is my first website and you may have noticed that this web browser was opened with edge so you can actually change that to a different web browser and here's how go to file preferences settings underneath extensions head to live server config custom browser and select a web browser of your choosing so right click open with live server and we are now using a different web browser so i'm just going to put my web browser and vs code side by side now let's add some text to the body of our webpage type whatever you want i like pizza then i'm going to save there we go we added some text to the body of our html document and we can also use a pair of header tags so surround some text with h1 this is the largest header tag and then make sure to close it afterwards okay so then we have h2 which is smaller we have h3 h4 h5 and the last one is h6 so if you need some sort of title for your web page you can always play some text within a pair of h1 header tags before i discuss p tags we should discuss what elements are elements embody the opening tag any content within and the closing tag so for example this is a opening title tag and a closing title tag and all of these together including any content within is known as the title element so that's the difference between tags and elements tags make up a portion of elements and with that out of the way we can move on to paragraph elements paragraph elements are made up of p tags we need an opening p tag and a closing piece egg and we can type some text within these paragraph tags this is some sample text browsers automatically add a blank line of before and after any paragraph elements also if you need some longer sample text there is a shortcut type lorem then tab and that will create some sample text for you and let's create another paragraph element so we need an opening p tag and a closing p tag i would like some more sample text i will type lorem then tab and we now have two paragraph elements if you need a paragraph of information to display with blank lines before and after you can always surround some text within a pair of p tags now there's also a br element and these do not need closing tags it's only an opening tag wherever you would like to add a line break just add a br element so let's say i would like to space out these header tags well i can add a line break between each of these if you ever need a line break just use a vr element and like i said there's no closing tag with these elements there's also an hr element and i do not mean human resources i mean horizontal rule if you ever need to divide your page section by section you can always add a horizontal rule let's say that we have a title to this webpage i'll create an h1 header tag this is my website and then i'm just going to close this what if i would like to divide this webpage section by section i can always add a horizontal rule by using an hr element and there is no closing tag with this element you just type hr with an angle brackets and this will divide a section of your webpage and add a horizontal rule which looks pretty nice so that is the hr element and the last thing we're going to discuss for this topic is comments comments will not be displayed within the body of your document it's more or less a note for yourself or other developers to create a comment we need an angle bracket exclamation point then two dashes and this will create the ending of your comment which is an arrow pointing to the right so anything between these two arrows will be a comment i'll leave a comment for i don't know myself this is the best website ever so as you can see this will not be displayed within my webpage it's basically used as a note for yourself or for other people looking over this html document so yeah those are comments well everybody that is the basics of html so yeah if you liked this video please give this video a thumbs up leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you how we can have some fun with hyperlinks and html so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running sup people so hyperlinks we can apply a hyperlink to text buttons images elements of that nature whatever you would like to turn into a hyperlink surround with a pair of a tags there's an opening a tag and a closing a tag and within the opening a tag there is an href attribute that you can set to a url of your choosing so if i want this hyperlink to take me to google then i will fill out the url for google so after saving if i click on this link it takes me to google easy enough right now there is a target attribute you can open a web page in a new tab or window by setting this to underscore blank so this should open in a new tab or window but the default is self so that this will open in the same window there is a title a title is a small popup box that will appear when you hover your cursor over this link we could write a message like this takes you to google and that box should appear after you hover your cursor over this hyperlink this takes you to google let's say you have another webpage and you would like this link to take you to your second page let's change the text uh go to page two i'm going to create another html file real quick i'll go to new file let's call this page two dot html if you need to generate the necessary body of an html document if you're using vs code you can type exclamation point and then tab and let's write a message this is page two if i set the href attribute equal to the relative file path of whatever page i would like to go to then this hyperlink will take me there so these files are right next to each other i only have to list the file name so i would like this hyperlink to take me to page2.htm so if i click on this hyperlink it will take me to my other html file this is useful if you have a navigation bar so depending on the link that somebody clicks on your navigation bar that can take you to a different page and lastly you can send an email to somebody within the href attribute type mail to colon then some email address let's say fake123 gmail.com let's say email me instead and then when you click on this link it will begin the process of sending an email but we won't actually complete it so yeah everybody those are hyperlinks you can apply hyperlinks to text buttons images which we'll have some practice with in the future so yeah those are hyperlinks and html all right people here's how to add an image to a web page find or download an image of your choosing i just so happen to have a picture of shrek within your folder containing your index.html file you're going to move or paste that image within the same folder and within the body element we're going to create a new element an image element within angle brackets type img for image this is a selfclosing tag and many elements have different attributes that we can change we need to change the source attribute of this image element the source attribute is src and we will set this equal to within double quotes the name of our image mine is shrek.png and then save what i like to do if i'm working with the webpage that has a lot of images i like to create a separate folder for my images this isn't necessary but if your image is located within a separate folder we need to find the file path relative to your index.html file so i'm going to create a new folder and let's name this images it will contain all the images from my webpage then i will move my image to my images folder so we can no longer locate this image we need to find the file path relative to the index.html file to look within my images folder i will precede the image name with forward slash the name of the folder images slash the name of the image and there it is personally if i'm working with a lot of images i like to place all of my images within one folder if you decide to do that as well you just need to precede the file name with the name of the folder that it's in here's my image but it's fairly massive we can change the width and height attributes if we need to i will change the height attribute height equals maybe 200 and that's a lot smaller maybe 300 that's a little bit better the height and the width will scale proportionately with each other but you can change them individually let's change the width width equals let's say 100 what we get is an extra skinnyshrek and if i change this to maybe 600 well shrek is extra thick now so i will just only change the height attribute so that the width attribute scales proportionately now if somebody is visually impaired they may be using a screen reader to navigate a web page it would be good practice to add some alternative text that is read out loud by a screen reader so that is the alt attribute within double quotes i'll type a brief description of this image this is a picture of shrek so when you add an image it's considered good practice to add some alternative text you can also add a title too a title will be a small popup box that appears when you hover your cursor over an image to add a title set the title attribute equal to some text uh shrek is shrek see and then i'm going to save hover my cursor over the image and we can see a small popup box that has my title shrek is shreksy we can also turn an image into a hyperlink to turn this image into a hyperlink we need to surround our image element with an opening and closing a tag so open and close within the opening a tag there is an href attribute that we can set to a url of our choosing i think i'll set this hyperlink to the wikipedia page for shrek so just type in the url between these double quotes save then if i were to click on my image this will take me to the wikipedia page for shrek or some other url depending on what you type here so yeah that's how to add an image to a web page within the body element you need to add an image element and then set the source equal to the image name if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro if you do need an mp3 file to work with for this video i recommend heading to the youtube audio library and then you can search and download a song of your choosing so after you find an mp3 file you can use a wav file too just drag and drop it to your folder containing your index.html file and then we can head to vs code now to add audio to our web page we need an audio element so within angle brackets audio and list the source equal to the name of your mp3 or wav file we're going to need some controls so this is a boolean attribute we don't need to set the sql to anything it's either true or false and to set it equal to true you just type the name of the attribute so within the audio element type controls and up top here we have our controls for our mp3 file with these controls we can play some audio file of our choosing we can fast forward and we can mute here's a couple other boolean attributes we can have our audio autoplay by using the autoplay boolean attribute if you would like this to be muted originally type muted so this is playing but you can't hear it because it's muted if you need this to loop just type loop yep and it's looping you can have backup audio files just in case your web browser doesn't support a given format so if you would like some backup audio files we're going to change this around a little bit so let's get rid of our source and we'll create an audio closing tag and we will create multiple nested source elements type source source equals the name of one audio file you would like to use primarily if you have a backup let's say we have the same song as a wav file you can do that too if for some reason the browser using doesn't support these first two audio files you can always display a message this browser does not support html5 audio so yeah everybody that's how to add audio to a web page you just have to use this audio element and set the source equal to an audio file of your choosing and there's a bunch of boolean attributes that you can add to if you would like some controls if you need to set this to autoplay if you need it muted and if you need it to loop so yeah that's how to add audio to a webpage if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you all how we can add a video to a web page you'll need a video of one of these file types when i was in tokyo some number of years ago i saw a reallife mario kart racing down the street so what i'm going to do is place this mp4 file next to my index.html file and then within vs code we need a video element and we will list the src attribute equal to the name of our file that we're working with and in my case it's racing.mp4 now this video is massive so let's change the width of this using the width attribute width equals what about 500 that's a lot better but we'll need some controls to actually play this video i'm clicking on this and nothing's happening controls is a boolean attribute we only have to list the attribute name to add controls there we go we now have some controls now if you want this to play maybe in the background and you do not want controls you can always set this to autoplay so i'm going to add the controls back if you need this muted just add the muted boolean attribute so it's playing but we can't hear anything and if you need this to loop just add the loop boolean attribute and this should loop yeah there it is here's another thing that we can try let's get rid of our source attribute and we're going to create a video closing tag and we will create nested sources within our video element source src equals our video file so just in case your browser doesn't support an mp4 video file you can always create another source let's say that we have a web m file as a backup just in case that this browser doesn't support an mp4 file and if for some reason that no other sources work you can always add a note this browser does not support html5 audio so you can write it either way but if you have multiple sources you can always have backups just in case this primary source doesn't work so yeah everybody that's how to add a video to a webpage if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right welcome back everybody so in this video i'm going to show you all a few useful text formatting tags that you may be interested in we'll need some sample text to work with this is normal text we'll create additional lines of text so i'm going to surround this text with a pair of paragraph tags just so that when we add additional text they will be added to a new line let's copy this line and paste it nine additional times let's say there we go first set of text formatting tags that i'll show you is bold any text that you need to bold just surround that text with a pair of b tags we need an opening b tag and a closing beats egg this is normal text and you can see that the word normal is bold uh let's change that to bold just so that it's more descriptive of what it does okay so any text you need bold just surround with a pair of b tags the next set of tags is italic surround any text that you need italic with a pair of eye tags this is italic text we have big this is big text we have small this is small text sub for subscript this is subscript text superscript the tag name is sup like you're saying sup to somebody this is superscript text we have inserted inserted is just underlined ins for inserted this is inserted text there is deleted deleted will create a line through some text this is deleted text and there's one more it looks like i miscounted there's also marked so we use a pair of mark tags any text that is marked is highlighted so yeah those are a few text formatting tags that i thought you should know if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey welcome back in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create lists in html there's three lists we're going to talk about unordered ordered and description lists let's begin with unordered lists to create an unordered list we need a pair of ul tags for an unordered list and between these ul tags we can create individual list items and we use a pair of li tags for each item we would like to add to our list so what's an example of an unordered list one thing that comes to mind is a shopping list like a grocery list because well i'm kind of hungry right now it's breakfast time let's say that we're going to bake a pizza and we need a list of ingredients we need pizza dough so add an item between this pair of li tags and we now have one bulleted item within our unordered list and let's create another item so we can just copy and paste this pair of li tags and create a new list item what about tomato sauce and then maybe cheese and toppings point being to create an unordered list you need a pair of ul tags and with each list item you would like to add to your unordered list you just place within a pair of li tags for list item an ordered list is very similar except we use ol tags so we need an opening ol tag and a closing ol tag so by default each list item is going to be numbered so let's say that we have a todo list to add a list item we need to use a pair of li tags perhaps this is a schedule of what we have to do in the morning we have to eat breakfast that could be one list item so to add another item we need another pair of li tags then maybe we need to take a shower so each of these is numbered and they're in ascending order and then we want to what about leave for work okay so yeah that is an ordered list the order of the list items does matter and we can change the type too within the opening oil tag there is a type attribute we can set each list item to a number a letter or roman numerals if i would instead like letters i can just set the type equal to a and our list items are now marked with the letter and we have description lists we need a pair of dl tags for description lists and instead of using an li tag for each list item we use a pair of dt tags for description term and dd tags for description definition so for a term that is dt and then we add a definition to this term let's say we have a list of web dev languages for a term we need an opening dt tag and a closing dt tag and then we can add a definition to this term so that would be dd description definition between the opening and closing dd tags we can add a definition to this term let's say that this adds structure to a web page and then to create another term and definition pair we can just copy this let's add css this adds style to a web page then javascript this adds functionality to a webpage with description lists each list item is a pair of terms and definitions the last thing i'm going to show you you can create a nested list within a list so let's say i would like to add a sub list of individual toppings to our unordered list within the list item we just create a new list let's say that i would like another unordered list so i need a pair of ul tags and what are some toppings we can place on our pizza so we need a list item what about pepperoni so we have a sub list going if you take a look on the webpage right now oh then maybe what about mushrooms next i like mushrooms and peppers i guess all right people those are how to create lists there's three types unordered ordered and description lists just use a pair of appropriate tags depending on the list you want to use so yeah everybody that's how to create different lists in html if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create a table using html so sit back relax and enjoy the show everyone i'm going to show you all how we can create a table using html let's say that we have a store not an online store but a brick and mortar store and our job is to create a table of the hours of operation for our store which we can best represent with the table on our website so to create a table we'll use a pair of table tags there's an opening table tag and a closing table tag to add a row to our table we can use a pair of tr tags for table row and let's say that we'll have two rows one for the days of the week and the other for the hours of operation so within this first row let's add some headers using th tags for table header and i'll list the days of the week so we have sunday through saturday so to add another header just use another pair of th tags sunday monday tuesday you get the rest table headers are inherently bold if we would like to add some data to the second row we'll add that between the tr tags for the second row so we would like some data which is td we need an opening td tag and a closing td tag for each cell let's pretend that our store is open monday through friday nine to five and closed on the weekends saturday and sunday this first cell is for the first day sunday the first column so we are closed this day let's copy our table data element and copy it this will be for the second row monday and we are open nine to five and let's fill this in for the days monday through friday and then saturday we are closed all right let's color in these cells i'll make the first row a dark gray color so to change the color of the first row within the opening tr tag for the first row there is a bg color attribute which means background color and i will set the sequel to gray and our second row let's make this light gray so within the opening tr tag for the second row let's set the bg color attribute equal to a different color like light gray pick whatever color you want it doesn't necessarily have to be gray so within the opening table tag i will set the bg color equal to what about black cool these cells are left aligned we can center them to center the cells within a row within the opening tr tag there is an align attribute and let's set this equal to center and the text is now centered and lastly let's make all of these cells the same size this wednesday cell is taking up a lot of space let's set the width equal to maybe 100 pixels and i will just copy this and with the opening table element i will set this equal to the width of each cell times the number of cells that we have so if each cell has a width of 100 and there's seven cells i will set the width equal to 700. and well there we go all of these cells are now aligned so yeah that's how to create a table in html just use a pair of table tags for each row add a pair of tr tags if you need a row to function as a header such as the days of the week use th tags if you're filling in data for a cell use td tags for table data so yeah that's how to create a table in html if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey uh what's going on everybody in this video i'm going to show you how we can add color to a webpage so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right now here's how we can add color to a web page we'll be talking a little bit about css but we'll cover this more in depth in the css series i thought this would be a good place for us to introduce colors because we'll be able to color things like buttons and forms and whatnot here's how to add some color to a webpage within the opening tag of an element of your choosing there is a style attribute and within double quotes we can add css properties for my website i would like to change the background color to black because i think it would look cool so within double quotes list the css property you would like to change background color after the colon you can either add a color name rgb values or hexadecimal values let's just say the color black there we go we can no longer see my website let's change the font color of these individual h1 header tags again it's the same process as before style equals within double quotes list the css property you would like to add i would like to add color this time to change the font color and i will pick red there we go this time let's use rgb values so again style attribute equals the css property would like to change to instead use an rgb value type rgb parenthesis then i would recommend looking up a color picker and you can pick a color of whatever you would like uh what about blue perhaps that shade of blue so rgb values are in a group of three a triad so i will copy these three numbers and paste them within the parentheses of rgb and the second h1 header tag is now that specific shade of blue i tend to prefer to use rgb values or hexadecimal values over color names because you have more variety now let's use hexadecimal values style equals the css property of color so hexadecimal values always start with a hashtag what about green so we'll have red blue and green and i will copy this number they are in groups of six and well yeah it's green now cool right okay now let's change both the font color and the background color of this paragraph within the opening tag of this paragraph element we will set the style attribute equal to any css properties within double quotes let's change the background color first background dash color colon space i'll set this to dark gray which is 2 2 2 2 2 2 then to add multiple css properties separate each with a semicolon and this time i will change just the color and i'll use the same shade of green all right well there we go so yeah everybody that's how to add some colors to your webpage there's more advanced things we can do when we reach the video series on css but what you can do for now within the opening tag of an element of your choosing set the style attribute equal to whatever css properties you would like to add within quotes so yeah that's how to add color to webpage if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey welcome back in this video i'm going to explain the span and div tags let's begin with span span adds markup to text or portion of a document anything that i surround with a pair of spam tags i can apply markup or some effect to so in my example document i have a header and three paragraphs what if i would like this specific sentence to be i don't know red well what i could do is surround this sentence in my document with a pair of spam tags so i need an opening spam tag and a closing spam tag and that sentence ends right here and within the span tag i can change some of the attributes of this sentence um so i would like to change maybe the style i'll set the style color equal to red now you probably do want this closing tag if you do not have this closing tag your span will take up this entire section so basically that's what span is it adds markup to text or a portion of a document div is very similar except it divides a division of a document so what if i would like to change the background color of these three paragraphs well what we learned in the last video on colors is that we could set the style background color equal to some shade of gray maybe this value this does work and i could just copy this and paste it for each of these paragraphs or another way of doing this is that i can surround these three paragraphs with a pair of div tags so we need an opening div tag and a closing div tag and then i will apply this style attribute to the opening div tag and it will apply this attribute to anything between these div tags so yeah that's basically what the span and div tags do span adds markup to text or portion of a document div defines a division of a document so yeah that's span and div in html yeah let's begin so meta tags the meta element represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the title base link style and script elements metadata is data about data we can add metadata to the head of our document and this tells the web browser what our web page is about with the meta tags we place them within the head not the body so we can tell the web browser some information about our web page meta tags are self closing we do not need a closing tag meta tags do have a name attribute that we can set to one of many settings let's say we would like to add a description to this webpage and the web browser is going to read this description after setting the name equal to description i can set the content equal to a brief description of my webpage uh perhaps free html tutorial for beginners okay so that's one example of a meta tag so let's create another so meta again these are selfclosing tags and i can add some keywords for search engine optimization so name keywords content and i'll explain my web page in just a few keywords uh perhaps html separate each of these with a comma tutorial beginners that'd be good we can add a author meta name equals author content equals and then type your name so if somebody is viewing your web page on a mobile device you can have your web page scale to their mobile device by adding this meta tag name equals viewport content equals and this will set the width of our web page equal to device dash width then comma we can set the initial scale equal to 1.0 so by adding this meta tag if you were to view this webpage on a mobile device this web page will scale proportionately with that mobile device another meta tag is a char set we can tell a web browser what sort of character encoding that we're using so authors are encouraged to use utf8 for unicode so if you want to use basic ascii encoding you would write ascii here although that's discouraged authors are encouraged to use utf8 for unicode all right and the last thing i'm going to show you is that we can set our web page to automatically refresh after a given amount of seconds so meta http dash equiv is the attribute name equals refresh and the content equals how many seconds you would like to wait to have your browser refresh uh perhaps 30. okay so i'm going to open this with live server so if i set this to 30 seconds it's not going to be that visible you're gonna have to wait until we see this refresh let's set this to something more drastic like two seconds let's crank this up yep see it's refreshing every two seconds uh but let's set that back to 30. two seconds was just an example so yeah those are meta tags they represent metadata is data about data by adding meta tags we can tell a web browser information about our website such as a brief description keywords author we can set the viewport for mobile devices you can set a refresh rate stuff like that and then be sure to add meta tags to the head element of your document so yeah those are meta tags if you found this

doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can use iframes to embed web pages and other documents within your website so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey welcome back iframes the iframe element is used to embed content from another source into an html document they're commonly used for advertisements and they're easily abused with many hacking techniques so basically using an iframe we can embed another web page within our webpage or we could embed our current html document with another html document here's how we can create an iframe this is a selfclosing tag and we set the source equal to this can be an external website such as a url or we can place a relative file path to a file of our choosing so this doesn't work with many websites and i'll demonstrate that so let's set the source equal to google.com and then save and reload so google.com refused to connect that's because a lot of major websites have disabled the use of iframes since we're embedding another web page within our webpage a common hacking technique is that you can have this embedded webpage take up the entire frame of your html document your website could pose as another website and that could be considered dangerous let's say that you embed a banking website like bank of america so if somebody visits your website it's actually a facade and somebody will type in their banking information like their login credentials and you could capture that so a lot of major websites have disabled the use of iframes so you cannot pose as their website one website that i checked that does work is bing so let's switch our url to that save and reload yeah see we have embedded the home page of bing but let's change the width and height attributes because this is fairly small let's say the width is 750 pixels and for the height let's say maybe 250. so save and reload cool yeah we have embedded bing within our webpage and you can use this normally bro code now let's embed another document so let's create a new file let's pretend that this is an advertisement we would like to display within our webpage i'll name this add.html so if you're using vs code to generate an html document a plain one type exclamation point then hit tab so let's say something i'll use an h1 header tag this is an advertisement and then close it uh let's change the background color too using the style attribute and i will pick the background color property and set this to maybe i don't know that color uh then let's change the width and height for the height maybe 100 then make sure to change your source as well so we need to list the relative file path since these files are right next to each other i only have to list the file name add.html save reload cool and there is my fake advertisement embedded pages do have a border this is how to remove that set the style attribute equal to the border css property and set this to zero so i'm going to save reload and this no longer has that border so yeah everybody those are iframes they're used to embed content from another source into an html document they're useful for advertisements and they're easily abused with a lot of hacking techniques so yeah those are iframes if you learn something new be sure to smash that like button drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you how you can create a button using html so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey in this video i'm going to show you how we can create buttons using html we'll need a pair of button tags there's an opening button tag and a closing button tag here's our button to add some text between the button tags we can add whatever text we want to the button like click me you can set this up as a hyperlink when you click on the button to do so just surround your button element with a pair of a tags there's an opening a tag and a closing a tag and i will set the href attribute of the opening button tag to a url or relative file path of my choosing to make this simple let's set the url to google.com and then when i click on this button it takes me to google you can disable a button by adding a disabled boolean attribute to the opening button tag and we can no longer click on this button if you know a little bit of css you can add some css properties directly to a button by setting the style attribute equal to and list some css properties of your choosing let's change the background color you can pick a color name you can use rgb values or you can use hexadecimal values i think i'll set this to a dark gray color so maybe 6 3s for rgb values and hexadecimal values you can always use a color picker online so if you would like to add multiple css properties separate each css property with a semicolon and next i will change the color that's the font color and maybe i'll pick green one color i like is zero zero ff zero zero that's just a bright green color you can also round these borders too by using the border radius property so again separate each css property with a semicolon and i will set the border radius property to 5 pixels just around the corners okay cool that's a pretty fancy looking button if i do say so myself and yep it still takes us to google just by us using html this adds structure to a webpage but it doesn't necessarily add functionality that's where a language like javascript comes in when we click on a button we can have this button execute some function from a javascript file i'll show you how we can create a very simple javascript program but of course we'll cover this more in the javascript series so let's get rid of this hyperlink and have our button do something else there is an on click attribute that we can set to a javascript function so we just place the name of the function between a set of double quotes we haven't created a javascript function yet but let's say that we'll have a javascript function named do something and then follow that name with a set of parentheses and let's create a paragraph element and we will say hello and then close it with this paragraph element i'm going to set the id attribute equal to let's say test here's how we can code a very simple javascript program you're going to create a pair of script tags there's an opening script tag and a closing script tag and within the script i will say function do something parentheses curly braces so this function will perform some subsection of code so when we click on our button what do we want this program to do we will take document dot get element by id parentheses list the id of our paragraph element test dot inner html and i will set the sequel to goodbye then add a semicolon at the end okay so when we click on this button it's going to execute this function do something and then perform whatever code is between this set of curly braces so you may need to save refresh your web page and if done correctly when you click on this button it will change this text from hello to goodbye so that is a very small javascript program so there is an on click attribute that you can set equal to a javascript function but of course we'll cover more about javascript well in the javascript playlist but that's one way in which you can add functionality to a button in this video we were more focused on actually creating the button itself so yeah if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey everyone i'm going to try and explain everything i can about forms in about eight minutes to create a form element we'll need a pair of form tags there's an opening form tag and a closing form tag and depending on the user input that you need there is an input element and you can set the type attribute to whatever you need let's say we need some text from a user like a first name within our form there is a text box where we can enter in some user information so we should probably let the user know what we want them to type in i will precede this input element with a label let's say first name and a user can type in their first name now it is considered good practice to fill out a for attribute within the label and set this to whatever you want let's say fname and within the associated input elements i will set the id also equal to fname whatever's within the four attribute this does a couple things one if i was to click on this label this will select my input box it's also helpful for people that are using screen readers so that they can easily navigate your form there is also a name attribute when we submit this data what sort of name do we want to give that data think of it like a variable i will also name this fname as well within the input element there is a placeholder to display some default text to a user by setting the placeholder attribute equal to some text like spongebob so if i was to click within this input field and type something that will get rid of my placeholder let's create an input field for a last name and really we can just copy this and make a few changes to it so copy both the label and the input element uh let's change this from first name to last name change four as well to lname id will be lname and let's make name l name as well and the placeholder how about square pants these labels and input elements will appear on the same line to separate them and treat them as block level elements i will add each of these pairs to their own div element perhaps i'll add a line break as well okay now with forms there are builtin buttons too we will set the input type equal to reset so if i were to type in some text and click reset that will reset whatever's within my form and there is a submit button as well i will set the type equal to submit so currently our data doesn't have any place to go to so if i were to click the submit button this data is not going to go anywhere so if i need to send this data to a page i will list that page within the action attribute of my opening form element so we'll need the help of a dynamic programming language php for example we're not going to focus on functionality in this video but rather the structure of a form so if i need to send this to a php page i will list that php page within the action attribute there is also an associated method attribute two common values are get and post get is considered insecure it's going to append your data to the url of your web page so for example if i set the method to get and type in some information and click submit it's going to append my data to the end of my url so it's going to add a question mark then all of my data if you need to submit some secure information like a password do not use get i would say that this is useful for things like search boxes if a user needs to navigate your web page for maybe some sort of keyword so it's better to use post to submit some secure information but this isn't going to do anything obviously because we do not have a server set up now there is a required boolean attribute you can add if somebody needs to submit some information they are required to fill out any input elements that have this boolean attribute of required so if i just attempt to submit this without typing in anything there is a small popup box that says please fill out this field all right i'm going to go kind of quick through these next input elements just because i think we have the hang of the general context of input elements so next we have password fields you set the type equal to password so if somebody types in characters they will be hidden if you need to set a max size of your password there is a max length attribute let's set this to maybe 12 so we can type in no more than 12 characters for a password and you can also add that required boolean attribute too for an email element set the type equal to email in order to submit an email we need an at character within our email otherwise we cannot submit this information and perhaps i'll add a placeholder as well placeholder equals s pants at gmail.com so there is our placeholder for a telephone number you're going to set the type equal to tell and i do have a placeholder as well if you need the user to type in a date like a birth date there is a type date which includes an interactive calendar to select a date a user can type in a number if you set the type equal to number let's say that the user is buying something from a store there are some arrows where they can increase or decrease the quantity but we should probably place some limits they can type in basically whatever number they want they want negative one billion items so we can set the min and the max i'll set the min equal to 0 and of the max equal to what about 99 and you can also set a default value too i'll set the default value equal to 1. next we have radio buttons with radio buttons we can only select one radio button from any one group perhaps we'll have the user select a title are they a mr a miss or a doctor so i'm going to create a pair of labels and input for each option that we have so we will have a mr option miss and phd okay i will set the input type equal to radio and then do that with each of these pairs so we can select more than one because these are all not within the same group to set them all within the same group we will all have them have the same matching name let's say that the name will be title so therefore we can only select one now since they're all within the same group and that's kind of the idea behind radio buttons you can only select one and we will set an associated value of let's say mister for the first value misses for the second and doctor for the last one then i'm just going to precede all of these with a separate label uh let's say title and i will set the four attribute equal to title and within each of these radio button labels when i click on one of these labels i also want to be able to select one of these radio buttons so i will set the for attribute equal to a unique id so let's say mister the id will be mister and repeat the same steps okay so when we click on these labels we should be able to select our radio buttons nice with drop down menus instead of a type we are going to use a pair of select tags so there's an opening select tag and a closing select tag and we list individual options within the select element we'll give our user three options from this drop down menu they can pay with a visa a mastercard or a gift card and i will give each of these a value okay we now have a payment field and the user can select an option from this drop down menu and the last input type i will explain in this video is the checkbox type so let's say we have a subscribe button and you can go ahead and smash that subscribe button so just set the type equal to checkbox for well a checkbox well yeah everybody that's how to create an html form there's still some more advanced input types we did not cover but these are the very basics i would say if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
