hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the not null constraint the notch null constraint can be added to a column when you create a table whenever we enter a new row the value within that column can't be null for example I have table products we have a hamburger fries soda ice cream if I were to recreate this table I would type something like this create table products I would list the columns we have product ID the data type is integer product name the data type is varchar I believe I set this to be 25 last time then price that is a decimal we gave this column a Max size of four digits and a Precision of two any column that I do not want to have null values I will simply just add not no this is a constraint now I've already created this table so I'm not going to execute the statement but that's how you would create a table that has the notch null constraint after the column name you just type not null to add the not null constraint to a table that already exists you would instead type alter table the name of the table modify the name of the column the data type of the column in this case decimal four comma two then not null it's a little bit different than the unique constraint in the last topic so let's execute the statement that seemed to work let's add a new item to the menu I will select everything from my products table select from products let's add a new item to the menu and we will test that not null constraint insert into products values we have 104 product ID 104 will be how about a cookie I'm not going to set a price I will say null for the price maybe I'm not decided on what the price is yet after executing the statement well we have an error column price cannot be null since we said that not null constraint on the product price we can't enter a null value we could set this to be zero that's acceptable but it can't be null so yeah everybody that's the not null constraint it's a useful constraint to verify input if there's any column that you don't want to have any null values just add that constraint and yeah that is the not null constraint in MySQL
