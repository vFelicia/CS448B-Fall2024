hey how's it going everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about for loops in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you can become a hero and save our channel by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on people let's talk about for loops a for loop executes a block of code a limited amount of times compared to a while loop a while loop could continue infinitely depending if its condition remains true with a for loop this will execute a limited amount of times so before we even begin the for loop we already know how many times that this for loop is going to iterate so let's create a program for an example that will count from 0 to 10. we can do this with a for loop so this is how to create a for loop type in the word for a set of parenthesis and then a set of curly braces so with our parentheses we add a condition along with two other statements so there's three parts to this for loop the first part is that we can declare a sort of counter or index so we will declare int index and we can set the sequel to zero and then add a semicolon so what a lot of people do is that they shorten index to i it's more shorthand with our second statement this is our condition we would like to continue this for loop as long as i is less than or equal to ten because we stated that for this program we would like to count from zero to ten now this third portion we will increment our counter i by one after each iteration so our for loop at least within the parentheses has three separate statements we declare a counter or index we call it i but it's not necessary that's just a common practice this is our condition we will iterate this for loop as long as this condition is true and then we can increment or decrement our index let's take a look at this how many times is this for loop going to iterate well it's going to iterate a total of 11 times because we're counting zero as well so let's test this with a print line statement we will display our index of i so this will count from 0 to 10 and then stop so let's do the reverse now let's start at 10 and count down to 0 and then display a message such as happy new year so with our index let's set this to 10 and change our condition to continue as long as i is greater than or equal to zero and then with our index we will decrement this by one and then when we exit the for loop let's display happy new year so we will start at 10 count down to zero and display happy new year now with this statement we could increment this or decrement this by more than one if we wanted to count down by two we would write this as i minus equals two so now this will execute a total of let's see one two three four five six times another way of writing this for loop that is optional is that you can move this third statement to within the for loop and this will work much the same as it did before it's just an optional way of writing this so that's what a for loop is it's similar to a while loop except that it will execute a limited amount of times compared to a while loop that could execute an infinite amount of times with for loops within the parentheses there are a total of three statements an index that you can declare a condition and then you can increment or decrement the index by a certain amount so that is for loops if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below please be sure to do me a favor and smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
