hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys all about timer tasks in Java and at the end of this video we're going to work on a project where we can have a countdown timer that will display a Happy New Year on New Year's Eve so let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright everybody I have two definitions here for you the first is timer and this is a facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread and basically what this means is that it keeps track of the time in a background thread and then we have timer tasks and this is a task that can be scheduled for onetime or repeated execution by a timer so this is a class that contains an abstract method called run and when our timer reaches a certain point a certain time it will execute a task either once or repeatedly and we can have that task be whatever we want so we're going to have a timer task that is linked to a specific timer so let's begin by creating an instance of a timer so we're going to type in timer and let's just call this timer with a lowercase T equals new timer and this will just keep track of the time but we'll need an import so let's add that now so import Java dot util dot timer now we're going to create a timer task so let's add that to the next line so timer task and let's call this task equals new timer task then a set of parenthesis then we'll need an import for this as well so make sure that you have these two imports now an easy implementation of the timer task is to add an anonymous inner class so with this timer task we're just going to add a set of curly braces after this and then we need to add unimplemented methods and it's just the run method so this timer task is going to be linked to this timer so when time is up it's going to execute this run function here so when our timer reaches a certain point it's going to execute this run function of our timer task instance so you can do whatever you want with in this run function but let's just start with something simple for this demonstration so I'm just going to create a simple print line statement that says task is complete now what we'll want to do is link this task to this timer so we can use the schedule function of this timer instance so I'm going to add that after our timer task so type in the name of the timer dot and we can use the schedule function and there's a few options here if you have intellisense there's a few variations and different ways to do this but we're gonna start with something simple so this schedule function has two arguments a task and a time and you can see that it filled in the tasks that we're gonna use within this first argument and the second is a time so this is normally in milliseconds so if you were to set this to zero and we ran our program this run function is going to execute immediately so let's try it and our task is complete now this is a delay the second argument so if we were to set this to 3,000 milliseconds there would be a threesecond delay so you can see that it's not doing anything right now because it's waiting and once that delay is over then it executes our task so for our next example I just turned this line into a comment so you don't have to necessarily just pass in only a numeric value we can pass in a date here if we want this task to be completed at a certain date in the future so we can actually do that utilizing the calendar class so let's create an instance of the calendar class and set the date so we're gonna type in calendar and let's call this date equals calendar dot get instance and then we're going to set things such as the year the month the day the hour so on and so forth so we're going to type in the name of this instance dot set and then within parentheses we're going to type in calendar dot and there's a few recommendations here if you have in the intellisense setup so let's set the year and this is all in caps and then we're going to add a comma and we'll this for 2020 and then we're gonna do the same thing for like the month the day of the month the hour so on and so forth but I'm also gonna change the clock on my computer just to demonstrate this so let's have this task perform at like midnight this day basically so we're gonna do the same thing here and let's set the month so month and let's set this to June so that would be calendar dot June and let's set the day of the month so day of month and we'll set this to June 20th and then we'll do our of day so this is in military time so if you want midnight that's going to be zero so it's zero through 24 basically and let's set the minutes so calendar dot minute and we'll set this to zero then you can do seconds as well so ii will set that to zero and that milliseconds okay so this task is going to execute at midnight june 20th of the year 2020 so I'm actually going to fast forward the clock on my computer to demonstrate this but first we actually need to have this task so we'll add that after here so timer that scheduled task and then for the time what we're going to write is date dot get time and that's it so let's run this okay so here I changed the clock on my computer to just a minute before midnight so once it hits midnight it's going to execute this task so we got three seconds to u10 task is complete now birth they're an example we're going to use a different method of the timer class and that is the schedule at fixed rate method and what this allows us to do is to repeat a task every so often and I think this would be good for some sort of like countdown timer so let's create something like that so timer dot scheduled at fixed rate so this will take a task the time or delay of the first instance or when you want this to be executed and we're going to set this to zero for now and this third value is how often do you want this repeated let's say that we want this to repeat every one second so we'll put 1000 here for 1000 milliseconds so this run method is going to execute every second so let's create a countdown timer so we'll create a variable within here and let's call it counter and set this equal to ten and within this function let's create an if statement in place of this so if counter is greater than zero what we'll do is that we will just display whatever our counter is and then maybe add seconds and then we want to decrement our counter by one so counter alright so this is just going to keep on running so we'll want some weight to cancel our timer so we'll add an else statement and then within here why don't we display something such as Happy New Year so will system that out a print line happy new year and then in order for our timer to stop we type in the name of our timer dot cancel all right so since there's no delay on this this is going to begin immediately when we run this so let's try it so it began at ten seconds and it's gonna keep on going down until it reaches zero and then display happy new year so two one happy new year now let's take this even further so let's have this task begin right before New Year's Day like 10 seconds before New Year's Day on New Year's Eve and then we'll have a countdown timer and then once it hits zero midnight of New Year's Day it's going to display Happy New Year so we can use schedule at fixed rate and for the delay we're going to use date get time so I'm just going to copy this paste underneath for our next example and we're going to use date get time in place of our delay here and then we're going to set the day that we want this to begin so let's set this to let's set it to 2020 calendar dot December date of the month the 31st hour of the day so this is in military time so 23 minutes 59 and then seconds let's put 50 here okay so I'm going to move the clock on my computer ahead to just before this time hey you know what why don't I show you guys how to change the time on your computer so I'm currently doing this with Windows so I'm going to hover over the time right click adjust time and I'm going to set the date and time manually and let's change this to December 31st of the year 2020 1159 p.m. and let's change it and run this okay so let's see the time right now okay so we have about a minute I'm just going to fast forward this video all right everybody our task is about to begin right about now so ten seconds nine seconds eight seconds I'll shut up now so four three two one happy new year alright everybody well that's the basics of timer tasks so you can execute some block of code either once at a specific time or immediately or repeatedly either immediately or at a set date in the future so if you want a copy of all this code I'll post this in the comments down below and yeah that's the basics of timer tasks in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
