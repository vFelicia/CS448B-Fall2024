hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well in this video i'm going to explain logical operators in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right everybody let's talk about logical operators these are used to check if two or more conditional statements are true so we'll be discussing the and as well as the or logical operators there's also a third one called not but that works a little bit different and i'll explain why so let's create a program to demonstrate this let's create a program where we will ask somebody for the temperature outside and then depending on the temperature if it falls within a certain range we will print a message so we'll need to use and as well as or logical operators to do this so here i have a prompt temp for temperature equals input what is the temperature outside so i'm going to cast this as an integer data type so what if we want to check to see if our temperature is within a certain range we can use the and logical operator to check two or more conditional statements this is how we might do that let's check if temp is greater than or equal to zero zero degrees celsius and we can check another condition too if temp is less than or equal to 30 degrees celsius so we need to add a colon at the end to finish this if statement and let me just fix some of the spacing okay so with the and logical operator in order for this entire condition to be true both conditions must be true this needs to be true and this needs to be true so if our temperature is equal to or above zero as well as being less than or equal to 30 that means our temperature falls within a certain range so let's print a message such as the temperature is good today print go outside all right let's try it so what is the temperature outside let's say it's 20 degrees celsius well the temperature is good today go outside this condition is true 20 is greater than or equal to zero and temperature is less than or equal to 30. let's try a different temperature like negative 20 degrees celsius so it's really freaking cold outside right now as you can see nothing happened because our first condition was false our temperature is not greater than or equal to zero but our temperature is less than or equal to 30 so our second condition is true but our first condition was false and in order for this entire statement to be true since we're using the and logical operator both conditions must be true in order for this statement to be true now let's discuss the or logical operator we can check to see if our temperature is below or above a certain range so let's write else if temp is less than zero or temp is greater than 30. so that means it's going to be either very cold outside or very hot outside so let's print a message the temperature is bad today print stay inside all right let's try this again what is the temperature outside it is negative 20 degrees outside the temperature is bad today stay inside so with the orological operator as long as one of these conditions is true then the entire statement is true it doesn't matter if one of them is false as long as one of them is true then the entire statement is true last but not least we have the not logical operator this works a little bit different from the and as well as the orological operator because we can check one or more conditional statements instead of two or more conditional statements so what the not logical operator will do is that it'll take a conditional statement if it's true it's going to flip it to false if it's normally false it's going to flip it to true so for this example we have another way in which we could write this although it's a little more complex so if our statement is true what we can do is that we can flip it to false using the not logical operator if it's normally false we can change it to true so what we'll do is surround one or more conditional statements with a set of parentheses and precede everything within the parentheses with the not logical operator so if the statement is normally true it's going to become false using the not logical operator if it's normally false it's going to be true then let's do the same with the else if statement so surround one or more conditional statements with the not logical operator so now these roles are going to be kind of reversed so let's try this again what is the temperature outside it is negative 20 degrees outside the temperature is good today go outside so what we should probably do is kind of reverse these rolls so i'm just going to swap everything within these if statements with each other and now this should work the same as it did before but we just wrote it a little bit different what is the temperature outside it is 15 degrees outside 15 degrees celsius the temperature is good today go outside so with the not logical operator you can surround one or more conditional statements with the not logical operator and what this will do is flip it from being false to true or from true to false well everybody that's the basics of logical operators in python if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of logical operators in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
