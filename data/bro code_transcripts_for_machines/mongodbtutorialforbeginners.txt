hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to teach you everything you need to know to get started using mongodb in about an hour so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey if you'd like free stuff you should probably subscribe because I release free courses every once in a while when I feel like it that is all what the heck is mongodb it's a no SQL database management system that can manage a humongous amount of data and it's becoming increasingly popular it's favored by many big tech companies unlike relational database Management Systems mongodb uses a nosql format to store and retrieve data nosql means not only SQL it's where data is stored in various formats besides a traditional SQL table rather than storing our data in rows and columns with the table using SQL we store related data as a single document think of each document as a single row and a table in SQL data in each document is stored as field value pairs similar to a Json format but it's technically bsawn binary JavaScript object notation but it behaves very simple similarly for all intents and purposes the general idea is that data which is frequently accessed together is stored together rather than in Separate Tables because SQL joins quite frankly are a pain in the ass this is how our nosql database is arranged we have a document a document is a group of field value pairs to represent an object a collection is a group of one or more documents and a database is a group of one or more collections this makes working with and scaling our database like really really easy before we do begin there are a few prerequisites for this series we will be working with document objects I would recommend at least some experience with an objectoriented programming language of your choosing it doesn't matter if it's python Java C plus plus C sharp JavaScript doesn't matter just pick one so let's get started I will show you what you need to download all right let's get started everybody here is the installation process for mongodb so go to this website mongodb.com go to resources server on the left sidebar go to installation here's a list of different installation tutorials depending on your operating system I'm running Windows I'll select Windows let's scroll down we're looking for install mongodb Community Edition all you have to do is follow the numbered steps beginning with one we will go to the download Center I'll open this in a new tab because I don't want to close out of this window select the current version select your platform again I'm running Windows and the installation package I'll keep that the same and download pick a place to save the installer to I'll keep it within my documents folder but you choose your own place and I will open this when it's done so we're going to click next up the license agreement next complete install mongod as a service make sure that's checked next also be sure to install the mongodb compass program it's a graphical user interface then give it a couple minutes now that mongodb is installed we can finish this may open compass compass is a graphical user interface for managing our database we'll be using Compass intermittently in fact I recommend creating a desktop shortcut you just have to open it then to establish a connection you hit the green connect button I'll be using Compass intermittently just to show you how everything works let's also install the mongodb shell to install the shell we're going to go to the left sidebar and where is it there mongodb shell also known as mangosh like oh my gosh we are going to go to the download Center select the current version select your platform I'm running Windows and the package will keep that the same and download we'll open this when it's done we will unzip this folder so right click extract all we will need the file pass to the executable let's open this folder go to bin and we can copy this file location let's right click on our executable go to properties copy this file location it should be within the bin folder then we're going to add that file path to our environment variables really we can just search for environment variables we're within system properties go to the advanced tab environment variables underneath system variables let's pretend that this wasn't here click new come up with a variable name sh is good then paste that file location hit okay and close so if we go to that folder and open the executable this is the mongodb shell I'm going to make the font size a little bit bigger to establish a connection to our database type sh and that should establish a connection to clear your screen type CLS to exit type exit personally I don't like using this executable by itself I like using vs code if you would like to use vs code for using the Shell here's how if you would like to use vs code for using the Shell here's how So within vs code we're going to download the mongodb extension so go to extensions search for mongodb it should be this one we will install this extension there should be a new icon for mongodb let's click on it to establish a connection we just have to click on localhost the mongodb connection was successful then to open our terminal right click launch mongodb shell let's minimize this close out of this window pull up this terminal we are utilizing the mongodb Shell with vs code so to exit you type exit to establish a connection you can type sh to clear your screen you can type CLS and that is everything you need to know to get started
