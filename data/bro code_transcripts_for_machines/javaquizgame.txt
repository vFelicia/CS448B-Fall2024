hey how's it going everybody it's you bro here yet again and in this video I'm going to walk you through how you can design your own quiz using Java let's get into it my goal is to create a program that is not necessarily the most sophisticated or advanced but one that is more or less easiest to understand if this sounds like something you'd be interested in then let's get started it's always a good idea to plan on how you want a program to function before you actually begin coding anything otherwise you may be backtracking if you make any changes halfway through and there's a lot of potential for something to go wrong you're not function as you intended so it's always good to plan ahead before you actually begin to code anything this is what I'm planning a text field for the number question that you're on a text area for the question itself for buttons that will submit a response a through D respectively a label for each possible answer and a timer that will count down from 10 and when it reaches zero it's going to skip to the next question after you submit an answer by clicking on one of the buttons all wrong answers will be colored red or if the timer reaches zero all wrong answers will also be colored red and the correct answer will continue to stay the screen color once all questions are complete it's going to tally the results and display what you got for a score let's get started the first thing we'll want to do is to create a new project if you're using Eclipse as an IDE just go to file new Java project and I will call this perhaps quiz game and let's click finish don't create all right then under the quiz game underneath the source folder we're going to go to file new class and I'm going to make a main class and we'll check box this public static void main so we can begin the program here all right I'm going to get rid of this comment and let's create a new class so we'll only have two classes for this so we're going to click on the source folder then go to file new class and I will call this quiz and finish all right all we need to do within main is we're gonna type this quiz quiz equals new quiz parentheses semicolon all right now we no longer have to use this main class for anything we're going to do everything else within the quiz class before we get too ahead of ourselves we need to import a few things so outside of your quiz class near the top we're going to import java.awt dot event dot asterisk there's a few more import Java dot AWT dot asterisk semicolon and this is the last one import Java X dot swing dot asterisk semicolon and that's all the imports that we'll need the best way to handle this next part is to break up our quiz class into different sections will include a constructor and some methods and we'll fill these things in as we go along the first thing that we'll need is the constructor so public quiz parentheses and a set of curly brackets we'll need a method in order to move to the next question so public void next question whenever we want to move to the next question we just called this method and do whatever is within this method now we'll need an action listener to handle button clicking events so we need to include all implement an interface implements action listener so this is going to yell at us because we need to add unimplemented methods so if you don't get that notice you can just type this in to public void actionperformed anything related to button clicking is going to go within this actionperformed method we'll want to include a method to display the correct answer so public void display answer parentheses set of curly brackets and lastly we want a method to display the final results public void results parentheses and a set of curly brackets we'll be filling in these methods as we go along so these are all the methods that will need will need a constructor for the quiz a method for next question a method for action performed a method for display answer and a method for the results so there should be a total of five methods okay well step one is complete we now have the framework or skeleton of our program and we're going to start filling things in we're going to be initializing and declaring a few things within the quiz class but before the constructor the first thing that we're going to add is an array of strings that will hold all of the questions that we want to ask so this will be of the string datatype it's going to be an array so we need be straight brackets and let's call this questions equals then a set of curly brackets then add a semicolon at the end and I'm going to line these up because it bothers me if they're not lined up and we can start asking some questions just put them within double quotes so pick whatever questions you want to ask but then here I have a few picked out for myself which company created Java and then separate each question that you want to ask with a comma and then you can ask another which year was Java created and then I'll ask one more there's not really a limit to how many you can ask this is going to be a dynamic program so it's going to adjust based on how many questions you want to ask and I'll ask one more we'll keep it simple at 3 what was Java origionally called all right and then on the last question you don't need to add a comma so these are all the questions we're going to ask we're going to store them within an array of strings the next thing that we'll need is a 2d array of strings to hold all the different possibilities for answers for every question that we have so this is going to be able to string datatype and we need two sets of straight brackets because it's a 2d array and let's call this options these are all the different options for answers equals and then a set of curly brackets and then add a semicolon at the end I'm going to line these up and then we can start filling this in this 2d array is basically an array of arrays so our first array is going to be all the different answers for our first question so we need a set of curly brackets that will function as the first array to hold all of the different answers for the first question so I'm just going to start typing in some company names for our first question so one of them was Sun micro systems and then separate each string with a comma Starbucks let's see Microsoft and alphabet all right so this is our first array we need to create another array for the next question and then we'll have a total of 3 for this example so we need to separate each array with a comma and honestly I'm just going to copy this and change a few things so this next array is for the second question which year was Java created and I'll start filling this in with a few answers so 1989 1996 1972 well let me fix that 1972 and 1492 and let's create the last array for the last question that we have what was Java originally called the answers I have listed were apple latte oak and coughing and then we do not need this comma for the end of the last array all right so we have our 2d array of strings that holds all the different answers while options for answers for all the different questions that we have now what we'll need is an array of characters or you can do strings to hold all the different correct answers so this will be an array of characters so charred then a set of straight brackets then we'll call this answers and they will hold the correct answers and this will be an array so we need this within a set of curly brackets I'm going to line this up all right and then if we're assigning char values these are within single quotes and I will list the first correct answer so it's going to be option a sun microsystems we'll need to separate each with a comma B is the second correct answer for the second question 1996 and the last question is C for what was Java originally called and it was originally called oak so just to verify everything we have an array of questions a 2d array of different options and then an array of characters that will hold all of the answers and another cool thing with this program is that it's dynamic if we were to either take out answers or questions and added some in it's going to function just the same so actually let's add another question here who is credited with creating Java so make sure that if you're adding another question you need to make sure that you have a comma we'll need another array for our options and let's start filling some of these in Steve Jobs Bill Gates James Gosling and the last one Mark Zuckerberg and we'll also need to add in one more answer and the correct answer for the last question who is credited with creating Java that is gosling if you've written your questions options and answers and have them picked out we can continue on with the rest of this program so we're going to be declaring and assigning a few things so make sure that you write these within the quiz class but before the constructor the first thing that we'll declare is a guess and let's make this a chart data type this will hold whatever our guess is going to be another chart value to hold the answer we'll need some sort of index so this will be of the int data type we'll need an int value to hold the correct number of guesses that we've had and let's assign this value right away of 0 will need a total number of questions so I'll write total underscore questions and we can actually set this to questions dot length and this will it just depending on how many questions that we have within our array of strings named questions so if we were to add another question this questions dot length would change from four and go to five so this adjusts dynamically we'll need an integer to hold a result will also be implementing a timer so we'll want an integer to hold the current amount of seconds and we can count down from a number such as ten but if we want to adjust this weekend now for this next part still within the quiz class but before the constructor we're going to be creating and initializing some GUI components so the first thing that we'll need is a frame to actually hold everything so I'm going to type J frame frame equals new J print parenthesis semicolon will create a jtextfield this will hold the current question that we're on so J text field you might have to watch the capitalization here text field equals new J text field parentheses semicolon we'll need a text area to hold the current question so J text area text area you Will's new J text area parentheses semicolon we're going to create a few buttons so J button I'll call this first one button a equals nu J button parentheses then a semicolon and I'm going to copy this and paste this a few times I'll include perhaps four buttons so a button a button B button C and button D and we'll create a few labels to hold all of the different answers so J label and I'll call this answer underscore label a equals nu J label parenthesis semicolon so this is the label for answer a I'm going to copy this and paste it a few times I'll change this to answer label B answer label C and answer labeled D I'm going to create two labels for the timer so J label and I'll call this first one time label all this will do is just display the word timer or something so J label print the seas semicolon and we'll create another label and this will be called seconds underscore left so this will function as a display for the countdown timer so new j label parenthesis and then a semicolon alright these are the last two these will appear after we calculate the results so it's going to be a J text field number underscore write equals nu J text field parentheses semicolon and this is the last one it's also a jtextfield so J text field and this is called percentage and this will display what you got for a percentage on your score nu J text field sieze semicolon the last thing that we'll need to initialize before the constructor is the timer but I think we're going to do that last we want to be sure that everything else is working first and with these variables and these GUI components since we declared these outside of the constructor but within the quiz class they're more or less acting as global variables so we can access these and make any changes to them anywhere within our program which we will be doing within each of these individual methods okay the next step is that within the constructor of the quiz class we're going to start designing some of these GUI components that we have so let's begin with the frame so at the very top we're going to type frame dot set default close operation and then within this within the parentheses we're going to type J frame dot exit on close all right we need to set a size for this frame so frame dot set size parenthesis and then a semicolon and then feel free to adjust some of these values depending on how you want to design your own quiz I'm just going to use a few that I liked so 650 by 650 is a decent size for me and at the very end of our constructor we're going to type frame dot set visible then put true within the parentheses and I'll give us some room because we're going to be filling in a lot between these two lines so let's test this out all right here is our frame it is 650 by 650 you can change the background color well type frame dot get content pay in parentheses and then dot set background parentheses and then within here I'll type new color and then a set of parentheses now within the parentheses of this color these are RGB values so you can pick whatever color you want if you know how they work if you pick 50 50 50 this is like a nice dark color so let's try it all right yeah and the background of our frame is now this darkish black gray color feel free to mess with these colors and change this to whatever you want this is just what I prefer this dark ELA looking color theme it's because I feel like I'm gonna pretend to lead hacker now I do not want to use a layout manager so I'm just going to type frame dot set layout and then within parenthesis I'll just type null because I want to size everything and place them on the frame by hand and this next part is optional you can save frame dot set resizable false if you do not want people to adjust the size of your frame so let's run this and try it alright here's our frame it's that color we wanted and we cannot resize this window okay well we have our frame let's create our text field that's going to hold the number question we're currently on so we'll type text field and we're going to set the bounds first so set bounds will determine where this text field is going to be placed as well as the height and the width of our text field so if I want this in the top left corner we're going to put the xcoordinate at 0 ycoordinate is 0 I want this to be 650 pixels long and for the height perhaps 50 pixels let's set the background color text field actually I think I'm just gonna copy this to save a little bit of time text field dot set background okay then within here new color another set of parentheses and this is again another RGB value if I want like a blackish color I'll just type 25 25 25 but feel free to place whatever color you want here next is the foreground color and that is set foreground and it's gonna be the same process as what we did with the background so new color and I think for the RGB value I'm going to pick like a green color so perhaps 25 fifty five and zero so that's going to look green let's change the font so text field dot set font parentheses semicolon at the end and within the parentheses we're going to type new font parentheses and there's three parameters that we can fill out the first is the font type and I like the font ink free it's like it's handwritten okay in the next field we can type some sort of style like if we want just plain text we can type let's see it's font dot plain otherwise you can change this to italic or bold but I think I'll keep a bold and then the third is the font size and I think I will pick 30 next line let's set the border so text field dot set border parentheses semicolon within the parentheses we're going to type border factorio dot then there's a bunch of different borders that you can pick from this is one that I like it is create bevel border and within parentheses I'm just going to type one next line we can set the horizontal alignment so let's Center the text on our text field so text field dot set horizontal alignment I'm just going to click on this because I don't want to type the whole thing so I'm lazy and then within parentheses J text field dot Center you can also have this centered someplace else as well make sure to get the capitalization right so the J T and F are capital okay then we do not want people to edit this so we're going to type text field dot set editable within parentheses false and let's add our text field to our frame just to try things out so frame dot add within parentheses text field okay let's see what this looks like so far okay here's our text field it's this black bar at the top of our window and let's add sample text so text field dot set text parentheses semicolon within the parentheses we're going to type just some testing text or something we're going to get rid of this right after so I just want to be sure that this works yeah looks good enough to me everything's working fine well it's delete this and move on to the next section all right well since I'm so lazy I'm actually just going to copy this and we're going to paste it and then change a few things so this was our text area so this is going to hold the actual question well at least display it so let's change text field to text area and just make a few other minor changes so we have the balance but we're going to want to change these so let's move this down perhaps 50 pixels so this is going to be displayed right under the text field 650s are good with same with the height all right now we need to set line wrap so text area dot set line wrap so in case the text goes off the screen or off the text area it's going to wrap around to the next line we're going to set this to true we're also going to set wrap style word and set this to true I'm going to change the font size slightly let's bring it down to perhaps 25 and we cannot actually align text areas so I'm going to get rid of this line then let's add our text area to our frame so frame dot add text area and let's see what we have so far okay here's our text area it's this second black bar let's add some sample text so text area dot set text and let's add some sample text and we're just going to delete this right away all right we know that this is working this is going to display our question I'm going to get rid of the sample text and actually I think I'm going to change the font type another font that I like is MV boliya it's a little bit easier to read than ink free but I like ink free just because it looks handwritten and I am going to keep this at 25 okay it looks like everything's good for the text area let's move on to the buttons so let's create the first button and that was called button a and we'll set the bounds set bounds the first field is the starting position that's the x coordinate so let's set this to zero the second position is the y coordinate so let's start this where y equals 100 let's make the button 100 by 100 pixels all right then let's set the font so button a dot set font new font parentheses and then we can pick a font within here I think I'm going to keep this MV Boley I'm actually going to copy this to save a little bit of time alright so MV Bohle font bold and I will make this 35 because this is only going to contain one letter all right let's say button a dot set focusable false sometimes when you click a button it's highlighted this will prevent that then we need to add a action listener to this button so button a dot add action listener and we're going to type this the word this within parenthesis all right let's copy this and just make a few changes so this is button B now okay and we will want to change the balance so it's in a slightly different location so let's move this down 100 pixels alright let's copy this and make button C so this is all button see now and we'll move this down 100 pixels and lastly button D and let's move this down to where Y is 400 and then we need to add all these buttons to our frames so frame dot add button Hey I'll copy this and do the same thing for B C and D so frame dad button a button B button C and button D let's run this and see if it actually appears okay here are our buttons we just need to set the text going back to button a we're going to type button a dot set text and this will appear on our button whatever we type within double quotes and we're just going to type a for button a let's copy this do the same thing for button B but we're going to put the letter B and button C and we'll put the letter C and lastly D so button indeed that's set text D let's see if it actually displays now yep here are our labeled buttons a B C and B after the buttons we need to add our answer labels so answer underscore label a dot set bounds so we'll place this at 125 where Y is 100 we'll make this 500 pixels long and for the height 100 pixels so I'm going to copy this portion answer label a dot set background then within parenthesis new color I'm actually going to pick a color that matches the frame background so that was 50 50 50 answer label a dot set for ground new color within parenthesis and I'm going to use that green color that we had four so that was let's see it was twentyfive to fifty five and zero okay one more thing let's set the font set bond parenthesis semicolon then within parenthesis new font then within the inner set of parenthesis same process as before we can pick a font so I'll pick M V bully again and I will say font dot plain and I will make this for a font size thirtyfive okay I'm going to copy this and do the same thing for the other labels we just need to change a few things so answer labeled B and I am going to move the ycoordinates down by 100 so this is two hundred and let's make answer label C and we'll move this down to three hundred answer label D this will be 400 all right then let's add these labels to our frame so frame dot and answer underscored label a then I'm going to copy this and paste this then we'll change it to B C and D now let's add some sample text just to see if everything's working so answer label a let me copy this dot set text and I will type testing label one and I'll do the same thing for the others answer labeled B dot set text answer label C dot set text I should probably change these numbers no big deal we're going to get rid of these okay let's see if this actually displays now I'd be really disappointed if it did that was a lot of work okay yeah here is where our options for answers are going to be displayed so let's get rid of these just because we want like a fresh start once we boot up this program all right so that is our answer labels let's create the timer for the seconds left this will be the countdown timer so seconds left dot I'm just going to copy this real quick and let's set bounds parentheses semicolon and I will place this this is going to seem somewhat odd I actually measured this out so where X is 535 where Y is 510 and it's going to be a box so it's gonna be 100 by 100 okay seconds left dot set background new color and I'm going to pick that dark black color that was 25 25 25 then foreground set for oh I did spell it right okay new color I think I'm going to have this be red so if you want to read color for the RGB value just type in 255 0 0 okay then let's set the font Seiken its left dot set font then within the parentheses new bond I typed too fast sometimes alright and then within the new font we're going to type Inc free or whatever font you want to use then if we want this to be bold or italic we can change that so I'll have this be bold like it's a big red ugly number that counts down to how many seconds you have this is going to be like a really large font it's going to be 60 it's a big countdown timer ok seconds left dot set border parentheses semi within the parentheses we're going to type border factory dot create Belleville border or whatever kind of border you want then I'll just put one within here seconds left dot set opaque I'll set this to true seconds left dot set horizontal alignment J text field dot Center all right am I missing anything oh we should probably set the text set text all right so this is what we're going to do we can't just put seconds seconds was an integer variable so we actually need to convert this to a string so we can display it as text so what we're going to do is type in string with the capital S dot value of and we need to put oops all right we need to put our seconds within parenthesis so this will take whatever the seconds currently is and convert it to a string and display it on the screen we'll need to add this to our frame so frame dot add seconds left okay let's see what this looks like so far yep this is going to be our countdown timer and it's already displaying ten because at the top of our program we set seconds to ten but that's going to change when we use our timer all right moving on let's display the time label so this isn't exactly necessary I just want to put the word timer above our seconds timer so if this part is optional but I'll type in time underscore label dot set bounds and I actually measured this already it was 535 475 100 25 okay I'm just going to copy this okay next was the background I am going to copy this and change these values to 50 so it matches the frame color then we have the foreground so time label dot set for ground new color let's see I think I'll pick red so 255 0 and 0 ok time label dot set font new font I will pick M V boli again so be font dot plain and let's pick 24 a size okay then let's set horizontal align meant and that was J text field dot Center okay then let's set some text set text and I will place the word timer within here and perhaps like an evil smirky face to countdown timer okay then we need to add this to our frame frame dot ad time underscore label well make sure you put it within parentheses label okay let's see what this looks like yep here's our timer label but I'm going to change the font slightly to perhaps 16 totally not necessary but I just think it's a funny message okay we only have a few more things to add this is going to be for the results we're going to display the number of questions that we got right out of the total amount so that will as number right and I'm going to copy this we're going to set bounds and this won't be visible right away this is going only going to be visible at the end so I'm going to pick 225 for the x coordinate where this is going to begin and where the y coordinate is 225 I'll make it 200 pixels wide and the height 100 pixels okay number right dot set background I promise you're probably going to be an expert at setting background colors and fonts after this because we do it so often all right new color and this will be a dark color so at 25 25 25 number right dot set for ground new color parentheses and let's see we want a green color so that was 25 to 55 and 0 let's set the font number right dot set font new font and you know the drill now I will pick let's see Inc free this time to have that handwritten style font dot come up bold and for the size fifty we're displaying the results so we want like a big font okay then let's set border parentheses then we're going to type border factory dot create then I will pick bevel border type one and let's set the horizontal alignment said horizontal alignment and I will type J text field dot Center okay this last part is important number right dot set editable false because we don't want people to edit what the number right you got was it's kind of like you're cheating on your test or something by changing the numbers it's kind of funny though alright then let's display the label that's going to display the percentage we got right in this is the last one so percentage I'm going to copy this real quick percentage dot set bounds I will place this where X is 225 325 it's going to be two hundred pixels long and 100 pixels tall percentage dot set background I'm actually going to copy those so a set background new color 25 25 25 let's see then foreground I'll copy the same thing so we'll change this to percentage dot set foreground new color and that should be green then 25 to 55 and zero for the font I will pick the same thing as what we had here for number right but I'm going to change this to percentage same thing with Porter honestly I could have just copied this whole thing basically so percentage dots at border border factory create bevel border then set horizontal alignment percentage dot set horizontal alignment jtextfield Center and the last one set editable false so percentage set editable false all right that should be all of them good work all right with this number right and this percentage we are not going to add this to our frame quite yet but let's just test this just to be sure that they're working so frame dot add number underscore write and frame dot add percentage okay let's just see if they display okay so when we calculate the results it's going to display this box in the middle the top is going to be the number of questions we got right out of the total amount and the bottom box is going to be our score percentage that's going to be calculated but let's get rid of these for now we're not gonna display these and add these to the frame until the end now there's just one last thing we're going to do for this constructor after our main method instantiates a copy of our quiz it's going to initialize and declare everything and at the very end of the constructor for the quiz what we're going to do is we're going to call the next question method to actually begin our quiz so we're going to type next question parentheses semicolon and the next phase of this project is to actually begin this quiz all right we are now within the next question method the first thing that we're going to type in here is that we're going to check if our index and this is going to act as a counter to determine which question we're on is greater than or equal to total underscore questions then we need a set of curly braces and if the index is greater than or equal two total questions what we're going to do is call the results method and we'll actually code this part later on okay so else what we'll do is that we're actually going to populate the screen with the question number the question and the answers so the first thing we'll type in is text field dot set not that set text and within the parentheses we're going to type something like question okay then plus our index which is currently set to zero plus one so it's going to change the text field to question one and then the next time we call next question this index is going to increase and it's going to be question number two then now we need to set the text for our text area and this will actually display the question being asked so text area dot set text parenthesis and a semicolon at the end and within here what we're going to display is our array of questions but it's going to be at a certain index so questions then you're straight brackets and then put the index within here so this is going to begin at zero since arrays always start at zero when we increase our index it's going to retrieve the next question whenever we increase our index and recall this next question method and we need to display and set the text for our answer labels answer label a dot set text and what we're going to type in here is that we're going to use our 2d array called options and there's two sets of straight brackets within the first set of straight brackets here we're going to type index so this is going to start at think of it like row zero and here we're going to retrieve whatever is within the first array the first element of the first array so let's copy this and paste it a few times one for each label so that's B C and D let's just change these so answer label B set text at our index and then we're going to change this 0 to 1 so we're going to change answer label the third one to C and this index to 2 and answer label D and we're going to change the 0 to 3 that's everything for this next question method for now let's test this out and see what we have okay yeah everything is populated for our first question now let's move on to the action performed method this action performed method is going to trigger when somebody clicks a button so the first thing that we'll want to do is that if somebody clicks a button they're submitting an answer so the first thing that we'll want to do is actually disable all the buttons just temporarily at least so we're going to say button a dot set enabled and we're going to put false within here and let's copy this and do this for the other few buttons so button B button C and button D the next thing that we'll want to do is to determine which button is being pressed and check to see if that's a matching answer to what we have within our array called answers so the first thing that we'll do is if e dot get source parenthesis is equal to button a so if somebody clicks button a what are we going to do we will assign our answer a character value so our answer equals a then and we're going to check if our answer is equal to that array of answers but at a particular index okay so if our answer equals the one that's stored in our array of answers at a certain index depending on which question we're on we're going to increase our correct guesses by one but you can just put correct guesses plus plus all right let's do the same thing for each of these buttons so I'm just going to copy this and paste it we're going to change a few things we're going to change button a to button B answer B and that's all we need to change then so let's do the same thing for button and C and cersei and lastly button D and answer D I'm anticipating some people might have this problem for our answer this is declared as a char value so it holds a single character so make sure that this is within single quotes but if you decided you want your answer to be a strength and make sure it's within double quotes and her now all we need to do within the actionperformed method is that we're going to call the display answer method and we can move on to this next section the first thing that we're going to want to do with display answer since this is going to be executed regardless if somebody actually submits an answer or clicks a button we probably want to disable all the buttons again just in case so I'm going to copy these methods where we disable all the buttons and just place it first within the display answer method so with any answer label that is incorrect we're actually going to change the font to red so this is how you can do that we'll use an if statement and we'll put within your answers at whatever index we're currently on our current question basically does not equal let's begin with a that's the character it so if the answer is not a what are we going to do answer underscore label a and we're going to change the font color so set for ground new color and perhaps we'll change this to red so that is 255 0 and 0 ok let's copy this and make a few changes so answers index well the answers at this index does not equal B the we're going to change answer label B same thing for C answer label C and lastly D answer label D let's see what we have so far so this is the first question so which company created Java the correct answer is Sun Microsystems but I'm going to guess the wrong answer and let's submit the answer of Starbucks all right any wrong answer is now in red so what we'll want to do before we go on to the next question is revert these colors back to what they were originally and then move on to the next question but the difficult part about this is that we'll want to add maybe a second or two delay after flipping the colors to red we'll want to flip it back to green after a second or two so we'll need to create a timer in order to do this so this is going to be the most difficult part of this video but if you can get through this then you're on the homestretch to completing this we're going to create a timer within the display answer class so we're going to type in timer the capital T and let's name this timer paused all it's going to be doing is adding a pause after we display the answer the correct answer that is so timer will call it pause equals new timer this part is going to be really tricky all right but hang in there so after this left parenthesis this is what we're going to type we're going to type 2,000 if we want like a 2,000 millisecond Paws that's the same as two seconds if you want a shorter pause you can change this to a lesser number well let's stick with two seconds all right then comma and then type in new action listener then add a set of parenthesis now we're going to add a set of curly brackets and we're going to be putting a few things in here the first is that we're going to override a method so let's type in override and what we're going to be overriding is the action performed Matt so public void action performed then within parentheses action event II then a set of curly brackets so this is what you should have so far but let me bring these together so it's easier to see so when our timer reaches 2,000 milliseconds to seconds we're going to perform whatever is within this action performed method and we'll actually flip the colors back to green and then move on to the next question after that pause so the first thing that we'll want to do is that we're going to take these answer labels and change these back to green so I'm just going to copy this and paste it within here and let's change this to what we had originally I think that was 25 and then 255 so that's like a green color again alright so let's copy this and do the same thing for the other labels let's see B C and D so you might have like a red line under one of these curly brackets we just need to finish closing this whole timer instantiation so at the end of this curly bracket here we're going to add a right parenthesis and then a semicolon and that error should go away now we have a few other things that we need to fill in with the actionperformed method so the first thing well the next thing is that we'll want to reset our answer and we'll just set this as like nothing basically just like a blank space that works just fine and then seconds we're going to set this back to 10 because it's going to be counting down it's going to be a lesser number after the countdown seconds left that's that display for the seconds set text then that was seconds but since this is an integer variable we need to convert this to a string so string dot value of and then we need to surround this with a set of this is there we go we need to reenable our buttons so button a set enabled true and we'll do the same thing for the other buttons so a B C and D we're going to increase the index by one so then we can go to the next question and then we're going to call the next question method alright so this is what you should have so far for this timer feel free to pause the video if you're missing anything last thing that we'll need to add to this display answer method so make sure that you put it in the right spot is that we'll want to start this timer so the timer was named pause and we'll use the start method okay one problem though this timer the actionperformed method within the timer is going to execute every two seconds so we only want it to repeat once or activate once basically there's actually a method that can help us with that it's the set repeats method and we're going to set this to false so this will only execute once then whatever is within our actionperformed method all right so that's everything for the display answer method okay let's test to see what we have so far okay one thing I've noticed is that we still need to work on the timer for the countdown but let's check to see if everything else is working so which company created Java that is Sun Microsystems and you can see that it's momentarily paused before it moves to the next question so which year was Java created that is 1996 what was Java originally called and that was called oak who is credited with creating Java I'm going to guess Mark Zuckerberg and that is wrong it is James Gosling next on our agenda is that we'll want to calculate and display the results of the quiz and then lastly we'll work on this timer at the very end so let's move on to the results then now within the results the first thing that we'll want to do is to disable all buttons so people will not continue to press the right answer for the button after the quiz is finished so we'll say button a dot set enabled false and we'll copy this and do the same thing for the other buttons so B C and D button B button C and button D now we'll want to calculate the result if we want to display some sort of percentage I actually used an int value to truncate the decimal portion but you can always change this to a double value or a float value if you want that decimal in so what we'll do is that we'll take the correct underscore guesses divide this by total underscore questions with this equation we're actually performing integer division so we're going to lose that decimal portion normally so what we'll want to do is actually cast one of these as a double value so then we can retain the decimal portion all right so let's surround these with parentheses and then we're going to multiply this result by 100 and then lastly what we can do if you do not want the decimal portion in your answer let's say you get two out of three questions right and you don't want the sixty six point six six percent you could just cast this as an integer at the very end let's add a semicolon but you know edit this however you want alright so then we have a result percentage next what we'll want to do is change our text field and we're going to set the text to display something like results because we really don't need that place for answers anymore or questions so results and then we're going to clear out pretty much everything else so text area dot set text parenthesis and then you could just put in nothing basically just to set a double quotes and that's all all right and sir underscore label a set text basically the same thing just an empty set of double quotes let's do the same thing for all answers so B C and D we're going to display the correct guesses that we got right out of the total questions so we're going to take the number right I think this was a text area if I remember or a text field one of them set text then within parenthesis we're going to type maybe correct underscore guesses plus and let's add like a slash here a forward slash plus total questions I'm going to do a little bit of formatting like I want to add a left parenthesis before this and then finish it with a right parenthesis but format this however you wish all right then we're going to display the percentage that we got right the result so percentage dot set text we're going to display the result plus like a percent sign okay then what we'll do at the very end is that we'll add all of this to our frame to display so add percentage and add number underscore right it really doesn't matter what order you put these in you can switch these around if you want doesn't matter okay let's see what we have so far okay I'm crossing my fingers that everything works here which company created Java Sun Microsystems which year was Java created 1996 what was Java originally called it was originally called oak who is credited with creating Java I'm still convinced that it was Mark Zuckerberg but that's wrong and here is the results of our quiz we got three questions out of four right and our score was 75% so we know that everything here is working so the last thing that we need to do well it's optional if you want this we can activate the timer so that adds a little bit of danger to our quiz then so when our timer reaches zero after each question it's going to skip it and go to the next question and it's basically going to be marked wrong so this is entirely optional I'll show you how you can activate the timer then so we're going to need to create another timer but I really do not want to type all of this again so I'm just going to copy all this up to this point and we're going to paste it and then make a few changes so I'm going to place this after all of these gooey component initializations we'll put it right here and we're going to get rid of everything within here and we'll name this timer perhaps timer instead of pause okay then we have a few more things that we need to add within here don't worry it's not that much now we'll change this to thousand two one thousand we want this actionperformed method to execute every one second every 1000 milliseconds and after each second we're going to take our second variable which is normally set to ten and decrement this by one so after each actionperformed method that executes every one second we're going to subtract one from the variable seconds and then we're going to take our seconds underscore left display and we're going to set the text to display whatever the seconds currently is but since this is normally an integer variable we need to convert this to a string in order to display this so we can't just put seconds we need to put string dot value of and then we can surround a seconds with in parentheses to convert this to a string okay lastly what do we want to do if our timer runs out when it hits zero we can check to see if our second variable is less than or equal to zero so if the timer runs out and hits zero we're going to call the Display answer method so this will display the answer and disable all buttons and basically when you get that question wrong then ladies and gentlemen we are almost at the end so we need to start this timer so where you can add this line of code is within the next question method and add this at the end of your else block so we're going to type timer dot start and then parentheses semicolon we're going to use the start method of our timer object that we have made and we also want to stop this timer after we answer a question so we can just put this within the display answer method then so timer dot stop and we can just add this at the very top all right I'm crossing my fingers that everything works let's try it out then okay looks like our timer is counting down just like we intended so let's see what happens if we just don't do anything one zero all right we got the question wrong then and it displayed the right answer so let's just finish the rest of this quiz then which year was Java created 1492 what was Java originally called latte who is credited with creating Java you know what I'm still convinced it's Mark Zuckerberg he's hiding something hooray we got zero percent all right with how this program is written it's actually dynamic so if we want to add any questions or take any questions away we actually don't really need to change much we only need to change our arrays of questions options and the correct answers like if I wanted to ask another question the only real change that I need to make to this program is just to add another question like does pineapple belong on pizza and then I would just need to add another set of options and then add another answer but that's really yet that's all the changes you have to make if you want to update this quiz you just have to update whatever is within these arrays if you want the source code for this quiz I'll post it in the comments down below and pin it to the top so I put in a lot of work to create this video so I have one last quiz for us to take and it has one question can you help me out by subscribing and the answer to this is yeah sure bro which is obviously the correct answer but yeah that is how you can make a simple quiz in Java hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down
