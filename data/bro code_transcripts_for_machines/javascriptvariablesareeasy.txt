all right well it's time that we discuss variables do you remember from middle school or elementary school when you learned algebra you had to solve for what the value of x was X was some representation of a value well that's kind of what a variable is in programming it's a container that stores a value the variable behaves as if it were the value it contains there's two steps to creating a variable declaration and assignment to use a variable we have to first declare it we'll use the let keyword then a unique variable name like X then a semicolon so what we've done is declaration each variable name needs to be unique if I were to declare another variable named X we would run into an error a syntax error identifier X has already been declared so your variable names need to be unique I can declare two variables X and Y and they both have different names that is fine but they can't have the same name the next step to creating a variable is to assign it a value once you declare your variable you don't need to declare it again so I'm going to assign X to equal some number like 100 we can use this variable X and it will behave as if it was the value 100. let me demonstrate so if I was to counsel.log X well then it's going to display 100 if I were to change this value to 123 well X is now 123. you can do both declaration and assignment together that would look something like this let x equal 123 this is both declaration and assignment if you're creating a program and you know what your value should be you can assign them a value right away sometimes you may want to accept some user input so then you might do assignment later in two steps it's really up to you how you write your program there's a few different data types in JavaScript the first is number like 123. let's create a descriptive name for our variable like age we will store a user's age according to my analytics in YouTube the average age of my viewers is 25. so let's say that my age is 25. then if I was to console.log my age variable it would behave as if it were the number 25. let's create a few more variables another example of a number could be price let price equal 10.99 maybe it's 10.99 or some other unit of currency of your choosing then we will console.log price 10.99 what about a GPA a grade point average my grade point average is a solid 2.1 it's not great but C's get degrees console.log GPA 2.1 using a template literal we can insert a variable using a placeholder within console.log I will use backticks let's write a sentence you are then to insert a variable use dollar sign curly braces place your variable name within the curly braces then we can continue our sentence you are variable age years old let's create another sentence using console.log the price is dollar sign curly braces price the price is 10.99 I'm going to insert a dollar sign before our price and that looks better feel free to choose some other unit of currency okay let's add a sentence to display our GPA console.log your GPA is colon space we're inserting a variable we need dollar sign curly braces we're displaying our GPA your GPA is 2.1 now if you need to display the data type of a variable you can use console.log then precede the variable with the type of keyword what is the type of age age is a number type price is also a number type same thing with GPA they're all numbers let's go over a different data type let's go over strings a string is a series of characters let's say we have a user's first name to create a string you can either use double quotes or single quotes personally I like double quotes then you can type in some characters like first name let's say my first name is bro feel free to pick your own first name I will display the type of my first name variable and it says it's a string a series of characters then I will display my name console.log first name and it is bro or whatever your first name is whatever you put here let's include our variable within a template literal your name is add a placeholder first name your name is bro what are some other examples of a string maybe somebody's favorite food favorite food my favorite food is pizza type in your favorite food console.log you like at our placeholder favorite food you like pizza maybe if I like something else like sushi well you like sushi okay another example of a string could be an email let email equals then type in your email I'm just going to make one up bro gmail.com console.log your email is email your email is bro gmail.com let me make the G lowercase now an important thing with strings is that strings can contain numbers after bro I'll add one two three so a string is a series of characters they can include numbers but we can't use these numbers for any sort of math strings have a different behavior from numbers numbers we can use in arithmetic Expressions strings not so much all right let's turn these lines into comments then I will discuss booleans okay booleans are either true or false typically they're used as Flags in your program let online equal true booleans are either true or false is somebody online or are they offline this is either true or false I will display the type of my variable online console.log type of online so online is a Boolean variable let's display our variable within a template literal type in whatever your first name is bro is online then I will insert a placeholder add my Boolean variable of online bro is online that is true if I were to change this to false bro is online is false booleans are typically used as a sort of flag so another example could be for sale is something for sale or not let's say that we are selling I don't know cars is this car for sale I could set this to be true or false let's console.log is this car for sale then I will add my Boolean variable for sale is this car for sale that is true another example let's say that somebody is enrolled in school like in college courses we could say let is student is somebody a student are they enrolled this can be true or false console.log enrolled colon space is student is the student enrolled in classes that is true so those are booleans they're either true or false typically we don't use them as direct output like you see here we usually use them with if statements to check something like if somebody is online do this if not do something else is a car for sale if that's true then display the car if it's not then hide it we'll have more practice with booleans when we reach if statements all right now what we're gonna do is we will close out of Dev tools we'll display some variables within our web page so let's delete everything we have I'll create three variables let full name equals type in your full name feel free to add a space between your first name and last name let age type in your age and let student equals if you're a student type true if you're not in school type false I am not in school anymore so I will type false we will go to our HTML file then add some HTML elements I will add three paragraph elements so that's one two three I will give my first paragraph an ID of P1 then let's do the same with the other two paragraphs let's rename the second as P2 and the third as P3 so to change the text content of an HTML element we're going to type document meaning the document of our web page then we will get our element by its ID get element by ID then within a set of parentheses within a set of quotes we will select the ID that we need let's start with P1 then add dot text content to change the text content then we will set this equal to a variable or a template literal let's begin with a variable so full name our P1 element should display your full name let's do this with P2 I'm going to zoom out a little bit P2 dot text content equals age it says that I'm 25. and then P3 let's display student or better yet is student let's change that is student false I am not a student but you might be though that might be true then let's display our variables along with some text using a template literal let's copy our full name your name is add a placeholder place our variable name your name is Bro Code or whatever your name is let's cut our Edge variable u r variable age years old you are 25 years old and then let's cut is student add a template literal let's say enrolled are you enrolled in school add a placeholder paste our variable enrolled that is false I am not in school anymore all right everybody so those are variables it's a container that stores a value the variable behaves as if it were the value it contains there's a couple different basic data types you have strings which is a series of text numbers and booleans there's more advanced data types but we'll cover that later and well those are variables in JavaScript
