all right welcome back everybody in this video we're going to discuss the const keyword the const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant it tells the compiler to prevent anything from modifying it so that it's effectively readonly here's an example let's create a program to calculate the circumference of a circle we'll first define the variables that we'll need we have double pi pi equals 3.14 then we have double radius pick some radius i'll pick 10. then double circumference equals and here's the formula to calculate the circumference of a circle it's two times pi times radius then we will display our circumference standard output we will display circumference then i'll add maybe centimeters our circumference is 62.83 centimeters any variable we do not want to be able to be changed at all we can turn into a constant let's say that somebody goes into our program and changes pi to a different number like 4 20 69 well then this is going to change the result of our program we may have not realized that somebody changed the value of pi before 2069 so any variable you do not want changed you can prefix this keyword const const double pi now a common naming convention for constants is to make all of the letters uppercase so let's change pi from lowercase to all uppercase and we'll need to make that change here as well now let's try and change pi to 420 69 again and then see what happens okay we have an error assignment of readonly variable pi so by including constants it adds some data security we can't normally change any value that's a constant a couple other examples of variables that you could turn into constants could be maybe the speed of light maybe you have a physics calculator so const and light speed the speed of light in meters per second is two nine nine seven nine two four five eight let's think of one more example perhaps you're working with screen resolutions we have const int width of 1920 then constant height of 1080. these may be a few examples of variables you do not want to be changed or altered at all you only want them to be read only yeah that's a const everybody it's a keyword that will modify a variable or some value so that it's readonly and can't be changed you should use constants as often as possible only if you know that a variable is not going to be changed at all your assignment is to think of a constant and post it in the comment section hey if you're enjoying the series please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
