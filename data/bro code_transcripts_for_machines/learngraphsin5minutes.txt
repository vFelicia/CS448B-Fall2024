all right what's going on everybody graphs a graph is a nonlinear aggregation of nodes and edges a node also known as a vertex may contain some piece of data and an edge is a connection between two nodes there are two types of graphs we're going to discuss undirected and directed an example of an undirected graph could be a social network like facebook each node could represent a user and if one user is friends with another user well we could establish a friendship and edge a connection between these two nodes if two nodes are connected they have what is known as adjacency in this example larry is friends with patrick and sandy so larry has adjacency to patrick and sandy patrick is friends with larry sandy spongebob and spongebob is friends with sandy patrick and squidward and squidward is adjacent to only one neighbor spongebob so a social network could be an example of an undirected graph the other type of graph is a directed graph a director graph contains edges that will link one node to another however these are oneway connections in this example node a would have adjacency to node b but not the other way around however it is valid to have one node pointing to another node and that node could point back to the previous node an example of a directed graph could be a street map let's say you're working on a travel app and each node is a possible destination these single edges could be oneway streets and these double edges could be twoway streets you can move back and forth between these two destinations there are two popular ways to represent a graph an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list with an adjacency matrix we could create a 2d array one row and one column for each node if we need to check to see if there's adjacency between two nodes we would first find the index of the node we're beginning at let's say a so we would go to node a and then find the index of the node we're trying to travel to so b so row a column b if there are no edges this would be zero if there is an edge this would be one so since there's one here within row a column b well there's adjacency from node a to node b but if we take a look at row a column c this is zero so there's no adjacency between a to c but if there was well we would replace the zero with one then now there are pros and cons with the matrix one of the benefits is that the runtime complexity to locate an edge is big o of one it's constant all we have to do is find two indices so we have to find the row and the column however the space complexity to store a matrix is big o of v squared v as in the number of vertices that we have but you could also think of that as n and for the number of nodes big o of n squared so since we have five nodes and five columns we would have a total of 25 spaces so the benefits of a matrix is that it's very quick to look up an edge however a matrix uses a lot of room so it tends to suit graphs that have a lot of edges on the other hand we have an adjacency list an adjacency list is an array or list of linked lists each element is a separate linked list and each header within the linked list would contain the address of a node if there's adjacency between one node and another we would add the adjacent node to our linked list so to find adjacency between two nodes we would find the node that we're starting at let's see if b is adjacent to e so we would locate index b and travel this linked list until we find the node that we're looking for that means there is adjacency between nodes b and e even if there's a node that is not adjacent to any neighbors we would still want to add it to our adjacency list just in case we do update it here are the pros and cons of an adjacency list the time complexity to locate an element is big o of v v as in the number of vertices you can also think of this as n so this would be big o of n to locate an edge we would first access the node that we're beginning at by an index so let's begin at b and we are looking for adjacency between b and e since each element is a linked list we need to traverse this linked list linearly until we find the node that we're looking for so in that way it's linear however a benefit of a list over a matrix is that they use less space the space complexity of an adjacency list is big o of v plus e v for the number of vertices aka nodes and e for the number of edges so yeah everybody those are graphs a graph can be used to model a network each node is a piece of data within our network and an edge connects nodes so like i said it's a popular way to model networks which don't necessarily have any sort of order so yeah that's an intro to graphs and in the next two topics we'll create our own adjacency matrix and adjacency list hey if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up if you have any ideas of where else you could implement a graph let me know in the comment section and of course subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
