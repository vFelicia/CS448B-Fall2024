hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can install and set up java fx for eclipse so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right people so i have listed seven steps which we need to follow in order to get java fx up and running so i'll include these steps in the description down below as well as any relevant links so be sure to look in the description all right people step one is to download the java fx sdk you can just google this java fx then go to the first link this is the url open jfx dot io so on this webpage scroll down to getting started then go to visit and then select the correct java fx version for your ide in this video we're covering eclipse but we'll cover intellij idea next so java fx and eclipse then go to non modular from ide and click this link javafx sdk this should bring you to another web page gluonhq.com products javafx scroll down to latest release and select the correct sdk for your operating system i'm running windows so i'm going to select java fx windows x64 sdk and click download now you should have a zip file so what i'm going to do is extract this by right clicking on this file then go to extract all and you'll want to extract this to a location that you'll remember i'm just going to keep this my downloads folder and click extract then give it a minute well my file is now extracted so remember the location of where you extracted this file to because that's going to be important later step two is to install the javafx plugin and we can do so by going to help eclipse marketplace we are going to find f x go and we are looking for e f x clips click install read the license agreement yes i actually did read it that fast i accept the terms of the license agreements and finish you may need to restart eclipse so that's unfortunate step three let's create a new java fx project let's go to file new project javafx javafx project next we need a name for this project i will call this hello fx but call it whatever you want and then finish within my package explorer i now have a javafx project which i called hellofx if i were to open this within my source folder and within the application package i have two files a java file called main as well as a css file called application for some css styling this main java file has some prewritten code to create a basic window for us however we first need to create and set a user library that contains the executable jars that we downloaded from that sdk you can see that if we try and run this currently we have all of these warnings if i were to attempt to run this we're going to run into an issue error occurred during initialization of boot layer module javafx controls not found to resolve this issue we need to create and set a user library step 4 is to create a user library let's go to window preferences then under java go to build path user libraries let's pretend that this wasn't here so let's remove that go to new we need a user library name let's call this java fx select ok add external jars what we're doing now is looking for that sdk that we extracted so remember that location of where you extracted those files to for me that's under downloads here it is then go to javafx sdk then under the library folder i'm going to select all of these executable jar files open apply and close step five is to set the library right click on your javafx project folder then go to build path add libraries user library next select java fx finish and you did everything right all of those red warnings should go away step six let's configure the build path right click on your project folder go to build path configure build path all we're doing is making sure that we have java fx under class path if you're missing this for some reason let's say we remove this well we can add that back by going to class path add library user library next check java fx finish so you'll just want to be sure that you have javafx underneath classpath if you already have it there's nothing more that you need to do apply then apply and close step seven is to add virtual machine arguments we need to copy a line of text from that webpage where we downloaded the java sdk so this is the url under java fx and eclipse under the subcategory of nonmodular from ide scroll down to the section regarding adding vm arguments there are two lines of text one if you're using linux or mac copy this line of text if you're using windows copy this other line of text i'm running windows so i'm going to copy this line of text i'll also include these in the description down below for this video so you don't have to navigate to this webpage since i'm a nice guy so once you copy this line of text let's head back to our ide now to add a virtual machine argument right click on your project folder then go to run as run configurations make sure that your project is selected if not you can select it on the left hand menu here under the arguments tab go to vm arguments and paste all of that text that you copied but there's going to be one change that we need to make to this we need to change the path to the library folder of the sdk that we downloaded so we'll need to find that locate where you extracted that java sdk folder to locate the library folder and then i am going to get this file path i'm going to right click then copy address everything within the quotes i'm going to delete and paste the location of where that library folder is apply and run if everything checks out after running this program you should have a small window that appears this will serve as the foundation for our java fx gui applications alright everybody that's the basics of installing and setting up javafx for eclipse i do plan on a separate video on doing the same thing for intellij idea if you would like a copy of all these steps and the appropriate links i will include those in the description down below but yeah that's how to install and set up java fx for eclipse hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
