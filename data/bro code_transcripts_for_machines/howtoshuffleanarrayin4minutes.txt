hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can Shuffle the elements of an array using JavaScript this is an optional video you might find this topic helpful if you're interested in making a game using JavaScript or any sort of application where you need some Randomness in this example we'll create a deck of cards our deck of cards will be an array we have an a for Ace the numbers 2 through 10 let me finish typing those in J for Jack Q for Queen k for King I'm not going to include any suits for these cards such as Ace of Hearts Ace of clubs that might be overkill for this example one method you might see floating around online to shuffle the elements of an array is to use the sort method then pass in an arrow function where you take math.random minus 0.5 I would not recommend using this method just because the results of this method aren't perfectly uniform let me console.log cards this array appears shuffled but it's not that uniform but not only that the Lar larger the array becomes this method becomes increasingly more inefficient I would not recommend using the sort method to shuffle an array instead I would recommend using the fer Yates algorithm we'll create a dedicated function for this so we will Define a function to shuffle there will be one parameter an array then to invoke this function we'll type the function name pass an our array of cards so what do we want to do exactly we're first going to Loop through the elements of this array we'll start at the end and work our way towards the beginning we'll use a for Loop to decrement So within our Shuffle function we'll create a for Loop we will declare index of I let I equal R array do length then minus one that's the first statement our array has 13 elements but the last index is 12 because arrays start with zero if the array's length is 13 we need to subtract 1 to get 12 which would give us the ending index of 12 we'll continue this loop as long as I is greater than zero then iusus to decrement now we have to generate a random number between the end and the beginning somewhere within this range we'll create const random random will store a random number take math. random method times I our index + one we'll need to round this number we're now going to enclose this equation with math. floor to round down math. floor and enclose this equation all right during the first iteration of this Loop we should generate a random number between the end and the beginning we'll swap our king with a random element within this array so to swap two elements of this array we can use destructuring in this context to use destructuring we'll take our original position array at index of I during our first iteration that will be the king we'll swap our King with our array at a random index the one that will be randomly generated equals our array at index of random comma array at index of I then to finish using destructuring we need to enclose both sides of this equation with with an array there and that will swap two elements of your array now if I run this program this will Shuffle the elements of my array I would recommend using a dedicated Shuffle function because in a game it's likely you're going to shuffle something more than once throughout that game like I said this isn't a necessary topic to continue on with the series but if you're ever interested in making a game using JavaScript or need some element of Randomness well then this function would work great and that is how to to shuffle the elements of an array using JavaScript
