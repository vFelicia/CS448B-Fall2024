Hello friends it's me again and in today's topic I'm going to explain logical operators in PHP there's three and or not they're used to combine conditional statements for example if we have an if statement we check a condition using these logical operators we can check more than one condition if using and if that were or we can check if at least one condition is true with the case with not we can reverse a condition if it's true it's now false if it's false it's now true more on that later we can make our conditional statements a little more sophisticated with logical operators here's an example we have a temperature we would like to check to see if our temperature Falls within a certain range let's say we have variable temp short for temperature this will be in Celsius because most of my viewers are from outside of the United States in the United States we use Fahrenheit but use whatever works for you let's say the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius let's write an if statement to check to see if our temperature Falls within a certain range if temp is greater than or equal to zero we'll start with one condition then let's Echo the weather is good our temp is 25 25 degrees Celsius the weather is good what if my temperature was 100 degrees Celsius well the weather is obviously not good right in fact the weather is horrible to make sure our temperature isn't above a certain number we can use the and logical operator which is a double ampersand if our temperature is equal to or above zero and our temperature is less than or equal to 30 30 degrees Celsius then the weather is good this statement is true but this one is false with the and logical operator both conditions must be true in order for us to execute this statement otherwise let's add an else Clause else Echo the weather is bad so 100 degrees Celsius that is not a good temperature the weather is bad what about negative 10 negative 10 degrees Celsius well the weather is still bad 15 the weather is good 15 Falls within our range 15 is greater than or equal to zero and 15 is less than or equal to 30. Now using the orological operator which is two vertical bars at least one of these conditions needs to be true if we're writing the same program using the orological operator this is what I would change let's say if temp is less than zero or temp is greater than 30 then the weather is bad else the weather is good let's change temp to negative 1 million well the weather is bad if our temperature was positive 1 million I believe that's actually a hundred million uh well the weather is obviously bad as well if our temperature is 25 then the weather is good with our temperature being this high this statement is false but this one is true using the orological operator only one of these conditions needs to be true that's another way in which you can write conditions you could use the orological operator use whatever is best for your situation okay let's set temp to something reasonable like 15. all right now I'm going to discuss the not logical operator let's add a variable cloudy this will be a Boolean variable it's either true or false let's set that to be true the temperature is 15 degrees Celsius and the sky is cloudy that's set to true using an if statement if we're checking a Boolean variable we could write cloudy is equal to true but if we're working with booleans we can just shorten this to if the Boolean variable name that's valid if it's cloudy let's Echo it's cloudy else Echo it's sunny um let me add one line break line break line break and I think we're good the weather is good it's cloudy using the not to logical operator we can precede our condition with an exclamation point if this condition is true the not to logical operator will reverse it essentially so if not cloudy that means it's sunny else it's cloudy so it's cloudy I will change cloudy to be false it's now sunny that's basically the not too logical operator it will reverse the state of your condition meaning you can check to see if something is not true let's go over some practice in this example let's say that your country has elections let's assume that it's a democratic nation in many countries you have to be 18 years or older to vote right I'm assuming maybe we have variable age set the sequel to whatever your age is let's say that I'm 25 this time and we have a Boolean variable named citizen and I will set that to be true we're going to use the and logical operator to see if we can vote so with an if statement if variable age is greater than or equal to 18. I'm in the United States in order to vote you have to be at least 18 years old if we're at least 18 years old and we're a U.S citizen citizen then let's Echo you can vote in my example I'm 25 I'm a citizen both these conditions are true that means I can vote else if one of these statements wasn't true then let's Echo you cannot vote let's say that I am 12 12 years old well I cannot vote I'm too young or if I was not a citizen citizen is false well I cannot vote either another way in which you could write this program is you could say this is a little more complex by the way if age is not greater than or equal to 18 or you are not a citizen then you cannot vote else you can vote I'm 18 but I'm not a citizen I cannot vote I'm 18 but I am a citizen you can vote I would probably stick with the previous example just because it's easier to read but this is another way in which we can use the notchological operator and the orological operator let's go over a last example just so that we really get the hang of this we're going to sell movie tickets we will have some Boolean variables will have a child variable I will set that to be false to begin with a senior I will set that to be false then a ticket price which I will set to be null to begin with if somebody's a child or a senior they get a discount if child or senior then the ticket price will be uh maybe ten dollars else ticket equals fifteen dollars that's quite a steep discount then at the end of our program let's Echo the ticket price is I'll add a placeholder add variable ticket pick a unit of currency I'll pick American dollars child is set to false we're not a child that's set to false we're not a senior that's set to false the ticket price is fifteen dollars the standard this is false or this is false that means we don't execute the statement we move on to the else statement if we were a child let's set that to be true then we get that discount the ticket price is ten dollars if we set child to be false but we're a senior I'll set that to be true we still get that discount all right everybody point being with logical operators there's many different ways in which we can check conditions there's and or not use whatever is best for your situation typically there's more than one way in which you can check a condition well everybody those are logical operators in PHP
