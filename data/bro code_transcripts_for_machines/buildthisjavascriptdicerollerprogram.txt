hey everybody so in today's video we're going to use JavaScript HTML and CSS to create a dice roller program this is an optional project you will need some images of dice to work with if you're able to find some images of dice I would save them somewhere maybe on your desktop once you have images of your dice we're going to create a new folder new folder I'll name my folder dice uncore images then take all of your dice images move them to that folder and now we are ready to begin we'll create all of the HTML elements that we'll need I will create a div section this div will have an ID of container to contain our program I'll include an H1 heading with text of dice roller after this H1 element I'll create a label the label will have text of number of dice afterwards I'll use an input element I'm going to zoom in a little bit temporarily with this input element I'll type in a number of dice I would like such as 1 2 3 however I can type in characters which I would like to avoid I will set the type attribute of the input element to be number we're indicating to the user to select a number and not type in anything although there are ways to circumvent this this will be good enough for now for the input element we can set a default value I will set the value attribute to equal one for the default we can go below zero I'll set a minimum with the Min attribute Min equals 1 we can't go below one but we can select any number one or above now we'll create a button the button will have text of roll dice the button will have its onclick attribute I keep on spelling on lick onclick attribute set to a JavaScript function let's say roll dice we'll still need to Define this function in JavaScript after our button I'll create two div sections the first will have an ID of dice result this will display some text the numbers of the dice we roll the second development will be for the images ID dice images and that is all the HTML that we'll need let's head to our CSS file and I'll Zoom back to 100% let's select our ID of container # container I will change the font family to ass sance sah font F such as Ariel with a backup of s serif I will text a line Center increase the font size in this project I'm going to use RM instead of em because we'll be working with a lot of different font sizes em is the font size relative to the parent RM is for the root for this specific project I'll stick with RM and I will set the font weight to be bold let's style our button next we are selecting our button I'll increase the font size of the button to be 1.5 RM I'll add a little bit of padding 10 pixels by 15 pixels I will set the Border radius to round the corners 10 pixels remove the Border because it's ugly border none pick background color for the button I'll pick something blue but I like using hsl values something like that looks good I will change the font color to be white and I will set the font weight to be bold not bad when I hover my cursor over the button I will change the cursor to be a pointer let's change the background color of the button when we hover over it we are selecting the hover suda class of the button let's take our background color I'll increase the lightness by 10% so that should change when we hover over the button now when I click on the button I'll increase the lightness even more to show that it's active with our button we will select the active pseudo class I'll set the lightness to be 70% so when we click on the button it should flash momentarily which it is let's style the input element CU I can barely see it with our input element I need to scroll down let's increase the font size to two RM I'll set a width of 150 pixels text align Center and font weight bold with our HTML file we do have two empty div elements currently we'll style these at the end once we get our images to populate we'll style that last with the onclick attribute of the button we set a function of r dice now we need to define it within our Javascript file we will Define a function to R dice we have a lot of constants to declare I'll create a constant for the number of dice we would like what's the value of this input element I will Define const num of dice what is the number of dice we need to roll equals document. getet element by ID the ID of this input element is I actually forgot what was it oh we didn't set an ID okay let's do that okay so for the input element the ID will be num of dice num of dice but I would just like the value I will access the value of whatever this input element is for the next constant we're going to get the dice result this empty div section const dice result equals let's copy this line of code but we don't need the value we just need that ID dice result then let's do this with dice images so we can copy this paste it const dice images the ID was dice images I'll create two empty arrays const values this will be an empty array we'll store all of the dice rolls the numbers then we'll need an array of images const images this will be for the images of the dice at this point in time we're going to create a for Loop that will Loop once for every dice that we roll we have to generate a random number between 1 and six for each dice we're rolling if I'm I'm rolling three dice I need a for Loop to iterate three times let's create a for Loop let I equal Z continue this as long as I is less than the number of dice then increment I by One during each iteration I need to generate a random number between 1 and six I'll store that within a constant const value that will be the random number equals math random method this generates a random number between 0 and 1 but I'm going to multiply it by six to give us a random number between zero and five it's not going to be a whole number though so I'm going to round it using math. floor then enclose this part of our equation now we should get a random number between zero and five but I need a random number between one and six so I'll add one to the End plus one so now we'll get a random number number between 1 and 6 just to be sure that this all works temporarily I'm going to console.log our value if I roll one dice we should get one random number one let's try three dice 546 324 all right we don't need this console. log statement anymore we know that it's working with these values I'm going to push them into our array of values take our array of values use the push method add our value that we randomly generate during each iteration and let's see if this works I'm going to console.log my array of values just to be sure that there's some numbers in there let's roll for dice inspect console I have an array of four elements the number 6 32 2 six so that does work all right here's the tricky part I need to take my array of images use the push method I will create a string representation of an HTML element I need to get one of the images found within the SCE images folder using angle brackets I will create an image element I will set the source equal to that folder name so my folder name was dice uncore images dice uncore Images slash so with my images it might be different for you mine are labeled appropriately you know for one two for two three for three so on and so forth I will use a placeholder add our value this number then follow this with the file extension of the images my images are PNG images do pay attention to that after after we exit this for Loop we should have an array of HTML images then we're going to take our dice result constant change the text content to equal all of the values I'll use a template string I will display the word dice at a placeholder I'm going to join all of the elements together all of the values to do that you can take your array of values use the builtin join method and I will join them all by a certain character or characters I will join all of these numbers by a comma and a space let's see if this works I'm going to roll one dice yep dice I rolled a one I rolled a four I rolled a three let's roll two dice I have 2 comma 5 four comma 6 2 comma 2 comma 3 6 comma 3 comma 2 then we have to get the images let's take our dice images constant access the inner HTML set this equal to take our array of images use the builtin join method I'm not going to join them by any character I'll join them by an empty string and let's see if this works I would like one dice yeah there it is two and three now for some reason if your dice isn't displaying with our image element I will set the alt attribute to equal a string of dice space at a placeholder value let's say I get the folder name wrong I will rename this as dice image I'll attempt to display one dice dice three dice four dice three so in case our image can't display for some reason we'll at least display the alternative text this is good for troubleshooting and for screen readers for exess accessibility let me correct the name of the folder again so with our dice images at least for me they're kind of big and I'd like to space them out a little bit our last step is we're going to go back to our CSS stylesheet I will select the ID of dice result that's going to be for this title right here I'll add some margin around this text right now it's kind of compressed I will set margin of 25 pixels then with our dice images ID dice images with my ID of dice images take each child image set a width of 150 pixels should be good yeah they're a lot smaller now I'll add a little bit of margin too margin 5 pixels yeah that's not a bad looking program all right everybody so that was a dice roller program you can make using JavaScript HTML and CSS impress your friends and that's pretty much it
