hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate how we can install and set up scene builder for javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running oh yeah are you ready for this in this video i'm going to be demonstrating how we can download and install scene builder for java fx this will be for both eclipse and intellij be sure to look in the description for any time stamps now the first step is to go to the internets and look this up javafx scenebuilder and then go to this website gluonhq.com oracle does have scene builder but it's not up to date so i would not recommend going to that site so let's go to gluonhq.com then go to download now and select whatever version you want i'm going to download the most recent version in this case it is 15 and select the appropriate download for your operating system i'm running windows so i'm going to download the windows version and then wait like a million years and it's done so once this is finished downloading you can open up this bad boy and finish the installation process i accept the terms in this license agreement yes i actually did read it that fast and click install and then wait like another million years and then click finish all right let's move on you'll want to remember the location of where this scene builder executable application is for me it's within my c drive program files within the scene builder folder and i would like to remember this location because it's going to be relevant later scenebuilder.exe for the next part of this video i'm going to walk you through how we can set up scene builder for eclipse if you're using intellij look in the description for any time stamps because i will walk you through intellij as well so if you're using eclipse we're ready to begin let's move on to step one we need to create a new fxml file to do that right click on your project folder then go to new other new fxml document next come up with a name for this file i'm going to name this main and finish step two is to link the scene builder executable to do that go to window preferences javafx and then browse for that location for the scene builder executable file so you can go to browse and then take a look for it for me this is within the c drive program files scene builder and then look for scenebuilder.exe open apply then apply and close step three is to open scene builder and to do that right click on your fxml file then go to open with scene builder and now we are within the scene builder gui application now if i may direct your attention to the lefthand side we have a library that contains various dropdown menus that have all sorts of different things there are various containers controls nodes menu items shapes charts and 3d effects so feel free to take a moment to browse through these menus for anything that you might find interesting and below our library is a hierarchy of different containers and nodes that we can add to our container by default you may have an anchor pin and for whatever reason it doesn't like to appear when you start up scene builder so an easy fix for that is to just go to containers and then add your pane that you would like i would recommend adding the anchor pan to begin with and then just drag this to our work surface and now we have a pane that we can reshape and add different nodes to so let's add some nodes what about buttons but you can pick something different if you want click on a node that you want and then drag it and drop it wherever you want so i'll just add a whole bunch of buttons for no reason you get a button you get a button everybody gets a button okay i would say that i'm fairly satisfied with this to save your project go to file save and once your file is saved you can close out of scene builder and let's head back to eclipse now we are on the last step we need to add one line of code to our start method so replace this line that contains our root node because we're going to create a root node based on our fxml file so add this line of code if this is not here already parent root equals fx ml loader dot load and within this method here we have a few things to add get class dot get resource and the resource that we're going to get is the name of our fxml file so within quotes main dot fx ml and then i am just missing that semicolon at the end all right you may need to add any necessary imports so be sure to do that as well so i need to import parent add fxml loader now if you were to run this the way it is you may run into a null pointer exception location is required that's because our fxml file is located outside of our application package there are two different fixes to this one when we name our resource we could precede this with a forward slash so that we know to look outside of our application package and this should work or what you could do is delete that forward slash and take your fxml file and drag it to your application package and this would work as well just like that now you may have noticed that the size of the window does not display the entire scene that's because you may have some dimensions passed in as arguments to the scene constructor so if you were to delete those and only pass in our root node well then you should be able to see the entire scene just like that well everybody that is how to set up scene builder for eclipse for part two we're going to set up scene builder for intellij all right part two of this video i'm going to demonstrate how we can set up javafx scene builder for intellij i have a fresh new project so the first thing that i'm going to do is link scene builder to intellij and to do that go to file then settings right here go to languages and frameworks java fx and then find the path to your scene builder exe so for me that is located within the c drive program files scene builder scenebuilder.exe and you can always open this folder to browse for it so once you have that click apply then okay step two is to open scene builder and to do that navigate to your fxml file and that for me is located within my source folder so i'm going to right click on this then open in scene builder all right we are now within scene builder if you look to the left we have a library with a bunch of drop down menus we have different components for containers controls nodes menu items shapes charts and 3d effects and on the bottom here we have a hierarchy of all of our different items that we have now to begin i'm just going to delete this grid pane because i wouldn't recommend that for beginners let's create an anchor pin so go to containers and then drag and drop your anchor pane to your workspace here and then you can reshape this let's make it a square now you can navigate through these drop down menus and drag and drop any nodes that you might like let's add a bunch of buttons for no apparent reason so you just click on it then drag it then drop it wherever you want once you're satisfied with whatever monstrosity that you built it's time to save it so to save this file go to file then save and that's how to save it and now we can close out of scene builder and head back to intellij now within your start method make sure you have this line of code this is to create the root node and this is linked to our fxml file that we used with scene builder so make sure you have this line parent root equals fxml loader dot load within the load method add get class get resource and the resource should have the same name as your fxml file and when you run this this should display your scene that you created but there is one catch to this it's not displaying the entire scene although you can resize it so if you have some dimensions passed in to your scene constructor you'll probably want to get rid of those now if i were to run this again only passing in the root node to our scene this window should display the entire scene that we created all right it works well everyone that is how to download install and set up scene builder for java fx if you would like a copy of all the steps i will post those in the description and in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to set up scene builder for javafx hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe
