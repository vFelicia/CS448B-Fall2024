hey uh welcome back in this video i'm gonna show you all how we can accept user input in c now if you're using vs code we need to switch from using our output tab to terminal and one way in which we can make that change is by going to file preferences settings search for code runner and then check this run in terminal so then when we run our code it will now display in terminal which accepts user input output doesn't because well it's only for output and you can ignore this this is a powershell command that will compile and run your c program but if you prefer instead of powershell you can use command prompt but you would need to manually compile and run your code since i'm using windows that would be a gcc the name of your c program helloworld.c that will compile your program into an executable named a.exe then just type that to run it but i'll stick with using powershell just to kind of simplify things okay now how can we accept user input let's declare a variable age but not yet assign it next we're going to create a prompt to ask the user for their age and we'll ask how old are you to accept user input we can use the scan f function it's kind of the inverse of printf printf is used to display something as output scanf is used to read input what we're going to place within our scanf function is the format specifier of the variable we will insert a value into if we need to accept a number an integer as input the corresponding format specifier is percent d then add a comma the name of the variable but precede the variable name with an ampersand that is the address of operator let's print a message that contains the value stored within our variable edge u r percent d years old so this is our format specifier it functions as a placeholder and i would like to display the value contained within my edge variable so things are getting a little bit difficult to read i'm just going to precede this with a new line okay let's try that again how old are you let's say that i'm 21 not anymore but let's pretend that i still am you are 21 years old that's basically how to accept user input you use the scanf function use the format specifier of the variable list the variable appreciated with the address of operator let's try this again but instead accept a string from a user like a name we need to declare an array of characters and set asides so let's create a character array named name now with character arrays we can't change the size of the array after the program is already running let's set a max size of maybe 25 bytes for this array if we go over this limit this will cause a buffer overflow and let's ask a user for their name so we'll create a prompt printf what's your name and i again will use scanf list the appropriate format specifier for character arrays which is percent s then our variable name and use the address of operator then at the end we'll display our name printf hello percent s how are you then comma name and before we run this i'm just going to add some new line characters just to make everything easier to read okay let's try it what's your name i'll type in just my first name not including any white spaces how old are you 21. hello bro how are you you are 21 years old so now this time let's type in a first and last name because this is going to act a little bit bizarre what's your name bro code and this is separated with the white space hit enter hello bro it did not include my last name how are you you are zero years old so using the scan of function we will read up to any white spaces so if your user input is going to include a white space we need to use a different function and that is the f gets function f gets parentheses and there are three things we will list within the f gets function the name of the variable and we do not need the address of operator that ampersand for this then we need to set an input size i will set this to 25 to match the size of our array and then std in which means standard input so using this function we can read any white spaces what's your name i'll type in a first name and a last name how old are you 21. hello bro code and notice that our output is actually being displayed on the next line that's because when you use the f gets function it will include the new line character when you hit enter if you need to get rid of that new line character at the end so that it's not included with your input here's what we can do it's a little advanced but we'll cover this in future videos we'll include this import include string dot h so using this import we can work with strings all we're going to do is edit our string and get rid of that new line character at the end what i'm about to show you will look a little bit advanced but it's going to make more sense when we get to the video on string functions type the name of the variable followed by a set of straight brackets type str len this gets the length subtract one and we will set the sequel to backslash zero that will get rid of the new line character so again this is a little bit advanced for us but it'll make more sense in future videos when we get to the video on string functions and let's try this one last time what's your name type in a first name and a last name hit enter how old are you hello bro code how are you you are 21 years old if you need to accept a string from a user that includes white spaces like a first name and a last name you'll want to use fgets in place of scanf because scanf can't read those white spaces it stops right there but it will include that new line character when you hit enter so you can do some string formatting just to get rid of that new line character and like i said this statement here will make more sense when we reach the video on string functions but yeah basically that's how you can accept user input you can use the scanf function if you need to accept a string of characters that includes white spaces you want to use fgets instead so yeah that's how to accept user input and see if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become
