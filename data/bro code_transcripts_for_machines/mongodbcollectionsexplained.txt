hey everybody with the last few minutes remaining of the mongodb in one hour series I thought I'd get a little more in depth with collections as we've learned at the beginning of the series a collection is a group of documents and a database is a group of collections within your database to show collections you can type show collections currently we only have one students let's create another though let's create a collection of teachers we'll use the DB dot create collection method pass in a name for this collection let's create a collection of teachers so this would work however there are some additional options that we can pass in as arguments to this method let's add the next argument it's comma separated another argument that we can pass into this method when creating a collection is a Max size for this collection we will set the capped field to be true that's informing mongodb this collection should have a maximum size this field is either true or false if capped is set to true you do need a minimum size specified so size that's a field then set a size in bytes if you would like a maximum size of 10 megabytes that would be 10 million 10 million bytes let me count my zeros yeah that's accurate and or you can have a maximum number of documents you will set the Max field to be some amount of documents I don't want any more than 100 teachers our collection has a maximum size of 10 megabytes we've also set that there can be no more than 100 documents in this collection we don't want any more than 100 teachers there are a few more advanced options for collections but that's beyond our level right now but another you may be interested in is auto index ID so that is a separate argument it's comma separated we need a document body Auto index ID this is either true or false based on indexes in the last topic automatically we apply an index to object ideas but we can toggle that to be true or false there are some pros and cons with indexes and index allows for quick lookup but any write operations are a little bit slower I'll set auto index ID to be false let's execute this command all right that was approved let's show our Collections show collections and we have two collections a collection for students and a collection for teachers hey let's create one more for practice let's create one more collection DB dot create collection what's the collection name let's create a collection of courses like what classes can we take at our school that was approved let's show our collections and we have three courses students teachers then to drop a collection you type DB the name of the collection let's drop our courses dot drop method that was dropped let's show our collections again and we are back to two collections a collection of students and a collection of teachers all right everybody that was mongodb in one hour hey if you've made it this far be sure you've smashed that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
