hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to discuss method overriding in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right what's going on people we're talking about method overriding method overriding provides a new version of a method inherited from a parent class i have a class animal this is a parent class also known as a superclass or base class and i have two child classes dog inherits from animal and cat inherits from animal so let's say that we have a method within our animal class so let's create one public void speak all animals can speak and then when a class that inherits this method uses this method let's display a message such as the animal goes burr okay let's create a dog object and a cat object dog dog equals new dog cat cat equals new cat now dogs since they're inheriting from the animal class they have a speak method as well as cats cat dot speak so when both this dog object and this cat object invoke their speak methods that they inherit from the parent class of animal we will execute this method and when my dog and cat object speak that will display the animal goes burr okay so we can actually provide our own implementation of this method we can override this method and do something else now to override a method it needs the same method signature the same name and the same parameters so if i would like to override this speak method within my dog class i'm going to type public override void the same type as the original method and the same name and signature now to create an overriding method the method that is inherited must be virtual abstract or already overwritten so i'm going to add this modifier virtual so we can now override this method you can also do this with an abstract method too but the class needs to be abstract as well and there needs to be no body but we'll just stick with virtual in this video okay so we have our virtual method that means that this method can be overwritten and now we can provide our own implementation of the speak method specifically for dogs so let's display a different message console the right line the dog goes woof so notice that we don't have anything within our cat class now if both dog and cat use their speak methods the dog will instead speak and say the dog goes woof and our cat is still using the method that inherits from its parent animal if i would like to do the same thing for my cat objects i can override this method again public override void speak and then i can provide a different implementation the cat goes meow so after both dog and cat use their speak methods this displays the dog goes woof the cat goes meow so by using method overriding we can provide a new version of a method inherited from a parent class however the inheritance method must be abstract virtual or already overwritten and the method overriding is commonly used with the tostring method which we still need to talk about and polymorphism so yeah that's method overriding if you found this video helpful please smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
