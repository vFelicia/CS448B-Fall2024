I was going everybody its bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to give you guys a demonstration of the benefits of using nameless objects in Java so let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright guys we're gonna be discussing nameless objects also known as anonymous objects so you know when we instantiate an object for example let's say a jlabel we would type in something such as jlabel then come up with a unique name for this J label such as label 1 equals new J label so what if I told you that we don't necessarily need to give this object a name we could just pass in something like this and this is available to you in certain situations and the reason that I thought of this is that I was working on a card game project and it was kind of inconvenient to come up with names for all the cards so what we can do is actually create anonymous J labels or other objects that we can use elsewhere in our program so this is going to be more of a demonstration instead of a walkthrough because I have this folder full of playing cards that I made and let's take a look at a few of these so this is card number 1 and it's just the ace of clubs card 0 is just the back of all the cards that I designed and it goes all the way up to 52 with the last card being the King of Spades so I'm going to give you guys a demonstration of how anonymous objects can actually be really useful so these are the three imports that I'm going to need everything related to java.awt everything related to Java dot util and everything related to Java X dot swing so the first thing that I'm going to make is a jframe so we'll call this J frame frame equals new J frame and then we're going to create an ArrayList of J labels to hold all of the cards that we have so we're gonna type in array list and this ArrayList is going to store J labels and this will function as a deck a deck of cards because it's going to hold all of the car that we have equals new array list then with an angle brackets J label alright that looks good now I'm going to create the frame so type in the name of the frame dot set default close operation jframe dot exit on close then let's set the size frame dot set size I usually pick 4 20 by 4 20 if I don't really have a size idea in mind and then I'm actually going to set a layout manager so frame dot set layout manager and I usually don't I usually set this to null but I'm actually going to use a flow layout this time so new flow layout and then we need to set this frame visibility to true so frame dot set visible true and that is it for frame so let's add the first card to our deck so we're going to do this the long way first by actually creating a named object and then I'll show you the shortcut of using nameless objects so let's say that we want to create an image icon and the first card in our deck is number 1 and that is the ace of clubs so for this first example we're going to create a named object first and then I'll show you the shortcut right afterwards so if we're doing this the long way the difficult way we're going to type in image icon and we need a name for the ace of clubs maybe AC ac/dc and I'm just kidding new image icon then within parenthesis we need to place the file path within here so this is within a folder called cards within my source folder so the file path for this will be SRC two backslashes cards two backslashes again and this specific card is one dot PNG so one dot PNG now the second line is that we're going to add this image icon to a jlabel so J label this will be called maybe AC label equals nu J label a/c and then with our deck we're going to add our jlabel AC label and then we just need to add this card to our frame so frame dot ad deck dot get and this is index 0 because it's the first card okay let's see what we have so far yeah here's our first card it is the ace of clubs now let's say that we want to add the second card and we're still doing this the long way by using named objects well we would have to repeat these three lines all over again so for our second image icon this would be the two of clubs so we would probably name this like to see for two of clubs change the file path to two dot PNG and we'll call this to see label and then we would need to change it here as well to see and then deck dot add to see label and then we need to add it on our frame as well so frame dot add but this is gonna be it deck dot get one and then there we are we have two cards so this is gonna be a lot of work especially if we have it fifty more cards to add so there's going to be a shortcut that we can use and that is by creating a nameless object so this is what we can do to create a nameless object we can actually for this first line chop this name off along with the equal sign and now since we're passing this name to our jlabel instead we can just take all of this and pass it within the constructor for the jlabel kind of like that alright and let's repeat the same process for our jlabel we have a nameless image within our jlabel and let's repeat this process again so we're going to get rid of all that take all of this copy it and then paste it within Dec dot ad and we can do all of this with just one line of code basically and let's see if this works which does so what we have here is a nameless image icon that we have added to a nameless J label and then we added this nameless jlabel to our deck which is an ArrayList of j labels and then if you need to fetch a certain J label from this ArrayList you can just call it by its index instead of the name and in this case the first one is index 0 if you need the first J label so now let's say that I want to add all 52 cards well we actually don't need to repeat this line of code 52 times with what I have set up here all these cards have a certain number in their name so it begins well technically at 0 but zeros just the back of the cards so we want cards 1 through 52 so what I plan on doing is replacing this number with an index and we're going to use a for loop to iterate through this 52 times so I'm going to surround this line with a for loop and I'm going to set int I equal to 1 our first card will continue this as long as I is less than or equal to 52 and then we're going to increment I by 1 each time and then for the file path I'm just going to change one thing we're going to replace one with I so after each iteration this is going to go up by one all right that looks good and one other thing that we can do is that we can take this line where we add the first index of our deck to our frame we can actually take this and paste it within here and change the index to I so it matches the for loop but for my example I probably need to change this to I minus one because the first index in this deck is 0 and the starts at one so let's run this now and here we have all of the cards well you can't see the rest of them because the screen is only so big so those are a few of the benefits of using nameless objects you can usually use a nameless object if you're passing it into a constructor for something so in this example we created a nameless image icon that we passed into the constructor for a jlabel and the straight labels also a nameless object that we passed into an ArrayList that is named dec and if you do use nameless objects when available well you could write your program involving less lines of code so for example if we actually used named objects for this project it's three lines of code for each card in the stuck so if we repeated this 51 more times that's over 150 lines of code just for this portion but we wrote this portion with just three lines of code for all the cards in this deck so if you want a copy of all this I'll post this in the comments down below but yeah those are a few of the benefits of using nameless objects in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a
