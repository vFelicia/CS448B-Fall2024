hey everyone I have a super quick video on the order by Clause the order by Clause sorts the results of a query in either ascending or descending order based on which column we list here's an example I have a list of employees how can I list all of these employees alphabetically currently they are listed by their employee ID well at the end of my statement I can add an order by Clause order buy then a column to order our Rose by let's order all of these employees by their last name Now by default they will be ordered in ascending order or alphabetical order if you're working with characters for descending order or reverse alphabetical order just add dese for descending now these employees are listed in Reverse alphabetical order or descending order for us sending order that would be ASC but that is the default so you don't explicitly need ASC let's order these employees by their first name first name these employees are listed alphabetically by their first name let's do reverse alphabetical order yeah there we are let's order these employees by their higher date higher date and ascending order you don't even technically need that keyword ascending it would still work just fine now descending I think we have the hang of it now let's select all from transactions there's one more thing I want to show you select all from transactions we have two transactions with the same amount let's order by amount when ordering a column if two values share the same amount we can add an additional column to compare by order by amount but if two amounts are the same order by maybe customer ID these two rows are now flipped so you can order by more than one column if two columns share the same amount then order by some other column then you can add ascending descending however you want to order your table so yeah that is the order by Clause you can order your rows by some column you specify in ascending or descending order but yeah that is the order by clause in MySQL
