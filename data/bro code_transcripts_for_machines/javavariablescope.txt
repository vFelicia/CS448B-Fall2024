hey how's it going everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys the difference between local and global variables and objects in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright guys and gals i'm going to explain the difference between local and global variables and objects so anything that is local is declared inside a method and is visible only to that method anything that is global is declared outside a method but within a class and is visible to all parts of a class including any methods found within that class here's an example we're going to create a program where we will roll a dice so let's handle that with an additional class so let's go to file new class and i will call this class dice roller click finish i need to create an instance of this class so within my main method i'm going to create an instance of my dice roller class dice roller i'll call this instance dice roller for short equals new dice roller within our dice roller class we'll create a constructor for this class it's the same name as the class name plus a method to roll a dice for us so the return type is void and we'll call this method we'll need to declare a few things an instance of the random class plus an integer variable to hold our result so let's create an instance of the random class random random equals new random we'll need an import as well so include that import java.util.random and an integer variable and we'll call this number int number and we'll set the sql to zero for now and lastly within the constructor we'll call the roll method so let's set up the roll method we're going to take our number variable set the sequel to random dot next int we want the numbers 1 through six so we'll pass in six to this method of next int plus one and we're adding plus one because we would normally get the numbers zero through five and then with a print line statement we'll display our number to the console window here's the issue we're running into both our instance of the random class plus our integer number variable are local to our constructor so anything that is local is declared inside a method and visible only to that method well our constructor counts as a method so the instance of the random class and our number are only visible to anything within our constructor our roll method does not have access to our instance of the random class plus our number there are two ways in which we can solve this one is that we can pass these as arguments to a method and the other way is that we can declare these as global so let's begin by passing these as arguments so we're going to pass our instance of the random class plus our number as arguments to our role method so let's do that we're going to pass random and number to our roll method but we'll need to set up some parameters this will accept a random argument as well as an integer argument and we'll call this number so this will work just fine then so we have a 4 and a 4 and a 6. so the other way in which we can write this i'm just going to reverse our changes we can declare our instance of the random class and our integer number variable as global these are declared outside a method but within a class and it's visible to all parts of a class so in place of declaring these inside of the constructor for the dice roller we're going to declare our instance of the random class and our number outside of this method our constructor and with our random class we'll finish instantiating this within the constructor so let's declare random outside of the constructor as well as our number outside the constructor as well so now our row method has access to our instance of the random class plus our number because these are global they are declared outside of the method but within a class technically we don't even really need to assign a value anymore to our number we can simply just declare these so this will work just the same as it did before it's just another way of writing this program we rolled the five and we rolled the four so that's the main difference between local and global anything that is local is declared inside a method and visible only to that method anything that is global is declared outside a method but within a class and is visible to all parts of a class so that's the differences between local and global items in java if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the main differences between local and global items in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
