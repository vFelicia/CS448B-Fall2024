hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can delete files using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody so in this video we're going to be deleting files using python and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module this is already included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it and now we need a file to work with so let's right click on our projects folder and go to new file i will name this test.txt and we now have a file that we can work with but you know what i would like to delete this file because it's lame so let's do that in order to delete this file let's type os dot remove and we're going to list the file path here since this file is within my project folder i only need to list the file path test.txt if this was someplace else on my computer i would probably need the file path like that but since this file is within my project folder i only need the file name another thing that you can do too at least what i like to do is that i like to pass in a variable called path i will make this a variable and assign it a string value of whatever the path to my file is so i will assign path the name to my file test.txt now when i run this this will delete my file test.txt and you can see that it's no longer there now what if we attempt to delete a file that doesn't exist well we'll encounter an exception so if you want this is optional we can do some exception handling so let's write the remove function within a try block and we will catch this exception file not found error and let's print something print that file was not found now if you attempt to delete a file that doesn't exist your program will not be interrupted and instead you'll print something that file was not found now this function does not remove empty folders this is how to do so and actually let's test that so let's create a new directory i'll call this empty underscore folder now i will attempt to delete this empty folder empty folder we encountered a permission error access is denied so let's create an accept clock for that accept permission error print i don't know you do not have permission to delete that all right to delete an empty folder there is a different function os dot rmdir short for remove directory we're going to list the file path and pass that in as an argument and let's create an else block as well because we can else if there are no exceptions let's print path plus was deleted all right so rmdir remove directory will delete an empty directory empty folder was deleted now this function will not delete a folder that contains files and let's try that so let's create a new directory i'll just call this folder and within this folder i will create a new file test.txt all right let's attempt to delete this folder i will probably need to change the file name let's change that to folder and we encountered an os error that directory is not empty so let's handle this exception we don't need to but i like to accept os air print you cannot delete that using that function okay to delete a folder that contains files we'll need the shuttle module import shuttle and the function that we're looking for is shuttle dot rm tree short for remove tree and we will pass in our path now be careful with this function it is considered dangerous because it will delete a directory and all files contained within so now we can delete a folder that contains files folder was deleted in conclusion these are three basic functions to delete a file or directory they are remove which deletes a file rmdir which is an abbreviation for remove directory which will delete an empty directory and lastly rmtree which is an abbreviation for remove tree and this is of the shuttle module and this will delete a directory containing files so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to delete files and or directories using python
