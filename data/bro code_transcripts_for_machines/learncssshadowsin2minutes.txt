hey let's talk about shadows there are two varieties of shadows we'll discuss text shadows and box shadows in this example i have a basic h1 element let's begin with text shadows with this css property there are three numbers and a color that follow the first three are in pixels and then pick whatever color you want for a shadow maybe gray the first number is for the positioning on the xaxis a positive number will result in the shadow being moved to the right a negative number to the left the second number is for the yaxis a positive number will move your shadow below your text a negative number and your shadow will appear above the text and you can combine these two if i need the shadow to the bottom and to the right i will set these first two numbers to be positive the larger the numbers the greater the displacement of your shadow this third number is for the spread a higher number results in a further spread so if i set this to 15 we can barely see our shadow anymore maybe let's set that to five that's a decent looking shadow okay you can also add more than one shadow i'm thinking for this example we'll create a sort of fire effect around our text so maybe i'll set the color to be yellow and i would like the shadow to appear directly around our text so i will set the first two values to zero and the spread to five or some other number so this kind of looks like our text is glowing so separate each individual shadow with a comma and i would like a red shadow this time and i'll place this directly above our text and set a spread to maybe five yeah there we go that's not a bad looking effect okay now let's discuss box shadows it's the same values as before there's three numbers and a color except this shadow will appear around our entire element let's set this to black i would like the shadow to appear to the bottom right of this element so five five and a spread of five works that's not too bad remember with box shadows the entire element is going to have that shadow effect so you may want to consider setting width and height properties of your elements we can set this so that a shadow appears when you hover your cursor over this element but you need to use the hover selector so h1 colon hover so if i were to hover my cursor over this element then this shadow will appear so it's kind of like a 3d popout effect so yeah those are shadows we discussed text shadows and box shadows if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
