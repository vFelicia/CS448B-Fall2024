hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here and in this video we're going to be discussing variables in C++ let's get into it do you guys remember in math class in school where there was an equation such as this and you can solve for what the value of X is and then you can reuse X as if it were that actual number like here in our example x equals 2 and then if we use this in another equation X behaves as if it's the number two and we can produce a result so for all intents and purposes our variable here could store some sort of value and it will behave as the value that it contains and we can reuse those variables elsewhere in our C++ programs however we are not limited to only assigning numbers to variables we can also assign words single characters or even these things called boolean values which hold either true or false heck we can even assign entire sentences to a variable now these are the steps to create a variable in C++ the first is that you need to come up with the name let's pick something simple to begin with such as X just because we're used to using X like in math class we'll say x equals and then we can give it a number if we wanted to let's say 2020 and then finish this with a semicolon all right so there's one more step that we need we need to declare what type of value that this variable is going to hold so there's certain rules of that apply when declaring variables and if this variable is going to store a value of some sort we have to declare what type of value that is going to be stored within this variable for example this could be a whole integer a decimal value a single character a string that's like a series of characters like a word a boolean value etc so for example if we wanted to store a whole integer value we would have to declare this of the int datatype which is short for integer but there's other data types that we should cover so let's discuss what those data types are now before we really begin to discuss data types these are only a few of the data types that are available to us I'm only going to be covering a few of the basic ones just because they can get somewhat complex but I want to give you just enough information to get started with using data types and then as you understand how these work you can look at other data types see what would suit your needs so to begin let's discuss the integer datatype this will only store a whole number an example would be an age or a year like you couldn't store a decimal value within here like you wouldn't say for like a year you wouldn't say it's like the year 2020 0.5 I guess for an age though if you're a young kid you might say like I'm seven and a half years old but typically people don't put like a decimal in their edge so if you want to declare a variable of the integer data it's like you just write int before the variable name a double will store a decimal an example would be a price and you just write double before the variable name and the reason that this is named a double it has to do with double floatingpoint precision it relates to computer science but think of double as a decimal so you can store something such as a price anything that contains a decimal portion the character data type sometimes referred to as chart like you're pronouncing charizard will hold a single character like a letter or a symbol a string that can hold one or more characters an example would be somebody's name or even an entire sentence or a paragraph and this also has the capability of holding a single character but we treat strings and characters differently and we also have boolean which can hold either a true or false and this is useful if you need to verify something's correct or not if something's on or off and to declare something of the boolean data type you just write B ool before the variable name now remember these are only a few of the most commonly used data types that would be used for beginners so there's definitely more out there just so you're aware but these are a few just to get us started let's head back to our program now if we want to store a whole integer within a variable we have to declare this of the integer datatype and according to that cheat sheet we had to place int here for integer now we can reuse this variable as if it was this number we can actually display this if we really wanted to while use our display see out and then we'll just play sexier now we don't need to put anything within doublequotes because that will literally print something so we can just reuse X and then I'm forgetting that semicolon at the end all right let's display this and here is our result 2020 now when naming variables it's important to name it something that will help you and other people identify what this is the letter X isn't too descriptive we can rename this something perhaps as year and that's much more descriptive and we will have to change it here as well so you're not limited to just having a variable named X you can name it other things too like year is more descriptive of what kind of value that this variable will contain and this will work just the same as it did before despite the name change how about we create a couple more variables and let's have them all be related to how about cars I like cars so let's create a few variables based on the data types that we've just learned about so if we want a price we can use a double value because that can hold a decimal so we'll say double and then we'll create a variable name price equals and then we can assign a decimal value here so 9999 dollars and 99 cents sounds pretty good to me I'm thinking for our next variable we can assign a char value a single character so we need to say char and then how about a status like is our car new or is it used so we'll say status equals and then if you're assigning a char value you need to put it within single quotes and you can put any one character in here doesn't matter which one so how about we say and for new you for used so that would work we need a string still so how about a model of a car so we'll say string and then model equals and then if you're assigning a string you need it within double quotes so pay attention that with integers you don't need any quotes same with doubles for char values you need single quotes strings you need double quotes so I'll pick my favorite car which is a Mustang and lastly we could use a boolean value so we'll say B ool short for boolean and how about we create a variable named for sale like is the car for sale true or false yes or no so we can say you know true if it is or false if it isn't but I want this car to be for sale so I'll say it true so there we go we have successfully created five different variables and now we can reuse these variables elsewhere in our program and we can display these variables much like we did with the year however if we're going to be displaying multiple variables we probably want to separate these by line so actually I'm going to add en DL at the end of this just so we can move each of these variables to the next line so en DL then we'll say C out how about status next P and DL same process with model and for sale all right let's display this all right so pay attention for the boolean value of for sale it actually came up as a one and that means true if it was zero that means false now when we display variables we can also display these variables along with some text as well so let's say that we want to make some sort of chart where we display all this information for a car well the first step to do that is that we'll want to write a string of what we want to display it so let's say that we want to display the word here and not the variable perhaps a colon and then a space and then we'll display whatever value is within your however compared to other programming languages you have to add like a plus here to display the variable however in C++ you need to use the insertion operator so that's one thing that's different and this should go away in a moment yep okay so that cleared up so if you want to combine displaying variables and some text you need to separate each of these with an insertion operator so let's do the same with each of these variables here so we'll say price then use the insertion operator so status I believe that was new or used so probably I'll put like new slash used so it's more understandable and this will just take a moment so we'll say a model and then for sale actually I think I'll say availability I can never spell this word availability it's probably wrong but close enough all right so let's display this now all right so you can see that we displayed some text along with our variable for each of these lines except I messed up spelling model and availability so let me go and fix those because it's actually going to bother me if I don't okay that's a lot better so we have like the year here 2020 it's a price $9,999 a new Mustang availability one which also means true zero means false now I'm gonna take the next part of this video just to show you guys a few different tricks that we can do with variables for example we can reassign values later on in our program let's say that this car is no longer for sale we can say for underscore sale the name of this variable now equals false so when we display this it's now going to show the updated value when it was last updated so this should display zero now and take notice that I didn't have to declare what the data type of this variable is because you only have to do that once and if you declare this variable type once you don't have to do it again also it's possible to declare a variable and not assign it a value right away in case like you want to assign it later for example we could just say for sale is going to be a boolean variable but we don't know what value we want to assign to it quite yet so we can just declare a variable and not assign any value and later on in our program we can assign that value later on one thing that you should be aware of when using variables that contain a integer or a decimal is that you can use these as if they were this number and that means you can also use this for math functions let's say for our price there's like a 10% discount what we can do is we could say the price equals whatever this price currently is times zero point nine that would be the same as a 10% discount and this price will actually be updated so let's run this and these are actually treated as numbers now like you can see the new price is eight thousand nine under $99 now with strings you can also combine strings together for example let's say that we want a variable named make so the make of this Mustang would be Ford all right so we have I'll make and a model so we can also combine these together so we could say perhaps string how about car equals make plus model and let's display this car variable instead of model so we could change this to car and we will display the car variable now so this should say Ford Mustang all right but see that it combined both of these words together and it doesn't have any space between them so you also have to take that into account so we can say make plus a space plus model equals car and this would also be an option too if you want to do some separation so it's kind of like our car which is a strength data type is holding like a whole sentence now it seems so those are the fundamental uses of variables they can store a value but you have to list what data type they're storing and they will behave as the value that they contain and you can reuse these later on in your program for any purpose and you can name these basically whatever you want but there's a few key words that are offlimits now please be aware that there are more data types than this I went over only a few of the more basic ones just so that we can get the hang of things there's more if you look online for example with doubles there's also these things called floats which also hold decimal values they're referred to as floatingpoint numbers but they use 32 bits of precision whereas in doubles have double that precision 64 bits of precision and it's usually better to use doubles over floats because they are more accurate so people tend to use doubles over floats so if you guys are looking for some practice I'll post the source code in the comments down below and why don't you guys fill in some variables here of a car that you would like and post it in the comments down below but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started working with variables and C++ hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you
