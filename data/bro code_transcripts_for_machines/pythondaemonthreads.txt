hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain demon threads in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay so demon threads also pronounced as daemon threads a demon thread is a thread that runs in the background and they are normally not important for your program in order to run your program will not wait for demon threads to complete before exiting whereas nondemon threads they cannot normally be killed they will stay alive until their task is complete so a few common uses of demon threads would be background tasks garbage collection waiting for input or other longrunning processes so here's an example of why demon threads would be useful let's say that we'll have two threads our main thread will be in charge of waiting around for some user input we'll ask do you wish to exit and in the background we'll have a timer going that will display how long somebody is logged in so let's create a function named timer and what we'll do is just display how long somebody's logged in so let's say we have a count variable while true we'll use the sleep function of the time module to sleep for approximately one second then we'll increment our count variable by one and we'll print a message so let's say logged in for count seconds and let's create a thread that will be in charge of this timer and run it in the background so let's say x equals threading dot thread the target will be our function of timer and we need to start this thread x dot start so our thread x will be in charge of our timer and run it concurrently while we're waiting for some user input our main thread will be in charge of waiting for this user input do you wish to exit now here's the issue of us using a nondemon thread for a background task such as a countdown timer so our main thread is in charge of waiting around for some user input and threadx or additional thread is in charge of running this countdown timer so if i wish to exit this program i'm just going to type okay and hit enter well my background timer is still going but my main thread is complete so i would like to exit this program but my program will not exit as long as there are non demon threads that are still alive we cannot normally close this program unless we do like a brute force you know close and exit of the program so we can turn this thread of x into a demon thread so that when we wish to exit the program when there are no more nondemon threads alive and to change a thread to a demon thread it's actually fairly easy when you create your thread you can set this flag of demon equal to true and that's it so when all nondemon threads have finished their tasks your program will complete and exit but if there are demon tasks running in the background they will be killed automatically so let's try this program again so do you wish to exit my program is going to continue running my demon thread is in charge of the timer and it's going to continue running until all nondemon threads have completed their tasks so once i type ok my program will finish running and my countdown timer will stop because all demons are killed when your program is finished running there's also two additional methods that you might be interested in you can use the set demon method of a thread and you can set it to false or true if you would like to change a thread to a nondemon or a demon however if your thread is currently running well you cannot actually change it from a nondemon thread to a demon thread while it's currently running so you would have to do that before you actually use the start function and you can also check to see if a thread is a demon or not by using the is daemon method this will return true or false so everybody in conclusion a demon thread is a thread that runs in the background and they're not important for your program in order to continue running your program will not wait for demon threads to complete before exiting the program whereas nondemon threads cannot normally be killed they will stay alive until their task is complete and demon threads are commonly used for background tasks garbage collection waiting around for input or other long running processes so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah those are demon threads in python
