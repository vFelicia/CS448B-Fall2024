all right everybody let's talk about javascript math math is an intrinsic object that provides basic mathematics functionality and constants there's a lot of functions i think that you would find useful in this example we have a variable x and x equals 3.14 feel free to choose any number that you want maybe i need to round this variable well there's a builtin function of math that can do that for us i could just type x equals then type math dot and then i have access to a bunch of different functions i would like to round x so add a set of parentheses and pass in a value or a variable that you would like to round and then if i was to display the value of x with console.log this would display my value or variable rounded whatever's within the set of parentheses of this function and x rounded is three let's cover a few more the floor function will always round a number down if this variable was 3.99 the floor function will always round down x is still three if you need to round up there is the ceiling function which is shortened to c e i l if x is 3.14 seal will round up x is now 4. you can raise a value to a given power x equals math.pow in the parentheses you'll give a base and an exponent each is separated with a comma x to the power of 2 is 9.8 x to the power of 3 is 30.9 their square root x equals math dot square root sqrt for short the square root of x is 1.77 to find an absolute value you can use the absolute value function x equals math.abs the absolute value is the distance away from zero if x was negative 3.14 the distance away from zero would result in a positive number positive 3.14 this time we have a couple variables and we need to find the maximum and the minimum we'll create two more variables let y equal i don't know what about five let z equal nine i'll declare a maximum and a minimum let maximum let minimum i will assign maximum equal to math.max function and pass in x y and z this will return the maximum and assign it so the maximum between x y and z is nine then there's also minimum so minimum equals math.min the minimum between x y and z is x 3.14 there's also some builtin constants too with x i assigned 3.14 i would like to assign pi with more digits well there is a builtin constant of math x equals math.pi and when i display x x is 3.141592653589793 so math is an intrinsic object that provides basic mathematics functionality and constants there's a lot more functions and constants than what we covered but here's a few of the basics so yeah that is javascript math if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
