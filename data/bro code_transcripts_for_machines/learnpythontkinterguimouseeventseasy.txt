hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about mouse events in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey everyone we're going to be discussing mouse events in python so before we begin we'll need a window so window equals tk followed by window.main loop and in the last video we learned that we can bind a widget or a window so that when a certain event occurs we can call a function so we're going to do the same thing for this video but we have various mouse events that we can cover so we're going to use the window window.bind function and this takes two arguments an event as well as a function name so let's define a function let's call it the do something function so do something and we'll need to define this so at the top d e f do something and remember that we need to set up one parameter for this function the parameter is an event and then we'll just print something print you did a thing okay so there are various mouse events for a left button click within quotes and then within angle brackets a left button click is button dash one so then if we were to click within this window it's going to call our function you did a thing but if i were to right click it doesn't do anything so there are other mouse events too so button two is that scroll wheel not if you scroll up or down but if you press in on it so right now i'm clicking left i'm clicking right now i'm going to press in on the mouse wheel and it says you did a thing button three is a right mouse click so i'm clicking left nothing but i'm gonna click right and that seems to work all right so button one i'm just going to add a note left mouse click button two is the scroll wheel that's if you press in on it and then button three is a right mouse click so did you guys know we can actually get the x and y coordinates of where this event occurred so to do that we type in the name of the event dot x however since we're displaying this along with some text we'll need to convert this to a string so string event dot x then i'll add the y coordinates as well event event.y i think i'll just add a comma between these to separate them and we'll change our text so we'll say mouse coordinates all right let's try this again so this is going to give us the coordinates of where we click and right now i'm just left clicking so the top left corner is zero zero well at least close to it not there exactly all right so here's a few other events that we can cover i'm going to copy this we have button release if we were to release a button it's going to trigger our event so right now i'm holding in on the left mouse button but i'm going to let go then it triggers our event if i were to right click and hold it it doesn't do anything but as soon as i let go then our event is triggered we also have enter not to be confused with the enter button just going to get rid of that so that is enter if we were to enter our binded window or widget so if i were to enter it's going to give the coordinates of where i entered this there is also leave so i'm going to say that enter the window and leave is leave the window so if i enter nothing happens but as soon as i leave it gives the coordinates and the last one is motion as long as the cursor is in motion so this one might be good for a game so that is motion where the mouse moved so it's consistently giving me the coordinates if i'm moving the mouse but if i were stationary or stop moving it stops all right so that's the basics of mouse events in python if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of mouse events in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
