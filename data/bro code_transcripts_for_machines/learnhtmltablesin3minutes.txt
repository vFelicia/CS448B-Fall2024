hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create a table using html so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey everyone i'm going to show you all how we can create a table using html let's say that we have a store not an online store but a brick and mortar store and our job is to create a table of the hours of operation for our store which we can best represent with the table on our website so to create a table we'll use a pair of table tags there's an opening table tag and a closing table tag to add a row to our table we can use a pair of tr tags for table row and let's say that we'll have two rows one for the days of the week and the other for the hours of operation so within this first row let's add some headers using th tags for table header and i'll list the days of the week so we have sunday through saturday so to add another header just use another pair of th tags sunday monday tuesday you get the rest table headers are inherently bold if we would like to add some data to the second row we'll add that between the tr tags for the second row so we would like some data which is td we need an opening td tag and a closing td tag for each cell let's pretend that our store is open monday through friday nine to five and closed on the weekends saturday and sunday this first cell is for the first day sunday the first column so we are closed this day let's copy our table data element and copy it this will be for the second row monday and we are open nine to five and let's fill this in for the days monday through friday and then saturday we are closed all right let's color in these cells i'll make the first row a dark gray color so to change the color of the first row within the opening tr tag for the first row there is a bg color attribute which means background color and i will set the sequel to gray and our second row let's make this light gray so within the opening tr tag for the second row let's set the bg color attribute equal to a different color like light gray pick whatever color you want it doesn't necessarily have to be gray so within the opening table tag i will set the bg color equal to what about black cool these cells are left aligned we can center them to center the cells within a row within the opening tr tag there is an align attribute and let's set this equal to center and the text is now centered and lastly let's make all of these cells the same size this wednesday cell is taking up a lot of space let's set the width equal to maybe 100 pixels and i will just copy this and with the opening table element i will set this equal to the width of each cell times the number of cells that we have so if each cell has a width of 100 and there's seven cells i will set the width equal to 700 and well there we go all of these cells are now aligned so yeah that's how to create a table in html just use a pair of table tags for each row add a pair of tr tags if you need a row to function as a header such as the days of the week use th tags if you're filling in data for a cell use td tags for table data so yeah that's how to create a table in html if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
