hey what's going on everybody so in today's video we're going to create a counter program using JavaScript HTML and CSS so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's begin everybody so what we're going to do is start with our index.html file we'll add any necessary elements then we will style those elements with our CSS file then lastly we will add functionality via JavaScript so let's begin with our HTML file within the body of our document I will create a label to store the count so I will create a label with an ID of count label the text will be zero it's a little small but that's okay we'll increase the font size with CSS I'll add a break afterwards with the brake tag we'll need three buttons decrease reset and increase so we have button one let's copy this button paste it two additional times the ID for the first button will be decrease btn4 button the text will be decrease then for the second button the ID will be reset button the text will be reset then increase ID increase button the text will be increase what I'm also going to do is place our buttons within a div section let's cut our buttons then place the buttons within the div I will give the div a unique ID of button container we'll Center align our button container so it's in the middle of the window okay that is everything we need with our HTML file let's move to our CSS file let's style the account label it's a little small right now I will select the ID count label I will display the label as a block level element I will text align Center so it's in the center of our screen let's increase the font size I tend to like to use the EM unit of measurement the text will be 10 times the size then let's change the font family pick a font of your choosing for this example I'll use helvetica let's Center the button container that should surround all three buttons as you can see here the ID was button container text align Center okay the buttons should be in the middle one thing I forgot to do let's actually add a class to our buttons too class equals buttons there all right we will select the buttons class I'll add some padding padding 10 pixels and 20 pixels let's increase the font size font size 1.5 em that translates to 150 percent let's pick a font color I'll just pick White then a background color for the buttons background Dash color I'll use hsl values how's that not feeling it that's pretty good let's round the corners with border radius 5 pixels I'll change the cursor into a pointer when we hover over a button cursor pointer then we'll add a transition animation transition background Dash color after 0.25 seconds then we'll apply the hover pseudo class when we hover over one of the buttons take our buttons class use the hoverseudo class we will change the background color after a quarter of a second then change the background color to something slightly darker yeah that looks good there should be a delay when you hover over one of the buttons our HTML file is done same with our CSS now we need to add functionality because well these buttons don't do anything I will individually assign all of these buttons so that each is stored within a constant so const decrease button equals then we need to select each button by accessing our document dot get element by ID what's the id we're selecting we will begin with our decrease button all right then we need our reset button reset button the ID is reset button then increase button increase button the ID is increase button we need our count label okay then we will set const count label equals then we need to get the ID of our count label so document.getelementbyid count label then we will use let count equals zero we'll be reassigning count we'll be incrementing and decrementing count with our HTML elements we do not plan on reassigning them so we can set them as constants now we need a few functions three functions one for each of these buttons decrease reset increase let's begin with increase so we are taking our increase button that we assigned with the on click attribute of this button set the SQL to a function What's it gonna do when we want to increase this value of our count label let's increment count by one count plus plus then we will set the text content of our label count label dot text content equals whatever the count currently is let's see if this works it looks like I misspelled on click all right let's see if this works yep every time we press the button our counter label increases by one okay let's work on decrease really we can just copy this function paste it let's change increase to decrease count minus minus save everything and we should be able to increase and decrease then the reset button let's copy one of these functions change decrease button to reset button when we want to reset we will set count back to zero then update our account label with the current count which should be zero we can increase we can decrease and we can reset then increase and decrease again all right everybody so that is a counter program with JavaScript HTML and CSS
