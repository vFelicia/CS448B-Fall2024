hey everyone it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a number guessing game in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's create a number guessing game we will randomly generate some random number between a set minimum and maximum and we will let the user guess as to what the number is if the number is too high or too low we will give a hint and the user can keep on guessing and we'll keep track of how many attempts it takes so we'll need a random object to generate some random numbers random random equals new random and there's a few other things we'll declare as well at the top boolean play again so if the user would like to play again we can keep this as true if they would like to quit we can set this to be false int min this will be the minimum value let's have the user guess a number between one and one int max but you can feel free to adjust these max equals 100 and guess i will declare this but not yet assign a value and number and int guesses okay we'll create a while loop and we will let the user decide if they would like to play again so our condition while play again equals true but since this itself is a boolean variable you don't technically need this equals true portion you could just say while play again because this by itself would evaluate to be true or false now if our user decides they would like to play again we should probably reset everything so let's take our guess and set this equal to zero guesses this is the number of attempts that equals zero as well and let's generate a new random number number equals random dot next and within the parenthesis of the next method we can list our minimum and maximum but remember that this number is exclusive but since we have these variables we can place these here instead so min and max so this should be max plus one this will generate a random number between one and one hundred because like i said this number is exclusive okay then we will keep on asking the user to type in a number like guess again so we'll need a nested while loop while and our condition is guess does not equal our number that is randomly generated so let's ask the user to type in a number guess a number between and this next part is going to get a little funky plus min plus i'll add a dash plus max plus a colon okay then we will take variable guess equals and we'll need to convert some user input convert to int 32 and within the parentheses console dot read line all right then we will display whatever our guess is console.writeline guess colon space plus guess and now we need to check our guess versus the number and we can use an if else if statement if and the condition is guess is greater than number we will display a hint console that right line let's say that guess plus is too high elsif and the condition is guess is less than number let's copy this guess is too low and then if guess equals number we escape the while loop oh and we do need to increment our guesses by one after each guess so let's place that right about here right before we do another iteration of our while loop guesses plus plus to increment our guesses by one now when we exit the while loop that means that we eventually got the right number so we will display the number with a writeline statement console dot rightline number colon space plus number then we will display you win console.writeline you win and let's display how many guesses it took how many attempts guesses colon space plus guesses then we should probably let the user decide if they would like to play again and actually let's declare one more variable string response and then we will assign this within the while loop let's do that here we'll reset it response equals an empty string okay then we'll have the user type in if they would like to play again would you like to play again y slash n so they would have to type in either y or n y to play again for yes and for no response equals console dot read line and let's make this uppercase in case they type in something that's lowercase response equals response dot 2 upper so if our response is equal to a capital y play again equals true else play again equals false then when we escape our outer while loop that means we are done playing this game so let's find where that ends right here okay let's say thanks for playing oh it looks like i typed that already so just type this in i guess all right we're good so let's run this guess a number between 1 and 100 what about 50 that's right in the middle right 50 is too high what about 25 25 is too high what about 12 12 is too high this is a very low number i guess what about six six is too high g's all right three three is too low our number is between three and six how about four four is too low five all right finally so it took seven guesses let's play again i think i can do better guess a number between one and 100 let's go with 50 again 50 is too low so something between 50 and 100 let's go with 75 75 is too high uh what about 63 63 is too high uh 57 57 is too low how about 60. all right 60. that took five guesses this time would you like to play again no thanks for playing well everybody that was a very simple number guessing game in csharp i'll post all of this code to the comment section down below if you would like a copy for yourself if you can give this video a thumbs up feel free to drop a random comment down below and well that is a very simple number guessing game in c sharp
