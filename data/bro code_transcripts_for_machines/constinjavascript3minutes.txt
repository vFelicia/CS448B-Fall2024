hey everybody in this video i'm going to explain constants a constant is a variable that can't be changed it adds some security to our code to declare a constant you use the const keyword in place of var or let in this example we're going to create a sample program to calculate the circumference of a circle which has this formula circumference equals 2 times pi times radius let's declare all of the variables that we'll need we're going to write this program without constants and then later with constants and i can show you their usefulness we'll create three variables let pi equal 3.14159 just the first few digits of pi let radius and let circumference we're going to accept some user input we will assign radius equal to window dot prompt enter the radius of a circle then when we accept user input it's a string we'll need to convert that to a number radius equals and use some type conversion and convert our radius into a number to calculate the circumference of a circle we will set circumference equal to and follow that formula 2 times pi times radius and with the radius the user will type that in at the end of our program we will display our result the circumference is circumference let's run this enter the radius of a circle if the radius is 9 i press ok the circumference is 56.54 now here's why constants are useful let's say that somebody changes our code pi now equals 420 69. now when we run this program and we type in 9 for the radius while the circumference is now 7572 we can prevent a variable from being changed if we assign it as a constant in place of let use the const keyword and our variable pi is now a constant and a common naming convention for constants is that you make all of the letters uppercase it's not necessary but it's good practice then we are going to change that here too enter the radius of a circle i'll type 9 the same as before and we encountered a type error assignment to constant variable so once we declare a constant we can't change it so if i were to get rid of this line run this again 9 the circumference is 56.54 you'll want to use constants as often as possible if you have a variable that you know will not be changed later we're not going to assign radius and circumference as constants because we'll need to update them later in our program so yeah those are constants it's basically just a variable that can't be changed it adds a little bit of data security if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
