hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how the flow layout manager works in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running well the flow layout it places components in a row sized at their preferred size if the horizontal space in the container is too small then the flow layout class uses the next available row so we'll need a frame i'm just going to paste what i had previously so jframe frame equals new jframe frame dot set default close operation j frame x and on close set your preferred size and then frame dot set visible true to set up a frame or other container class with a flow layout we use a certain function called set layout and then we pass in a new layout manager so new flow layout so by default frames use a border layout so this time we're setting this with a flow layout now we'll need to add some components to this frame to demonstrate the effects of a flow layout so let's create some buttons so j button we'll call this button one equals new j button all right so i'm going to show you guys a shortcut too for creating components uh so let's say that we're adding this button to the frame so frame dot add then we say button one right uh one shortcut that we can do just to save time is that instead of calling this by name we can just say new j button and pass this in to the frame when we add this and then we can give this like a number if we wanted to so this will create a new j button for us all right so one problem that you might run into is that sometimes these components don't always display if you set the visibility to true before you actually add the components so actually if we were to move this window this button appears uh so i'm just going to set the visibility at the very end so we don't uh run into any problems so then this should display right away there it is all right let's create a bunch of buttons to demonstrate this so i'm going to copy this line of code where we create a new j button and now this is the frame maybe like nine times or so so we'll call this button two three four five six seven eight nine all right so we should have nine buttons now and they're all centered within the top row so with flow layouts if they run out of room within their first row the components will be pushed down to the next row kind of like this pretty sweet right so it's kind of like a waterfall or something it's flowing like water so we can also set an alignment for these components so when you pass in a new flow layout you can type in flow layout dot and if you want this to start on the left you can say leading and there's a few options here so now what these components do is that they stick to the left hand side they're leading and if you were to expand this frame they will stay in the top left corner and then when you compress this frame they will be pushed down so the default is actually center so we should see no change with what we had previously where they will all stay in the center and there's also trailing as well so let's switch this to trailing and now they will stick to the right hand side and if you were to compress this frame they will be pushed down you can also set the horizontal and vertical gaps between the components too so i'm going to change this back to center to set some spacing you pass in some integers when you actually create a new flow layout so the first number is the horizontal spacing and the second number is the vertical spacing so if we set these both to zero these buttons are going to be which they are so let's set the vertical spacing to 10. so now we have 10 pixels worth of space around the components and then let's set the horizontal spacing to also 10 so now we have extra spacing between these components with layout managers you can also add layout managers to panels so let's create a panel and add all of these buttons to our panel then add the panel to the frame so we'll need to create a panel and set this up with a flow layout manager so let's create a panel jpanel we'll call this panel equals new j panel then let's set a size for this panel as well so panel dot set preferred size we need to pass in the dimensions by saying new dimension let's say this is 250 by 250 and let's set the background color so we can better see this panel dot set background let's say light gray so color dot light gray all right so then with these buttons we're going to be adding these to the panel in place of the frame so one shortcut that you can do if you're using the eclipse ide select all of the code that you want to edit if you want to replace a certain word you can go to edit find replace i'm going to replace the word frame with panel and then replace all all right so we're going to be adding these buttons to the panel uh however we still need to set the layout manager for the panel because i forgot to do that so panel dot set layout and then we are passing in a new flow layout new flow layout and actually by default panels already use a flow layout but i'm just doing this again for teaching purposes so this panel has a flow layout and we're adding all of the buttons to the panel this time and then we need to add the panel to the frame so frame dot add panel so this is what this looks like now this panel is acting as the container and since these buttons ran out of room within the first row the next set of buttons got pushed down to the next row and if we were to change the width of this panel it's going to push the buttons down even further down further rows so let's set the width to now 100 so these buttons are pushed down even further because this panel is using a flow layout just like what the frame was using in the previous example so that's the basics of the flow layout manager if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the flow layout manager in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
