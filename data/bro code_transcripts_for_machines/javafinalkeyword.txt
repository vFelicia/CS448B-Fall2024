how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the final keyword in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay ladies and gentlemen i'm going to be teaching you guys about the final keyword anything that is declared as final cannot be changed or updated later in your program here's an example let's say we have a double variable called pi and we will store the first few digits of pi 3.14159 there's still more digits than that but that's good enough for this example and let's update the value of pi to maybe four and then within a print line statement let's print the value of pi so this will display four because we updated our variable pi to equal four so if we were to use the final keyword when we declare our variable we're going to precede our data type with the keyword final and we can no longer update this value and it states the final local variable pi cannot be assigned it must be blank and not using a compound assignment so we can no longer change the value of pi we're going to run into a problem and it states here that we ran into an unresolved compilation problem so if you declare anything as final you cannot update it it is final that's the law you can't update it and one common practice that people will do when they declare something is final is that with the variable name they will make all the letters uppercase it's not necessary that's just common practice and when we run this program it displays our number pi of 3.14159 so really that's the basics of the final keyword anything that is final cannot be changed once you declare it if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's how the final keyword works in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
