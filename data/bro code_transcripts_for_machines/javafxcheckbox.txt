yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be covering some very basic uses of check boxes in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show in this video i'll be demonstrating how we can use a checkbox to call a method and change the state of nodes that are within a pane a checkbox will return a true if the checkbox is selected and you call the is selected method if it's not selected then this method will return false this will be a very basic example of how the state of a checkbox can change a basic label as well as an image within an image view so let's head to scenebuilder and get started i'll use an anchor pane for this demonstration now we need a checkbox so that is underneath controls and that is near the top checkbox i'll place it maybe here let's say on slash off like it's a light switch i'll change the font too right there is good i suppose i'll need an id let's say my check box and we'll need a method to link let's say change whenever we click this checkbox we'll call the change method let's create a label i'll put that near the middle and let's say off to begin with because the light switch will be off and pick a font that's decent the id let's say my label and if you have an image that you want to change we can use an image view although it's entirely optional for this video so let's say i have an image i'll place that near the middle for the id let's say my image view and you can also set an initial picture if you have one so i have two images within my application package within my source folder i'll set the initial picture to lightbulb2.png and then when i click the on button on off button it's going to switch between these two images okay let me save make sure to add your controller class because that's easy to forget save and let's head to our controller class open up the tab for your fxml file just so that it updates because sometimes it doesn't like to update and let's inject our fxml code into our controller and we are going to declare a few things private check box my check box at fxml private label my label if you have an image view then type at fxml private image view my image view okay now if you have an image let's create two image objects let's say my image one equals new image get class dot get resource as stream and the name of your first image and mine is light bulb one dot png let me copy all of this and make image two lightbulb 2.png just as a quick reminder these two images of mine are within my application package so i only need to list the file name now that method that we linked to my checkbox that was named change but you can really name it anything so let's define that method public void change and there is one parameter of action event event so whenever we click our checkbox it's going to call this method but we need to check to see if our checkbox is selected or not because it can have two states so let's check to see if my checkbox dot is selected what are we going to do then so let's begin by just printing something to the console window just as a test so let's say on if it's selected else we will print off okay let's test it you can see in the console window it's displaying on and off let's change our label next i'll go right to this line here my label dot set text to on else off now this label should switch between being on and off and lastly let's change the image within our image view so to do that we're going to take my image view dot set image to my first image of my image one which is in my case lightbulb1.png but it's probably going to be something different for you else we'll change this image to my image too so our light bulb is on now it's off it's on it's off well everybody that's a very basic example of us using a checkbox that's really all there is to it it's either on or it's off and you can check the state by using the is selected method of your checkbox so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below but yeah that's a very basic use of a checkbox in javafx
