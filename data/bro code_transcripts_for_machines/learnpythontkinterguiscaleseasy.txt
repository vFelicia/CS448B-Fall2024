hey what's going on everybody it's ibro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a sliding scale in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running let's create a scale so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.mainloop we'll create a scale called scale scale equals scale we need to add the scale to our window so we'll put that here we can list a from position and a two position both of these values will be our range of values that we can use for our scale so from make sure to add an underscore after from it won't work without this underscore from equals let's say 0 and 2 equals 100 so we're going to create a scale for temperature and this will be in celsius so 0 will be freezing and 100 will be the boiling point uh you know for water so then to display the scale we'll need to add scale.pack and let's run this so the front position is zero so that's at the top here and then if you go down it increases so you can actually flip this so we'll save from 100 and two will be zero now you can scroll up and the number will increase let's also get the current value so we'll need a button so button equals button we'll add this to the window we'll add some text text equals submit and then a command command equals submit but we'll have to make this function so let's do that outside the window def submit and we will simply print the current temperature so let's display message the temperature is plus scale dot get plus degrees celsius we can just say degree c so let's try this but we also have to pack the button so button.pack so if we were to try and submit this right now scale.get is going to return an integer so we need to convert this to a string so str scale.get and you have to do that with python if you're displaying a integer value along with another string you need to convert it to a string so now this should work so it is 82 degrees celsius so let's do some cosmetic changes for our temperature gauge because right now it's kind of ugly so the first thing we'll change is let's say the length so length equals 600 so that should be fairly large you can also set the orientation so that is orient spelt like that so this can either be vertical which it currently is or horizontal but i'll keep this as vertical so i'll let a comment that this is orientation of scale let's also change the font so font equals pick whatever font you want and a size so maybe 20. now you can add some tick intervals maybe i'll set this to 10. so these will be numeric indicators on the scale and show value this hides the current value so if you set this to zero this will hide current value so it no longer displays what the current value is next to the slider to actually retrieve it you'd have to get the value so right now it's 40 but it helps that you have the tick intervals on the left hand side i should probably add that this adds uh numeric indicators for value good enough let's continue on now let's use the set function we can set the current value of the knob on our scale and by default it is zero so we can use the scale dot set function and we can place a number in here a value so let's say we want this to be 100 so this is now at the 100 position instead of zero if we wanted this in the middle we could set this to 50 and now it's in the middle however if you change the range of your skill of from minus 2 and set this to 50 now 50 is all the way down here so it no longer appears in the middle so this isn't really necessary but if you want this to be a little more sophisticated there's actually a formula that you could use we can use scale straight braces and then place the word from within here this will give us our max basically so this is from without an underscore so this not this this scale from minus scale 2. and then we're going to divide this by 2 and then i'm just going to put this within a extra set of parentheses plus scale 2. just in case our two value is greater than zero we just want to account for that and then i'm just going to put these within another set of parentheses so this should always appear in the middle then even if we were to change this range yeah it seems like it works uh like i said it's not really necessary but if you want this to be a little more sophisticated that would work now let's make some cosmetic changes to this scale and make it look pretty so first let's change the trough color this is this gray portion right here so let's set the trough color equals whatever color you want you could say like blue or you can place a hex value here and i actually picked one out already so i'm going to use 6 9 e a f f and that is this icy blue color kind of like this is sliding on ice and i'm also going to change the font color and i'm going to pick this fiery red color to symbolize heat and then you can change the background color too so that is bg and i'll just set this to like black it's looking kind of cool now right and for no good reason i'm going to add some pictures so feel free to pause the video if you'd like to download some images i'm going to use an image of a flame for the hot side of our scale and a snowflake for the cold side so let's begin by adding the hot image to the scale before we actually add the scale to the window so we'll do this after we instantiate the window because that's the only place that we can do that so we're going to create a image i'll just call this hot image for the fire icon so hot image equals photo image file equals this is hot dot png so hot dot png we're going to add the image to a label i'll call this hot label hot label label image equals hot image and then we need to pack this so hot label dot pack and this should appear at the top let's test it yep there it is let's do the same thing for the cold side so i'll add this here before the button and i'm going to replace hot with cold same thing with the file name cold.png this will be cold label cold image and cold label dot pack and that should be it let's take a look not too shabby it's looking pretty sweet it has our submit button at the bottom too uh so right now the temperature is 100 degrees celsius the temperature is 0 degrees celsius the temperature is 60 degrees celsius well that's how to create a scale in python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to create a scale in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if
