hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can move an image on both a window and a canvas in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right my fellow bros i'm going to divide this video into two different sections in the first section we're going to move a widget within a window and in the next section we're going to move an image on a canvas so let's begin by moving a widget within a window so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.mainloop and we'll also need to set some geometry for this window window dot geometry let's make this 500 by 500 500 x 500 and let's take a look okay that should be a decent size let's add a label to this window so i actually have a race car image that i want to use if you would like an image feel free to pause the video and download one what i would like to do is create a photo image from this png file that i have i'm just going to call this my image equals photo image file equals since this is within my project folder i can just list the file name otherwise you might have to list the file path and for me this is called racecar.png i want to add this image to my label not necessary but it'll be helpful for this example i'm going to call my label just a label label equals label i'm adding this to the window and i'm going to set the image to equal my image that i created it's a photo image if you do not have an image that you want to use you can simply just change the background color you could say bg i don't know red oh then we need to place this so be sure to do that label dot place and i'm going to place this in the top left corner that is where x equals zero and y equals zero and then we should have a race car or whatever image you used and a red background you can get rid of the background color if you prefer that's just if you don't have an image to use you can set the background color just for a visual to show you where the label currently is let's set some key bindings for this window and let's add them maybe here before we create the label and our image so let's bind the w key for up s for down a for left and d for right so we do that with window dot bind and we pass in an event as well as a function name so we want to tie the w key to a function and we'll call this move underscore up and then we will need to define this so outside of the window let's define move underscore up and this takes an event so we'll place that as a parameter and to move our label up we're going to take label dot place and we're going to place this at some new coordinates x equals the label's current position relative to the window that it's in so that is label dot w info underscore x all right so then for y it's similar y equals label dot w info underscore y but we're going to subtract maybe one all right so this is all we need although this is only going to move up so i'm going to press w and our label our race car or whatever image you used is going to move slowly up i'm going to increase this to 10 so the change is more drastic so now our race car is drifting off into space let's find a few other keys s a and d sad all right so s will be down move underscore down a for left move left and d for right move right we'll just copy what we have here and make a few changes let's begin with move down the only thing we're going to change within here is in place of subtracting 10 from the y coordinate we're going to add 10. and with our race car oh i guess we have to define these so let's do that real quick so we have left move left we're going to subtract 10 from the x coordinate and keep y the same and then the same thing for move right move underscore right and this time we are going to add 10 to x and y will stay the same okay now with our image we can move up down right and then left and why stop there we can bind these to our arrow keys so up is just up with a capital u down is down these are all capital by the way left is left and then right is right and now i can use my arrow keys to move this image now for this part of the video i'm going to teach you guys how we can move an image on a canvas this time and not just within a window but we'll need a window to begin with window equals tk followed by window.main loop and we're going to create a canvas canvas equals canvas we're adding this canvas to the window and let's set a width and height for the width let's make this 500 and the height 500 as well so this is an even square and we'll need to pack or place this canvas canvas.pack should take care of that and let's run this and this is our canvas at this step we need to add an image to our canvas and i have an image of a race car that i want to add so i need to create a photo image from this file so we can do that let's give this photo image a unique name i'm just going to call this photo image to keep it simple photo image equals photo image and i can list the file path or the file name since this image is within my project folder i only have to list the file name and my file is called racecar.png this next step we need to give our image a unique name the image that's being added to the canvas i'll call this my image equals and we need to turn this photo image into an image added to the canvas so we type in the name of the canvas canvas dot create underscore image we first need to list the coordinates of where we want to place this photo image so let's place this in the top left corner that is where x is 0 and y 0 and we need to set the image of the image that we're creating so we can do that with saying image equals the name of our photo image and let's see what we have so far so this image is somewhat cut off in the top left corner we can easily fix that by anchoring our image when we create it so let's at the end add anchor equals northwest so that should fix that problem and we now have our image that we want to use and to move our image we can set some key bindings so we type in the name of the window dot bind and we pass in two arguments an event as well as a function name let's tie pressing the w key to moving up so the first argument is going to be w and the second is going to be a function name so let's say move underscore up and let's bind some other keys w for up s for down a for left and d for right we'll need to define these now so at the top outside of the window let's begin by defining move up def move up this has an event as a parameter and let's create the other definitions here so i'm just going to rename these so we have move up move down move left and move right okay now this next step we can use the canvases move function to move an image a certain amount of pixels on the xaxis and yaxis so let's begin with move up we type in the name of the canvas dot and use the move function and this has three arguments the image that we want to use and this image is called my image the one with the race car the next argument is the amount of pixels we're moving this on the xaxis with up we can keep this the same but on the yaxis let's say we want to move this up 10 pixels so that would be 10 and let's repeat the process for move down move left and move right for move down we're going to change y to 10 for move left we'll keep y the same at zero but we're going to subtract 10 and then move right we are going to add 10 to where x is and that should be it so we can move up down right left and if you want to bind these to some arrow keys all we have to do is just change the event so we can bind these to our wsad keys as well as up down left and right and this time i'm going to use my arrow keys up down right and left all right so that's a few of the basics of moving either widgets or images on a canvas or window if you would like a copy of all this code for both examples i'll post both of them in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of moving widgets and images in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
