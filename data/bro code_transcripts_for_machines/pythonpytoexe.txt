hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can convert a python file to an executable so sit back relax and enjoy the show here's a quick disclaimer before we begin windows defender and other antivirus programs may prevent your executable from running but if you head to the settings section of your antivirus you can disable that so that your python file can run also please be sure that pip and pi installer are both installed and up to date i have a separate video on that if you're interested now the program that i'm going to be converting to an executable has a gui portion to it i created a clock program in a previous video so i'm going to turn this clock program into an executable now i recommend creating a new folder on your desktop just because this process is normally somewhat messy so we'll create a folder to contain it all now copy any relevant python files and or images and paste them to within this folder if you have an image that you would like to set as an icon for your executable i recommend moving that to the same folder as well our next step is to open command prompt and we need to change the directory of command prompt so that it's pointing to that folder that contains our python file so on your python file right click on it go to properties and copy this location and in command prompt to change directory type cd space and then paste that location now here's the cheat code to convert a python file to an executable make sure that pi installer and pip are installed and both up to date so type pi installer dash capital f to make all of this one file if you need the terminal window in your program then omit this next part since i'm running a gui application i do not need that terminal window so to remove that window type dash w if you have an icon that you want to set type dash i and the name of your icon however it should be an ico file so if you have some other image that you would like to convert to an ico file here's how if you need to convert an image to an ico file you can just google convert to ico but one website that i commonly use is icoconvert.com just pick a file to upload so choose file i'm going to convert this png file of an alarm clock upload it there's a bunch of different settings you can use convert ico and then download my icon and once your ico file is downloaded i will drag and drop it to my folder and i will rename this let's rename this as icon dot ico and here's that cheat code one more time pi installer dash f dash w if you do not need the terminal window dash i if you would like to add an icon the name of your icon it should be an ico file followed by the name of the python file and mine is named clock.p.y then hit enter all right looks like building our executable has completed successfully so open that folder back up your executable is located within this dist folder i would recommend just dragging and dropping it to your desktop and we can get rid of this old folder but close out a command prompt and by clicking on this executable this executable will now run my python program well everyone that is how to convert a python file to an exe file i will post my notes to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to convert a python file to an executable
