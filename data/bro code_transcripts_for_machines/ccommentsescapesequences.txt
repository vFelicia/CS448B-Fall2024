hey y'all what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain to both comments and escape sequences in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back so we have to discuss comments and escape sequences so a comment is some text that is ignored by the compiler that is used as an explanation description or a note for yourself or anyone else reading over your code so try to comment you will type two forward slashes then anything afterwards is considered a comment and will be ignored by the compiler this is a comment blog so if i was to run this this text will be ignored by the compiler and we do not see that as output i tend to use a lot of comments when explaining things so this is something you'll see fairly often in my videos now if you need a multiline comment this is only for a single line comment if i was to type this again without those forward slashes this is a comment well our program thinks that this is some sort of code if we need a multiline comment you will instead type forward slash asterisk then anything after is considered a comment you can see that this is all green now anything up to a asterisk and forward slash will be a multiline comment this is a multiline comment and again this is ignored by the compiler so if you need to write a note description or explanation for yourself or for somebody else you can write that within a single line comment or a multiline comment and i use a lot of these for teaching purposes because i have a lot of explaining to do right okay let's move on to part two of this video we have escape sequences an escape sequence is a character combination consisting of a backslash followed by a letter or combination of digits they specify actions within a line of text otherwise known as a string so we learned in the last video that we can end our printf statement with a backslash n to create a new line this is the escape sequence for a new line and within a string of text a line of text and within a string of text we can add a new line wherever we want and as many as we want let's say that after each word within my line of text i would like to add each word to a new line so i can use the escape sequence for new line after each of these words so that would look like this i like pizza but you may have to work on the spacing though that's a little bit better so wherever you place a backslash n that will create a new line character another escape sequence is backslash t for a tab so let's say i have a few numbers here one two three and i would like to create even spacing between these numbers i can just add an escape sequence for a tap character one backslash t two backslash t and these numbers are spaced evenly or i can get really fancy and add a new line character then maybe a four tab 5 tab 6 new line character then maybe a 7 tab 8 tab and then a 9. so now we have a grid of numbers all spaced evenly so that is the new line escape sequence and the tab escape sequence you can use them wherever and however many you want within a string of text within a printf statement what if we need to display quotes like we're quoting somebody i like pizza this is a quote from abraham lincoln probably i need to place quotes around i and pizza so if i were to write it like that well our program doesn't know where our string of text begins and ends it's kind of confused if we need to literally print double quotes we will add an escape sequence backslash then double quote and then add that here as well so this allows us to literally print some quotes as i'll put i like pizza abraham lincoln probably or if you need to display single quotes backslash single quotes so that's how to display single quotes and if you need to display a backslash that would be double backslashes this will literally print backslashes so yeah those are just a few escape sequences here's a list of a bunch of them but a lot of these really aren't going to be relevant to us so yeah those are comments and escape sequences and see if you found this video helpful please be sure to destroy that like button drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
