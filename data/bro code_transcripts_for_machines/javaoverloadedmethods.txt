hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about overloaded methods in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright everybody let's discuss overloaded methods overloaded methods are methods that share the same name but they have different parameters this is allowed because each method needs its own unique method signature that is the method's name plus its parameters they can share the same name but they would need different parameters to give them each a unique method signature let's create a few overloaded methods perhaps just a few add methods that will add some numbers together outside of our main method let's declare a few overloaded methods so for this example we'll need these to be static let's return an integer so the return type is going to be int and this will be called add and we will accept a few arguments so we need to set up some corresponding parameters let's say int a and int b and we will return the sum return a plus b so let's create another method an overloaded method also called add wait a minute we have a problem so we have two methods that are duplicates duplicate method add and type main they both have the same method signature they both share the same method name as well as the same parameters where they accept two integer values there are two ways in which we can resolve this the first is that we can change one of the method names and this error would go away but that defeats the purpose of overloaded methods the other way is that we can change the parameters that we have for each method let's say we would like two versions maybe even three versions of our add method one that accepts two values another that accepts three values let's say into c return a plus b plus c and another that will accept four values so we'll have int d return a plus b plus c plus d and then our problem went away so let's test these i'm just going to add a print line that states which overloaded method we're using this is overloaded method number one and i'm going to copy this and paste it and we'll change the second instance of this print line to this is overloaded method number two and lastly this is overloaded method number three so let's try this let's say we have an integer int x equals add and we can pass in between two and four integers now i'm going to attempt to pass in a single integer value but we cannot run and compile this because we do not have a matching method signature we can pass in between two and four integers so let's try this by passing in two arguments this time two integer values and then let's display the sum the result system that out that print line our variable of x so we end up using our first overloaded method this is overloaded method number one and this will display the sum a plus b which is three and let's try and use our second overloaded method we need to pass in three integer values as arguments and we are now using our second overloaded method and lastly we can pass in four integer values and we end up using our third overloaded method and we get a sum of 10. and with overloaded methods not only are the numbers of parameters taken into account but the data type for each specific parameter so this time let's create three more add methods but these ones will accept double values instead of integers so let's change any instance of int to double including the return type all right and then i'm going to change the number of the overloaded method that we're using so six five four three two one our first three methods only accept integers and they will accept between two and four integers our next three add methods only accept double values and they accept between two and four double values so we could also pass in some double values to our overloaded methods let's change these to 1.0 2.0 3.0 and 4.0 and we will need to change the data type of our variable x as well so double x add 1.0 through 4.0 and we are now using overloaded method number six which accepts four double arguments in summary overloaded methods are methods that share the same name but have different parameters they can share the same name but they would need different parameters to give each method a unique method signature some factors that are taken into account with parameters are the number of parameters the data type and the order of the values so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below please don't forget to help me out and smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
