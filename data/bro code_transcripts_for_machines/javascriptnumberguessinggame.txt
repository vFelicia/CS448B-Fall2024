hey what's going on everybody in this video we're going to create a number guessing game using JavaScript so why don't you go ahead and sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's get started everybody so the first thing that we're going to need is to set the minimum and the maximum numbers in our number guessing game so we'll create two constants const minum for the minimum I will set my minimum to be one but feel free to pick a different number if you would like then a maximum const Maxum I will set my maximum to be 100 so what we got to do is generate a random number between our minimum and our maximum inclusively so let's create another constant const answer then we'll generate a random number between one and 100 our minimum and our maximum to do that we can type math. random the random method of math will generate a random number between zero and one we will multiply this by within a set of parentheses the range between our maximum minus our minimum then add plus one let's see what we have so far just to test everything I'm going to console.log our answer okay let's inspect go to console here's my answer currently 56 point and then a bunch of decimal places after I will round our answer by enclosing this equation with math. to round down okay let's see what we get again 39 899 20 71 27 17 46 okay that seems like it's working what if we have a higher minimum let's say between 50 and 100 well I have 7 22 43 numbers that are below our minimum so if we have a minimum besides one I will add to the the end of this equation our minimum again okay let's see if that works so if I need a random number between 50 and 100 this equation should work 97 80 79 52 all right that seems like it's working so this is the equation you'll need to generate a random number between your minimum that you set and your maximum but let's change our minimum back to one and make sure our maximum is 100 all right let's move on to step two we'll create a variable name attempts to keep track of the attempts it takes a user I will set attempts to be zero and let guess I will declare this variable but not assign it quite yet we'll take care of that later I will also create a Boolean variable named running and I will set this to be true the reason that we have the Boolean variable running is so that we can exit the game when it's over we'll set running to equal false so to keep the game running we'll use a while loop while running equals true now if this is a Boolean variable you don't necessarily need this portion equals true you can just set this to be while running while this Boolean is true keep the game going then when we want to exit the game we will set running to equal false so that will be at the end now we need to accept some user input I'll do this with the window prompt we will set our guest to equal window. prompt I'll use a template literal guess a number between I'll add a placeholder our minimum through add another placeholder our maximum all right to test this I'm going to console.log the type of guess as well as what guess is there's something I need to show you guess I number between one and 100 I'll guess something right in the middle 50 let's inspect go to console so my user input of 50 is a string data type we'll need to convert it to a number for comparisons so after we get our guess let's reassign it and typ cast it as a number type let's let's try that again guess a number between 1 and 100 I'll type 50 okay inspect console we have our guess of 50 and it's a number data type what if you were to type in something that wasn't a number like a string of characters such as Pizza here's the result if you type cast some characters that are nonnumeric you know the number 0 through 9 you'll end up with not a number Pizza can't be converted to a number unfortunately I will delete this line of code we no longer need it I'll add an if statement there's a function to check to see if something is not a number is not a number function if our guess is not a number if this evaluates to be true let's add an alert window. alert please enter a valid number guess a number between 1 and 100 What if I type pizza please enter a valid number now what if somebody types in a guess that's below our minimum or above our maximum I'll add an else if statement else if our guess is below our minimum or our guess is above our maximum will window. alert please enter a valid number again guess a number between 1 and 100 what if I type in 150 that's above our maximum please enter a valid number please enter a number between 1 and 1001 please enter a valid number if the user's guess is a number and it's between our range between the minimum and the maximum we'll execute an L statement if they reach the L statement that means they have a valid number we'll increase our attempts variable by one attempts Plus plus to increment it if the guess if the guess is less than the answer then will window. alert too low try again else if the guess is greater than the answer will window. alert to high try again if the guess isn't lower than the answer and the guess isn't higher than the answer that means the guess must equal the answer within an else statement we'll congratulate the user they have the right answer window. alert correct the answer was and I should probably use a template literal for this if we're inserting variables the answer we'll let the user know how many attempts it took it took you the variable attempts then the word attempts at the end of our lse statement we'll move running equals false to within the lse statement at the end to ex at the game we no longer want to play once we have the correct answer all right and this should work let's try it guess a number between 1 and 100 I'll guess something right in the middle 50 too low try again okay so the answer is between 50 and 100 75 too high so it's between 50 and 75 62 too low 68 too high so it's between 62 and 68 65 too high 63 too low 64 yeah correct the answer was 64 it took you seven attempts and we can exit all right everybody so that is a number guessing game in JavaScript
