hey what's going on everybody so in today's video we're going to create a random number generator but first I need to explain how to create a random number in JavaScript let's store a random number within a variable which we will name random num to create a random number in JavaScript we can use the random method of math math dot random method this will generate a random number between 0 and 1. but it looks like we forgot to Output our random number so let's do that with console.log console.log randomnum this will generate a random number between 0 and 1. it will give us a number with a long decimal portion most likely let's say we would like to roll a sixsided dice I need a random number between one and six not including the decimal portion so the first step is that we will multiply math.random times six what this will do is give us a random number between 0 and 6 exclusive now I don't want the decimal portion I would like a whole integer we'll enclose this equation with the floor method of math dot floor then we will enclose our equation so now we have oops it looks like I misspelled math it should be Capital there so far a random number is going to be between zero and five so they're zero and there's five but I need one through six well we can increase the minimum by adding plus one or whatever you want the minimum to be so now that should give us a random number between one and six there's six and there's one for a random number between 1 and 100 I can set the maximum to be 100 math.random times one hundred plus one so now the number is going to be between 1 and 100. if you're looking for a random number between a certain range let's say 50 and 100 well we're going to change our equation just to make this easier to read I'm going to set two constants const Min what's the minimum let's say 50. and the max const max will be 100. let's replace 100 with our maximum and one with our minimum there's one additional change we need to make for example our random number is 139 we're multiplying math.random times 100 our maximum then adding an additional 50 to it so one change we're going to make is that we will subtract our minimum from our maximum then I will surround this portion of our equation with the set of parentheses just to force operator precedence now the random number should be between 50 and 100 so depending on the range of numbers you're looking for you can change the minimum and the maximum all right now with that out of the way let's create our random number generator let's go to our HTML file I will create a button the ID will be my button the text on the button will be roll we will roll a sixsided dice within our CSS style sheet I will set the text of the body of our document the font family I will set to be verdana because I like that font to Center align everything to make this easy I will set text aligned Center all right we're getting somewhere let's work on the button I will select the ID of my button I will change the font size of the button to be 3 em meaning 300 percent I'll add a little bit of padding within our button 5 pixels by 25 pixels and I will set the Border radius to be 5 pixels just to smooth the corners we're also going to need a label so let's go back to our HTML file I will add a label with an ID of my label within our CSS style sheet I will select the ID of my label then change the font size to be 3 em so be sure to save your CSS file save your HTML file then within our JavaScript file we will need to get our button and the label we'll store those within some constants const my button equals document dot get element by ID the ID of the element we're getting is my button then we will need to get my label my label the ID is my label let's set a minimum const Min equals I'll set that to be one as if we're rolling a sixsided dice const Max equals six then let random num will declare a random number variable but not assign it quite yet okay when we click on the button we'll execute a function we will take my button with the on click attribute I will set the SQL to a function what's the function going to do it's going to roll a random number random num equals math dot random times our maximum we'll enclose this equation with math.floor to round it math dot floor then add our minimum then we will change the text content of my label to display it my label dot text content equals our randomnum when we click on the button it should roll a random number uh what are we missing not a number oh okay it looks like I made a mistake I forgot to add a set of parentheses after random there we go I'm going to put the number on a new line so within our HTML file I'm just going to add a Break Tag there we go let's save everything roll again so I rolled a six three one two five three let's say we would like to roll three dice not just one we'll make a few changes I will replace my label with label one for the ID then I'm going to add a break after okay let's copy our label paste it two times we'll need labels two and three I'll also give these labels a class of my labels we can apply CSS styling to an entire class to make it easy all right within our CSS style sheet let's replace the ID of my label with the class of my labels be sure to save all of your files than within our Javascript file let's replace my label with label one the ID is label one copy this line of code then we need labels two and three label two label three let's rename randomnum as random num1 copy it paste it two times then we need random number two random number three within our function for our button change random num to be random num1 copy this line paste it two times then we need random number two random number three we'll change the text content of my label to be label one equals random num1 copy this line paste it two times change one to B2 then for the third line change one to be three what we'll do now is generate three random numbers between one and six as if we're rolling three dice two three two three six one two two five all right everybody that's how to create a random number generator in JavaScript
