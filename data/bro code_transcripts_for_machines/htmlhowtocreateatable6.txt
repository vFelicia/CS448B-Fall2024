hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here and in this video I'm gonna teach you guys how we can make a basic table in HTML let's get into it I guess tables are used to display a table of information it's useful if you need to organize some information in rosing columns so before we begin what I think we'll do for a project is we'll create a table of personal finances so before we create that table let's create a heading perhaps an h2 heading because I think that's a nice size and then let's close this so we'll make a title such as personal finances and if you're a baller you can write like a dollar sign underscore dollar sign like you're seeing money otherwise if you're broke like me you can put a frowny face the first step to creating it sable is that we need a pair of table tags so we'll make an opening table tag and a closing table tag everything related to our table is going to be between these two tags the second step is that we'll want to create our first row and we can use the TR tag and that is short for table row and you'll want to be sure to have a closing tag for this as well anything between these two tags will be included with the first table row and we'll make a couple table rows but let's begin with the first if we want to have a heading for the first cell in your table use the table heading tag otherwise if you don't want this to be heading you can use the TD tag for table data but let's say that for the first row we want these all to be headings we'll use the th tag for table heading and I'll show you the difference between each of these two tags so what I think I'll do for the first cell in the first row of our table is that I will put the word month here and then we need a closing th tag let's save this reload the page and it says month so we can add a few different cells within here so let's create another table heading tag and perhaps I will say January then let's close this save this reload and it says January right next to month so let's do this for a few months so let's do february th march perhaps one more April alright let's save this reload alright and this is the first row in our table let's say that we want to add a second row well we need to use the TR tags a pair of them and you'll want to be sure that you're adding this second pair of TR tags outside of the first so let's create another table row alright so what I think we'll do is that we will list perhaps income on the second row so I'll create a table heading and I will list this as income and then let's close this let's check this out alright so here is the first cell in our second row that says income and let's add a few more cells just to populate everything after income for this row so I'll just make up some numbers so we don't want to use a heading table heading we can but I don't think that's necessary for this part so we can use the TD tag or table data and I'll just make up an income so how about we say $1500 and then let's close this and let's see what this looks like alright and here it says $1500 let's populate the second row with a few other incomes and I'm just making up numbers here you don't have to copy this you can come up with your own numbers too or even use your own personal finances if this helps alright so I'll just make up a number 1750 so we'll make another set of table data tags and perhaps I will say 1250 then how about a low number for April $500 alright let's save this refresh right and here the rest of our row too is populated with data this table is becoming more difficult to read and one way to make it more readable is to add a border around this table and between each of these individual cells of this table so one way that we can add a border is that within the opening table tag we're going to type border we'll use the border attribute and we'll set this equal to any number you want for the width of your border to is a decent amount you can either put 2 or 2px for 2 pixels and let's save this reload and each cell within our table is now surrounded with a border so this is more neat and organized now one thing to notice with table headings and table data is that anything that's using the table heading tag is actually bold and it's centered and with these table data tags any text that's between these two tags is not bold and it's aligned to the left so you can use either table headings or table data tags freely depending on how you want your table arranged I feel like having anything within our first row or our first column as table headings wouldn't be a bad example but you can use table headings and table data tags freely based on whatever you want for your table you're not required to have table headings first for each table row but create these tables however you want all right so let's create another table row how about another for expenses so we need to create a table row by using a table row tag and then make sure to close this and let's create a table heading and we will put the text expenses and then close this let's save this reload just to check this out all right we have another row and the first cell in this row says expenses but I'm going to add a colon here just to match the others okay let's make up some expenses we can use a table data tag to add some data to this and I will make up some numbers perhaps 500 then for the next row how about a thousand we spent a lot of money for February you know Valentine's Day all right then table data then we realized we spent a lot of money so we're not gonna spend as much this month so perhaps 750 and then for the last month we didn't make much money so let's put a really low amount for expenses we spend $150 this month we were broke all right let's see what this looks like oh I think I'll add a minus sign all right let's reload this all right here is our expenses for each of these months let's create another table row perhaps one for savings like what is our savings with income minus expenses so let's create another table row so we need to use the opening TR tag for table row and a closing one as well right now we don't have any automatic ways of calculating what the sum of these two cells is like it's an Excel spreadsheet so I'm just gonna do this by hand so let's create a table heading and we will call this savings and we will close this table heading and let's create a table data cell and 1500 minus 500 is 1,000 I'm just gonna do the same thing with each of these columns so table data and for February we saved 750 dollars and for March I think that is 500 and lastly for April we did not save much we saved three hundred and fifty dollars all right let's see what our completed table looks like alright there is our last row savings and these are our savings for each of these months this black and white table is boring let's add some color I'll show you how to do that so within each of these table rows let's say we want to color the first row so go to the opening tag for the table row this is what we're gonna type BG color equals and then pick a color so pick whatever color you want I think I will just say gray let's save this and refresh the page all right well great technically isn't a color or is it I don't know but it's not white a black anymore which is the point let's do the same thing with income for the next opening tag of our next table row we're going to type BG color and you could pick a different color or the same one doesn't matter I think I will pick yellow like it's cold or something well let's save this reload and the second row in our table is now yellow so let's do the same thing for expenses and savings so BG color equals perhaps red because we're subtracting money it's negative it's a bad sign then let's do the same thing for the last row so BG color equals perhaps green save this reload here is our artistic exhibit of our personal finances colorized circa the year 2020 or so but you know what we can take this a step further let's change the background color of our table so within the opening table tag what we'll type is BG color equals and then we can give this a new background color perhaps black let's save this reload and the background of our table is now black we can also give the individual cells in our table a specified minimum width and height using the width and height attributes so for our month table cell it's going to be this one right here within the opening table height tag all right height equals and this is pixels perhaps ten and then with we can say equals 75 so let's see what this looks like and you can see that the dimensions of the month table cell as well as with the other cells that come after it all change to match the width of 75 and the height of 75 and you know what I'm going to apply this to the others as well just so that each of these cells in our table is more uniform so I'm going to paste this in each of these table heading tags so now all the cells in our table should be uniform then so that's kind of nice then if you want everything to be of the same size you can also apply the height and width attributes to the table as a whole as well so we'll put that within the opening tag of our table so let's specify a minimum height for the table we'll say perhaps 150 let's save this reload and the entire table now has a minimum height of 150 pixels now you're not limited to just specifying the height and the width and pixels you can also place a percentage here and the percentage applies to the room available on the web page so we could say width equals you can place pixels here otherwise you can place a percentage let's say that we want our width of our table to take up the entire webpage the entire width of the webpage that is so we'll say with equals 100 let's save reload and the width of the table now takes up the entire webpage and this is dynamic if I were to change the dimensions of this webpage the table is also going to change dimensions as well so the width will always take up 100% of the width of the webpage lastly for this topic on tables and I promised that this is gonna be the last one there's an attribute called a line and you can align text in the space that's available to it let's say that we want to align some of these dollar amounts within our table let's start with income so what we'll do is that we'll go to our table rrrow opening tag and we will use the align attribute now we can align text to the left to the center or to the right but let's say that we want to align all of the text within this table row to the center so we'll say align equals Center and then we will save this reload the page and all the dollar amounts within our income are Center aligned now so just to be consistent I'm going to copy this and put this in the other table rows that we have and voila here is our completed table and I would say that this is good enough for this beginner HTML tutorial if you would like a copy of this HTML document I'll copy all of this text and post it as a comment down below and pin it to the top and if you're looking for additional practice or a project to work on why don't you create your own table of your own personal finances but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started creating tables in HTML heyyou if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help
