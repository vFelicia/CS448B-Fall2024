hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can use iframes to embed web pages and other documents within your website so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey welcome back iframes the iframe element is used to embed content from another source into an html document they're commonly used for advertisements and they're easily abused with many hacking techniques so basically using an iframe we can embed another web page within our webpage or we could embed our current html document with another html document here's how we can create an iframe this is a selfclosing tag and we set the source equal to this can be an external website such as a url or we can place a relative file path to a file of our choosing so this doesn't work with many websites and i'll demonstrate that so let's set the source equal to google.com and then save and reload so google.com refused to connect that's because a lot of major websites have disabled the use of iframes since we're embedding another web page within our webpage a common hacking technique is that you can have this embedded web page take up the entire frame of your html document your website could pose as another website and that could be considered dangerous let's say that you embed a banking website like bank of america so if somebody visits your website it's actually a facade and somebody will type in their banking information like their login credentials and you could capture that so a lot of major websites have disabled the use of iframes so you cannot pose as their website one website that i checked that does work is bing so let's switch our url to that save and reload yeah see we have embedded the home page of bing uh but let's change the width and height attributes because this is fairly small let's say the width is 750 pixels and for the height let's say maybe 250. so save and reload cool yeah we have embedded bing within our web page and you can use this normally bro code now let's embed another document so let's create a new file let's pretend that this is an advertisement we would like to display within our webpage i'll name this add.html so if you're using vs code to generate an html document a plain one type exclamation point then hit tab so let's say something i'll use an h1 header tag this is an advertisement and then close it uh let's change the background color too using the style attribute and i will pick the background color property and set this to maybe i don't know that color uh then let's change the width and height for the height maybe 100 oh then make sure to change your source as well so we need to list the relative file path since these files are right next to each other i only have to list the file name add.html save reload cool and there is my fake advertisement embedded pages do have a border this is how to remove that set the style attribute equal to the border css property and set this to zero so i'm going to save reload and this no longer has that border so yeah everybody those are iframes they're used to embed content from another source into an html document they're useful for advertisements and they're easily abused with a lot of hacking techniques so yeah those are iframes if you learned something new be sure to smash that like button drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
