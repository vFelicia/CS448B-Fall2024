hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all everything you need to know to get started writing code in csharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn c sharp c sharp is a very flexible language we can use c sharp for all sorts of things console apps web services games and if you're an aspiring game developer c sharp is definitely a language you want to learn along with c plus but why not learn both and the average salary for a csharp developer if you have some experience is 63 000 per year according to glassdoor if that all sounds good let's begin to code with csharp we'll need an ide that's an integrated development environment think of it as software that helps us write other software one that i would recommend is visual studio community so you can just google that then head to this url at the top here okay then we are going to download visual studio and just follow the installation procedures so let's open this and run it so continue and here we have a bunch of different packages that we can download you'll want to check dot net desktop development for using c sharp and if you're interested in using unity you might as well just download this package too then we are going to install you have the option to sign in but i'm just going to click not now maybe later you can also pick a color theme for your ide i'm going to go with dark because i like to feel like a pretend elite hacker then start visual studio now with this home screen we'll continue without code i'll show you all how we can create a new project all right now to create a new project we'll go to file new project select c sharp console application next we'll need a name for this project i'll call this my first program next then create all right now this font size is very small you can either zoom in here down at the bottom or you can change the font as well as the font size by going to tools options environment fonts and colors and you can change the size here what about 18 and we should be good and here we have a small program that was created for us automatically all this does is display some output the words hello world to compile and run a program you just have to click this green play button at the top and this will create a console window that displays our output of hello world whatever we have written here within quotes and this line of code is known as the main method it's the entry point for where our program begins and this set of curly braces after the main method is the body of the main method so our program will begin by executing any code at the top of the main method and it will work its way down and execute any subsequent code that follows so this main method is made up of a bunch of words that we don't quite understand yet static void main string args in time we'll learn what each of these words mean but that's more of an advanced topic so a textbook that i read once said to think of the main method as like a magical spell or incantation that we have to say in order for our program to run so let's see what happens if i remove the main method i'll still keep this line though console.writeline hello world and let's try it okay so it looks like there were build errors so we cannot run the program as it is now so we do need that main method and if you are missing it you can just type it in and it should work now now this is a standard writeline method whatever text that we put within quotes will appear within our console window to display as output so let's actually change it right now it says hello world but let's type something else so make sure that this is within double quotes let's change this to i like pizza and then run this again so now my output should say i like pizza and then you can add a second line of output just by writing console.writeline then within parentheses and within double quotes you can write something else like it's really good and now we have two lines of output i like pizza it's really good so to write output to the console window you type console.writeline then within quotes some text that you want to write one thing that you may want to change is the font and the font size of your console window because right now it's very difficult for me to read so to change that right click in the top left corner go to properties then go to font let's increase this to maybe 28 you can pick a new font style as well i'll keep it the same then you can also change the color scheme too i'll change the screen text to maybe green then okay all right but now this window is huge so let's change that so again go to the top left corner go to properties then go to layout let's change the width to what about i don't know 50 and the height to let's say 15 i think that should be good okay yeah that's not too bad and here it's actually a lot easier to read i like pizza it's really good oh one last stupid thing that i wanted to show you all is how we can make our console beep type console dot beep parentheses semicolon so then our program is going to beep when it reaches the end it's not really important at all i just thought it would be something fun to throw in at the end of this video so that's how to make your console beep for some reason all right well that's the very basics of c sharp to get you started in the next video we'll cover more on output and comments so i'll post this code to the comment section down below and well that's the very basics to get you started in c sharp hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
