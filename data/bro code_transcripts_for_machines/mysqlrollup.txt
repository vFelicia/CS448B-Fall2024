hey again it's me today I'm going to be explaining the rollup claws like a fruit rollup it's an extension of the group by Clause it produces another row and shows the grand total it's also known as a super aggregate value here's an example I have a table of transactions what I would like to do is to group each transaction by the order date then produce a grant total here's what we'll do I'll give you a few different examples let's begin by selecting the sum of the amounts and the order date from our table transactions then we will Group by the order date and there we are we have the sum of every amount per order date using this rollup Clause I can add an additional row that shows a grand total so to say all I have to do after the group by Clause is ADD with rollup and there you go here's the grand total 7.88 plus 8.37 plus 8.97 is 25.22 here's another example let's count the transaction ideas buy order date we have two transactions on the first two on the second three on the third for a total of seven transactions I'll give you two more examples let's select the count of our transaction ideas per customer I'm going to give this count an alias as number of orders as well as the customer ID column from our table transactions we will Group by customer ID let's see what we have so far then I will add with roll up here are the amount of orders per customer ID the customer with an ID of 3 has visited here more than once the grand total of the number of orders is seven that's the roll up one last example let's select our employees table select all from employees we will group all of these employees by their employee ID then display a rollup of all of the hourly pay as a business how much are we spending on all of our employees per hour so let's select the sum of our hourly pay I'll give this an alias as hourly pay I guess it really isn't different from the column name we will display the employee ID as a column from our table employees Group by the employee ID with rollup here's the hourly pay of each employee as well as a grand total if all of our employees are working currently we are spending as a business 92.75 cents per hour well yeah that's the rollup Clause everybody it's an extension of the group by Clause it produces another row and shows essentially the grand total it's also known as a super aggregate value to include a rollup after the group by Clause just add with rollup it's probably good for accounting and well yeah that's the rollup clause in MySQL
