hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the date picker node in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay people in this video we'll use the date picker node to select a date using an interactive calendar that will appear once you press this button alternatively you can enter a date into this white bar here as well once we have our date we will change the text of a label to reflect that date so once you have your date picker node that is found underneath controls let's add some prompt text enter a date and your text will appear as a prompt within this white search bar here and let's give this date picker a unique id my date picker and on action let's say get date but we'll need to define this method later okay we need a label that's found underneath controls let's drag and drop it and i'm going to expand this although it's not necessary and i will change the font that's decent and center it i will give this label a unique id my label so add your controller class then we should be good let's head to our controller class now now open up your controller class we're going to inject our fxml at fxml private date picker my date picker and at fxml private label my label we need to define that getdate method public void get date action event event okay now we need to get the value of our date picker this will be a local date object local date my date equals my date picker dot get value so let's test this let's just print the date to our console window let's use system.out.printline my date but we'll need to use the to string method okay let's test this we should be able to select a date using this interactive calendar let's say whatever this date is okay so march 1st of 2021 so now let's change the text of our label instead so let's get rid of this line my label dot set text my date to string let's try it again okay march 1st 2021 nice now you can change the format of this date if you don't want the year first here's how to do so let's say we have string my formatted date equals date actually that's my date dot format date time formatter dot of pattern and we need a pattern if i would like the month first that would be two capital ms make sure you don't use lowercase because that's for minutes m m d d dash y yyyy and we will display my formatted date and let's run it okay march 1st 2021 now if you need the name of the month you use three capital m's okay march 1st 2021 well everybody that is the date picker node it allows us to use an interactive calendar to select a date if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below but yeah that's the date picker node in javafx
