hey yeah so today I got to explain a checkboxes in pqt 5 to work with checkboxes we will need the following import from the module of widgets from pyqt5 import Q check box to work with different states we will also need the following import from PI qt5 do QT core import QT this module of QT core it contains non goey classes relevant to Pi qt5 applications so be sure that you get this import as well to create a checkbox I will create this within the Constructor of my main window we will create a checkbox with self the name of the checkbox which I will name checkbox equals call The Constructor of the Q checkbox class the first argument is going to be the text of the checkbox what do you want the check boox to say let's ask do you like food the second argument is the parent widget where we will be adding this checkbox let's say self self will apply to this window we could use a layout manager but I want to keep this lesson as simple as possible we're just going to focus on checkboxes and their functionality so we should have a checkbox however we can barely see it the font is really really small I have a method to initialize the user interface that's where we'll set the stylesheet and the geometry of our checkbox let's set the stylesheet self dot the name of the checkbox checkbox do set Styles sheet method then we can pass in some CSS like properties let's set the font size to be 30 pixels and I will pick a font family font family aial oh and we should change the geometry of the label it's getting cut off self dot the name of the checkbox which is checkbox let's set the geometry pass in some X and Y coordinates for the placement as well as a width and the height I will pick 500 and 100 uh maybe I'll move it a little more to the right by 10 pixels that's pretty good our checkbox has an initial State it's normally unchecked that's the default Behavior but we could set that to be checked with the following method when the window loads let's take our checkbox self. checkbox call the set checked method then pass in true so then when the window loads the checkbox is already checked but let's keep that as false now this checkbox it doesn't do anything when I check it let's add some functionality we'll take our checkbox connect a signal to a slot the slot can be a function or a method let's define a method within our main window class let's name this me method checkbox changed we will call this method when the state of our checkbox changes there is one parameter besides self a state now the state parameter is going to be provided to us when we interact with our checkbox when we check the checkbox let's print something like a test message you like food we have to connect a signal of State changed to a slot of checkbox changed we will take self dot the name of the checkbox which is checkbox the signal will be State changed to connect a slot to a signal we use the connect method then pass in a function or method name so we are working with methods this method belongs to the window class we'll prefix the method name with self self. checkbox changed so when I run this program when I check the checkbox we execute this method you like food now when I uncheck it I instead would like to display you do not like food so that's where our state is going to come in I'm going to print our state just to see what it is our state is going to be a value when we check the check boox our state has a value of two when we uncheck it it has a value of zero 0 means unchecked two means checked there's also one for partially checked but that's not going to be relevant to this topic so zero or two we could add an if statement such as if state is equal to two then print you like food however that's not really readable other developers looking over your code are going to understand what two is by looking at it instead let's use the following we will access the class of QT there's a builtin constant of checked this also equals two but it's more readable it's a constant so if state is equal to QT checked print you like food I will check the checkbox you like food when I uncheck it nothing happens let's add an else statement else let's print you do not like food so then when I check the checkbox we print you like food when I uncheck it we print you do not like food you like food you do not like food you like food you do not like food all right everybody so that is an introduction to checkboxes in pi qt5
