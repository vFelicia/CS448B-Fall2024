hey everyone we're going to cover some basic arithmetic in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show everyone i thought we could just cover some basic arithmetic real quick let's say we have a variable friends and i will assign this a value of what about five and within a writeline statement i will display the value stored within friends so of course friends will have a value of five but what if i need to update this like increment it i could say friends equals friends and we make a friend so we could say friends equals friends plus one because remember the value stored within friends is five this is no different from saying friends equals five plus one which would be six so let me display the value stored within friends and of course that's six of course you can change this to a different number too you could say friends equals friends plus two then the amount of friends that we have is seven so there is a shortcut of writing this too because this can be somewhat tedious what you could say is friends plus equals then the amount that you want to increment this variable by so if i need to increment friends by two i could say friends plus equals two and that would do the same thing that's like a shortcut so of course that would be seven so there's a third way to increment and decrement two this method is found within loops you could say friends plus plus however this will only increment a variable by one so if friends is initially five then we say plus plus well then friends will equal six so there's three different ways to increment a variable this way is found within loops this is the standard way and that's kind of the shortcut this line right here okay so let's decrement friends so we could say friends equals friends minus one or we could say friends minus equals one or friends minus minus so if we combine all these the amount of friends that we have is two let's work on some multiplication if we need to double the amount of friends that we have we would say friends equals friends times we use an asterisk for multiplication and programming times two then the amount of friends that we have is ten and the shortcut would be friends asterisk equals two and that would do the same thing now division let's say that steve breaks up our group of friends so we could say friends equals friends divided by two and for division we use a forward slash now pay attention to this our current number of friends is five but what if we divide this by two well you would think that we get two point five right well you're wrong we end up with two that's because friends is an integer we can only store whole numbers we can't store that decimal portion that 0.5 so if this was a double well then that would be 2.5 so that's referred to as integer division and that's something you have to look out for so if friends equals friends divided by two well then the shortcut would be friends forward slash equals two and that would do the same thing and then remember i'm storing this within an integer so we will truncate that decimal portion and we end up with two and our last operator for this topic is the modulus also known as the remainder operator now for this example i'm going to change the amount of friends that we have to 10 so we can find the remainder of any division but i'm going to store this within a new variable int remainder and to find the remainder we could say friends then modulus which is represented by a percent sign than 3. so 10 divided by 3 will have a remainder and we will store that remainder within a new variable so let's pretend that we have a total of 10 people and we have to break up into groups of three so there's going to be one person remaining and i will just display that remainder of 1 but if this was in groups of 2 so friends modulus 2 well 10 divides by 2 evenly so there will be no remainder and the value will be 0. so if you need to find the remainder you can always use this modulus the remainder operator and it's also pretty good for finding if numbers are even or odd too so that's always a plus as well all right everybody so that is some basic arithmetic i will post this code to the comment section down below and well that's some basic arithmetic in c sharp
