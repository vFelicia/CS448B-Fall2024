hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can update and delete data from a table in my example we have a table of employees however Sheldon Plankton is missing some information and hourly pay and a higher date let's update those fields to update some data in a table we would use the update keyword the name of the table employees in my example then set which column would we like to interact with first let's interact with hourly pay set hourly pay let's pay Plankton ten dollars and 25 cents per hour we should probably add a where Clause I need to specifically select Plankton where let's select his employee ID where employee ID equals six then semicolon to end the statement you could also select Plankton by his first name or last name as well when I execute the script Plankton's hourly pay is now 10.25 cents per hour to update multiple columns you can change more than one field at once after your first change you can add a comma then change another field let's change Plankton's higher date to be the following higher date equals 10 230 Dash zero seven I'll make his hourly pay 10.50 I'm feeling generous here we are Plankton's hourly pay is now ten dollars fifty cents his higher date is January 7th 2023. to set a field to null meaning no value you would just say equals null for example let's take Plankton's higher date set the higher date equal to null Plankton's higher date is now null so maybe we're gonna fire him or something in this next example I'll give you a demonstration but you don't want to follow along to update all of the rows within a column you would exclude the where clause if I were to set hourly pay equal to 10.25 that would affect all of the rows after executing this statement the hourly pay for everybody is now 10.25. that's an example of how you could set a column to be one consistent value to delete a row from a table you would type delete from the name of the table now don't write just the statement it will delete all rows in your table here's an example do not do this I will delete from employees there my whole table is gone do not do this be sure to add a where Clause when deleting from a table otherwise this will delete all your rows where employee ID equals six yep and Plankton is no longer there all right everybody that is a super quick video on how to update and delete data from a table
