hey it's me again today I'm going to explain the for each method in JavaScript the for each method is used to iterate meaning Loop through the elements of an array and apply a specified function to each element you have an array we can use the builtin for each method of arrays and send each element through a call back to a function here's an example I'll create an array of numbers let numbers equals 1 through 5 then I'm going to create a function to display each element function display there will be one parameter an element we will individually display each element within this array console.log each element I can display each element of this array by using the for each method we will take our array Dot use the builtin for each method then pass a call back as an argument we will pass our display function as an argument so this should display all of the elements in my array to the console 1 2 3 4 5 believe it or not the element argument is provided for us with the for each method behind the scenes the for each method will provide to a callback an element index and array argument an element for the current element that we're on when looping through this array an index that keeps track of the current index number and the location of the array itself in this case it would be numbers that's why when we pass the display function as a callback we're already provided with an element argument behind the scenes so we're using the for each method to display all of the elements of this array let's use the for each method again to double each element before displaying it I will create a new function function double to double the value of each element element index and array are provided for us automatically for each element what are we going to do let's take our array at index of index index keeps track of the current index number so during each iteration it's going to increment by one starting with zero we will take our element multiply it by two all right so let's take our numbers array use the for each method then pass a call back to our double function so now all of these elements should be doubled let's triple them now we'll create a function for triple function triple we will set the parameters to be the same but we will multiply each element by three then pass in a call back for triple so now we have 3 6 9 12 15 they're all tripled let's Square each element function Square again the element index and array arguments are provided for us take our array that we receive at index of the current index number set the equal to to square a number we can use the power method of math then raise a base to a given power we are raising our base of element to the power of two if I pass our Square function as a call back to for each we will now Square each number before playing it 1 49625 then this time let's create a cube function function Cube raise our element to the power of three pass our Cube function as a call back to the for each method and now each number is cubed 1 8 27 6415 let's create a more practical example I will create an array of fruits let fruits equals some fruit we have an apple we have an orange a banana and a coconut we'll create a function to display each element function display it's kind of like what we did before an element argument is going to be provided to us during each iteration let's console.log each element and then we will use the builin for each method of our array fruits fruits. for each we will pass our function as a callback to display each element of this array Apple orange banana coconut let's create a function to make all of these strings uppercase function uppercase we'll need an element index and array element index array during each iteration let's take our array that we receive add the index of our index equals take the element that we receive use the two uppercase method so we have an uppercase function that utilizes the two uppercase method remember that a method usually belongs to something this method belongs to the element that we receive functions are Standalone before displaying each element within my array of fruits let's take our fruits array use the for each method then apply a call back to uppercase to make all of the elements uppercase before displaying them what I'm going to do is copy all of these elements so they will begin uppercase I'll create a lowercase function function lowercase we have our element index and array with this line of code we will use the two lowercase method within the for each method we will pass our lowercase function as a callback to make all of the elements lowercase let's set the elements of our array to be all lowercase again this will be a challenge round we will capitalize the first letter in each element of this array we will create a function capitalize the element index and array arguments are going to be provided to us take our array that we receive at the current index set this equal to we're going to get the first character in each element we will take our element get the first character Char at index of zero method chain 2 uppercase to make this letter uppercase then we will string concatenate our element use the slice method we'll create a substring begin at index one this portion is going to create a substring of every character besides the first the first character we're going to make uppercase so now this should work so let's take our capital I function pass it to the for each method and now the first character in each element is all uppercase all right everybody so that is the for each method it's used to iterate over the elements of an array and apply a specified function as a call back to each element you take your array use the for each method then pass a call back as an argument it's really useful if you need to apply a function to each element of this array and well everybody that is the for each method in JavaScript
