hey what's going on everybody in today's video we're going to create a temperature conversion program using HTML CSS and JavaScript so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's begin everybody we will begin within our HTML file make sure you've linked a script to your Javascript file which we'll fill in later so within the body of our document we will create a form element within our form we will create an H1 heading for the title of this program which we will name temperature conversion is good after our H1 element we'll create an input element this is a selfclosing tag it's a text box since we're going to be converting temperatures I will set the type to be number so that should give us some arrows to increase or decrease the number or type one in if we need to I'm going to give this text box an ID of of textbox we'll be referring to this text box by its ID later I'm also going to go ahead and set an initial value of zero then we can increase or decrease the number like I said before it is a little small but with CSS we will increase the size what I'm going to do now is create two radio buttons along with labels so we have input input is a selfclosing tag the type will be radio and for the ID this will be a radio button to convert to Fahrenheit I can never spell Fahrenheit we'll want the radio buttons in the same group I will set the name of the group to be unit oh looks like I misspell type there we go so I'm going to place our radio button on a new line so within our first input element I will add a line break all right so after our first radio button I'll create a label for it label this label will be four 2 Fahrenheit and the text will be Celsius to Fahrenheit or if you prefer you could create like an arrow I don't really like the look of that let me use an emoji instead so on Windows to create an emoji you can hold windows and semicolon is there an arrow that'll work so when you click on the label you should also be able to select the radio button that's because the four attribute is the same as the ID attribute of the radio button okay let's copy both the first radio button and the label then paste it but change Fahrenheit to Celsius let's switch these around Fahrenheit to Celsius to Celsius I'm also going to add a line break after our first label so right here as well as here Google wants to translate my web page from German to English it's probably because of the word fahrenheit I'm guessing now I'll create a button the type will be button the text will be submit there is an onclick attribute for buttons onclick when we click on this button we can execute a JavaScript function eventually we'll be creating a function named convert actually let's take care of that now before we forget So within our Javascript file function convert we'll fill this in later so when we click on the button we will execute the convert function then lastly we're going to display a result whatever the new temperature is we'll use a paragraph element the ID will be result and just as a placeholder for now I'm going to type select a unit all right so far so good let's style this program with CSS now be sure to save your HTML file we'll move on to CSS we will first change the body of our document let's change the font family of the body of our document I'll pick aial with a backup of son's serif I'll change the background color too backgroundcolor I like using hsl values let's type a color such as black we will change the color to be hsl I'll go with a very light gray color like 95% so the background is going to be slightly light gray we'll fill in the form section to be Pure White we will select our H1 element that's going to be the header I'll pick a color again I'll be using hsl values let's go with I don't know blue feel free to pick a different color if you would like that's not bad then we'll fill in the form our form contains pretty much all of these elements so let's select our form I will change the background color I'll just copy this sline and paste it but I'll make this Pure White I'll text Al line Center everything within this form so everything should be centered I'll set a Max width of the form because right now it's taking up 100% of the width of the web browser so max width will be how about 350 pixels we would like this form to be within the middle aligned horizontally we can set margin to be Auto to automatically Center that I'll add a little bit of padding around the elements within our form padding let's do 25 pixels I'll smooth the corners of the form using border radius border radius 10 pixels then I'll add a box shadow box shadow the first value is the horizontal offset let's set that to be five pixels then the vertical offset I will set that to be 5 pixels the third value is the blur radius because right now it's fairly concentrated let's stick with 15 pixels not bad you can also select a color again I'm going to use hsl values you can also change the transparency I'll set mine to be 30% or approximately 30% 0.3 not bad so that's my box Shadow now we're going to change the text box so this text box does have an ID text box let's select this element by its ID I'll set the width to be 50% it's going to take up 50% of the width available let's text align Center the number is going to be right in the middle let's change the font size let's do 2 em for 200% I'll add a border to pixel solid then I'll pick some hsl values for the color I'll make it a little transparent maybe like 80% let's select a border radius for pixels to smooth the corners I'll add a little bit of margin below the text box marginbottom 15 pixels is good that's going to push the radio buttons down further just to give this text box more space let's work on the radio buttons next so we are selecting the labels so let's take every label I'll change the font size so it's a little bigger 1.5 em for 150% I'll make the font weight to bold just to bold it there let's select our button we are selecting our button I'll add a little bit of margin above the button margintop 15 pixels let's change the background color of the button pick a color I'll pick red and again I'm going to use hsl values because I like them Ah that's decent I'll change the font size of the button 1.5 em for 150% I'll remove the border border none I'll add some padding 10 pixels for the top and bottom of the button 15 for the sides I'll round the the corners with border radius border radius 5 pixels I'm going to change the font color color white then when I hover my cursor over the button I will change the cursor to be a pointer and that appears to work now so when I hover over the button I'll use the hover pseudo class to change the background color of the button we are selecting our button then s select the hover sudo class we'll make the background color just a little bit darker we'll change the lightness of our hsl value to be like 10% darker so I have 60% I'll change that to be 50 so now the background should change when I hover over the button lastly let's change the CSS properties of the result so this should have an ID of result result I'll make the font size a little bit bigger font size 1.75 em is good and I'll make the font weight bold font weight bold all right and that is all the CSS we need be sure to save everything and then we will move on to our Javascript file all right so what I like to do is at the top of my JavaScript program I will declare all of the constants and variables that I'll need so let's get our text box I'll set this to be a constant const text text box equals document. getet element by ID the ID that we're selecting is our text box we'll need the two Fahrenheit radio button let's copy this line paste it get the ID of two Fahrenheit const to Fahrenheit get element by ID to Fahrenheit then 2 Celsius 2 Celsius const 2 Celsius the ID is 2 Celsius so that will be this radio button copy this line paste it then we need the result to display the result result get element by ID result within our HTML file we don't necessarily need to select a unit anymore We'll add that later if somebody presses submit without selecting a radio button then we need let temp for the temperature when we click on the submit button we will execute this function convert so what are we going to do within this function we'll begin with an if statement we'll check to see if our two Fahrenheit radio button is selected so take two Fen height we'll use the checked property if this radio button is checked it's going to return true if it's not it's going to be false else if 2 Celsius is checked to celsius. checked we'll perform some different actions else let's change the content of our result so here result. text content equals select a unit let's see if this works be sure to save everything I am not going to select a radio button I'm just going to submit and that's correct select a unit we didn't select one let's be sure that these two radio buttons are working just temporarily I'm going to change the result within the if and else if statement you selected 2 Fahrenheit and you selected two Celsius I just want to be sure that these radio buttons are working so let's convert two Fahrenheit submit you selected 2 Fahrenheit we'll select the second radial button you selected 2 Celsius okay we know that this program is reading these radio button successfully so we no longer need these two lines of code we're going to get the number from our text box we'll store that within temp temp for temperature temp equals take our text box access the value within so when we accept user input it's of the string data type I'm going to typ cast the value as a number so we can use it with math okay then we're going to take our temperature and convert it to Fahrenheit here's the formula temp equals temp * 9 / 5 + 32 then we're going to update the text content of the result result. text content equals our temperature then I'm going to add plus Fahrenheit so to add the degree symbol on Windows you can hold alt then type 0176 on the numpad so this will be Fahrenheit let's type 100° CI to Fahrenheit that gives us 212° f 10 would be 50 1° c would be 33.8 0 is 32° F if you would like to add some Precision following our temperature there's a builtin method two fixed We'll add one point of precision this will give us one digit past the decimal place 0° C converted to Fahrenheit is 32.0 De fah 10° C is 50° F let's copy these three lines then paste them within the else if statement we'll keep this line the same but we'll change the formula temp equals within parentheses temp 32 * 5 9 then change Fahrenheit to Celsius so what is 32° fah converted to Celsius that is zero 100 is 37.8 all right everybody so that is a simple temperature conversion program using JavaScript HTML and CSS
