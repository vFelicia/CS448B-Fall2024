hey what's going on people it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can download and set up javafx for intellij so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm step one is to download the java fx sdk you can just google this so go to this first link open jfx dot io scroll down to getting started click this visit button go to java fx and intellij nonmodular from ide and there should be a link here download the appropriate javafx sdk scroll down to latest release and select the correct sdk for your operating system i'm running windows so i'm going to download this first link once that's downloaded you may need to extract this file i'm going to right click on this file and extract all and you'll probably want to extract this file to a location that you'll remember i'm just going to keep this my downloads folder because i'm really lazy so we just need to extract this file and give it a second all right and then once that file is extracted we can move on to step two step two is to create a new javafx project within intellij we can do so by going to file new project go to javafx project select the appropriate sdk next we should come up with a name for this project let's call this hellofx and finish and you can click this window all right so then if everything checks out you should have a main.java file and there's going to be some warnings here this will be a sample that will create a basic window for you but there's still a few more things that we need to do to get this up and running which will bring us to step three step three is to add our sdk library go to file project structure libraries plus java and then find wherever you placed that sdk download that you extracted so for me that's in downloads probably not the best spot but i don't really care so open up that sdk folder and go to your library folder okay okay apply okay if you did everything correctly then all of those red warnings should go away step four is to add virtual machine options head back to this webpage open jfx dot io go to java fx and intellij nonmodular from ide and scroll down to the portion regarding adding virtual machine options so we'll need to copy some text if you're using linux or mac copy this line of text if you're using windows copy this other line of text so i'm running windows i will copy this line of text and i'll include both of these in the description for this video so you don't have to navigate to this webpage if you don't want to let's head back to intellij within intellij to add virtual machine options go to the top toolbar under run edit configurations vm options and then paste all of that text that we copied within the quotes there is currently a file path we need to delete this and replace this with the file path of that sdk that we downloaded so locate the sdk that you extracted and navigate to the library folder we need this address so i'm going to right click copy address go back to vm options and within the quotes i'm going to paste this new file path to the library folder of my extracted sdk apply then okay if you've done everything correctly after running this program a small window should appear and this will serve as the foundation for all of our javafx gui applications alright everybody that's how to download and set up javafx for intellij if you would like a copy of all these steps and the relevant links i will post those in the description down below but yeah that's how to set up javafx for intellij hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
