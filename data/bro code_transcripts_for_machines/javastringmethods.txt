hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about a few useful methods of the string class so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm hey welcome back my good people in this video i'm going to explain a few useful methods of the string class now as you know a string is a reference data type that can be used to store one or more characters and reference data types have access to some fairly useful methods let's begin by creating a string variable called name string name equals and let's assign this a value of whatever your name is so let's type our name variable dot and here are all the methods that we have access to i'll describe and explain a few of the more useful methods that you might be interested in at this level so let's begin with the equals method this will compare two strings to see if they are equal so within the equals method let's type another string i'm just going to copy what i have for my name to make this easy this will return a boolean value and we can do something with that boolean value such as use it for an if statement or anything else so i'm going to store the result within a boolean value let's call this result boolean result equals name dot equals and then type in a string and let's display what the result is so our equals method is going to compare my two strings my name variable and whatever string is within here and this will return true however it is case sensitive though if i made the b in my name lower case this will now return false but i could instead use the equals ignore case method and now both of these strings according to my equals ignore case method is now true next on my list is the length method and just to keep things simple i'm going to turn this line into a comment and i am going to create a new variable so the length method is going to return an integer based on the length of a string int result equals name dot length and this will return a value of three because we have three letters in my name but your name might be different we also have the char at method this will return a single character char result equals name dot char at and we list an index if we would like to access the first character in our string that would be index zero and the second position would be one the third position would be two then you just continue on in that pattern so the character at index zero of my name is capital b then we have index of this will return an integer int result equals name dot index of this will find a character and return the index of where the method finds that character so let's say i would like to find an index of capital b so this will return the position and we have a capital b at index zero if this was oh lowercase o that is at index two we can also check to see if a string is empty this will return a boolean value boolean result equals name dot is empty so currently my name is not empty and this will return false now if i got rid of my name and we just have an empty set of quotes here this will return true because my name variable is now empty so let me reverse that and move on to the next method we also have the two uppercase method we can change all of the letters in a string all to uppercase so this will return a string string result equals name dot to uppercase now my name is all uppercase and there is also to a lowercase actually i'm just going to copy most of this paste it and change upper to lower this will change all of the characters in my name all to lowercase and now the b in my name is now lowercase we can also trim some empty space before and after the string string result equals name dot trim so this will remove all of this empty space that i just added the trim method will remove all of this empty space before and after my characters that i have and the last method i have to show you guys is the replace method this will return a string and we can replace a character with another within a string name dot replace and there are two values we need to place within the replace method an old character and a new character that we want to replace the old character with let's say we would like to replace all os with is so this will replace the o in my name with a and now my name is bra well guys and gals that is a few of the more useful string methods but not all of the methods entirely available to you if you type in a string variable type dot at least with the clips this will prompt an entire list and you can always read through some of the descriptions to see what some of these methods will do so those are a few of the more useful string methods if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below don't be afraid to help me out and smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
