yo what's going on everybody so today I'm going to discuss Lambda functions in Python a Lambda function is a small anonimous function for a onetime use then we throw them away they take any number of arguments but only have one expression a few of the benefits of Lambda functions is that they help keep the namespace clean because we don't have to think of a unique name for that function we're only going to use it once we don't need to give it a name and they're useful with something called higher order functions which we still need to talk about there sort map filter and reduce for example here's an example of a Lambda function that you may see within a map method we have Lambda our parameters colon our expression I haven't talked about the map function yet a Lambda function is a function you would commonly see within the map function a higher order function but that's a topic for a future video in this video we're going to focus more on the syntax of Lambda functions so what we'll do is we will create a variable let's say double we'll write a Lambda function to double a number following this formula we have to type the keyword Lambda to specify that this is a Lambda function we have our parameters we will accept one parameter which we will name X colon then a oneline expression let's say with X I would like to double it x * 2 so what we're doing is we're assigning a Lambda function to a variable although you could assign a Lambda function to a variable that's not the primary use of them you would more likely see Lambda functions within higher order functions like I said we're just covering the syntax of a Lambda function with this variable of double it contains a function meaning we can call it to demonstrate that I'm going to print my double variable since it contains a function within it we can call it we have to pass in one AR arent let's say two we will double two and print the result which gives me four if I were to double three that would give me six if I doubled four that gives me eight with Lambda functions we can have any number of arguments this time we'll create two arguments we will assign a variable of ADD and add two numbers together with a Lambda function Lambda our parameters are X comma y colon then expression let's add X and Y together x + y I will take my variable of add it contains a function within it I can call it but I have to pass in two arguments for X and Y let's add two and three then we have to print it in order to see it and the result is five let's write a more complicated expression we'll find the greater of two numbers I will create a variable of max value equals again following this formula Lambda then we need the parameters we'll compare two numbers X and Y we return x if x is greater than y else we will return y this is similar to a list comprehension I will print take my variable of max value call the Lambda function that's within it pass in two numbers what is the greater number between four and five five what about six and five well we get six okay let's do the opposite let's find the minimum value we have X and Y return x if x is less than y else Y what is the minimum value between 6 and 7 6 what about between 8 and 7 seven we'll create a Lambda function to concatenate a string I will create a variable of full name equals Lambda we will have two parameters first meaning first name and last meaning last name we'll take our first name first plus a space plus the last last name I will print our full name variable call the Lambda function that's within it passing a first name and a last name I will pick SpongeBob last name SquarePants this will give me a full name of SpongeBob space SquarePants all one long string because we're using string catenation using a Lambda function we can check to see if a number is even I will create a variable of is even this will give us a Boolean Lambda X will be the parameter X modulus 2 modulus gives you the remainder of any Division if x is divisible by two that means there is going to be no remainder we can check to see if that is equal to zero so I will print our is even variable call the Lambda function that's within it let's see if the number four is even four divides by two evenly that's true but what about five that's false Let's do an age verification check I will create a variable of age check equals Lambda we have one parameter of age I will return true if our age is greater than or equal Al to 18 else we will return false I will print our age check variable and pass in 21 that returns true but what about 12 that returns false all right everybody so those are Lambda functions they're small Anonymous functions for a onetime use they take any number of arguments but only have one expression using Lambda functions helps keep the space clean because we don't need to constantly think of different function names especially within a larger program and they're extremely useful with something called higher order functions such as sort map filter and reduce which we'll be covering in the next few videos and well everybody those are Lambda functions in Python
