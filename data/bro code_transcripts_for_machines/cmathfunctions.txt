hey what's going on everybody so in this video i'm going to show you some useful math functions in c now if we include this math header file this contains a lot of the useful functions i'm about to show you one useful function is the square root function let's say that we have a bunch of variables we declared them but we have not yet assigned them i will assign a the square root of nine so after including this math header file i have access to a square root function so type sqrt then add a set of parentheses and within the parentheses we can find the square root of a number let's find what the square root of 9 is and then display it with a printf statement so the square root of 9 is 3. so let's move on we can raise a base to a given power by using the pow function the first number is the base let's raise 2 to the power of 4 and then display it 2 to the power of 4 is 16. we can round a number and i will store this within an integer let's round 3.14 oh and then make sure you use the appropriate format specifier for ins 3.14 rounded is three now by using the seal short for sealing function we can always round a number up 3.14 rounded up is four likewise there's a floor function where we will always round down three point nine nine rounded down is three we can find the absolute value of a number that's how far a number is away from zero so it will take any negative numbers and make them positive the absolute value of negative 100 and that would be positive 100 if you're familiar with logarithms we can find the logarithm of a number log 3 is 1.098612 and if you know some trigonometry there's various functions for sine cosine and tangent so what's the tangent of 45 that is supposedly this number 1.619775 so yeah everybody those are a few math functions that you might be interested in to use these just include this header file at the top math.h if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
