all right welcome back everybody in this video we're going to create a simple number guessing game let's declare our variables int num our number will be randomly generated and guess this variable will hold the current player guess and tries how many tries is it going to take for the user to guess the correct number we'll be using the sran function to generate some random numbers pass in time pass and null we will assign our variable num a random number between 1 and 100 rand function modulus 100 then add one this function will give us a random number between one and one hundred start with the num just for some decorations i'm going to create a title for this game number guessing game then add a new line i'll place all of this code within a do while loop do while our guess does not equal num we will have the user type in another guess we'll create a prompt standard output enter a guess between 1 through 100 standard input guess once the user types in a guess we will increment our tries variable by one to keep track of the score now we'll have to examine the guess versus the number if guess is greater than num let's display too high i'll add a new line else if guess is less than num then we'll display to low else if the guess is not above the number and the guess is not below the number the guess must be equal to the number standard output correct we'll display the number of tries number of tries we'll display our tries variable i'll add a new line and i'll just add a line of text for decoration at the bottom once we exit the game that should be everything let's run this number guessing game i'll guess something right in the middle 50 too low okay so the number is between 50 and 100. i'll guess right in the middle of that range 75 too high something between 50 and 75 perhaps 62 that's still too high 56 too high 53 too low 54. 55. all right the correct guess was 55 it took me seven tries i don't really think that's too good but it works okay everybody that is a simple number guessing game involving the use of do while loops and generating random numbers if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comment section down below if you're enjoying this series please let me know by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
