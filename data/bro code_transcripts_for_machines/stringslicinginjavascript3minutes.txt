sup everybody let's talk about the slice method the slice method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string without modifying the original string how is this useful maybe we have a variable full name set the sequel to whatever your full name is what i would like to do is extract certain portions of this full name to create a first name and a last name without changing the full name i'll declare two additional variables but not assign them yet first name as well as last name i can create an entirely new string from an existing string via the slice method let's extract this last name and assign it to this last name variable last name equals then type the original string full name dot slice within the parentheses there's up to two values that we can add the starting index and the ending index if i need my last name that would be at index 0 1 2 3 4. so 4 would be the last value if you don't add a second value it's assumed to copy everything until the end of the string i would like the entire rest of the string after index 4 and then we'll assign it to this new variable last name let's display it to test it console.log last name and this should display my last name yep what if i need the first name you can place up to two indices so first name equals type the original string full name dot slice the starting index will be zero and the ending index will be in my example zero one two three this doesn't include the last character all right then let's display my first name and there's my first name even though this does work it wouldn't be realistic to do this by hand manually every time we would like to create a first name and a last name from a full name right so why don't we use the string index of method to search for any spaces and return an index so let's try this again let's begin with last name last name equals full name dot slice and we only need one index we need the starting position of where to begin so we would like to begin where there's any spaces plus one so we need to begin at this character in my example but it might be different depending on what your full name is so i would like to search for any spaces and i can do that by taking my string full name dot and use the index of operator and we will search for the index of any spaces so let me hide my first name here oh pay attention to capitalization there however i need to get rid of the space because the first value is inclusive so i will add plus one everything after the first space slice it and create a new string so there's my last name then let's do this with our first name first name equals full name dot slice then we'll need two indices zero the beginning and we will end wherever there's a space so there's my first name and my last name let's try a different name just to be sure that it's working right how about snoop dogg yep snoop dogg alright everybody that is the slice method it extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string without modifying the original string in our example we created a first name and a last name from a user's full name and that is the string method if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
