hey welcome back everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can make some tables in MySQL a table in a relational database they consist of rows and columns kind of like an Excel spreadsheet in this topic we're going to create the table and the columns but we'll be populating the rows in the next video to create a table you'll type create table then the name of the table I'll create a table named employees then add a set of parentheses semicolon at the end within the set of parentheses we will list the columns for employees let's have an employee ID comma each column is separated with a comma then a first name last name how about hourly pay that'd be good higher date which date were they hired there's one thing that's missing after each column we need to set the data type of what we're storing within each column exactly is the data going to be whole integers decimals text a timestamp those are data types an employee ID that could be a whole integer the data type will be int add int after the column name a first name that's a series of characters the data type for some text would be VAR Char then within parentheses the maximum amount of characters I think 50 characters is enough for a first name last name varchar 50 is good hourly pay maybe our hourly pay is in dollars and cents we'll need a decimal portion there is a data type that is decimal add a set of parentheses we'll add the maximum amount of digits for our decimal I think five should be good then a Precision two for two decimal places the reason that I set the maximum digits of my hourly pay to be five is that I don't anticipate anybody's hourly pay being over 999.99 per hour that's pretty absurd I think five is enough then we have higher date there is a data type which is date if you need to work with dates otherwise there's date time if you need to include the time just the date is fine let's execute the script we have created our table employees if I were to refresh my schemas window underneath tables we have our employees table now I'll show you how we can select a table if you need to select your table you can type select asterisk from the name of the table employees let's take a look here's our table so far there's no rows but there are columns we have employee ID first name last name hourly pay and hire date if you need to rename a table you could type rename table the original name employees to whatever the new name is perhaps workers let's try that rename table employees to workers was successful if I refresh my schemas window the table employees is now known as workers but I think that's stupid let's go back and change it rename table workers to employees to drop a table I discussed this earlier you would type drop table the name of the table I don't want to drop this so I'm not going to execute the statement but that's how you would drop a table drop table the name of the table if you need to alter a table there is the alter keyword let's add a phone number alter table employees I'm going to write this next part of the statement on a new line what do we want to add uh what about a phone number add phone number then we'll need to list the data type of this column varchar is good Max size of 15 characters then we will end this statement execute the script all right we have altered our table let's take a look at our table select asterisk asterisk means all I don't know if I explained that select all from employees we have employee ID first name last name hourly pay higher date then our column phone number let's rename phone number and change it to something else we will again use the altar keyword alter table employees rename column phone number to let's say email okay then let's take a look again select all from employees yeah employee ID first name last name hourly pay higher date then email however the data type has not changed for email I'm going to refresh my schemas then underneath information underneath employees our email column has a max size of 15 characters let's change that alter table employees modify column email then the new data type varchar maybe 100 characters for an email let's execute this statement refresh our schemas yeah now our email column has a size of 100 characters maybe we need to change the position of our email column if you need to move columns around this is how you can do so let's move our email column so it's after our last name column to do that we would type alter table the name of the table modify the name of the column to be moved email in this case then the data type this email column has a data type of varchar 100 then after then the name of the column we would like our email column to follow I need my email column to come after my last name column I will type after last name then afterwards I might as well just display everything select all from employees you can write more than one SQL statement here we are employee ID first name last name email hourly pay higher date if you're modifying a column and need it to be first you could just say first email employee ID first name last name hourly pay higher date you can use the after keyword then a column or first if you need the column to be first now to drop a column you would type alter table employees drop column the name of the column to be dropped email our email column is no longer there alright everybody that's how we can create a table and work with the columns in the next video we're either going to talk about data types or learn about inserting rows into our tables I haven't decided yet but we'll probably cover one of those two
