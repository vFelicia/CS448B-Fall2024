hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about pseudo classes in css so let's get started before you reach the end of this video make sure to like comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty youtube algorithm think of a pseudo class as a special keyword that is used to define a special state of an element and for example i have the hover pseudo class right here we can do things like change the appearance of a button when we hover over it we can create drop down menus to appear i'll probably make a separate video on drop down menus we can even style certain items in a list or grouping based on certain criteria using a pseudo class so this video is meant to introduce how to use pseudo classes we won't cover all the pseudo classes that are out there but at least a few of the more useful ones and if you ever encounter a pseudo class that you might find useful for your own projects well at least you know how to use them so let's begin by creating some sample text on our html document we're going to create three things a link a button and a list let's get started let's first create a link so i'm just going to use an a tag and we're going to use the href attribute and let's set this equal to maybe google https colon two forward slashes www.google.com all right then let's add the text for the link www.google.com and then let's close this a tag let's save reload the page okay that works for our link here now let's create maybe two line breaks just to give us some space then let's create a button so button type equals button and then let's add some text to this button click me and then close the button let's save reload the page there's our button now let's create a list but i'm just going to separate a few of these things let's make an unordered list so use the ul tag then let's add maybe 10 list items so this is item number one and let's close this and then i'm just going to copy and paste this a bunch of times so two three four five six seven eight nine ten that should be fine and let's close this ul tag and i'm just going to change some of the numbers so two three four five six seven eight nine and ten let's save reload okay this is fine let's go to our style sheet and let's get rid of that now by default with links the color the text color is blue for a hyperlink but if you've already visited that page it's going to be purple and you can see right now that it's purple so you can actually delete your browser history to get rid of that and it will go back to being that blue color for the hyperlink since i already clicked on this it's already purple so i'm just going to delete my history real quick well welcome back now with this link it is now blue that is the default for hyperlinks but it might be something different if you're using a different web browser idk though so we can actually use a pseudo class to change the appearance of this hyperlink so what we want to do is target all a elements then colon and then we can pick a pseudo class so we can use the link pseudo class to change the appearance of a hyperlink so let's change the color and i have a hexadecimal color picker here and we can just pick a different color so maybe i'll pick like a seafoam green of some sort that works for me so i'm just going to copy this hex value and place it right here let's save this then reload the page and now what you see here is that all hyperlinks are now this sea foam green color which is pretty sweet that is the link pseudo class let's discuss the visited pseudo class these css properties that are listed will apply to any link that's already visited alright so let's actually click on this link then head back it's back to that basic purple right so now we can actually add some css properties for any link that is already visited so let's maybe change the color and i will pick like a purplish color and i'll take this value and then just paste it let's save reload the page now it's like a pinkish purple color which is a little more artistic i would say okay let's style this button so we're going to target our button then we'll use the hover pseudo class we can change the appearance of this button whenever we move our cursor over it so let's change the color as well so we're going to change the background dash color and i think i will pick a reddish color that should be fine so i'm going to copy this paste it and i believe i will change the text color as well and i will just pick white okay so let's save it reload the page so there doesn't appear to be any changes to our button right but if we take our cursor and hover over this button that's when these css properties will kick in whenever we hover over an html element that is listed so this doesn't really appear to do anything when you click on it it does become focusable where there's this blue border around this but we can actually change the appearance of this button when we click on it so we're going to use the active pseudo class so let's target our button element and we're going to use the active pseudo class and i guess i'll just change the background color again and i will pick a slightly darker shade of red that should be fine and let's paste that save let's reload and now when we click on this button you can see that it just flashed really dark right so the active pseudo class is applied whenever you click on something or you hold something down so you can see that it's that darker shade of red now it's kind of like it's a 3d effect where we're pushing in the button and it's not getting as much sunlight where it's kind of like in the shade then you know what i mean so the active pseudo class applies to any html element that is clicked or is held down all right moving on i have a few pseudo classes that are useful for different list items or groupings of items and the first one that we're going to discuss is the first child pseudo class so we have a unordered list here and we have 10 list items we can actually target specific list items and then give them some css properties so i'm just going to type in li and then we're going to use the first dash child pseudo class and this is going to apply to the first list item in some sort of list or grouping so maybe i'll change the background color i should really discuss more css properties too but colors are kind of fun to work with and maybe let's pick like a maybe a greenish color um i already picked one out already so i'm just going to use this one because it was a pretty sweet color so a 93 ff7d all right so this first child pseudo class will apply to the first item in some sort of lister grouping so let's reload the page now this list item is now highlighted now there's another pseudo class that is the last dash child and this will apply to the last element in some sort of list so i'm just going to copy this background color and paste it and this color will now be applied to the last item in your list and actually if we were to add one more item to this list this would actually change so currently list item number 10 is highlighted right so let's save this reload now we have a new item within our list and the last child pseudo class now applies to well the last item now which is now item number 11. i do have a few other pseudo classes related to lists i'd like to show you guys so i'm just going to comment this out for now the first child as well as the last child pseudo class all right this next one is called the nth child pseudo class but we're going to add a set of parentheses right after and then a set of curly braces like we normally do now we can target a specific item within some sort of grouping by putting the item number within the parentheses let's say that we want to target maybe this fifth item right here we're going to put the number five all right and then i'll just copy what we had here before with the background color so let's save reload now the fifth item in this list or grouping is now highlighted or it has this css property applied to it now if we were to change this number to maybe three save and reload this now applies to the third item in our list are grouping and before we finish this video i'm going to show you guys a few different tricks related to the nth child pseudo class so for now i'm just going to move this comment a little bit down further and then save reload we're going to copy this and then just make one change so we don't necessarily need to place a number here between the parentheses of the nth child pseudo class we can also type in a word such as odd to target all odd numbered items within this list or grouping so let's see what happens now when we put the word odd here so all odd numbered items now have this css property applied to them and we can do the same thing with even numbered items so i'm going to paste this change odd to even but i'm going to change the background color so it stands out so i'm just going to pick a slightly lighter shade of the same color let's copy this hex value and then place it here so this color will be applied to all even numbered items in this list so let's save reload and what ends up happening is that we get this nice looking table it's something you might see in like a textbook for school or something so all odd numbered items are this color all even numbered items are this other color that's lighter and i have one last trick for this video to show you guys we can create a custom formula within the nth child to target very specific items within a grouping of some sort so for now i'm just going to turn the rest of this into a comment and this will be the last one i'll show you guys so we're going to type in li colon and child and then set a parenthesis set of curly braces now within the parentheses there's a formula we can put in here it is a n plus b all right so we're actually going to be replacing each of these letters with some sort of value and here is a definition of each of these values so i'm just going to write a comment right here so a equals the cycle size how many times do we want this to repeat n is our counter and it starts at zero and then lastly b is equal to our offset value then i should probably write this one more time right here so that was a n plus b okay i'm just going to save and reload so this is all cleared then now let's say that we want to target every third item within our list here so for our cycle size we're just going to put uh 3 here instead of a we can keep n here we can keep that at 0 plus the offset and if we don't want an offset we'll just place zero here now we can add some css properties uh i think i'll change the background to like maybe like a highlighter yellow color so maybe i'll use background image and a linear gradient so linear dash gradient and then two right and i have two colors picked out already so that was fff421 this is yellow and six f's which is just all white then so this is like a highlighter effect of some sort but make sure you spell background right because i didn't okay so this css property is going to apply to every third item in our group so let's test it out then just to prove i'm not a liar so let's save reload now each third item in this group has this css property applied to it now we can actually add an offset to this so for example if i were to add one here the offset would be one then if i change this to two you can see that everything shifted down by one then and if the offset was three it shifts down further um so if you want to add an offset you could just change that here um so now if you want like every fourth item you would just place four here instead of three so now every fourth item has that css property applied oh and one last thing before you go with these pseudo classes you're not limited to only changing the colors i was only using colors just because i think they're fairly simple to use you can add other css properties as well for example i could also change the opacity and maybe i'll set this to 0.5 for 50 percent maybe i'll add a border around each of these so border one pixel solid so now we have a border around these selected items so you can pretty much add any css property that you want to these pseudo classes i was only using colors because they're pretty simple to use and well they're kind of pretty so that's the basics of pseudo classes if you would like a copy of this markup i'll post this in the comments down below there's still more pseudo classes out there these are a few of the more basic ones that you might encounter they're fairly useful if there's any new pseudo class that you encounter you at least know how to add it and use it then but yeah those are the basics of pseudo classes in css hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing
