hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain math math is a builtin JavaScript object that provides a collection of math related properties and methods for example if you ever need the value of pi you would type math with a capital m dot Pi then let's console.log this console.log math dot pi Pi is 3.14 and the rest of the digits if you need e is known as Euler's number it's used for the base of natural logarithms we won't really be using e in the series but if you ever need it it's there math does give you access to a lot of useful math related methods let's create a few variables let x equal 3.21 let y equal to and let Z will be undefined if you need to round a number let's say Z equals you can type math dot round method Place whatever value or variable you would like to round within the round method let's round X store the result within Z then display Z console.log Z so 3.21 rounded is three even there's also floor floor will always round down let's change 3.21 to 3.99 let's copy this line paste it change round to floor always rounds down so 3.99 rounded down is again three to always round up you can use seal as in ceiling the opposite of floor ceil let's change 3.99 to 3.21 3.21 rounded up is 4. then there's truncade trunk short for truncate will eliminate any decimal portion 3.21 truncated is three another way to raise a base to a given power is to use the pow method pow let's raise three to the power of two so x to the power of Y which would be 9. y to the power of X would be 8. there's a square root function s q r t let's find the square root of how about 81. the square root of 81 is 9. if you ever need to find the natural logarithm of a number you can use the log function math DOT log let's set X to be 10. the natural logarithm of 10 is 2.3 if you need to do anything with trigonometry there's sine cosine and tangent functions let's begin with sine sin within this function you will place radians I'll set X to be 45. so Z is going to be 0.85 so that's sine let's do cosine which is cos 0.52 then tangent tan and that is 1.61 let's change X to be negative 3.21 again to find the absolute value of a number you can use the absolute value function math dot abs it's basically going to give you the same number but it's going to be positive the absolute value of negative 3.21 is 3.21 basically we're eliminating the negative sign to find the sign of a number you can use the sine function s i g n so the sine of negative 3.21 is negative 1. If This Were a positive number it would be 1 if it's zero then the sign is zero here's a pretty helpful method we can find the maximum or minimum value from a set of values or variables let's set Z to be one y will stay as 2 and X will be 3. I will create a new variable named Max it will store the maximum value from these three variables math dot Max comma separate each of the variables x y z then display the maximum within our console.log method the maximum value from these three variables is three then there's min for the minimum let min dot min so the minimum of these three variables is one all right everybody so that's math it's a builtin JavaScript object that provides a collection of properties which was pi and E and methods such as round truncate power methods related to trigonometry and Max and Min methods they're pretty helpful if you ever need them and well that is what math is in JavaScript
