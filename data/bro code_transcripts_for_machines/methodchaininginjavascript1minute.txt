hey everybody we're talking about method chaining method chaining is a programming technique where you call one method after another in one continuous line of code here's an example of where it could be useful let's say we have a username and assign this whatever your first name is but i'm going to make this all lowercase in this example what i would like to do is take the first character of the string and make it uppercase without using method chaining we could do something like this we'll create a temporary variable to store a letter and i will return the first letter in the string user name dot and i will use the char at method and the first letter has an index of zero letter is now b but now i would like to make it uppercase i will need to reassign my letter variable equals letter dot to uppercase and then we can display this console.log letter this should display the letter capital b to write this code a little more elegantly we could use method chaining after calling one method we can call subsequent methods i'll eliminate this line and follow the char at method with 2 uppercase then add that set of parentheses this single line of code will do the exact same thing and it's easier to read and understand you can follow one method call it with another if i would like to invoke another method i don't know like trim i could just add that to the end you have the capability of calling one method after another in one continuous line of code it makes your code cleaner and more readable so yeah that's method chaining if you found this video helpful feel free to help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
