hey let's talk about if statements if statements are used to add some choices to a program let's take the small program for example we have a variable edge and we'll ask a user to enter in their edge what if i would like to check their edge maybe they're signing up for a credit card or something so to check some value we can write an if statement if parentheses then a set of curly braces if some condition that we specify is true we will execute some block of code some subsection of code what sort of condition should we write let's check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18. so there's different comparison operators there's greater than or equal to greater than less than less than or equal to or you could check to see if two values are equal by using double equal signs this is the comparison operator if you use just one this is the assignment operator and this would be the same as assigning age equal to 18 so if you need to compare if two values are equal use the comparison operator which is double equal signs but what i would like to do is check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18. if this condition evaluates to be true we will have our program do something so let's print a message since we're signing up for a credit card let's say you are now signed up and let's run it end to your age let's say that i'm 21 i hit enter boom you are now signed up but what if this condition is false let's say that i'm 12 years old and i'm attempting to sign up for a credit card well we skip this if statement if this condition evaluates to be false we will skip this block of code and continue on with the rest of the program ignoring it or we could do something else by using an else statement if this condition is false we will skip this subset of code and instead perform this let's print a different message instead you are too young to sign up and let's try that again enter your edge i am 12. you are too young to sign up you can check more than one condition before reaching your else statement by using else if blocks and that is by using else if statements we can check another statement before reaching our else statement so let's check to see if age is less than zero so obviously somebody's messing with this program then because you can't be under zero years old right you haven't been born yet so after running this program if i say that i'm negative six you haven't been born yet so we will check our if statement first if this condition is false we will move down to the next block and then check this else if condition if all above statements evaluate to be false we will execute this else block as the last resort so to say and with these else if blocks you can add more than one let's check something else just to demonstrate else if what about age is equal to zero and we will print you can't sign up you were just born and to your age i am zero years old you can't sign up you were just born if one of these conditions evaluates to be true we will skip all of these statements that come after then with our else block if all above statements evaluate to be false we definitely execute whatever's within here so yeah those are if statements they add some choice to a program you can check to see if some condition is true if not you can check something else using else if statements you can perform whatever is within an else block and that's optional so yeah those are if statements in c if you found this video helpful please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
