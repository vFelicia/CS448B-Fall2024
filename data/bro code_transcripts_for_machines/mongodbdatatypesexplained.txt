all right everybody it's about time I discuss some basic data types in mongodb we will Begin by inserting a new document into our students collection db.students.insert1 we're inserting a document add a set of curly braces the first data type I'll discuss is a string suppose we have a field of name a string is a series of text within quotes these can be either double quotes or single quotes but typically I like to put them within double quotes a string is a series of text like a name Like Larry strings can contain spaces we can enter in a first name space then a last name Larry Lobster they can also contain numbers larry123 however in a string we treat the numbers differently we read the Morris characters rather than actual numbers so let's stick with name Larry that's a string it's a series of characters then we have integers and integer is a whole number let's create a field for age Larry will be 32. whole integers don't contain decimal portions it wouldn't make sense to enter in 32.5 we don't really keep track of people's half birthdays and stuff so age would be a whole number those are integers whole numbers then we have doubles a double is a number that contains a decimal portion maybe a grade point average grade point averages typically contain decimals Larry has a 2.8 GPA it's a double because there's a decimal portion integers are whole numbers doubles are numbers that contain a decimal then we have booleans booleans are either true or they're false it's kind of like a light switch it's only on or off there's only two states let's create a field for full time is the student full time this can be either true or false Larry is too busy working out all the time he is a parttime student not a fulltime student we'll set that field to be false date objects are pretty popular in mongodb suppose we have a registration date register date to create a date object you can use the new keyword followed by a call to the date Constructor if you don't pass any arguments to the date Constructor you'll use the current time in the UTC time zone otherwise you can pass a date in time like 2023 January 2nd you could add a time too but we'll just stick with the current date and time that's assigned to us those are date objects the next data type is null no means no value I'll create a field for a graduation date and I will set that to be null Larry is a current student but we don't know when he's going to graduate all we're really doing is creating a placeholder we don't have a date yet so we can set that to be null that's to be filled in later so null means no value then we have arrays much like in modern programming languages is kind of like a variable that has more than one value but in mongodb we have a field that can have more than one value let's create a field of courses what courses is Larry enrolled in place all values within a set of straight brackets let's insert multiple values what courses is Larry in maybe he's in biology these values are all comma separated chemistry then calculus so that's an array they're all enclosed within a set of square brackets they allow one field to contain multiple values then we have nested documents this would be good for an address to create a nested document you use a set of curly braces within the nested document we can list some field value pairs how about a street let's come up with a street name one two three fake street is good than a city big Keeney bottom and a zip code one two three four five it is possible to have documents within documents which is what we did with the address let's enter everything to see if it works yeah that was acknowledged let's head to Compass refresh and here is Larry name Larry h32 GPA 2.8 full time is set to false he's a parttime student here is Larry's registration date and time we're using the UTC time zone his graduation date is set to null all of his courses that he's in is stored within an array and his address is stored as a nested document alright everybody and those are a few basic data types you should know in mongodb
