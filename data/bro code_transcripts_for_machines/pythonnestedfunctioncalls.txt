hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain nested function calls in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people nested function calls these are function calls inside of other function calls and this is possible because certain functions will return a value and we can immediately use that value as an argument for the next function so here's an example let's say that we have the small program where we will ask a user to type in a whole positive number and let's say i don't let's say i type in negative 3.14 and then i'm storing that value within a variable named num what i'm going to do is convert that number to a floating point number because currently it's a string when you accept user input i will find the absolute value of num and then round it to the nearest whole number and then print the value so we can actually do this using less lines of code with nested function calls so let's start with the first function which will be accepting some user input the input function so this will be in the very center of our nested function calls and then the next function we would like to apply to the variable that is returned the value that is returned we will pass in as an argument to our next function of casting this data type to a float so we'll surround our function with another function and use the float function and then we'll just keep on adding layers to this so we have the absolute value function next so we'll add another layer and we have the round function so we'll add a layer to that and lastly we're going to print and that'll be the outermost layer so this program will do the exact same thing let's say negative 3.14 except we've written this with one line of code so basically we start with the innermost function and resolve that first whatever value is returned we use as an argument to the next outermost function and in this case it would be float then we resolve that then move on to absolute value then round and then print so it's just another way of writing code that takes up less lines but this is more of an extreme example you probably won't see like four or five nested functions well everybody those are nested function calls if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah those are nested function calls in python
