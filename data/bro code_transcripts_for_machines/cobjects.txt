hey it's bro hope you're doing well and in today's video we're going to discuss objectoriented programming in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right objects an object is an instance of a class that means that we can use a class as a type of blueprint to create objects with objectoriented programming so look around you right now you're surrounded by objects next to me i have a microphone a monitor a mouse and a cup of coffee so we can use code to mimic real world objects objects can have fields and methods these are defining characteristics and actions that an object can perform they describe what an object has and what an object can do and in today's video we will be instantiating human objects but will need the help of a human class as a type of blueprint to design what sorts of fields and methods that all humans should have so outside of our class program you can either do this within the same csharp file or a separate one within your solution explorer i'll keep it all within the same c sharp file this time let's create a class named human then curly braces so let's add some fields fields are kind of like the defining attributes of what all humans should have let's say that humans have a name and an age so i'll define those much like what we do with variables string name i will declare this but not yet assign it as well as int edge so these are fields they're defining characteristics of what an object has now let's create some methods what kinds of actions can humans perform they can eat and they can sleep void eat and then i will display something when we invoke this method let's say name plus is eating and then let's create a sleep method void sleep name plus is sleeping okay now this is what we need to do to instantiate an object from a class type the name of the class human we need a unique name for this human object let's call this human object just human one human human one equals new human again add a set of parentheses and a semicolon there we go we now have a human object named human one now there's just one problem the fields and methods of this human object are not visible so if i type human one dot we can't access the name and h fields as well as the eat and sleep methods so normally i wouldn't recommend doing this because this isn't secure but just for learning purposes let's precede our fields and methods with the axis modifier of public so that these are publicly accessible from another class so if we type human one dot we should be able to access our name and age fields as well as the eat and sleep methods so let's give humanoid a name humanone dot name and let's assign human one a first name of rick like from rick and morty and let's give him an age too human1.h and he will be 65 years old and we should be able to use the eat and sleep methods now humanone dot eat and then human one dot sleep so after invoking these two methods eat and sleep this will display rick is eating and rick is sleeping so congratulations we have successfully instantiated a human object and the nice thing about classes is that we can keep on reusing this class to create more humans if we need more than one so this time let's create a second human so follow this formula the name of the class human then we need a unique name for this human object human one is taken so let's name the second human human too equals new human and then we can assign some of the fields of our human class so we need a name and an age so human two's name will be morty and his age will be 16 and this time let's have human 2 use the eat and sleep method so rick is eating rick is sleeping morty is eating more he's sleeping so that's basically what an object is it's an instance of a class and a class can be used as a blueprint to create objects and objects can have fields and methods fields are what an object has methods are what an object can do think of it that way so yeah those are objects they're an instance of a class and a class can be used as a blueprint to create objects so if this video helped you out help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and as always subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
