all right welcome back everybody in this topic I'm going to explain typecasting type casting is the process of converting a value of one data type to another we can convert integers to floats floats to integers strings to booleans booleans to Strings floats to Strings strings to integers integers to booleans I think you get the idea why might you want to use typecasting when we get to the lesson on accepting user input the user input is always a string if somebody were to type in a number and we need to perform math involving that number we would want to convert it to either an integer or a float another example is that if we had a floating Point number and we need to round that number to an integer one possible way is to cast it as an integer we can truncate the decimal portion there's two different ways we can do this explicitly and implicitly let's cover some explicit type casting I have four variables we need a string let's say a name type in your first name age that's good float how about a grade point average GPA for short my GPA will be a solid um 1.9 then we'll need a Boolean uh what about student are we a student if we're a student that would be true if not that would be false here's four variables of the four basic data types we have a string an integer a float and a Boolean if you ever need the data type of a variable you can use the builtin type function type the word type followed by a set of parentheses place a variable within the set of parentheses however when I run this we can't see anything so we need to place this statement within a print statement I'm going to type print add a set of parentheses we will cut this line of code and paste it within the print statement so we are printing the type of my variable name and that is Str which means it's a string let's do that with age GPA and student just so you're more familiar with using the type function we have age GPA and student here we are python says the data type of name is a string Str age is an integer int means integer GPA is a float then student is bull which means Boolean let's do some explicit conversion for practice I need to convert my variable age into a floating Point number I could take my variable age I could reassign this a value by using equals then I will explicitly cast age into a float by typing float a set of parentheses add my variable to be typecasted within the set of parentheses then let's print whatever age currently is look at that age is now 21.0 you can tell it's a float because it has a decimal portion if I were to use that type function again we can see what the data type of age is now and my variable age is a floating Point number that's how to cast a value as a float you type float add a set of parentheses place your value or variable within that set of parentheses then you may need to reassign it to something here we're just reassigning our variable age we know how to convert a value to a float let's try an integer I'll convert my GPA into an integer I'll take GPA set this equal to type int set of parentheses place my variable within the parentheses then I will print whatever my GPA is my GPA is now one so an integer it's a whole number we can't contain that decimal portion so it's truncated that's how to convert a value into an integer let's convert a value into a string how about this Boolean so student equals to convert a value or variable into a string type Str add a set of parentheses place your value or variable within that set of parentheses then let's print whatever our variable is after we reassign it so student still says true it appears the same as it did before but now it's treated as a series of characters rather than a Boolean just to prove to you that student is a string let's use the type function and Surround our student variable when we print it student is now a string so to convert a value or variable into a string you can use the builtin string function just type Str set of parentheses add your value or variable boom there you go all right lastly we can convert a value or variable into a Boolean so a Boolean can only be true or false what if we were to convert a number into a Boolean what would happen so let's take age equals to cast the value or variable into a Boolean you type bull set of parentheses add your value or variable I'll Place Edge within the set of parentheses then let's print whatever age is do you think the result is going to be true or false it's actually true when converting a number to a Boolean if that number is anything but zero it will always be true let's say age is like a million well it's still going to be true what about negative 1 million that is still true but if age were zero then it's false why would casting something as a Boolean be useful let's say that we ask a user to enter in their name I need to check to see if they entered in something let's type cast my name as a Boolean that is true but if this was an empty string that would be false even a space registers as true like I said we could use typecasting to check to see if somebody typed in their name or not if we cast the name as a Boolean and it's true that means they typed in something we'll have more practice with that later that is explicit typecasting all explicit typecasting is is manually converting a value or variable into a different data type by using one of these cast keywords we only covered four strings integers floats and booleans alright now let's go over implicit typecasting implicit typecasting is when a value or variable is converted into a different data type automatically for example let's say we have x x equals two then we have y y equals how about 2.0 what if I were to reassign X and set x equal to x divided by y well we're dividing an integer by a float so what's the result going to be is X going to be an integer or a float so let's print whatever X's is now a float even though we assigned it to be an integer originally a whole number so that's implicit typecasting a variable's data type can be converted when you perform certain operations on it such as arithmetic expressions like this all right everybody so that is typecasting it's the process of converting a value of one data type to another you can convert strings to integers integers to floats floats to booleans booleans to Strings any combination of those and there's still more data types we didn't cover but that's the general idea so that is typecasting hey if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and
