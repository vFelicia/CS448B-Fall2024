hey uh here's a few transformations that you may be interested in let's begin by creating a simple box i'll use a div element and assign this a unique id of box one and within this box we'll say hi within my style sheet i will select box one i'll give this a border of 4 pixels solid a width of 250 pixels and a height of 250 pixels as well let's change the font size to something larger like 225 pixels we will change the text alignment to center and change the background to pick a color that you like to work with transformations there is a transform property and you can select a transformation that you like let's begin with translate x you pass in an amount of pixels to translate your element on the xaxis if i set this to 50 pixels this element will be translated to the right by 50 pixels or a negative number for a left translation okay let's select translate y and do the same thing this transformation moves elements up or down on the y axis or you could combine them both and that is just simply translate but you pass in two numbers between the parentheses so this combines both an x and y translation we can rotate on the xaxis you pass in an angle like 180 degrees so that is a rotation on the xaxis there is also a yaxis rotation and a zaxis rotation we can scale on the xaxis scale x one is the default two means two hundred percent so this image will stretch twice as wide or three times as wide there is scale y and that will stretch on the y axis or you could combine them both with simply scale if i set both of these values to 2 our image is twice as big we can skew on a given axis skew x and then pass in an amount of degrees like 45 degrees we can skew on the y axis or we can do both pass in two values within skew let's say 20 degrees for both there's also matrix matrix is a little more complex there are six values that we can pass in and they start in this order the first value is for scale x the second is for skew y skew x scale y translate x and translate y the first number is for scale x and the fourth numbers for scale y so i'm going to set this to 1 for 100 so if these are both zero or at least one of them is zero then this image is going to disappear so matrix combines the following scale x skew y skew x scale y translate x translate y so using matrix you can add more than one transformation let's say i need this scaled twice as big and translated uh let's make that a little more drastic maybe 250 or i could skew this too so yeah those are some simple transformations whatever you would like translated just place this property within an element and you can select one of these based on what you need so yeah those are some simple transformations in css if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
