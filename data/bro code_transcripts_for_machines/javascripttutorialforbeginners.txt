hey what's going on everybody in this video I'm going to teach you everything you need to know to get started working with JavaScript as a beginner so why don't you go ahead and sit back relax and enjoy the show JavaScript is a programming language used to create Dynamic and interactive web pages JavaScript runs on a web browser such as Google Chrome Safari Edge whatever you use to browse the internet basically by using JavaScript we can respond to user actions and transform user input whenever somebody interacts with our site in this example I have a calculator written with HTML it's not very pretty and it doesn't function we have the framework that we need at least though by applying CSS we can add color and style to this calculator but unfortunately it still doesn't function by including JavaScript code this calculator can perform actions and as well useful so in this video I'm going to show you everything you need to know to get started working with JavaScript I would recommend knowing HTML and CSS before starting the series I do have a full free course on my channel if you're interested in learning those or if you need a refresher if you don't know either you could probably still get by watching this video I'll walk you through both as we go along throughout the series series now before we do begin you will need a text editor one text editor that I recommend is vs code which you can download from code.visualstudio.com for a stepbystep instruction of how to install it feel free to check out the HTML and CSS series with that out of the way let's Dive Right In so what we'll need to do is create a new project folder in vs code you can go to the left toolbar go to explore we will open a folder I'll place this folder on my desktop just for convenience I will create a new folder which I will name website to contain my website files let's select this folder and we are now within our website folder we'll need three files an HTML file CSS file and JavaScript file we'll begin with the HTML file we can close out of this welcome window I will name my HTML file index.html in a website the index.html file is typically used as the home page we have our HTML file next comes the CSS file mine will be named style.css the CSS style sheet is in charge of the overall appearance of the web page this can include fonts colors positioning stuff like that then lastly we have the Javascript file which I will name index.js the Javascript file is in charge of the interactivity of a web page so altogether we have structure style and actions so rearrange these tabs however you like I switch back and forth between the JavaScript and HTML file quite often so I tend to put them right next to each other but do whatever's most convenient for you so to generate the necessary text to create a web page in your HTML file in vs code you can type exclamation point then hit tab so here you can change the title of your web page if you want I'll change my title to be my website and that's all we'll need for now now we'll need to link the style sheet to the HTML file now we are going to create a link tag we can link an external style sheet to our HTML file within the link tag there is a relationship attribute shortened to Rel the relationship will be style sheet we are linking a style sheet then the next attribute we need is the href attribute where is the CSS file located well it's right next to each other we only need the file name so we are linking the CSS style sheet now our CSS style sheet is linked to our HTML file now we need to link the Javascript file to our HTML file we can do that by adding a pair of script tags we will set the source attribute to be the name of the JavaScript file index.js all right everything should now be linked together the last thing we'll need is the live server extension in vs code go to extensions we will search for live server it should be this one we are going to install this extension so whenever we save any changes to our files the web page should refresh automatically so now let's test this you can go to file save or use the shortcut I'm just going to save everything I'm going to right click on our HTML file then open with live server and here's our web page but it currently doesn't have anything let me just minimize this I will readjust this window throughout this course I'll have vs code alongside a web browser with our HTML file we can add elements such as an H1 element these are typically used as headers I'm going to say hello then save and that should update automatically or you can press the refresh button but since we have live server installed we shouldn't need to then paragraphs are typically used for a paragraph a text in vs code to generate a random paragraph of text you can type lorem then hit tab now we should have a random paragraph I believe it's Latin at least it looks like it to change the style of our web page we can go to our style sheet to change the style of the body of our document we will select body I'll change the font family to something else font family how about verdana there we now have a different font to increase the font size you can set the font size property to be either in pixels or em personally I'm a fan of using em 2em means 200 percent where 3 em is 300 but that's a little too big let's stick with 2 em all right and that is everything we need to get started oh important note you do want your script element at the bottom of the body of your document just in case there's an error with your Javascript file you do want all of the HTML elements to at least render first before running any JavaScript code alright so let's delete our H1 elements and our paragraph element we no longer need them for now be sure to save everything we'll work with some basic output I'm going to zoom in a little bit to Output some text you can type console .log add a set of parentheses then a semicolon at the end within the set of parentheses to Output some text you can either use double quotes single quotes or backticks personally I'm a fan of using these back ticks this is known as a template literal they're helpful with inserting variables which we will discuss in the next lesson using either double quotes or single quotes or back ticks we can output some text let's say the word hello be sure to save I'm holding Ctrl s on Windows there's no apparent output we have to go to Dev tools so right click on your web page go to inspect then console and here's our basic output hello for an additional line of output we can console.log again let's print a different message I like pizza let's save and here's my second line of text I like pizza and I'm just going to move these windows a little bit that's better throughout much of the series we will be working with this window again you have to right click on your web page go to inspect then go to console now within our web page to create an alert box you can type window dot alert add a set of parentheses semicolon to the end we'll use a template literal we'll need a set of backticks this is an alert this should create a popup window this is an alert let's create another let's copy what we have pasted I like pizza let's save this is an alert okay I like pizza not sure why we need to tell a user that but we can now we have comments to create a comment you type two forward slashes comments aren't used for output they're used as notes for yourself or for other Developers this is a comment so when I run this program then if we were to go to our Dev tools we don't see this comment at all they're not displayed as output they're either used for notes for yourself or for other people for a multiline comment you can type a forward slash asterisk anything that comes after will be a comment this is a comment you can see that the text is green that means it's a comment again we should not be able to see these comments they're hidden I'm going to turn this JavaScript code into comments just for the next part because these window alerts are kind of annoying to be honest all right now what we're going to do is populate our web page with some text within our HTML file I will create an H1 element H1s are usually used for headers or titles there will be no text content yet but I will set an ID I will give this H1 element a unique ID of my H1 feel free to pick a different ID something you'll remember I will also create a paragraph element I will set the ID to equal my P meaning my paragraph so remember there is no text content currently using JavaScript we will add some text content first we need to select these elements by their ID my H1 and my P uh let's do that here we will type document meaning the document of our web page dot get element by ID do pay attention to the capitalization what id are we getting let's start with my H1 so copy the ID paste it within the set of parentheses be sure you're including quotes as well follow this with DOT text content we will set the SQL to how about the word hello let me zoom out a little again this can be back ticks single quotes or double quotes all right let's type the word hello now when I save and refresh the page that H1 element should display the word hello now this time let's get our paragraph element with the ID of my P my paragraph document dot get element by ID the ID that we're getting is my P will change the text content equal to uh what can we say I like pizza there we go hello I like pizza all right everybody so that's the basics of JavaScript when working with basic output you can use console.log which we will be using a lot to create an alert you can use window.alert to change the text content of an HTML element you first have to select that element then change the text content then set it equal to some text of your choosing all right everybody so that is the very basics of JavaScript and in the next topic we will cover variables
