hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing borders in CSS so let's get into it to kick off this lesson we're going to need some sample text I'm going to create a heading and then a paragraph so I'll use an h1 header tag and I will call this boarder demo and then we're going to close this next we'll add a paragraph we'll just need some sample text to work with if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem and hit tab then you'll have a sample paragraph to work with and I'm going to surround this with a pair of paragraph tags let's save this reload the page that'll be good for now so I have a style sheet that's linked to this HTML file so that was covered in the first lesson for this CSS tutorial series so let's get on to creating borders the first thing that we want to do is to create a border perhaps around this paragraph so we'll want to target the P tag the paragraph tag and then we'll add a set of curly brackets so there's different styles of border and you'll want to specify what kind of border that you want let's start with something simple just a plain solid border so to add a border you're going to type border style colon and then the type of style that you want for this border I'll showcase a few of these but let's begin with a simple solid border so let's save this refresh the page and we have a border around our targeted HTML element now if you were to take a look at this paragraph you'll notice that the text is very close to the border and it might be difficult to read some of the letters so there's this property in CSS called padding it's the distance between the text and the border so by default it's set to 0 so we can actually add some space between the text and the border think of it like you know when you get a package from like Amazon or in the mail there's like bubble wrap or packing peanuts within the box it's between your item and the actual box itself it's the padding between the text and the border so let's create a padding property and let's give us five pixels of room so I'm going to type five px for pixels I'll save this reload the page now we have some distance between the text and the border and I find that easier to read if we want something ridiculous like 50 pixels you know we can do that although this probably doesn't look too great but it might be useful for something so like I said padding is the distance between the text and the border think of it like you receive a package the text is the item the box is the border and the padding is like the styrofoam packing peanuts or bubble wrap that's between your item and the box but in this case it's the text and the border I hope that makes sense all right so let's cover a few other styles so this was a solid border but I don't want this much padding between my text and the border so let's just stick with five for now I think that's decent so I'm going to cover a few different border styles and some of these might pique your interests so border style and then let's go with a perhaps dashed border so let's save reload so we have this nice dashed border around our text this border somewhat reminds me of like a coupon in an ad or something where you cut along the dash border to take out the coupon from the ad or something I don't know maybe if you're making a website that has printable coupons you can create a dash border around each coupon oh and one thing that I want to mention before I forget with CSS properties if you have multiple values assigned to the same property you'll actually end up using the most recent value that's assigned to that specific property for example we have two border styles solid and dashed well it's the same property but we're going to end up using the most recently assigned value which is dashed like if I were to switch these around and I were to place dashed first and then solid we would actually end up using the solid border because that was the value that was last assigned to that property so for this example I'll be showing a bunch of different border styles and I'll just have them all listed here but it's only going to be displaying the most recently assigned value so let's cover a few border styles and you might like some of these so we're going to type border style and this next one is the dotted border style so this is what it looks like we have border style double and this is a double border I think I'm just gonna copy this to save a little bit of time so border style Ridge so that one looks like it has a shadow around it which is kind of cool border style groove like it's groovy like we're in the 70s that's pretty much the same but it's slightly darker border style inset and this has a 3d effect it's kind of like it's pushed in like a button or something and the inverse of this is outset and it has a 3d popout effect of some sort this one I would say is my favorite because it's kind of like it's 3d so those are a few of the border styles let's discuss the border width property so we can increase the width of the border so a border width and maybe let's assign 3 pixels to the width of this so 3 px and the border is slightly thicker so if you're using like an inset or outset border it actually looks like it's popping out of the screen slightly more if we did a border this is obviously going to be a thicker line so that's the border width property now you can actually assign a few different widths and here's an example let's say 3 pixels 5 pixels 3 pixels 5 pixels so let's see what this looks like first and then I'll explain this so if you have a border width with 4 different values the first value is going to apply to the northern top border the second is the right eastern border the third one is South or the bottom the fourth one is the left border or West one so you can either assign four different values you can have them all be the same otherwise you can just assign one universally to all sides so for this example I'll just keep five pixels so it's all the same size then all right let's change the border color so border color you can either just type in a generic name such as green another option is to use a hexadecimal value you can look those up online if there's a specific color you like I think I will pick the color 0 0 FF 0 0 which is a bright green color so let's save this reload the page and this border is now a very bright green color now there's another property called border radius the radius will give you a rounded borders kind of like they're smooth but these borders are very sharp right now so border radius so if we were to assign maybe a 1 pixel radius this will slightly smooth out the edges of the border it's a little bit difficult to see if it's just one pick so let's try something more drastic like 5 pixels so you can see that the borders are much more smooth now let's try maybe 10 that might be a lot more noticeable yeah 10 is very noticeable these corners are no longer sharp it's kind of like you filed the corners down so that's kind of what the border radiuses you're smoothing out the edges of this so that's a basic border that you can use around whatever element that you want so with our header tag let's get a little crazy we can target specific sides of your border so let's target the h1 header tag and the first thing that we can do is that let's target a like bottom border perhaps so if you want to target a specific side of the border you'll type in border perhaps bottom otherwise there's top left and right but let's target the bottom for now and let's set the style to perhaps maybe dotted oh but make sure you spell border right not bored bored or there we're good alright so we have a single bottom border to this h1 element let's do the same thing from the top so I'll just copy that and we're going to change bottom to top let's save reload alright so we have a border that only has two sides it doesn't have a left side or a right side let's target the left side perhaps so border left style let's do something different perhaps solid alright we're getting somewhere and let's target the width of just the left border so you're actually able to do that border then it is left with maybe 10 pixels so you can individually change the sizes or width of a single side of your border you just have to list it specifically otherwise if you do just border style it applies to all sides so you also have the capability to color an individual side of your border let's say we want to color just this left border will type in border left color and we can assign a color to this I will pick the hexadecimal value of 0 0 FF 0 0 that was the bright green color that we had before but taking a look at this I actually don't like it on second thought maybe I'll switch this to a different color but point being you do have the capability to colored individual side of your border alright well with the time remaining let's make the rest of this light actually look cool so let's target the body and add a background color so background color and I'm just going to pick black let's take our text which is just color and let's change this to white alright and then with our border for the h1 header tag let's perhaps make this white so that is border color white alright let's see what this looks like I would say that's pretty decent for a beginners website that looks pretty cool but yeah that is pretty much this lesson on borders in CSS if you would like a copy of this markup I'll post it in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that is how borders work in CSS hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button
