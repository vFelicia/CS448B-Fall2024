hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how multiple inheritance works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people multiple inheritance multiple inheritance is the concept where a child class is derived from more than one parent class here's an example let's say that all of our children classes are going to be certain types of animals and we would like our animal classes to inherit from either the prepared class the predator parent class or both depending on what type of animal it is because some animals in the animal kingdom can be both prey and predators and one example that comes to mind would be fish fish will eat smaller fish but also can get eaten by larger fish so here we have two classes prey and predator each has a dedicated method if a class inherits from the prey parent class they will have access to a flea method which will print this animal please if a class inherits from the predator parent class that class will have access to a hunt method that will print this animal as hunting and it's possible that some animals can do both they can both flee and hunt but they'll need to inherit both of these classes both prey and predator and that's where multiple inheritance comes in now let's create some classes based on certain types of animals let's say we have class rabbit and rabbit we'll inherit from the prey class because rabbits are typically prey and not predators but i don't know there could be some killer rabbits out there haven't run into any yet let's have class hawk inherit from the predator class and lastly fish and fish can be both prey and predators so they will inherit from both classes and we just separate each class with a comma so prey comma predator and it's as simple as that now let's create an object from each of these classes we have rabbit equals rabbit hawk equals hawk and fish equals fish now let's just verify all of the different methods that each of these objects inherited so our rabbit should have access to a flea method but no hunt method and let's just test that yep this animal flees and my hawk object should have access to a hunt method but no flea method this animal is hunting and lastly my fish object has access to both a flea and a hunt method and if you take a look on the right hand side of this popup window it shows the class that it inherited this method from so flea comes from the parent class of prey and hunt comes from the apparent class of predator so my fish can both flee and hunt because it's typically considered both prey and predators this animal flees this animal is hunting so that's basically what multiple inheritance is it's a concept where a child class is derived from more than one parent class so that's basically multiple inheritance i'll post all of this code to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how multiple inheritance works in python
