hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create dialogue boxes in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey i'm going to teach you guys about j option pain this is a popup standard dialog box that prompts the user for a value or informs them of something before we begin we'll need this import at the top java x dot swing dot j option pane there's a few variations of dialog boxes that we can create let's begin with a standard message that informs the user of something so in order to create a dialog box we need to type in the name of j option pane which is the name of this class j option pane dot and a simple message is show message dialog so that's show message dialog and there's three variations of this they each have different arguments that they accept so the second one accepts four arguments a parent component a message a title and a message type for now we'll just set the parent component to null because we don't have one a message this can be any sort of message so this is what will appear within the dialog box this is some useless info you can set a title for this box just set this to title and then a message type and there's a few variations of these so a plain vanilla message would be j option make sure you get the capitalization right j option pane dot plain message so this is a plain message with no styling whatsoever and this is what we have here is our dialog box the title is set to title this is some useless info okay thanks for letting me know this fourth argument is the message type so depending on what value we place here it's going to give our message dialog box a different look and feel so there's five i'm going to show you this is one of them i'm just going to copy and paste this five times and then give you a demonstration of each so the first one was a plain message the second one i'll introduce you guys is information message the third is going to be a question message then a warning message and then an error message and then i'll turn these into comments just so that they all don't appear at once so this is the look and feel for the information message the second one so maybe i'll change this to here is more useless info all right so what's different about this one is that there's this icon in the top left corner of this dialog box that just says i and it says here is more useless info okay great so our third dialog box is question message and i'll change the message here like we're asking a question really so we have a question mark icon and it says really okay this fourth one you guys will probably like this is a warning message so this is one thing that you might see during like those fake tech support scams where there'll be like a popup dialog box that says your computer has a virus let's mimic something like that your computer has a virus and this is a warning message your computer has a virus so if you want to be annoying what you could do is stick this within a while loop while true basically do this forever so this isn't going to go away even if we were to click okay or exit out of this so your computer has a virus okay i can't seem to click out of this so it's just going on forever uh so that's one annoying thing you can do that's a cool trick you can show your friends so let's go over the last one that is error message we can let the user know that something went wrong so that is this last one i'm going to turn that into a comment for now so this is j option pain dot error message call tech support now or else man they're really getting desperate these scams they're starting to threaten people and this is the error message it has a red x within what looks like a stop sign all right so those are basic message dialog boxes we can also have the user respond to something and we can actually ask for a yes no or cancel response so a different dialog box is show confirm dialog so j option pin dot show confirm dialog so it's the same as before we have a parent component message title and an option type so for parent component i'm going to set this to null message we can ask whatever we want bro do you even code pick a title this is my title and then an option type so j option pane dot and we can select what kinds of responses we want available we can have yes no cancel options just yes no or only yes let's go with yes no cancel and then we need a semicolon at the end and this is what we have here is our confirm dialog box it has our question bro to even code and there are different buttons you can add to this dialog box so we added the one with yes no and cancel but currently this doesn't do anything so let's actually display what this returns using a print line statement so system.out.printline i'm going to take this whole line of code and put this within the print line statement then i need to get rid of that semicolon there all right so if we were to select yes this returns a zero no returns one cancel returns two and then if you click the x button it returns negative one one technique available to you you could store this within a variable let's say int answer equals j option pane dot show confirm dialog based on the value that is stored within this variable you could run this through an if statement or a switch and depending on the answer or what value is stored within here you can do one of a few things so that's how show confirmed dialog works next we have show input dialog where the user can actually type in something so to do that it is j option pane dot show input dialog and we can simply just put a message within here like what is your name and then we can store the result in a variable like string name equals j option pane dot show input dialog and then i'm going to turn this into a comment and run this so what is your name my name is bro okay and then we can like display this or something so hello plus name and let's try that again what is your name bro okay hello bro okay people so the last one i have for you guys today is show option dialogue this combines all of them together into one so that is j option pain dot show option dialog and there are a ton of arguments within here but it's okay we're going to go through these one at a time so for the parent component we're going to set this to null what do we want our message to be maybe you are awesome you can set a title i'll set this to secret message you can set an option type so these are the buttons that you want to add or the response type for this dialog box so j option pane dot you can select whatever you want i'll just have the standard yes no cancel option then a message type that's what we added up here at the top for our message dialog boxes for now i'll just set this to perhaps information message so that is j option pane information message we can also add our own icon and our own options for our buttons but for now i'll just set these to null but we'll get into that in just a moment so null no and the initial value is what is initially selected i'll just set this to zero and then a semicolon at the end okay let's try this you are awesome no i'll be humbled this time okay so let's actually add our own icon to this it's going to replace whatever icon we have set for the message type so i'm going to create an image icon out of this image that i have it's just called smile.png so i need to create an image icon image icon i'll call this icon equals new image icon i need to set the file path or the file name if it's within the same project folder so this is smile.png i'll need an import as well for this okay so i have this image icon just called icon i'm going to add that to this argument here it's the third from the last one so that is icon and this should override the previous symbol that we have so now it's using my image in place of the uh i symbol that we had previously we can also add our own options for these buttons but this will take an array of components or reference data types so let's create an array of strings so a string an array of strings we'll call this responses what do we want to add to these buttons in place of yes no cancel so maybe for the first option no you're awesome then for the second option perhaps thank you and for the third option we'll just maybe blush alright so we take this array and we're going to place it in the second to last argument i think i'm going to add these all on a new line just uh just so we can see everything here because it's getting very long all right we should be good and this is the value that you initially want to be selected so if you want the first button selected set this to zero if you want the second one set this to one and here is our dialog box secret message you are awesome no you're awesome thank you or blush no you're awesome alright so that's the basics of j option pane if you want to copy evolve this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of j option pain in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and
