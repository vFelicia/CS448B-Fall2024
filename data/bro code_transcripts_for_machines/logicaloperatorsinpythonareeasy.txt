all right another day another video in this topic I'm going to explain logical operators logical operators are used on conditional statements such as an if statement there's three types we'll talk about and or not each exhibits different behavior and we'll check to see if two or more conditions are true or checks if at least one condition is true not is a little different not will change the result of a condition if a condition is true it's now false if it was originally false it's now true here's an example say we have a program to check the temperature temp equals 25 the temperature will be in Celsius in this example if the temperature Falls within a certain range I would like to print a message that says the temperature is good I can check more than one condition using the and logical operator let's check if our temperature Falls between the range of between 0 and 30 if temp is greater than zero and temp is less than 30. then we will print the temperature is good if this condition is true and this condition is true then we will execute this code else we will print the temperature is bad our temp is currently 25 the temperature is good what if it was negative 10 degrees Celsius well the temperature is bad what if it was over 30 like 40 degrees Celsius well then the temperature is still bad using an andalogical operator if one of these conditions is false then this entire statement will evaluate to be false we would then skip over any sub code and continue on using the and logical operator is pretty convenient if you need to check to see if something is within a certain range like a temperature there is another way we can write this too using the or logical operator let's replace and with or if at least one of these conditions is true then the entire statement is true How about if temp is less than or equal to zero or if temp is greater than or equal to 30 then the temperature is bad else the temperature is good currently our temperature is set to 40. well the temperature is bad this is false but this is true using the orological operator only one of these conditions needs to be true if our temperature was negative 15 well the temperature is still bad but if it was 20. well then the temperature is good and as well as ore are fairly similar with and two or more conditions need to be true for the statement to be true with or only one of them needs to be true is this true or is this true now not is a little different let's say we have a Boolean variable named sunny is it sunny outside I'll set this to be true using an if statement if Sunny is equal to true but if you're working with a Boolean you can just shorten this to the Boolean itself if sunny then print it is sunny outside else print it is cloudy outside Sunny is set to true therefore it is sunny outside if Sunny were set to false it is cloudy outside using the not logical operator that would flip the result so if not sunny then it is cloudy outside else it is sunny outside Sony is set to false it is cloudy outside if Sunny were true well then it's sunny outside the not logical operator will change something that's true to be false or if it was originally false it's now true alright everybody so those are logical operators they're used with conditional statements theirs and or not we'll have more practice with these in the future and yeah those are a few logical operators in Python
