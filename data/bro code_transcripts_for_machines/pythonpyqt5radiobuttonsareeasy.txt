all right let's do this thing today I got to talk about radio buttons in pi qt5 to work with radio buttons we will need the following imports from the module of QT widgets we will need the class of Q radio button as well as Q button group to group together different buttons let's create three radio buttons within the Constructor of my main window we will construct three radio buttons for the first radio button this will be named radio one we will call the Constructor of the class Q radio button then we can pass in some text what is the radio button going to say let's say that we're working with payment options let's say visa for the first option then for the second argument I will pass inself we will add this radio button directly to our window that would be self let's create two more additional radio buttons radio Radio 2 and radio 3 the text of radio button two will be MasterCard and three will be a gift card we are selecting different payment options we need to set the geometry of these radio buttons because we're not using a layout manager I have a method to initialize my user interface this is where I will set the geometry of my radio buttons so let's say self. radio1 we will call the set set geometry method pass in some coordinates 0 0 is good that applies to the top left corner of my window for the width 300 and the height 50 is good let's do this with radio buttons 2 and three Radio 2 radio 3 we'll just move each radio button down on the Y AIS by 50 pixels each so 50 then 100 here are the three radio buttons however the font is kind of small we can barely see it so let's apply a stylesheet here's a trick that we can do with stylesheets we can apply multiple CSS like properties to an entire group of widgets rather than having to type them and apply them individually we will select our window of self set the stylesheet of our window with the set stylesheet method we will add a selector the selector is going to be the name of the widget Q radio button in this case then add a set of curly braces we can apply CSS like properties to an entire group of widgets this way so let's set the font size of all radio buttons to be 40 pixels better let's set the font family to be aial then I will add a little bit of P padding around each radio button padding 10 pixels that's pretty good so with radio buttons we can only select one from any one radio button group if I was making a payment I can't pay with a Visa and Mastercard at the same time I can only select one option that's the point of radio buttons we're limited to just one option with the default behavior of Pi qt5 all radio buttons unless explicitly stated are all part of the same group to demonstrate that let's create two additional radio buttons Radio 4 and Radio 5 radio button 4 will be for a payment method rather than a payment type for example we could say we're paying in store radio button 5 will be we're paying online radio buttons 1 through 3 will be for the payment type radio buttons 4 5 will be for the payment method we're either paying in store or we're ordering something online we do need to set the geometry for these two radio buttons I'll just copy these two lines add Radio 4 Radio 5 we'll set the ycoordinate of four to be 150 and 5 to be 200 all radio buttons will be within the same button group if I was to select in store we deselect one of these options what I would like is one option from this first group and another option from this other group these buttons are all in the same group I can only select one if I would like to pay with the VISA in store and I click the in store radio button we unelect the radio button for Visa I would like these radio buttons within different groups we need to create two different groups and add them accordingly here's how within our Constructor we will act access self declare a button group let's name it button group one for Simplicity equals call The Constructor of the class Q button group then pass in to set the parent widget to be the window then we will create button group two we're going to access self select the radio button group button group one call the add button method then pass in a radio button self. Radio 1 then we'll add Radio 2 and radio 3 we'll select button group two this time button group two add radio button 4 and radio button 5 the first three radio buttons are within the same group radio buttons four and five are within a different group we can only select one radio button from any one radio button group maybe I would like to pay with a Visa card in store or a master card online or a gift card in store these radio buttons are within different button groups we're limited to one selection in any one radio button group when we select these radio buttons they don't quite do anything for each radio button we have to connect a signal to a slot here's how let's define a method of radio button changed there will be no parameters beside self temporarily I'll write pass we'll fill this in in a moment we will take each radio button let's start with radio one Radio One the signal will be toggled when this radio button is toggled we will connect a slot we will pass in a function or a method self do radio button changed then we will do this with the other radio buttons 1 through 5 let's print a test message you selected something just to be sure that everything is working you selected something okay we know that that works currently what we're going to need to do is get the sender widget which radio button sent the signal of toggled I will create a local radio button to store that radio button whichever one emitted the signal we can determine that with self. sender method the sender method is going to return the widget that sent the signal so if we select radio button one our radio button will be radio button one if it was five then it's five in this case then we'll determine if our radio button is checked take our radio button use the is checked method this will return a Boolean true or false if it's checked if this returns true then let's print the following all an F string we will get the text of the radio button radio button called the text method to return the text of the radio button is selected all right then let's see if this works let's select Visa Visa is selected MasterCard is selected gift card is selected in store is selected and online is selected that's how to to determine which radio button was selected which one is the sender which one sent the signal all right everybody so that is an introduction to radio buttons in pi qt5
