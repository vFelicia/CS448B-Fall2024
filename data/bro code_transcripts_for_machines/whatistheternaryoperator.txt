okay guys we are talking about the ternary operator which is represented by a question mark followed by a colon it's a replacement to using an if else statement you write a condition then add a question mark kind of like you're asking a question is something true if that condition is true we can do some code if it's false we do some other code here's an example we have a grade my grade is 75. if grade is greater than or equal to 60 i'll output you pass else will output you fail my grade is 75 therefore i pass another way of writing this is to use the ternary operator first we write a condition so let's get rid of this if statement after our condition we'll add a question mark now parentheses are optional then we write some expression standard output you pass we do this if our condition is true colon what will we do if that condition is false well let's use whatever's within our else statement and this would work the same if my grade is 75 you pass if it's 50 you fail let's come up with a few other examples let's check to see if a number is even or odd int number equals what about nine we write a condition we'll check if number modulus 2. remember modulus gives you the remainder of any division does number divide by 2 evenly so this returns a 1 or a 0. if number modulus 2 is equal to 1 question mark then let's display odd if it's false we'll display standard output even okay odd let's change number to eight now it's even you don't necessarily need equals one or equal zero the number one does correspond to true and zero corresponds to false so you could write it like this too eight divides by two evenly that's even if it's nine that is odd okay last example let's examine a boolean variable bull how about hungry is somebody hungry i'll set this to be true let's write our condition hungry equals true question mark now if you're examining to see if a boolean variable is true you don't necessarily need equals true you can just say that boolean variable hungry question mark like you're asking a question so if hungry is true we will do this standard output you are hungry colon what will we do if it's false standard output you are full hungry is set to true you are hungry if it were false you are full if we're displaying output there's a couple different ways in which we could write this it's up to you how you want to handle it so another way of writing the same code would be standard output then within a set of parentheses then we could use our ternary operator hungry question mark you are hungry else you are full this would work as well let's just check that hungry is set to false you are full let's set it to true you are hungry so yeah that's the ternary operator everybody it's a question mark followed by a colon you write a condition as if you're asking a question if that condition is true you do some expression if not you do some other expression it's a replacement to an if else statement your assignment is to post a use of the trinary operator in the comment section and well yeah that's the ternary operator in c plus
