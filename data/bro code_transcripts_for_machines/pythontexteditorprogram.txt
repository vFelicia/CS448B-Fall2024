hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can build a basic text editor program in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay people let's create a text editor here's all the different imports that you'll need and we'll begin by defining all of the different functions that we'll need so let's say we have a change color function to change the color of our font and for all of these functions i'm going to write pass as a placeholder so we have change font and this function will accept a varying amount of arguments so we'll use that args keyword we will need to open a file new file open file save file cut copy paste yeah there's a lot of functions here about this is for an about section and lastly quit so how many do we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten functions let's create the main window that we're gonna work with window equals tk and at the very end window dot main loop okay so let's create a title for this window window title notepad program i guess or maybe text editor program would be more appropriate text editor program okay and we will need a file to work with and i'll declare that now file equals none we'll need a window width and height window with equals 500 is good and a height okay so let's attempt to center this window because right now it just appears to the side so our next step is to get the screen width equals window dot w info screen width and i'll copy this for screen height okay so we need to figure out how much we're going to move our window on the x and y axis so let's say x equals screen width divided by two minus window width divided by two and we're going to cast all of this to an end so add an inch cast around this let's copy this do the same thing for y except this will be screen height and window height okay let's set the geometry for the window window geometry i'm going to use a string format method so let's say these will be placeholders for our values so we have window width for the first value window height x and y so this should be near the middle cool we're going to create a string var variable to hold the font name font name equals string var and pass in your window and you can set this to what do you want your default font to be so let's say font name dot set and then pick a font i'll use ariel i think let's create a font size string bar as well we're going to add this to the window and we can set a default size perhaps 25 okay let's create a text area text area equals text we're adding this to the window i'm going to set a font equal to font name dot get the name of the font that we want to use will be the font that we set within our font name string bar so now we'll use a size of font size dot get font size dot get okay now we need a scroll bar scroll bar equals scroll bar we're adding this to our text area so pass that in and i'm going to configure my window using grid row configure this will allow our text area to expand but we're going to set a weight equal to 1 so that it doesn't back expand and then we need column configure okay and text area dot grid i'm going to use the sticky keyword and this will stick north plus east plus south plus west so my text area should take most of the window this is some sample text hooray so it goes down to the next line once it runs out of room on one line unless you resize the window which is exactly what we wanted let's create a scroll bar while we already created it we just have to add a few details to it so that will be near the bottom and why don't we say scroll bar dot pack side equals right fill equals y and then we just have to configure our text area with the scroll bar so text area dot config y scroll command equals scroll bar dot set so that should work but let's test it to be sure okay i'm just going to type a bunch of apps okay look at that our scroll bar works cool okay let's head to this portion and we'll create a bunch of buttons well a button an option menu and a spin box for the font color the size and the font style so i'm going to place all of these different widgets within a frame frame equals frame add it to the window and then i'm going to use frame dot grid okay let's create a color button to change the font color color button equals button i'll add my button to my frame i'll set the text of the button equal to color and i will associate a command of change color which we have already defined at the top where is it at the top here change color and then actually that's it for this portion so then we need to add this button color button dot grid i'll set the row equal to zero and the column equal to zero so let's be sure that this appears make sure you spell grid right okay and we have a color button but this button doesn't do anything so let's head to the change color function within the change color function we're going to say color equals color chooser dot ask color and you can set a title to pick a color or else you don't technically need a title and then text area dot config oh i should probably print this color so let me do that um i'm just going to explain something here so this color is going to be i believe a tuple so let's print it let's say that i would like white okay so we have a tuple we just need one of these values not both of them so i'm going to say area dot config foreground equals our color but we do not want to assign a tuple to our color we just need one of these values so let's say i would like this hex value so i'm going to say at index 1 and let's try it color perhaps i would like my text pink for some reason so we're going with pink this is some text i suppose and we can change this back to by using this color button now i would like blue and we have blue text okay so that is the change color function i'm going to minimize this because we do not need it anymore okay we're going to change the font next so head to the portion of our code right after the color button and we'll create an option menu to list all of the different fonts available to us so let's say font box equals option menu we're adding this to our frame we need to set a variable a string var so that will be our font name that we declared up here now here's a trick to add all of the fonts as options to our option menu we can use the unpacking operator which is an asterisk followed by font dot families and then call this function so this will return all of the different fonts available to us and we just need to set a command and when we use our option menu we'll call change font and we need to add our font box to our grid row equals 0 and column equals one so this should be on the right hand side of our color button yeah it's going to look something like that and you can see the default is arial that we set and we can change it to something else like comic sans or whatever uh however it's not going to change it quite yet so that'll be the change font function before we fill in the change font function there's another widget that's going to share the same command of change font so we should create that next so our next widget is a spin box which i will name size box this will be in charge of increasing or decreasing the font so size box equals spin box we're adding the spin box to our frame and we'll set a range so from underscore you have to add that underscore it's kind of weird this is the range of our spin box for the font size from 1 to let's say 100 the text variable will be font size and our command equals change font so when we use our spin box and call this command of change font it's going to pass in our font size as an argument whereas with option menu it doesn't pass any arguments that's why with our change font function we're accepting a varying amount of arguments because one's going to pass in an argument and the other isn't and we just need to add our spin box so that would be size box dot grid row equals zero and column equals two so we should have a spin box right on the bottom and it's set to 25 that was our default for our font size string var which we set as the text variable okay so we can fill in this function of change font now which will apply both to our option menu and our spin box so that is all the way at the top within the change font function we're going to take our text area dot config set the font equal to font name dot get and the size will be size box dot get and that's it for this function i'll minimize it for now and let's test it this is some sample text hey how you doing good looking okay so let's change the font uh let's pick comic sans or whatever you want and we can increase or decrease the size and we can change the color how about red this time all right nice now let's add a menu bar at the top so we can save this file or open a file or create a new file and some other stuff on second thought i'm going to move these two last lines of code to this section here where we create our scroll bar just so that it's more organized okay so at the bottom let's create various drop down menus so we'll need a menu bar to begin with so let's say menu bar equals menu we're adding this to our window make sure that's capital by the way and window dot config menu equals menu bar so we'll create a file menu edit menu and a help menu so let's begin with the file menu tab to the menu bar file menu equals menu we're adding this to our menu bar and set a tear off equal to zero we'll need a cascade for it to actually be a drop down menu so that will be menu bar dot add cascade label equals file comma menu equals file menu let's see if anything appears yet yep so we have a file menu but there's nothing to drop down yet so we need some options well commands technically file menu dot add command label equals new and the command will equal our new file function actually i'll put these together okay so let's copy this and paste it we have open the command will be open file we have save the command will be save file and i'll add a separator file menu dot add separator and lastly we will have exit command quit okay let me show you what this looks like so here's our drop down menu that separator is this bold line going across so if i was to remove this then we wouldn't have that bolt line you can keep it in or get rid of it do whatever you want and this is the tear off so i'm going to remove the tear off and you get this like tear off line at the top i guess it's the default i usually don't like it so i set tear off equal to zero so that is our file menu let's work on a edit menu edit menu equals menu menu bar make sure that's capital two tear off equals zero we'll need a cascade menu bar dot add cascade label equals edit menu equals edit menu edit menu dot add command label equals cut to cut some text command equals copy actually that's cut my bad okay next is copy so let's copy this and paste it cut copy we have paste command paste all right let's take a look oh make sure you spell label right okay there we go okay so we can cut copy and paste and lastly we should have a help menu help menu equals menu menu bar tear off equals zero i think i'll copy this for my cascade so menu bar dot add cascade help menu equals help menu what we'll be doing for a command is that we'll be creating an about section that will bring up a popup window if you need to display any like help information or anything uh so let's say about and the command will be about okay let's take a look so we have help and we'll have an about section that will tell you more about this program but we need to work on some of these functions let's head to the quit function this one's fairly easy this is found within the file menu window dot destroy that will close out of the window so go to file then exit to exit the program we don't need it anymore so let's minimize this okay let's go to the about function let's bring up a message box show info this first argument is the title so let's say about this program and the text will be whatever you want to tell the user about this program this is a program written by you okay so we should have a popup window when you go to help then about about this program this is a program written by you the next function is the paste function so we can paste some text text area dot event generate and the event is going to be within quotes and double angle brackets paste let's copy this and change paste to copy and then cut okay so we should be able to cut copy and paste hey how's it hanging okay let's highlight this edit copy let's move it down to the next line and paste and we should be able to cut as well edit cut nice head to the new file function and we'll set the title of our window to maybe untitled until we save something so untitled and i need to delete any text within our text area text area dot delete and we need to set a range so this has to be a floating point number the first character until the end let's try it so i'll write some sample text and we are going to go to file new that changed the title and it deleted our text so that is the new file function let's work on open file we are now within the open file function and we'll say file equals ask open file name so we have a default extension if you would like one default i think i spelt that wrong extension equals let's say a txt file comma what are the accepted file types i'll set this equal to all files comma and then we need asterisk dot asterisk for all file types as well as text documents so these are what is accepted when we look for a file so we have either all files or all text documents text documents comma asterisk dot txt okay so then let's try some code we'll set our window title equal to os dot path dot base name of our file so that we will change the title of the window to match whatever the file is that we opened then let's take our text area delete what's currently here from one until the end take our file use the open function open our file and read it so pass in our text area dot insert beginning at index of one point zero file dot read that you can catch any exceptions to i'll just write accept exception but it's better to name specific exceptions i'll just print couldn't read file and we should close our file at the end within a finally block finally file dot close we'll need a sample file to read so i'm going to create a new file on my desktop i'll call this test.txt and let's write something whoa you can actually read this awesome okay let's save close out of it add run our program file open test.txt open whoa you can actually read this awesome nice so we know that the open function is working if we need to create a new file just go to file new and that will delete our old text so lastly we have save file underneath the save file function file equals file dialog dot ask save as file name so this will be the default name for the file but you can change that initial file equals let's say untitled dot txt you can set a default extension default extension equals let's say txt file types equals all files comma then asterisk dot asterisk for all file types and any text documents text documents asterisk dot txt okay if file is none that's if they close out of our file dialog we'll just return else so we'll set the window title first window title os dot path dot base name file file equals open open our file and write file dot right take our text area and get the text from index one through the end catch any exceptions it's better to name them instead of just doing a general accept exception but i'm just going to print couldn't save file and finally close our file file dot close all right so let's test it so i'm going to change the font i wonder if impact is in here yes it is i'll change the font size maybe 30 and i'll pick a color how about this swamp green color okay so write something perhaps some lyrics to a song you like i should probably test copying and pasting edit copy edit paste nice all right let's actually try and save this now i'll go to file save the default file name is untitled because we set it to that i'll say all star lyrics and save now i should be able to open this so i'm going to go to my desktop here's that text file i'm going to open it and here are the lyrics that i wrote within my text editor and let's try and read this so let's go to file open find your text document open and would you look at that my lyrics are still here however this program doesn't save the font so i thought of a fun last minute project that we can do we can actually use our text editor to write a python file much like what we do with pycharm so let's write a program using our text editor program it'll be just a simple program let's print hello world and ask for some user input let's say name equals input what's your name and we will print hello plus our name variable and you can change the font and everything too if you want okay so let's save this file save i'll save this to my desktop but make sure you save it as a py file a python file i'll name this as hello dot py and save now to run a file using command prompt we need to find the directory that contains our python file mine is hello.py and it's located on my desktop so i need the location right click go to properties you can copy the location then within command prompt or terminal you can change directory by typing cd space and then paste your new directory the new location enter then to run a python program type python space and then the name of the program the python file mine is hello dot py hit enter hello world what is your name bro hello bro i just thought that would be a fun last minute project that we can do you don't even technically need an ide to write a python program screw you pycharm well everyone that is a basic text editor program i will post the code for this program in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a basic text editor program using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a
