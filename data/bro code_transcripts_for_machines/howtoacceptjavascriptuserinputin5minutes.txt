yeah what's going on people so uh today I'm going to show you how we can accept some user input in JavaScript generally there's two good ways of doing this the easy way is to create a window prompt the professional way is to create an html text box of some sort and you'll likely need a button to submit the user input let's begin with the easy way we'll create a window prompt the first thing we should do is declare all of the variables we're going to use let's create a variable named username we'll declare it but not yet assign it then when we assign it we can set username equal to then to create a window prompt we can type window dot prompt parentheses then within the parentheses our window prompt can contain some text let's ask what's your username okay let's run this and see what happens what's your username I will type in my username press ok we have this variable username it will have a value but we should do something with it let's console DOT log our username let's try that again what's your username I'll type in my username feel free to type in yours let's check our Dev tools and here is my username so that's the easy way to accept user input with this window prompt you could assign declaration and assignment together if you want to you know that would also work now we will accept user input the professional Way by creating an html text box we will navigate to our HTML file okay let's create an H1 element that says welcome we'll need a text box we'll use a selfclosing input tag I will set the ID of this text box to be my text I'll create a label for this text box too because if we're a user we don't know what we're supposed to type in here I will create a label the text within the label will be username then a submit button button the text will be submit I'll put this on a new line I'll add a Break Tag maybe two make it look nice for the ID of the button I'll set the ID to be my submit let's see if this works this is a little Advanced when we click on this button we're going to execute a function but we need to select this button we will access the document of our web page get element by ID the ID that we're getting is the ID of the button my submit So within quotes type the name of the ID follow this with DOT on click equals here we'll write everything we're going to do after clicking the button we need a function function parentheses curly braces everything between this set of curly braces is everything we'll do when we click on the button so first we need a username variable outside of the function when we click on the button get the text from this text box we will reassign our username then set the SQL to the text from the text box we'll use document.getelementbyid the ID that we're getting this time is my text we need the value of the text box so follow this with DOT value all right then to test this let's console DOT log the username all right let's type in our username press submit then check devtools yeah there it is okay let's replace console.log we'll change the text content of our H1 element I will give this H1 element a unique ID let's say my H1 we need to select my H1 element document.getelementbyid the ID was my H1 we are changing the text content equal to let's use a template literal hello username all right let's try this again type in your username press submit and that should change the H1 element hello whatever your name is all right everybody so those are two different ways to accept user input you can use a window prompt or you can use an html text box and that is how to accept user input in JavaScript
