hey what's going on people in this video i'm going to show you all how we can pass an object as an argument so here's the rundown i have a class car cars have two fields a model and a color and a constructor to assign a model and color argument that we receive i have one car object car car one equals new car the model of this car is a mustang and the color is red so i'm going to create a method that will change the color of my car but i have to pass in a car object so let's create a method to handle that for us public static void it's not returning anything and let's call this method change color and we'll need two parameters a car that we would like to change the color of so the data type is going to be car as well as a name for this parameter let's name whatever car object that we receive as just simply car and we need a color as well that would be a string string color then to change the color of this car i would type car dot color equals whatever color that we receive and that's it so now when we invoke this method we have to pass in a car object as well as a color so that would be change color and the car object that i will pass in as an argument is car 1 the name of the object as well as a new color let's color this car silver and then let's display our cars color and model console.writeline car one dot color plus all out of space plus car one dot model and this should change the color of our car to a silver mustang so to pass an object as an argument you need to make sure that you have the right parameter set up you type the data type of this object followed by a name for this parameter then when you invoke this method you have to pass in the name of the object let's try something a little bit different let's create a method to copy an object so let's get rid of this change color method but we'll keep our car object so we'll create a method to return a car object so public static instead of void the data type is the type that we're returning we're returning a car object so replace void with car then we need a name for this method let's call this copy so we will pass in a car object the data type is car and i will name this argument that we receive as car now one thing that we can do to copy a car object is return a new car and then we'll need to pass in a model and a color so the model of this car is car dot model and the color is car dot color now if i would like to copy car 1 and create a second car a copy of it i can type car car 2 equals copy and then i will pass this object as an argument and then let's display the fields of car 2 and i bet it's a red mustang oh yeah there we go so we successfully created a copy of car 1 by returning a car object so yeah that's how to pass objects as arguments you just have to list the data type of the object since we're working with cars we had to set up a car parameter then if you would like to return an object instead of void you would replace void with the data type of the object you would like to return and if you would like to return a new object like what we did with this copy method you would return a new and then call the constructor of whatever object you would like to create and return so that's why we called the car constructor and then we returned that new car back to this spot here so it's kind of like we replaced this method with calling the car constructor something like that so yeah that's how to pass objects as arguments as well as return objects from methods too so yeah if this video helped you out feel free to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
