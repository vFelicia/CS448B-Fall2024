hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the color chooser module in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody so before we begin we'll need a second import so let's add this at the top so from tk enter import color chooser and the reason that we need a second import and it's not included with this first import is because this is a sub module it's not necessary to add this comment i just like to add comments for teaching purposes so make sure you have these two imports before we begin now we'll need a window and a button that we can add to the window and when we click on the button we're going to select a color and change the background color of the window so let's create a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop and then let's set the geometry so we're going to change the background color of the window after we select a color so let's select a fairly large size for a window maybe 420 by 420 so this is the width and the height and then let's create a button so button equals button let's set some text text equals click me and we're going to set a command for this button that is called so we're going to create a function maybe called click and then we just need to pack this button so we can add this to the window so button.pack now we're going to need to create a function and we'll call it click so when we click on the button this function is going to be called so def click and what do we want to do after clicking this button what we're going to do is take color chooser and we're going to use the ask color function so currently this is what this does we can select a color after clicking this button and pick whatever color you want then you hit ok however we need to store this color within let's say a variable so we'll create a variable called color color equals color chooser dot ask color and then we can do something with this color but for now let's just print this color just to take a look to see what it contains so print color so let's say that i want this green color click ok this is what this prints this is our color so this is the rgb values that we have in this first element so this is the amount of red then green and then blue and the second element is the hexadecimal representation of these values so what we want is this hexadecimal value so what we can do is create a second variable to store this so let's just call this color hex color hex equals color and we're going to get the first element well technically it's the second element but it's the element at position one so this one this is zero index zero so we're going to basically extract this hexadecimal value and let's just print this just to be sure that it's working fine so print color hex and let's try this again but select a different color maybe i want this purple color then click ok so this is cb42ff and here we have cb42ff now let's change the background color so since we have this hex value that's actually fairly simple so we're going to take window dot config bg for background color equals color hex and this will change background color and let's set this to a sky blue color maybe like this click ok and it changes the color however it's not really necessary to continue printing these values you can take these out if you want and this would work like just the same then now this part isn't necessary but if you want you can condense these three lines of code that we have for our click function into less lines of code so what you could do instead of assigning the value of color at index 1 to a separate variable we can take color at index 1 get rid of this line and assign bg equals color at index 1. so now this is done with just two lines of code and why stop there we can write this with just one line of code so now we're going to take color chooser dot ask color get rid of this line bg equals color chooser dot ask color at index one and now this is done with just one line of code however it's a i would say a little more difficult to teach so that's why i kind of like to separate this line by line so if you want you can condense all of this into just one line of code so here's some ideas of where the color chooser sub module could be helpful so of course you can change the background color too but let's say that you're creating a game and you can customize your character or avatar well it would be kind of nice if you could have some way for the user to actually change maybe the character's hair color eye color something like this would actually work fairly well so yeah that's the basics of color chooser if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post this in the comments down below but that's the basics of color chooser in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
