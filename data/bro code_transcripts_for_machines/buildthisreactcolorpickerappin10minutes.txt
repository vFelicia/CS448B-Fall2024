hey what's going on everybody in today's video we're going to create a Color Picker program using react this serves as more of an exercise now that we know how the UST State Hook and the onchange event handlers work so let's get started all right let's begin everybody within our source folder we'll create a new file for a Color Picker component this will be a jsx file we will use function based components function Color Picker there are no parameters then let's be sure to export this export default Color Picker we need to return something for the time being I'm going to return a fragment just so that everything works going back to our app component we will import our Color Picker component from its location SL colorpicker djsx then let's include one Color Picker component and that is all we need with the app component heading to the Color Picker component we will need to import the UST State hook import from react we'll use object destructuring just to get the use State Hook from react within our Color Picker function at the top we'll use the UST State hook to create a stateful color variable const we're going to use array D structuring and and create a color and a Setter function for that color we will use the use State hook for the color if you would like to set an initial color you can do that I recommend using heximal values to keep it simple for example if you would like white that would be 6fs personally I'm a fan of using hsl values for Hue saturation and lightness but that can get kind of complicated you would need to pass in a JavaScript object with those three properties we'll stick with heximal values just to keep it simple then we'll create our HTML elements So within the return statement I will create a div element this div element will have a class name of Color Picker container with react when using CSS I like to use a hyphenated naming convention this development will contain everything we need for our Color Picker component within this St elopment I will create an H1 element for a heading The Heading will be Color Picker after this H1 element I will create a nested div element this nested div element will have a class name equal to color display this is what's going to change color this development now I will set the style attribute equal to some JavaScript if I attempt to set the background color to our color variable well with any CSS properties in JavaScript we need to enclose them within an object so we will use a double set of curly braces and that would work if you're embedding some JavaScript and then you're changing some CSS properties you'll need to enclose those CSS properties within a JavaScript object within this nested Dev element will create a paragraph element that has text of selected color embed some JavaScript include our stateful color variable after this development I will create a label this label will have text of select a color I'll create an input element input the type attribute is going to be color we'll have an input element for a color the default is black I'll set the value equal to our state full color variable then to change the color I will set the onchange event handler equal to a call back to a function we will handle color change but we still need to Define this function that's the last step in this component so we will create a function to handle color change there will be one parameter an event all we're going to do is use our Setter function for our color whichever color we select that's going to be its value either RGB hsl or heximal we will access this event Target access its value set the color to whatever that value is so if I set the color to be I don't know blue well that color is going to change to be blue and that is everything we need for this component we haven't applied any CSS yet so it's not very impressive although it does have functionality so be sure to save everything we will go to our CSS stylesheet let's select the body of our document I will set the font family to be aial with a backup of s serif I will take our class of Color Picker container this is what contains everything this div element take our Color Picker container I will use flexbox because I like flexbox display Flex Flex direction will be a column right now it's a row and align items in the center much better let's take our H1 element that would be this heading we are selecting H1 let's add some margin of 50 pixels and increase the font size to 3 RM let's select our color display that would be this element right here that has a class of color display I will set a width of 300 pixels a height of 300 pixels I'll use flex box for all the elements within display Flex justify content tent in the center then align items Center I'll add a border around this element border 5 pixel solid I'll use hsl for the color let's pick something light gray I'll set the lightness to be 80% then I'll round the corners with border radius border radius 25 pixels I'll add a little bit of margin to the bottom margin bottom 25 pixels so when we select a color it's going to change I'm going to add a transition effect so the transition is a little more smooth I will set the transition property after a quarter of a second 0.25 seconds we will ease this transition so this animation should be more smooth let's select this paragraph element and style it take our color display class access the paragraph element within for the color I'll use hsl values 0 0% then 20% this will make the text a dark gray color although it's kind of small you can't really see it I'll increase the font size to 2 RM then text to line Center let's work on the text of the label we're going to select our label increase the font size to 1.5 RM let's set the font weight to be bold and add a little bit of margin to the bottom margin bottom 10 pixels the last thing we need to do is change this input element so it's a little bigger I will select our input element but I don't want to select all input elements I'll use an attribute selector select all input elements that have a type of color so that'll be just this one I will set a width of 75 pixels a height of 50 pixels some padding of 5 pixels I'll set a border radius to round the corners of 10 pixels then set the border to be 3 pixels solid and for the color I'll use hsl zero for the hue zero for the saturation 80% for the lightness that should give us a thick gray border all right everybody so that is a Color Picker program you can create as an exercise for react
