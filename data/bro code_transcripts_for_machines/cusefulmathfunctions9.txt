hey what's going on everybody it's bro here again and in this video we're gonna be covering some useful math functions and C++ let's get into it I promise that this video won't be as boring as the last one on string functions it's probably going to be even worse no it won't be that bad but here's a few math functions that you might find useful for your programs first thing that we're going to want to do is include something at the top of our program so outside of your main method we're going to type this hashtag include then within angle brackets I'll go rhythm but make sure you spell it right just like that not all functions that we'll be covering will need this but a few will and I might forget to mention this later on in this video and it would be a pain in the butt to have to reedit this and show you the part of the video where I include this so let's just get this out of the way and include this now so this video is going to be more of a showcase of different math functions that we can use in C++ and if you want to skip around in this video that's completely fine I'll include some timestamps in the description if there's any math functions that you'd be interested in the first math function we'll cover is the max function we can find the higher of two numbers and return the higher number so let's write a program that will ask the user to enter in two numbers and the program is going to return the higher number so let's create two double variables so these can store a decimal portion it doesn't need to be a whole integer when we write this program so double X and double y we're not going to assign these value quite yet and then let's create a prompt perhaps this program will enter the max of two numbers all right and then we are going to create a prompt to enter in number one enter in number one and then C in X for our first number and we'll do the same thing for y but we're going to change a few things enter in number two and we're going to change X to Y and we can place the result within another variable if we so choose like double Z so if we want to find the max of two numbers we're going to use the max function so type in max and then a set of parentheses and we're going to put two numbers within here and we can just put the variables x and y and then let us display the result so we'll just see out Z okay everything looks good let's run this false alarm I have to make a few edits so I forgot to end the line and I'm just going to add a space after this space alright it should look better now all right this program will enter the max of two numbers enter in number one how about the number 24 and to read number two you know it's better than 24 25 and the max number is 25 all right now with the minimum function it's going to be the same process as before but we're just going to change a few things we're going to change max to men within our little message here and we're going to switch max to men so this will find the minimum between two numbers so let's from the same process that we did last time 24 and 25 and the minimum is obviously 24 big surprise there right the power function men that's a pretty cool name power function it returns a number to the power of another number so in our message what we'll say is this program will return X to the power of Y all right so enter in number 1 that's right entry number 2 now we're going to use the powell function that also kind of reminds me of like those old comic books like Batman where they have like sound effects for all their kicks and attacks but I'm getting off track again ok let's run this powpow BAM all right this program will return X to the power of Y entering number 1 perhaps 3 entering number 2 let's say 4 so the result is going to be 81 and that sounds right 3 ^ for is 81 let's talk about square roots so the square root function will return the square root of a variable or number that you place within the function for this demonstration we will no longer need the Y variable and we can get rid of this prompt all right so this program will return square root of a number all right so enter in the number okay so then what we're going to do here is just type in s Q R T for square root and then a set of parenthesis and we're going to place the number or variable that we want to find the square root of within the parenthesis here and then this variable Z will store it and we can display this all right let's run this all right and turn the number to find the square root of perhaps 64 that's a nice number and the square root of 64 is 8 the absolute value function will return the absolute value of a number that's basically its magnitude think of it like how far away the number is from zero is going to return a positive number so let's change our message to this program will return the absolute value of a number and turn the number that's good all right what we're going to do here is change this sq RT to abs like abs sixpack ABS but it's short for absolute value all right let's run this this program will return the absolute value of a number and turn the number so let's say negative 42 so this will return the magnitude of the number basically how far it is away from zero and it's always a positive number so the answer is 42 the round function will round a number to the nearest whole in so what will change here is this program will round a number to the nearest whole integer all right enter in the number and what we're going to do here is type in round parentheses and then place our number within here so X all right this program will round a number to the nearest whole integer enter in the number let's type in the number 3.14 the first few digits of pi and the result is three so the nearest whole integer to 3.14 in regards to the decimal portion is three now what if we were to type in a different number like three point five it's actually going to round it up as long as the decimal portion is at least 0.5 so there's a few other round methods to you might be interested in the sealing function will always round a number up to the nearest whole integer so this program will round a number up I'm gonna feel like typing that much and what we're going to type in here or the sealing function is it's shorthand C e il4 sealing like you're touching the roof the ceiling so let's type in 3.14 again and see what the result this so it's always going to round it up if there's at at least a decimal portion if this was like 3.0 this would stay the same as 3 but it's always going to round it up and the opposite of this function is the floor function if there's a ceiling there's a floor then so this program will round a number down to the nearest whole integer and we're going to replace this CEI out with floor like the floor of your house and we'll run this okay so let's type in a number with a very high decimal portion like three point nine nine and a nine and a nine and this rounded down to the nearest whole integer which was three so those are just a few of the math functions available to you we only went over a few of the basics there's still way more out there I'll post a resource that you can go to if you're interested in more math functions but these were just the basics I'll also post the code that we worked on in the comments down below and pin it to the top if you would like a copy but yeah those are some basic math functions and C++ heyyou if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button
