hey everybody I have a quick video on the unique constraint the unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are all different that's basically it we can add this constraint when we create a table or after let's create a new table create table let's create a table of products what products do we offer we'll list the columns let's add a product ID the data type will be int product name the data type will be varchar maybe 25 characters then a price price the data type will be decimal our price will have a Max size of four digits and a Precision of two decimal places to add the unique constraint select a column after the data type add the keyword unique and that's all you have to do with this keyword unique we can't insert any product names that are the same they all have to be well unique let's create this table let's say that you forget the unique keyword then you create the table what you could do instead is type alter table the name of the table products which we just created add constraint unique the name of the column within parentheses product name if you forget to add a unique constraint to a column after you already create the table this is what you can write uh however when I run this I do have a warning I already have a unique constraint on that column but yeah that's how you would add a unique constraint to a column in a table you have already created let's select our table select all from products we have a product ID column product name and a price let's insert all of our values insert into the name of our table which is products values will insert maybe four rows we'll need a product ID name then a price for a product name we have a hamburger and the product ID I'm just making up a number is 100. the name is hamburger the price will be 3.99 Fry's will be our next item then we have prize the price will be 189. 102 will be soda the price is one dollar even 103 will be ice cream the price will be 149. Let's test the unique constraint that we have added to the product name column suppose that I forget that I have fries on the menu already and I will add another row 104 Fry's 189 actually let me change the price to maybe something different like 175. here's what happens when I attempt to add two values that are the same duplicate entry fries for Key Products dot product name MySQL is telling us that we have a duplicate under the product name column we have fries twice since we added the unique constraint all values in this column must be different if I were to remove the last column where we have that duplicate well then this would run just fine now let's select everything from products yeah there we go here are the products we have a hamburger fries soda and ice cream all on the menu so yeah that's the unique constraint you can add that constraint when you create a table or after whatever column has that unique constraint all the values need to be different so yeah that's the unique constraint in MySQL
