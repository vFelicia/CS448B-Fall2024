all right let's do this thing so I got to talk about classes and JavaScript classes are an es6 feature that provides a more structured and cleaner way to work with objects compared to the traditional Constructor functions that we're normally used to classes are going to be really helpful when we reach future topics such as the static keyword encapsulation and inheritance in this example I have a Constructor for a product our product needs a name and a price for example we have a shirt and the price is $19.99 instead of using a Constructor method we're instead going to use a class our class will include a Constructor so let's start from the beginning to create a class you type class then the name of the object so our class is going to serve as a blueprint our objects will be products then add a set of curly braces to use a Constructor we can use the Constructor keyword within our class list any par parameters we will have a name and a price for each product we will assign the properties of this.name equals the name parameter that we receive this. price equals price I will also create a function our function will be display product now inside of a class you don't need to use the function keyword when we would like to display this product we will console log product colon space I'll include a placeholder this. name let's also output the price price pick a unit of currency I'll use American dollars this do price let's create some product objects const product one equals to create a new object we have to use that new keyword the name of the class product the Constructor is going to be called automatically but we do need to pass in a name and a price as arguments we will pass in a shirt the price will be $19.99 just to be sure that everything works let's invoke the display product method product one do display product method here are the details of our product object product shirt priced $19.99 let's create a few more so this class is reusable product two will be pants I'll pick 2250 for the price let's display product two product two and we will use the display product method of our class product pants the price is $22.50 uh it looks like I only have one decimal point I'm going to make one change after the price I will use the two fixed method and set this to be two decimals there 2250 all right product three const product 3 equals new product our third product is going to be underwear this underwear is really expensive it's $100 it's really good underwear guys product 3. display product product underwear price $100 here's a challenge round I'm going to add another method this method will have one parameter sales tax we'll create a method to calculate a total including tax so let's create a new method inside of a class we don't need the function keyword calculate total there will be one parameter sales tax all we're going to do is return this. Price Plus to calculate the sales tax we'll take this. price times the sales tax assuming it's a percentage okay let's display product one product one. display product I'm also going to create a constant for the sales tax that's not going to change const sales tax let's say the sales tax is 5% 0.05 I will create a variable const total equals let's take product one use the calculate total method but we have to pass in sales tax we can either pass in this number or this variable once we have our total let's display it console.log I'll use a template string total price in parentheses with t tax I'll add a placeholder display the total pick a unit of currency I'll use American dollars then I'll add two fixed two to set it to two decimal places all right our product is a shirt price is $1 199.99 total price with tax is $20.99 let's do this with product two product 2. display product product 2. calculate total pants 2250 total price 2363 let's check out our really expensive underwear product 3. display product product 3. calculate total our underwear is $100 including sales tax it's $15 all right everybody so those are classes they're an es6 feature that provide a more structured and cleaner way to work with objects compared to the traditional Constructor functions that we learned about in the last video classes are going to be really helpful with a few upcoming topics and well everybody those are classes in JavaScript
