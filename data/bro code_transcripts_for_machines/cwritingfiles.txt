all right let's do this here's how we can write to a file in c let's create a file pointer the data type is file and i'll name this pf it's a pointer to a file and i will set this equal to then invoke the f open function we will pass in a name we would like to give our file let's name this test.txt but if you would like this to be a different file extension such as html well you can change it to that then uh we'll keep this as a plain text file just to keep it simple and to write to a file there is a second argument a mode so this could be w for right a for append r for read but we are looking for w for now so it is good practice at the end of your program to close any files that are open so we will use the f close function and pass in our pointer p f make sure to not dereference it now to write a line of text to our file we can use f print f pass in our pointer p f do not dereference it and then some string of text let's say spongebob squarepants so this file will be created in the same folder as my c program so after running this we have a new text file within the same folder and it says spongebob squarepants what if i run this again and write something different like patrick starr so if the mode is w then we will actually overwrite any existing data already within this file if we need to append a file we can use the a mode for append so this time let's append some text to the end of our document spongebob squarepants and you'll have to keep track of any new lines that you add too so if i run this again and this time i am appending some text well patrick star is still there and we appended spongebob squarepants to the end of our file now if you would like to delete a file here's how i'm going to turn all of this into one giant comment let's use a little bit of file detection let's check to see if our file does exist within our if statement let's invoke the remove method and we will pass in the name or location to our file test.txt if we remove this file successfully it will return zero so if after invoking the remove function if this returns zero that's its exit code that means that file was deleted successfully let's print a message to let the user know that file was deleted successfully else we will print a different message printf that file was not deleted okay let's try this so here's my file within the same folder if i run this that file was deleted successfully and that file is no longer within the same folder you can see here that this says deleted and if i run this again we will not be able to locate that file because it's not there now you can write a file to a different location let's say i would like to write a file to my desktop i can set a relative file path or an absolute file path i'll use an absolute file path i'm going to get the file location of my desktop so i'm just going to click on one of these folders go to properties and copy this location so with my file name i'm going to precede this with an absolute file path then any backslashes might need to be double backslashes so this time if i write a file then this file will appear at this location on my desktop and here's that file test.txt and it says spongebob squarepants well alright everybody that is how to write append and delete files in c if you found this video helpful be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
