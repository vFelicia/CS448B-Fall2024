all right so uh yeah type conversion type conversion is the process of changing the data type of a value to another data type for example we can convert strings to numbers numbers to booleans booleans to Strings numbers to strings booleans to numbers I think you get the idea why might we want to do this well when we accept user input the data type of that input is a string if we need to use it for any sort of math we need to convert it to a number here's an example let's say we have variable age I will create a window prompt window dot prompt we will ask a user how old are you I'm going to add 1 to our age age plus equals one then console.log age how old are you let's say I'm 25 press OK let's inspect our page go to console it shows that age is 251. when we accept user input it's a string data type a series of characters by adding one we appended one to the end of our string we're not increasing our age by one we're doing string concatenation we are going to convert our user input into a number and this is how so after accepting our user input and before making any changes to it let's reassign age equal to and this is a function the number function it will convert another data type such as a string or Boolean into a number then we'll place our Edge variable within that function so now this should work how old are you let's say I'm 25 press ok 26. so that's the reason you may want to type convert because different data types behave differently along with my age variable I'm going to display the type of age what's the data type how old are you 25 press OK 26 and it shows that the data type of age is number if we removed this type conversion and then run this again it shows that our age is 251 and it's a string which is not exactly what we would like that's a reason why type conversion is important let me give you another example let's create three variables let X let y and let Z I'll show you what happens when we convert different values into different data types let's say x is the word Pizza same thing with y and z I will type Cast X as a number then we need to place X within the number function I kind of want to see what happens when we try and convert pizza into a number it's probably not going to go well let's convert Y into a string then Z will be a Boolean let's console DOT log X as well as the type of x let's do the same thing with y and z alright what's gonna happen if you attempt to convert alphabetical characters into a number that variable will be Nan which means not a number the data type is still number though as you can see the word Pizza is already a string so converting it into a string really doesn't do anything that's why for this line the value is still pizza and the data type is still a string if you convert a string into a Boolean booleans again are either true or false converting the word pizza into a Boolean returns true and the data type is Boolean so basically as long as there's some value here and you convert it into a Boolean it will always be true let's replace pizza with zero what will happen we can convert 0 into a number it doesn't contain any alphabetical characters X contains zero it's a number Y is zero but it's treated as a string Z contains true and it's a Boolean what about empty strings just a set of quotes typecasting an empty string is a number is still zero we have an empty string for y then with our Boolean it's false why might you want to type cast a string as a Boolean that's one way in which you can check to see if user input is empty like did somebody type something in if a user skipped user input it's most likely going to be an empty string then you can check to see like if this is false then the user didn't type in anything and you can let them know what about a variable that's declared but not assigned a value converting an undefined variable to a number results in not a number our string is undefined and our Boolean variable returns false so that's the basics of type conversion it's the process of changing the data type of a value to another it's pretty important when you accept user input because when you accept user input it's a string data type at times you may want to convert it to a number if you need to include that number with any sort of arithmetic expressions or a Boolean if you're checking to see if that user input was completed we'll have more practice with this in the future and well that is type conversion in JavaScript
