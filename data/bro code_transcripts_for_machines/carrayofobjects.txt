all right what's going on people so in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create an array of objects i have a class car cars have one field a model field and a constructor to assign an argument to this model field so let's create some car objects car car one equals new car then pass into model of your choosing let's say that car one will be a mustang and let's create maybe two more cars car two and car 3. car 2 will be a corvette and car 3 will be a lambo so we'll need an array to work with too so in the past when we've created arrays we will list the data type of what we're storing within our array like strings ins whatever so after the data type add a set of straight brackets but the data type is going to be the data type of the objects that we're working with since we're working with car objects we'll change that to car car straight brackets then we need a name for this array let's say garage it's kind of like we're parking cars within a garage equals new the data type again straight brackets then a size for this array let's say three then we will assign some of these indexes with an object so let's begin with garage at index zero this will equal let's say car one it's as if car one is parking within our garage at this parking spot number of zero then let's park car two and car three so garage at index of one equals car two garage at index of two equals car three then let's display these console.right line garage at index of zero so let me just show you what this looks like first we're not accessing the model quite yet we're just displaying whatever's within garage at index of zero and what we get is the namespace followed by the data type of our object so if we need the model of this object whatever's within garage at index of zero i'm going to follow this with dot model and that will display my car's model which is a mustang then let's do the same thing for garage at index of one and two so garage index of one garage index of two then make sure to follow those with dot model so within our garage between indexes zero through two we have a mustang corvette and a lambo now another way in which we could display these is with a for each loop for each parentheses curly braces and with our for each loop we have to list the data type of whatever's within our array car and let's call each car just car car car in garage then during each iteration we will display car dot model and that will do the same thing however this time we will iterate through our array now there's another way in which we can write this too we don't need to necessarily define a size for our array then create some named car objects and then assign those objects directly to each index we could just declare an array and then immediately instantiate some objects all in one step so we're going to create a new array car straight brackets i will call this garage equals curly braces and then we will pass in just new car then you need to pass in a model and do the same thing with your other two cars okay this will do the same thing it's just written in less steps so these are known as anonymous objects they don't technically have a name so i may or may not make a separate video on anonymous objects so within our garage we should have a mustang corvette and a lambo so yeah that's how to create an array of objects in c sharp
