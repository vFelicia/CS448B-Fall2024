hey welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you how we can loop through and print the elements of an array so i have an array of doubles named prices and i just made up some fictional prices to display one of these elements i can use a printf statement i will use the appropriate format specifier for the elements displayed within this array since this array contains doubles i will use the format specifier for a double then to access one of these elements i will type the name of my array followed by a set of straight brackets then an index number so the first element in an array is zero because computers always start with zero then if i need to display the other elements well i would have to manually type prices at index zero then one two three four so on and so forth so this does work if you have a couple elements but what if you have hundreds this method is not going to be practical a better solution is that we could make a for loop and this for loop will iterate once and display each element of this array so let's create a for loop four parenthesis curly braces and we'll need an index int i i'll set this equal to zero then we'll need a condition for the time being let's set i less than five but later on we're going to replace five with something else and i'll explain that later and then we will increment i by one so then during each iteration let's use this print statement again and make one change instead of setting an index number let's use our index instead then i'm just going to add a new line character after each printf statement so here we go this for loop should iterate five times and it will display the elements within our array so we have 5 10 15 25 20. maybe i'll add a couple extra things to this format specifier let's display two digits and a dollar sign that's much better so this kind of resembles maybe a receipt of some sort like somebody just bought a bunch of items okay now here's one situation what if we add or remove elements from this array let's say that a user purchases one more item for thirty dollars now the way that this for loop is written it's not going to display this last element because we set this for loop to iterate as long as i is less than or equal to five it's not going to display this last element so we would need some way to update this condition a better solution instead of using a number here is that we could calculate the amount of elements within our array and loop that many times and one way in which we could do that is to use the size of operator so let me demonstrate the size of operator real quick it will return the size of an operand in bytes so let's print this so this will be an integer and we will use the size of operator and pass in our array of prices so this size is going to be in bytes so the size of our array in bytes is 48 bytes we have six elements made up of doubles each double uses up eight bytes so six times eight is 48. so now let's use the size of operator instead size of prices but we're going to divide the size of our array by the size of one of these elements they're all going to be consistent because they all have the same data type so we will take size of prices divided by the size of one of these elements let's say prices at index zero so 48 divided by eight equals six we will iterate through this for loop six times and here's our array we have 5 10 15 25 20 30 and we can add or remove elements freely and there's no need to update our code because we may not remember to do that later on so yeah that's one way to loop through and print the elements of an array you can use a for loop then use a printf statement and for the index of your array you can use the index of your for loop then if you would like your for loop to calculate how many times it's going to iterate through this array you can use the size of operator passing prices divided by the size of one of the elements and that will calculate how many elements are within your array so yeah that's one way to loop through the elements of an array if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to loop through and print the elements of an array in c
