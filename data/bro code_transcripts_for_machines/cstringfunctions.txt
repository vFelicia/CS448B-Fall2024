hey everybody so now that we know how functions work i thought this would be a good opportunity for us to learn about some useful string functions so there's a lot of string functions that are already written for us just include this header file at the top include string.h so create two strings one named string1 and the other named string2 string1 will be your first name string2 will be your last name and then at the end of this program i am just printing string1 using a printf statement so let's begin the first useful string function is string lower so whatever string you pass in as an argument this function will convert a string to lowercase so the first letter in my name is uppercase it's capitalized so after passing in string1 into this function my name is all now lowercase otherwise there's string upper that will convert a string to uppercase and my name is uppercase stringcat will concatenate as in append string2 to the end of string1 so we will append the second argument to the first argument so if i pass in string1 then string two this will append my last name to my first name and these strings are now combined or i could append a given amount of characters from string two to string one so the third argument is a number if i append one character from string two to string one then this will take the c from my last name and append it to the end of my first name so that is the string and catch function there's also string copy and this one is actually fairly common so this will copy string two to string one if i print string one well it now displays code instead of bro this will remove the contents from string one and replace them with string two or you could copy a given amount of characters from string two to string one uh let's say that i'm going to copy the first character over so i'm copying the first character from my last name to my first name and my first name is now crow or i could set this to two and this will copy the first two letters over coo all right here's a few more so string set will set all characters of a string to a given character i'm going to set all of the characters from string 1 to a question mark all of the characters within my name are all question marks and a string and set will set the first and characters of a string to a given character so i'm going to set the first character of my first name to an x so my name is now x bro and string reverse will reverse a string so if i reverse string one my first name is now orb so this next set of functions will return an integer so i'm going to declare a variable int result and this function is really common string length this returns the string length as an integer if i pass in string one this string has a length of three characters and then i'm going to print my result and this is an integer so the length of my first name is three characters this is a fairly common function the string compare function will compare all of the characters within two strings if they're the same they will return zero if they're different they will return a number beside zero so here's an if statement if result is equal to zero we will print these strings are the same else these strings are not the same so my first name is not equal to my last name these characters are different so this code will print these strings are not the same and let me get rid of that printf statement okay now if i make the strings the same then result is going to be zero these strings are the same and you can compare a given amount of characters too so currently i have these strings set to be the same characters so this will compare only the first character these strings are the same even if i change the other characters the first characters will still be the same so this function will return zero there are two additional versions of string compare and string and compare they are string compare i and string n i compare so these will do the exact same things except they ignore case sensitivity so yeah everybody those are just a few useful string functions there's still a lot more located within this header file but we would need to understand how things like pointers work which we have not discussed yet but i thought i would at least cover some of the basics so yeah those are a few useful string functions in c if you would like a copy of all these notes i'll post them to the comment section down below and well yeah those are a few useful string functions in c
