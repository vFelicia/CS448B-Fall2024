what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how frames work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running what's going on people we're going to be discussing frames today a frame is really just a rectangular container to group and hold widgets together so we're going to practice using frames today but first we'll need a window we're going to create a frame and add a frame to the window so window equals tk followed by window.main loop well we're going to need some widgets to add to our frame so let's create a bunch of buttons because why not so i'm going to show you guys a shortcut too so let's say button equals button and then for now we're going to add this to our window but we're going to replace this eventually with frame when we create this and i'm just going to set the text to equal let's say w we're going to have four different buttons wasd like the buttons on the keyboard if you're playing a game and you want to move forward left back or right so we're adding this to the window for now let's set the text to w and what else can we do uh let's change the font so font equals i'll pick the font consoles because that tends to be even with buttons the size of the button adjusts to the size of the letter that you're using or the size of the text so let's set this to 25 and then a width so maybe width equals three all right and then button.pack and i just want to take a look at this so here's our button w so i'd like to show you guys a shortcut if you don't plan on using this button by name you don't really need to give it a name you can just say button and then have all your uh options here and then instead of having button.pack just add dot pack to the end so this will do the same thing however you can't adjust this button by its name though because it doesn't have a name anymore so let's create a few other buttons one for a s and d so we have w a s d and by default they're all top and center so with pack we can actually put these on a certain side so let's say we want uh w on the top and then the other three will be all left so side equals left and then after i show this to you you'll see the benefits of using a frame all right so right now they're all at least it appears that they're all within a container so what if i were to expand this well w is just drifting off it's sailing away by w so what if we could put these within a frame or container to actually contain all of these widgets well we can so let's create a frame frame equals frame and instead of adding these buttons to the window we're going to add these buttons to our frame and now we need to add the frame to the window and this is what this looks like however we need to actually add this by using pack or place so frame dot pack so now what this looks like is that all of these buttons all of these widgets are now contained within a frame a container let's change the background color of this frame just so that we can see the width and the height of this frame so when you create your frame there is an option for background color it's just bg and let's set this to a color we haven't done pink yet pink is a very masculine color so now the background of our frame is pink and that might be a better visual cue to the balance of the frame let's also give this frame a border so let's set a width of 5 using bd and then the type of border that we want and we can specify that with relief so relief equals let's say raised so this will have a 3d pop effect kind of like that let's try sunken there's a few other ones as well but i don't feel like it's necessary to go over all the border types let's stick with sunken for now that'll work alright so with this frame we are currently packing this we can set this on a certain side within our window so currently it's at the top let's set this to maybe the bottom so side equals bottom now this frame is sticking to the bottom of the window and it still contains all of the buttons all of the widgets that we added another function available to you is the place function we can place this frame at certain coordinates within our window so let's set x to equal zero and y to equal zero so then when we place this frame within our window and set some coordinates this entire frame is going to stick at these coordinates even if we were to resize this window and we can change these too let's say x is now 100 and y is also 100 so the frame along with all of the components all of the widgets that it contains are sticking within the container and they move along with this so that's the basics of frames it's really just a rectangular container to group and hold widgets together so if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below and well yeah that's how frames work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to
