hey what's going on everybody today we're going to cover the transform property in CSS the transform property lets you rotate scale skew or otherwise translate an element here's what we're gonna do we'll create a div section I will give this div an ID of box one then within the Box let's say the word hi let's head to our style sheet within my style sheet I will take our ID of box one set the width and height to be 250 pixels then I will give this div section a border of 5 pixel solid let's increase the font size 13 em is fine then text align Center hey let's change the background color to while we're at it I'll pick a greenish color and that's pretty good I'm also going to remove some of the margin around the body of our document body margin zero all right so the transform property the First Transformation I'll show you is translate we can translate X on the xaxis Translate Y on the yaxis or both with just translate let's begin with translate X so after translate X add a set of parentheses whatever value you place within the set of parentheses we will translate this element on the xaxis if I were to set translate X to be 50 pixels this element will move to the right by 50 pixels that's 100 200 negative numbers will move the element to the left percentages are fine too if I set translate X to be one hundred percent this element will translate to the right by 100 percent the width of this element with a negative percentage that will translate the element to the left it could effectively hide that element then with negative fifty percent we should see just half of this element A lot of these Transformations can be done in pixels or percentages there's also Translate Y for the yaxis if I were to translate by 50 pixels on the yaxis that moves the element down negative 50 would move the element up by one hundred percent we will move this element down by one hundred percent the height of the element that negative 100 will effectively hide the element you can combine both of them too with just translate but you need two values the translation on the xaxis then the yaxis if I set the first number to be 50 well 50 pixels that's an X translation the second value is a y translation now we're moving the element to the right and down negative values will move the element to the left and then up those are translations for the transform property then we have rotations we can rotate on the xaxis within rotate X we set a number of degrees if I were to set rotate X to be 45 degrees we'd begin rotating on the xaxis that's 45 this is 90. you can't even see it 135 with 180 it should be kind of upside down that is an X rotation then we have y rotate y we'll start with 45 degrees that's 45. 90 you can't even see it anymore 135 180. and lastly we have Z rotation that's 45 this is 90. 135 180. those are different rotations their scale we can scale X or scale y 1 corresponds to 100 percent 1.1 is 110 percent if I were to set scale X to be 2 we're scaling this element on the xaxis by 200 percent 3 would be 300 percent any value below one would in a way compress it on the xaxis and here is 0.25 we also have scale y scale Y is set to 2. would scale this element on the yaxis by 200 percent that's 300. here 0.5 and here's 0.25 you can combine both X and Y2 with just scale but you need two values so by default it's 1 1 for 100 let's scale on the xaxis and the yaxis by 200 percent and here's 300. that is scale then we have skew skew X or skew y if I were to set skew X to be 45 degrees we are skewing this element on the xaxis here's 90. 135 and 180. the same applies for y Year's 45 90 135 180 you could combine them both with just SKU then again you need two values following that same pattern you can apply more than one transformation at a time let's begin with translate X by 100 percent and then we will rotate on the zaxis by 90 degrees let's add a scale as well I'll shrink this image by 50 percent so yes you can apply more than one transformation at a time these Transformations can also be applied to a class let's create two additional boxes box one box two box three I'll give each of these elements a class of box I'll remove this transformation I will select the Box class take all of these properties cut them besides the background color then paste them within the Box class then let's color in our two other boxes box one box two box three I'll make box two red box 3 will be blue all right let's apply some transformations to the class now I will set the transform property let's translate on the xaxis translate X by 100 pixels then let's rotate on the zaxis by 45 degrees then I will shrink these with scale set to 0.5 you also could apply these transformations to images I just so happen to have a picture of Shrek in my computer I think everybody should have at least one right that image just saved within my website folder let's delete these boxes that include that image image source equals the relative file path of the image all right let's take our image I will apply the transform property let's Translate our image on the xaxis by 100 percent then let's rotate Shrek on the zaxis by 180 degrees let's scale Shrek in the xaxis by 200 percent scale X two all right I don't know what the point of that was but I thought it would be a fun exercise all right everybody so those are transformations it's a CSS property that lets you rotate scale skew or otherwise translate an element and those are a few basic CSS transformations
