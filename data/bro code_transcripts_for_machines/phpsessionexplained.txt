hey everybody how's it going in today's video I need to explain sessions in PHP because well it's an important topic in PHP a session is a super Global variable that's used to store information on a user to be used across multiple Pages once a session is created a user is assigned a session ID for example these can be used for login credentials once you log into a site like Facebook for example you can visit different pages on that site and stay logged in we'll do something like that with PHP let's get started we have our index PHP file but let's create another our index page will be our login page then we'll create a PHP page named home home.php the idea is that once we log in with our index file we will be redirected to our home page so we have two PHP files Now to create a session before you display any HTML we will use the session start function within my PHP script I will type session start and that's how to start a session then after you start a session then you can add any HTML let's generate some HTML I'll add some text to our HTML page this is the login page then I'll add a hyperlink for the home page we'll use an a tag set the href attribute to equal home.php this goes to the home page then be sure to close it I'll add a break as well perfect after our HTML document let's add another PHP script we can create name value pairs within our session super Global variable let's create a key of username set this equal to a username of your choosing then let's do that with the password as well so we will access our session super Global variable we will create a key of password then make up some password for testing purposes let's Echo our username and our password Echo session we're accessing the key of username then we will be returned to the value then I'll add a break then do this with password as well let's see if this works okay here's my username here's my password they are stored within the session variable but we can access the values with a given key they're in key value pairs I would like these values to be accessible from another page from my home page for demonstration purposes I am going to Echo our username and our password from our home page but we need to create a PHP script so PHP then I will Echo our username and our password let's see what happens it's an experiment so I'm going to save everything on our index page we have our username and our password that works fine but if I were to go to our home page our second page well we don't have a username or a password undefined Global variable session within any additional files that we create we will also need to start a session with the session start function and I'll just copy this you'll need to do this before any HTML is displayed we'll start the session I'll create some HTML I'll copy these two lines but make a few changes to them okay this is the home page then I'll create a link to our index page this goes to the we'll call the login page let's reload this okay this is the home page this goes to the login page we do have our username and our password so I'm just switching between the home page and the login page we can access our session variable from either page as long as you start a session for some additional practice let's change our login page to actually reflect a login page we'll have a text box for both a username and a password and a login button so let's go to our index page so this is the login page let's change a few things around we'll create a form set the action attribute to equal index.php for the method since we're using credentials we should use post let's say username add a line break I guess that can be a label too we'll need a text box input type equals text for the name attribute let's set that to be username add a break let's copy these two lines of markup then paste them change the second username to be password also do that with the name attribute then we need a login button input type equals submit for the name this will be login or the value let's say that this is login as well then let's get rid of these lines I'm going to minimize this Explorer window just so we have more room to work with what we're going to do now is after somebody clicks the login button then we'll assign our session variable to check to see if somebody interacts with our login button we can use the is set function within an if statement if is set let me scroll down a little bit we are accessing our post variable at the Key of login if this button is interacted with if it's set we will assign our session variable we'll create a key of username we will assign whatever is within our text box for our username in a real world scenario I would probably use a filter but just for learning purposes I'm going to keep it simple and not use one maybe in a project we will I need to access our post variable at the Key of username whatever is in our text box we will assign to our session variable of username then do that with our password as well before we log in we have to check to see if our username and our password fields are empty we could write using an if statement if not empty function we are checking if our username is not empty and let's check to see if our password is not empty I'll put that down here if our username is not empty and our password is an empty then let's assign our session variables so for testing purposes let's Echo those values Echo the sessions username I'll add a break then do that with the password all right type in a username make up a password oop that should be a password Field hold on type equals password there we go here's our username here's our password if I were to refresh everything type in either a username or password we shouldn't display anything which is correct if one of these two fields are empty let's add an else clause else let's Echo missing username slash password one of those is missing then I'll add a break I'll type in a username but not a password missing username slash password let's type in a password but not a username missing username slash password let's type in both and that seems to work now let's get rid of these Echo statements we no longer need them we were using them for testing purposes what we're going to do now is after hitting the login button we will redirect our browser to our home page there's a function for that it is the header function we'll add that right here after we assign our username and password to jump to our home page within the header function and within quotes we will type location colon space then the name of the page home.php home dot PHP let's save everything make sure you're on your login page I will type a username and a password Press login and we are directed to our home page we are still maintaining that session we have our username and our password still let's create a log out button we'll do this within our home page let's get rid of our hyperlink we'll create a form that just has a button so the action attribute will be home.php or the method let's use post again I will add a button the input type will be submit for the name this will be log out for the value that will be log out as well we will use the is set function to see if our logout button is set so let's use an if statement if is set is our log out button set we will access post the key is log out if this button is set we will use the session destroy function we would like to end our session if we're logging out we will use the session destroy function to destroy the session after logging out let's go back to our login page the index file we will use the header function again set the location to be index.php I will log out and that should bring me back to my login page all right everybody that's how to create a session in PHP you can store information about a user that can be used across multiple pages and well everybody that is an introduction to sessions in PHP
