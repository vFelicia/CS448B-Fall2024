hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the for each loop in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm hey what's going on guys and gals in this video i'm going to explain the for each loop also known as an enhanced for loop this is a traversing technique to iterate through all the elements in an array or other collection the benefits is that a for each loop takes less steps and is more readable than a standard for loop however it is less flexible so let's begin by creating an array of animals so these will be animal names so the data type will be string then we need a set of straight brackets we will call this array animals equals and then we will assign a few values so within our array of animals let's say we have a cat a dog a rat and a bird i'm not sure what kind of bird just use your imagination now we could create a for loop to iterate once through each element of this array but we could also use a for each loop to do this so this is how to create a for each loop type 4 a set of parenthesis and then a set of curly braces so the only part that is different is the statements within the parentheses of the for loop we're going to begin by listing the data type of our array or other collection so we're going to list this as string because we're iterating through strings next we need an index let's say index i then colon colon represents the word in for every string index in our array of animals so lastly list the array or collection name at the end so this will iterate once for each index in our array of animals so what would we like to do within each iteration of this for each loop let's display whatever i is so this is going to be a string whatever this data type is so we can print this directly and when we run this our for each loop will display all the elements within our array and now let's try this for each loop using a collection an arraylist is a type of collection so let's create an array list called animals this time so array list within angle brackets we're going to list the data type which is string and then we will call this animals equals new array list angle brackets list the data type parentheses semicolon and then we'll need an import at the top import java.util.arraylist and then we need to add some values to each element of this arraylist animals.add we're going to add a cat then repeat the process for dog rat and bird dog rat and bird and you can see that nothing has changed so remember a for each loop is useful for iterating through all of the elements in an array or other collection it involves less steps and is more readable but it's less flexible compared to a standard for loop so that is everything you need to know to get started with the for each loop also known as the enhanced for loop if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below and don't forget to do me a favor and smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
