hey everybody in today's video we're going to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS so let's get started we'll Begin by creating an H1 title for the title of our web page why don't you go ahead and type in your name or your employer's name or your business name really doesn't matter then I'm going to use a nav element also known as a navigation element navigation elements are typically used for a set of navigation links I will give this nav element a class of navbar then within this navigation element I'll create an unordered list my unordered list will contain one list item for each category in my navigation bar for the first list item let's create a category for home I would like to turn this category into a hyperlink I'll surround this text with a pair of a tags within the opening a tag I will set the href attribute to B I'll just keep it empty for now we'll fill that in later let's copy our list item paste it a few times maybe a total of four links for the categories let's have home about products and contact these are a few common categories you may see for a navigation bar all right then outside of our navigation bar let's use a main element for the main content for our web page I'll add an H3 element for a sort of subtitle for the main section of our content this is the home page then I'll add a paragraph a text to generate some text in vs code you can type lorem then hit tab alright that is what we need for now let's go to our style sheet the first thing I'm going to do is text align our H1 element and set it to Center text align Center the text in our H1 element should be right in the center I will take our navigation bar class select our unordered list set the list style type to be none to remove the bullet points and they are gone now I'll also change the background color let's pick a dark gray color I'll set the lightness to be 25. I'll remove any padding as well as any margins let's style these hyperlinks within our navigation bar class take any a elements set the color to be white remove the text decoration text decoration will be none that removes the underline I'll add some padding of 15 pixels I will display these elements as a block then text align Center there we are this navigation bar is a vertical style navigation bar this is a style you may see at the bottom of a web page when I hover over one of these links I want to change the background color we will take our navigation bar class take any a elements then apply the hover pseudo class when I hover over one of these hyperlinks I'll change the background color I'll turn down the lightness slightly to 10 lightness there we are if you would like a horizontal navigation bar here's a change we can make with our navigation bar class take any list items then we will float left one change we'll make within our unordered list set the Overflow property to be hidden all right that's pretty good so far there is a little bit of margin around the body of my document I am going to set margin to be zero with our body element set any margin to be zero pixels if you would like margin around the main content of your page we will take our main element then set margin to be let's stick with 20 pixels you also could put margin just on the left side and the right side you know what I'm going to set margin left to be 20. and margin right to be 20. all right then lastly let's fill in these href attributes for the href attributes I will set my home link to be index.html about will be about.html products.html and contact.html we're going to go to our website folder we'll create a few copies of our index file we need three more files one two three let's rename one of these as about.html then products.html then contact.html so let's open about I'll change the header element of our main element to be this is the about page let's apply that for products this is the products page then contact this is the contact page all right and that should be everything let's see if this works we're currently on the home page I can go to the about page products contact and home in this example they're all relatively the same except for the H3 title all right everybody and that's how to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS
