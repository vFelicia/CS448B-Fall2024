hey uh so today I'm gonna explain the checked property in JavaScript the checked property determines the checked state of an HTML checkbox or a radio button element by examining this property we can determine if a check box is checked or a radio button is selected in this program if I were to not select any of these buttons we have a different result within our HTML file we will create an input element the type is going to equal checkbox then for the ID I will set this equal to my check box and here's our checkbox we should probably add a label so that people know what this is for so the label I will set the for attribute to B my checkbox what's the label going to say let's say subscribe like a subscribe button utilizing the for attribute if the four attribute is the same as the ID when we click on the label it should still select the checkbox all right let's add a break then we will create some radio buttons we will again need an input element the type this time will not be a check box it will be radio for the ID this will be a v sub button I'm going to abbreviate button to BTN so pay attention to that then I will create a label for this radio button we will set the for attribute to be the same as the ID then the text will be Visa I'm going to add a break okay let's copy this radio button paste it two times we'll change the second visa to be MasterCard let's change the ID first Master Card let's copy the ID paste it within the four attribute of the second label then change the text Master Card then the third ID will be PayPal button then change the for attribute and the text PayPal so with radio buttons they should all be within the same group currently they're not so I can select all of them if I would like we should only be able to select one for many group we will group these radio buttons by their name attribute they should all have the same name the name let's say is card so let's copy this attribute and paste it within the other input elements now we should only be able to select one and that appears to work lastly let's create a submit button we are creating a button the text will be submit the type is submit and for the ID will be my submit I will create a paragraph element we'll populate it with some text depending if subscribe is checked or not same thing goes with our radio buttons I will create two paragraphs after our button the ID on the first paragraph let's name sub result there will be no text content to begin with we'll change the text content of our subresult paragraph with some text that states if the user is subscribed or not we'll create another paragraph for the radio buttons again there's going to be no text content I'll set the idea this paragraph to be payment result now before we move to our JavaScript file I'm just going to edit the CSS on the button to make it a little bit bigger so you guys can read it so the ID of that button was my submit we are selecting an ID my submit I will set the font size to be one em and that's probably good enough uh maybe I'll add one more break after the Subscribe button and the PayPal radio button just so that it's not as cramped that's decent enough okay so be sure to save your CSS file your HTML file then we are now within our JavaScript file what we're going to do now is get these elements by their ID and store them within constants so they're easier to work with okay let's start with our check box so the checkbox had an ID of my checkbox const my checkbox be sure to pay attention to the capitalization feel free to change that if you would like just be sure it's consistent with what you have currently with your HTML elements we are accessing the document of our web page get element by ID the ID is going to be my checkbox and that's it so let's get the other elements we have my check box then we have our Visa button const Visa button get Elements by ID Visa button then let's repeat this with our MasterCard button again pay attention to the capitalization it's pretty important then we have our PayPal button we need our submit button next my submit then our paragraph elements sub result then payment result all right here are all the constants that we'll need so when we click on the submit button we will execute a function so we are taking my submit that's the name of the button dot on click I keep on spelling on lick on click equals a function parentheses curly braces when we click on the button what are we going to do we recently learned about if statements we will first check the checked property of the Subscribe button we'll place it within an if statement so to create a if statement it's if parentheses curly braces we are examining my checkbox that's the Subscribe button Dot checked property this will evaluate to be true or false if this is true we will execute this code if not we do something else if somebody is subscribed let's change the text content of our sub result paragraph so sub result we are accessing the text content to equal maybe I'll use a template literal you are subscribed else the user is not subscribed let's copy this line paste it you are not subscribed Let's test this if I click on the check box then press the submit button it states that I am subscribed you are subscribed if I were to refresh the page I don't click the Subscribe button press submit you are not subscribed alright we know that that works let's move on to the radio buttons first we will check to see if somebody selected Visa we are accessing the Visa radio button if Visa button dot checked if this is true we are changing the text of the payment result paragraph paymentresult dot text content equals you are paying with Visa let's see if that works I'll select Visa press submit you are paying with Visa all right let's add else if the next radio button is Mastercard button if this is checked MasterCard button dot checked then we will change the text content of the payment result to be you are paying with MasterCard you are paying with MasterCard let's add another else if statement else if this time we are examining the PayPal button PayPal button dot checked if this is true change the text content of the payment result to be you are paying with PayPal you are paying with PayPal else if none of these radio buttons are checked we will change the text content of the payment result to be you must select a payment type I will press submit without selecting a payment type you must select a payment type all right everybody so that is the checked property by examining the checked property of an HTML checkbox or a radio button element we can determine if those elements are checked or not and well that is the checked property in JavaScript
