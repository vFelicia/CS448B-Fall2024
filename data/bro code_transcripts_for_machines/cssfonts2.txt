it's your bro hope you're doing well and for this topic will be discussing fonts in CSS so let's get into it every one so we're going to be discussing fonts so if you don't know fonts are a set of characters of a particular style just had to get that out there in case you didn't know what a font is don't hate me for bringing it up so there's two categories of fonts there's serif and sansserif here's an example okay well I took this image from the Wikipedia page for serif and sans serif fonts now serif is a typography term for small lines or embellishments on certain areas of these individual characters you can see that here with this line all the serifs are colored red now Sons serif means without then those lines that we were discussing so if you're going to pick a font for your web page I would recommend something that is sans serif that doesn't have these little lines just because it's easier to read on a computer screen but if you really want to go crazy with serif fonts be my guest I'm not going to stop you but generally it's on serif fonts tend to be better okay then let's get started let's add some sample text to our page I'm going to create an h1 header I will add the text perhaps font demo we'll close this header tag and we'll add some sample text if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem and hit tab otherwise you can just go online to find a paragraph or two and then just copy it here let's save this refresh the page so I have a style sheet already linked to my HTML file I will place all of the changes in properties for CSS using the style sheet but if you're doing this internally or in line you can feel free to do that as well so let's change the font of our paragraph so I'm going to type in P because we're targeting the paragraph elements and a set of curly brackets and now we can start adding some font properties and I just realized I forgot to surround our paragraph with a set of paragraph tags so make sure you do that ok now we're good so the first thing that we're going to add is a font family so this is actually a property and what you can do with a family is that you can list a few different fonts that you want to use you'll use the first font in this list and if for some reason if somebody's web browser can't support this font it will try and use the next font and then it will just continue down the list so for the last font you'll want to use something that's more or less universally accepted so I'm going to list a few fonts here I'll start with the one that I preferably want to use one font that I do like is ink free now one thing to pay attention to is that with font names if they have a space you need to put these within a set of quotes so let's try in crete to begin with so let's save reload the page and now everything looks handwritten so i kind of like this font i would like to add another font to this font family in case somebody's web browser can't support this ink free font and another that i like is this other one called MV Bohle so let's say that somebody's web browser can't handle this first one it's going to use the second font in this list which is from my example MV Bohle so it kind of looks like this so I'm going to add maybe two fonts that I like and then for the last one this is like a last resort in case somebody's web browser can't handle the first view you can't go wrong with just typing in sons serif so if these two fonts don't work it'll just default to a sans serif font but I kind of like that ink free font because it has personality so I'm going to keep that so let's add a few other things we can add a font style and you can type in the word italic to make your font italic we can add a font weight and you can set this to bold so this will basically just bold all of your text we can change the font size so we'll use the font size property so the default for font sizes is 16 pixels but I'm going to pick maybe 18 to make this a little bit larger just like so I know the unit of measurement is e/m and the default is 1 p.m. so this is the same as 16 pixels so if I were to change this to 2 II M this would be the same as 32 pixels then so you might see either with a unit of measurement being pixels or e/m so use whatever one you prefer all right we can also add a text decoration and let's say I want to add a underline well we can do so this will add a underline underneath all of our text we can also add a particular style to this underline like we can type in the word wavy and this will become a wavy underline I'm not sure what any good use of this would be but you can I don't know maybe it's like ocean waves or something yeah you know what let's change that to blue so our text is riding on some blue waves but I'm getting off track again so I'm actually going to go back and set this to normal and it's as if there's no change at all to that and we can change the font color by using the color property you can type in a color name here or you can use a hexadecimal value if you know how those work one value that I like is zero zero a zero zero and this is a green color kind of like that so with the fonts normally available to you with HTML and CSS it's somewhat limited but you also have access to the google fonts API and I'll show you how you can add a stylesheet link for a custom font from the Google Fonts API first I'll show you the website for where to go for that so this site is easier to find that what I anticipated all you do is go to fonts google.com I'll post this link in the description down below so we can actually browse through these fonts if there's anything you like you can just click on it then I'll show you the next steps I did find one that I liked and it was called al D RI CH I think it's pronounced alderic Aldrich probably pronouncing it wrong but I kind of like the spot because it's techy kind of fits my channel so I'm going to click on this alright so then I'm going to select the style then go to this embed tab alright so we're going to take this link we're going to copy this go to our HTML file and we're going to paste it within the head so that's step one now with step two which HTML element do we want to target let's target our h1 header that we have so we're going to make a block for this on our style sheet and we're going to go back to this embed tab and we're going to just copy this font family otherwise you can just type it in basically all you have to make sure to do is just to type in the font name that you used so let's save this I can actually close out of this page now refresh our page and we now have this custom font from the google fonts API and with the font family you can also add a few other fonts to fall back upon in case for some reason this one isn't supported so perhaps I'll just add that ink free font that I like and then make sure each font is separated with a comma so basically since my web browser supports this font it's going to display this one then it's gonna fall back on these other fonts encase this first one isn't supported and let's add a font color to our header tag our h1 tag and perhaps I'll pick a very bright green color so that's 0 0 FF 0 0 let's see what that looks like oh yeah that's pretty sweet but I think this would look better on a black background so I'm actually going to target the body element of our web page and I'm going to set the background color to black otherwise if you don't want to type in the word you can just type in hashtag and the hexadecimal value for black is just 6 zeroes all right let's this looks like oh but I misspelled body so make sure you spell it right all right sorry about that okay yeah that's pretty sweet and maybe I'll just change the background color of this paragraph element just something slightly lighter maybe one one one one one one okay yeah that's not too bad so that concludes this topic on fonts in CSS if you would like a copy of what we worked on here today I'll post all of this markup in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that's how fonts work in CSS hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in 3
