hey everybody in this topic i'm going to explain the fill function the fill function fills a range of elements with a specified value there's three arguments a beginning address of a data structure an ending address then some value suppose we have an array of strings standard string i'll name this array foods i'll give this a maximum size of 10 elements then i'll go ahead and fill this array with the same food i'll fill all 10 elements with the word pizza so that's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so these all have the same value now this really isn't practical although it does work just to demonstrate i'll display the elements with the for each loop we're displaying strings for every food element in my array foods i would like to display each food element then i'll add a new line so we have 10 elements all filled with pizza you know this does work but it's not practical to initialize all of these elements manually what if we had an array of 100 elements i would have to type the word pizza 100 times there's a few solutions one of which would be the fill function which would make this process a lot easier i'm going to declare this array but not fill it in quite yet we have an array of 100 elements to store strings i'm going to fill all 100 elements with pizza so we type fill parentheses now we need the beginning address of a data structure well that's simply the array name then an ending address so that would be the second argument we would type the array name plus the size of the array so plus 100 in this case then some value i'll fill this array with the word pizza 100 times there we go all 100 elements have been filled with pizza now if you do change the size of this array let's say we have 150 elements you would have to go and change that within the fill method too what i would do in place of adding some number to my array i will add a size variable foods will be index of size and then we can set some size actually better yet let's make this a constant constant and size then i'll set this to be 100 foods plus size so again all 100 elements are filled with pizza now here's a few exercises if i'm filling the first half of this array with pizza we have our beginning address then i need to find the halfway point foods plus size divided by 2. i'll just go ahead and put that within some parentheses for clarity then if i were to run this the first half of this array contains pizza and the second half contains nothing it's empty to fill the second half of this array with hamburgers i would invoke the fill function again we will begin where we left off foods plus size divided by 2 the ending address would be foods plus size we will fill the second half of this array with hamburgers there we are the first half is all pizza the second half is all hamburgers here's a challenge round we'll fill the first third of our array with pizza the second third will be hamburgers and the last third will be hot dogs but 100 doesn't divide by three evenly just to make this simple i'll set our array to be 99 elements we're filling the first third of our array with pizza size divided by three hamburgers will begin at foods plus size divided by three and end at size divided by three times two then we'll invoke the fill function one more time we'll continue where we left off and we will end at foods plus size and fill this with hot dogs here we go so we have pizza hamburgers then hot dogs so yeah that is the fill function we can fill a range of elements with a specified value it's great if you have a lot of elements to work with and you don't manually want to type all the values if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's the fill function in c plus
