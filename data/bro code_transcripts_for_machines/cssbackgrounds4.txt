hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing backgrounds in css so let's get into it so before we begin this video if you want to follow along just find a background image that you like and download it and for now put it in the same folder that contains your index html file and your style sheet so let's begin now we're going to be discussing how to add a background to your website this can be a background color or an image so to kick this off let's create a simple h1 header so h1 let's add some text perhaps background demo and then close this let's save reload and we just have some text now we're going to mostly be working on our style sheet now if you want to target the background of your website you can simply just target this body element however there's a better option than targeting the body and that's actually targeting the html element because that will pretty much cover everything so you can see here that pretty much everything is within the html tags so we're going to target this html tag for our style sheet now if you want to change the background color we've covered this already you just type in background color and this is a property and we can set this to a color like maybe green save reload the page oh there you go that's it lesson over just kidding and for colors you can also use an rgb value which is red green than blue just type in rgb then a set of parenthesis and there's three values that you can place within the parentheses here it's a number between 0 and 255 and depending on what value you place for each of these different positions this will add varying amounts of red green and blue so i'm just going to type in some random numbers i have no idea what this color is but we'll see what it is so i just made up the numbers 100 255 and 75 let's save reload the page and that's like a bright green lime color which is kind of interesting otherwise you can use hexadecimal values so you need a number symbol then you can type in a series of six digits like all zeros would be all black then all f's would be all white and you can look online for some hexadecimal values if there's anything you like let's talk about gradients a gradient is a gradual change from one color to another that's the best way i can explain it let's say that on our website we want the background color to start at one color and then by the end of the document it will become another color and it's going to gradually change colors kind of like a sunset you know how there's varying colors that's kind of what a gradient is it's just a gradual change in colors so this is what we can do to create a gradient effect type in background we'll use the background property linear dash gradient then a set of parenthesis let's start with two different colors we want a gradual shift from one color to another for our background let's say we want maybe gray and we want this to transition to black and you can use either rgb values or hexadecimal values here i'm just going with the words gray and black just because it's simple for this video so let's save reload all right so we're starting to get somewhere so what's going on here is that our background gradient is only extending as far down as we have substance on our website basically since we only have an h1 header tag the gradient is only going down so far if i were to add let's say a paragraph to this so if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem and hit tab and save this well the gradient now extends for as much as we have text for other items on our website and then it will repeat itself every so often but if you want your gradient to extend to the entire window size these are the steps to do that so the first thing that we're going to do is that we're going to prevent our web browser from repeating this gradient every so often depending on how much text you have or other items on your website so background dash repeat then we'll set this to no repeat so this doesn't repeat anymore but we have all of this blank white space underneath all of the items on our website so there's a few other steps we're going to set the background dash position and we will center this this isn't really going to be noticeable quite yet but when we include background images it's going to be more noticeable so no apparent changes yet we will set the background dash size to cover again no noticeable changes and lastly we're going to set the background dash attachment to fixed and what this does is that it this determines if the background will scroll with the rest of the page or if it's fixed in place so when you combine all of these together all these properties what you get is that the gradient or your background image will extend to the full length of your browser window and if you were to resize this window it's actually going to expand naturally so that's what a lot of people tend to want they want their background image or color to extend to the full length of the browser window now if you would like to set an image as your background these are the steps so for now i'm going to comment out everything that we did here and we'll just use this as a reference and we'll start fresh so the first thing that we're going to do is that we're going to include a background image so background dash image colon url a set of parentheses now there's two things we can type in here either the file name if it's within the same folder for this example for me i put this in the same folder but in just a moment i'll show you where you can locate a image that's in a different location or a different folder so type in the name of the image here so i picked a file that was named space underscore small dot png let's save this reload the page all right here's my background but i'm going to change the font color because i can no longer read it and i'm just going to set that to white so one thing you might see is that with images for a web page all the images might be in a separate folder so we'll need to add the file path for where we can locate our background images so let's create a new folder so new folder and i will call this images and we're going to take our background in my case i have two uh here because i'm going to show you another example and we'll place it within a folder called images so now if we were to reload this page we can no longer locate this file so we'll actually have to add that folder here so we're going to type images or whatever else you named your folder then forward slash then the name of the file so if we were to reload this we can now see our background but for this example i'm just going to put everything back within the same folder as it was originally so let's expand this window all right so what's going on here is that this portion right here is the background image but it seems like it's repeating itself to fill in the entire width and height of your web browser too so what i would like to do is that i want to take this background image and have it extend to the full size of my browser window so it's going to be the same steps as before then the same that we did with the linear gradient the first thing that we're going to type is background dash repeat so i'm going to just place that here let's save reload the page so this is the original image that we have for our background and it's not repeating anymore but we still want this to take up the entire size of our browser window so the next thing we're going to do is set the background position to center alright so now this image is in the middle of our webpage we want this background size to be set to cover so now this background image covers the full width of the web browser however we still have this white space underneath it and then lastly we're going to set the background attachment to fixed and this determines if the background will scroll with the rest of the page or if it's fixed in place so when you combine all of these properties together what you end up with is a background image that takes up the entire size of your browser window which again is what people tend to want instead of just their background image only taking up like a certain portion of this window and with this background image the more you zoom in or the larger the window size the image itself will begin to lose some quality so you're better with using high resolution pictures but for this example i had a small version of the background image i wanted to use i'm going to switch this to a better larger resolution picture that i had and the file that i had was space underscore big so now the resolution of the picture is slightly better but you also have to be concerned with how large the image is that you want to use for a background because that might increase the low time for somebody viewing your page then so that's something to keep in mind but higher resolution pictures tend to be better if you're using it as a background image so that's the basics of adding a background color gradient or image to your web page as a whole now you can also add a background to specific html elements let's say that we want to change the background of our h1 header tag which we have at the top so we'll add that to our style sheet h1 set of curly brackets let's add a linear gradient for the background so we'll type in background linear gradient parentheses and then we can type in the colors we want within the parentheses now you can have more than two before we just had gray and black we can add more colors let's say we want like a sunrise or a sunset effect we can type in red then orange and then yellow so let's see what this looks like that's pretty sweet but why stop there though we can make this a whole rainbow if we really wanted to so let's add a few other colors maybe green blue indigo and violet sweet that's a pretty cool looking rainbow it kind of reminds me of that meme i think it was called nion cat yeah this is it this is what this reminds me of assuming most people wouldn't want a rainbow background but for this tutorial series i'm going to include this because well it's my tutorial series and i can do what i want so now how about we change the background color of this paragraph that we have so let's go back to our html file and i need to surround our paragraph with a set of p tags and i'm assuming you probably do as well so make sure you include those we're going to list the p element as our target and let's change the background perhaps we'll use another linear gradient because there's a few other tricks that we can do too perhaps we will use the boring gray and black that we had previously so our gradient only targets this specific paragraph another trick with linear gradients is that you can have the colors flow in a different direction by default it starts at the top and the color eventually transitions to its second color when it reaches the bottom so you can actually change that direction like we can have gray start on the left and when it reaches the right it'll become our second color so within the parentheses we're going to type two right comma and now our first color is on the left and it eventually transitions to our second color on the right otherwise there's two top so it's kind of like these positions are reversed and two left so use whatever you want for your website i kind of like to write honestly that's pretty sweet here's one thing to consider what if you had a bunch of different paragraphs this is what this might end up looking like so i'm just going to take our current paragraph and just paste this maybe an additional three times so we have four paragraphs so each of these paragraphs has their own what looks like an individual box so if you don't want these basically blank empty spaces between each of these paragraphs what we can do is actually put all these paragraphs within its own container using a div tag so before the first paragraph we're going to begin a new div tag and we'll give this a unique id such as my text name this whatever you want really and then outside of the last paragraph we're going to close this div tag and within our style sheet we can target everything within the specific div tag so if you're targeting something with the unique id you need to put the number sign and the name of the div tag or whatever the name of the id was and i already forgot what it was my text okay so we're just going to type that here so my text set of curly brackets and i'm going to take our linear gradient that we had for our paragraphs and i am going to place it within my text now and we'll reload the page now we got rid of those empty spaces before and after each paragraph and it's all one uniform background basically one pretty unique feature about this is that if you have a scroll bar you'll notice that as we move up and down on our web page you'll notice that the actual background image is staying in place and all of our text is moving as if it was on some sort of track or rollers maybe it's kind of like there's two layers there's a background image and then there's all of our text that's moving so that's kind of cool to see so that's the basics of backgrounds in css if you would like a copy of the markup that we worked on today i'll post this in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that's how you add a background in css hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like
