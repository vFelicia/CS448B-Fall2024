hey it's me again today I got to explain the map method in JavaScript the map method accepts a callback and applies that function to each element of an array it's very similar to the for each method however it returns a new array that's a key difference for example let's create an array of constants I'm picking constants just to demonstrate that we're not changing any elements in this array we have const numbers I'll select the numbers 1 through 5 to keep it simple I will create a function to square each number function Square we have one parameter we have an element all I'm going to do is return math.pow this will raise a base to a given power we are raising our element to the power of two then returning it we're going to take our array of numbers use the builtin map method then pass in our function as a call back the map method will return a new array we will create a new array to store the values that are returned so I will create const squares equals numbers. map and then let's display our squares I'll use console.log for now console.log R squares here are all the numbers squared 1 4 9 16 25 let's create a function to cube these numbers now we'll copy and paste our Square function but change it to cube we'll raise our element to the power of three const cubes equals take our original array numbers dot use the map method pass in a call back to the function we would like to use Cube then we will console.log rray of cubes and we have some new numbers 1 8 27 64 125 the map method is very similar to four each but after completion the map method returns a new array we still have our original numbers whereas in four each will'll change them that's a key difference let's go over a new example we'll create an array of students const students equals for my first student I will pick SpongeBob then Patrick Squidward Sandy that's good enough I will create a function to make all of these strings uppercase function uppercase there is a single element remember the element is going to be provided for us with the map method element index and array but we only need element in this case I will return our element dot to uppercase method and that's it we'll create a new array students what can we name this uh students upper I suppose we will take our array of students use the Bap method pass in the function we would like to apply as a callback then I will console.log students upper within my array all of the students names are all uppercase let's create a function for lowercase function lowercase to lowercase I will create a new array const students lower equals the name of the array students map pass in our function as a call back then display the array of students lower now all of the names are now lowercase all right third example this one is more practical we'll create an array of dates const dates equals certain regions will order their dates differently for example you might have the year followed by a month then a day we're going to rearrange the order of these dates using the map method so come up with a few dates I picked 2024 January 10th 2025 February 20th 2026 March 30th feel free to rearrange these however you want I will create a function to format dates we have one parameter a single element within this function I will create a temporary array named Parts we're going to split each state into parts and store it within an array within this function const Parts equals element. split we are going to split each element but where we are going to split at each dash for example with my first element we'll split this date into 2024 that will be the first element 1 and 10 then we'll reformat these parts I will return a template string so I'm going to need some placeholders so dollar sign curly braces let's take our array of parts at index of one that will be the month I live in the United States we arrange our dates with month then day then year I will place my month first forward slash let's include another placeholder Parts at index of two that will be the day of the month slash Parts at index0 that will be the year we will create a new array const formatted dates equals take our original array dates use the map method then pass the function name as a callback then after I will console.log our formatted dates and here they are for me the dates are now January 10th 2024 February 2nd 2025 March 30th 2026 feel free to arrange these however you like all right everybody that is the map method it's very similar to the for each method the math method accepts a callback and applies that function to each element of an array however it returns a new array when it's finished that's nice if you need to preserve the original array that the elements came from and well everybody that is the map method in JavaScript
