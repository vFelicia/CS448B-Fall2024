hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can select data from a table to query all of the data from a table we would type select asterisk meaning all from the name of the table in my case we have table employees this statement select all from employees will give me all columns and all rows but sometimes you may not want all of the data here's a scenario your boss gives you a task of retrieving the full name of every employee well we don't need employee ID hourly pay or higher date for that right we just need a list of the first and last names of our employees table in place of the asterisk meaning all we can select specific columns such as first name and last name we have all of the first and last names from our employees table you can change up the order of the columns too this time I would like last name then first name with our query this returned all of the last and first names of all the employees point being you can select specific columns depending on what you're looking for or everything with the asterisk there is a clause known as the where Clause if we're looking for something specific let's add where then what are we looking for exactly we can write some criteria let's select all from employees where employee ID equals one then end your statement with a semicolon this will give us a specific employee the employee that has an ID of one if I set employee ID to be 2 that would give us Squidward three would be SpongeBob 4. Patrick I think you get the idea here's an exercise let's find all the data from employees where the first name equals SpongeBob where first name equals Sponge Bob this query will return employee ID3 the first name last name hourly pay and higher date here's another example let's find all employees that have an hourly pay greater than or equal to 15. our criteria will be where hourly pay is greater than we'll use the greater than operator or equal to 15. this returns three employees Mr Krabs Squidward and Sandy all three of them have an hourly pay of fifteen dollars per hour or greater it is possible your query can return multiple results let's find anybody that has a higher date less than or equal to perhaps the year 2023 January 3rd this query returns two results Eugene Krabs and Squidward Tentacles they both match this criteria and in this case we use the less than or equals to operator another operator you should know about is the not comparison operator it's an exclamation point and an equal sign we will check if something is not equal let's find where employee ID does not equal one who are all the employees that have an ID not equal to one that gives a Squidward SpongeBob Patrick Sandy and Plankton on the other hand if I set this to one that would give us Mr Krabs that is the not comparison operator if you need to check if something is not equal in this next example let's pretend that we're human resources we need to find any employees that do not have a higher date and then begin the paperwork for them currently Plankton's hourly pay and higher date are both set to null null meaning no value in place of saying you know higher date equals null in place of using the equal sign we would type is select all from employees where higher date is null that would return Sheldon Plankton because his higher date is null not equals null that doesn't work it would be is null you could even say is not null that would return every employee that does have a higher date all right everybody so that is how to query data from a table select whatever you're looking for it can be everything or specific columns from a table of your choosing where the results equal some criteria that you set it really depends on what you're looking for and that is how to query data from a table
