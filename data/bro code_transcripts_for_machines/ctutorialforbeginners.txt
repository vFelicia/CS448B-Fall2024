hey guys in this video you're going to write your first c plus program so sit back relax and well enjoy the show hey if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn c plus plus c plus plus is a fast language like really fast it's commonly used in advanced graphics applications a few examples would include adobe applications video editing software anything that's graphics intensive c plus plus is considered a middle level language therefore it's commonly used with embedded systems and most importantly it's commonly used with creating video games i like video games like a lot compared to other programming languages you could say that c plus plus is a middle level language programming languages tend to be on a spectrum the higher level of programming languages the more it resembles human language languages that are closer to being lower level resemble hardware instructions higher level languages such as python java and csharp are very easy to write with and to understand but they tend to be slower c plus and c they take a little more effort to write but they're very fast they have the benefit of working closely with machine hardware while still somewhat resembling human language just a fair warning there is a learning curve with c plus plus but if you can learn it it's worth it i did some research on glassdoor.com the average salary for a c plus software engineer is 124 000 however i'm just going to say this right now watching this video by itself will not guarantee you a job it's a good entry point though you'll want to watch the video practice create a portfolio work on your job interview skills then you have a good chance of getting an entry level job but as you can see there's a lot of potential so why not learn c plus there's two things you'll need to get started one is a text editor a few options include but are not limited to would be vs code code blocks or even notepad vs code and code blocks are also considered ides integrated development environments they are a text editor as well as a workshop that contain a lot of useful developer tools in this video i'm going to show you how to download vs code but feel free to use any text editor that you're comfortable with secondly we'll need a compiler a compiler is a piece of software that will parse source code to machine instructions and that's really it if you're using windows or linux you'll probably want to go with gcc if you're running mac you'll probably go with clang okay clang has a really cool logo it's blue eyes white dragon so let's get started well alright then everybody now we are going to download vs code that text editor i was talking about head to this url code.visualstudio.com then select the correct download for your operating system i'm running windows i'll select windows then i will open this read the agreement yes i actually did read it that fast i accept the agreement next next next i'll create a desktop icon why not next and install we might as well launch it finish in vs code there's two extensions i would recommend go to the left toolbar underneath extensions we will look up c c plus plus and we would like to download this extension uh let's pretend that this wasn't already installed so i'm going to install it then the next extension i recommend is code runner here it is then just click this blue button to install it okay let's close out of this we're going to create a new folder to hold our c plus projects go to the left toolbar explore open folder i'll create a new folder on my desktop new folder i'll name this c plus plus projects that sounds good to me then select folder within this folder we'll create a new file i'll name this hello world dot cpp make sure to get that cpp extension at the end that means it's a c plus file okay we now have a c plus plus file to work with now we just need to download that compiler that parses source code to machine instructions there's a great set of instructions at this url dot code.visualstudio.com slash docs let's head to c plus plus there's different installation instructions depending on your operating system you'll be downloading gcc on linux if you're running linux gcc on windows for windows and clang for mac os downloading a compiler for linux and mac is actually really easy i can cover that in like 30 seconds windows is a little more complicated but let's begin with linux so all you're going to do is open up terminal and enter the following command gcc v that will check to see if it's currently installed if it's not you enter this command in then you install the gnu compiler tools by typing in this command right here and that's all you need to do with linux if you're on mac you'll download clang open terminal type in this command if clang isn't installed all you type is this command and that's it so pretty easy right if you're using the windows operating system there's way more steps so let's head to step three we'll need to install min gw64 you can click this link to the installer this is an executable i'll open this when it's done click next next next wait for it we might as well run this then finish now we will follow the installation instructions on this website under step 5 we will type pack man dash capital s y u enter type y then enter to proceed with the installation type y then enter again to confirm to proceed now we'll need to find this program from the start menu m sys2 then type this command pack man dash s u enter type y then enter to proceed with the installation now we'll need to enter this command in there's a lot to type here pacman dash s dash dash needed base dash dev l min gw dash w 64 dash x 86 underscore 64 dash tool chain then enter then just hit enter proceed with the installation type yes type y enter again then give it a moment then we can close out of this window we'll have to find the bin folder of mingw it's likely going to be within your c drive go to m64 mingw64 bin then copy this address we'll need to add that path to the windows path environment variable to do so search settings settings we'll search edit environment variables go to path edit let's pretend that this wasn't here i'm going to go to new paste that address okay okay close out of this window just to be sure that our compiler is working and available let's open up command prompt command prompt then type in this command g plus plus dash dash version enter yeah it looks like it's good to go we have now successfully installed our compiler all right everybody let's write our first c plus plus program at the top of our c plus file we are going to type include within angle brackets io stream io stream is a header file that contains functions for basic input and output operations by writing include iostream we're including that header file then we have access to a whole bunch of useful input and output operations now we'll need a main function the main function is where the program begins we'll type int main parentheses curly braces we begin the program by invoking the main function and read any code within the main function starting at the top and working our way down at the end of our main function we'll want return 0 then add a semicolon if we reach return 0 that means there were no problems in this program however if 1 is returned that means there was a problem there is an issue so place return 0 at the end of your main function what we'll do in this lesson is write some basic output to write some output you'll type std contrary to what you might believe in this case it doesn't mean sexually transmitted diseases it means standard follow std with two colons then type c out c means character out means output altogether this means standard character output we're going to display some characters as output then follow c out with two left angle brackets these characters mean output it's also known as the left shift operator when used with numbers what characters would we like to display as output within quotation marks let's write something what's a food you like i like pizza i'll type that then follow this statement with a semicolon at the end of statements we add a semicolon that lets the compiler know that this statement is done it's sort of like the period at the end of a sentence that's when you know the sentence is complete so i'm going to save this i'll hold ctrl s or you can go to file save then click this button to run it and there's my output i like pizza on the next line i'll type std two colons c out two left angle brackets for output i'll write a second line it's really good then i'll run this again you can press this icon to clear your output uh oh we have a problem i like pizza it's really good all of this text is on one line what if you need the next line of text to be on well the next line when you need to move your cursor down to the next line you can follow some string of text with double left angle brackets for output std colon colon en dl that means end line and i'll do the same for my second line i'm going to save clear my output run this again yeah there we go i like pizza it's really good each line of text is on a different line another option for a new line that's better performance wise is to add a new line character within single quotes type backslash n and let's replace that here as well so i'm going to save clear my output run this again i like pizza it's really good adding a new line character does the same thing and it's better performance wise however the benefit of using endline is that end line will flush the output buffer really you can use either one but i thought that might be a nice trick to show you now you can write a comment a comment is ignored by the compiler to write a comment you use two forward slashes this is a comment comments are used for yourself for notes or for notes for another developer so if i were to run this again this comment is ignored it's not used as output or anything like that if you need a multiline comment you type forward slash asterisk wherever you need your comment to end you'll place asterisk forward slash again this is a multiline comment and you can see that all of this is ignored as well so comments are used as notes for yourself or for other developers yeah that's a quick introduction to getting started with c plus plus i'll post this code in the comment section down below if you would like a copy hey if you enjoyed
