well hello everybody Welcome to lesson two today I'm going to discuss variables in PHP a variable think of it as a reusable container that holds data we give that container a name that is the variable name there's different data types we'll discuss they include but are not limited to Strings integers floats and booleans there are still more than this but these are a few of the basics for beginners let's get started to declare a variable you type a dollar sign then a unique variable name I'm going to store a user's name a unique identifier could be just name I will set this variable name equal to a string of text so place your string of text within a set of double quotes add a semicolon to the end because we always do that why don't you enter in your first name then to display this variable as output we can type our Echo statement then add the variable name so type dollar sign name semicolon let's save and there is our name rendered as HTML the data type of this variable is a string it's a string of text and it can include spaces add a space followed by your last name as output we're displaying my first name and my last name all as one long string of text if you Echo a message directly that is known as a string literal I will display a message such as hello then I want to add this variable name the easiest way to do that is to add a set of curly braces as a placeholder and within the curly braces add your variable name so dollar sign name hello whatever your name is let's add a few more variables how about a food variable what's the food you like I like pizza of course which we learned from the last video hello name I'll display another message Echo you like at our placeholder our variable name food let's save I'm going to disable this page is not in Dutch for some reason our output is all on one line I'm just going to add a line break a low bro code you like pizza what's another example of a string maybe an email let's declare our variable which we will name email add a set of quotes semicolon to the end uh fake at gmail.com so let's add another line break let's Echo your email is at our placeholder for a variable then our variable name email your email is fake gmail.com that's the string data type it's just a series of text your text can contain numbers such as fake123 gmail.com so even though these are numbers we treat them more as characters we can't use these for any sort of math that's where our next data type comes in integers whole integers an example of a whole integer would be somebody's age let's say that I'm 21 age equals 21. I'm not 21 anymore but I like to think that I still am the data contained within this variable age is an integer we don't have any quotes around this number I will Echo my age variable Echo you are are variable age years old let me add a blind break here there you are 21 years old and int is simply a whole integer you know somebody wouldn't be like half a year old like 21.5 and age would be a whole number another example of a whole integer variable could be users let's create a variable named users and there are maybe two users online you wouldn't have half a user users would be a whole number let's Echo the amount of users there are at a placeholder are variable users online there are two online after the variable users let's add the word users there are two users online one more example of a whole integer could be a quantity you wouldn't have half a product you would have a whole product let's create a variable named quantity I'll just set it to three let's Echo you would like to buy are variable quantity items then a line break you would like to buy three items okay those are whole integers let's discuss floats next a float is a floating Point number it's a number that contains a decimal portion these variables are ins integers they're whole numbers an example of a float could be a grade point average maybe my grade point average is 2.5 so let's Echo your GPA is then our GPA variable then line break your GPA is 2.5 I think we're getting the hang of this I'm going to speed things up another float could be a price with the merry concurrency a price contains dollars and cents with the cents being a decimal portion suppose a pizza is 4.99 let's Echo your Pizza is I'll add my price variable your pizza is price line break your pizza is 4.99 I'm going to add the dollar sign before 4.99 but we have a problem PHP is getting confused because we precede our variable names with the dollar sign undefined variable 4.99 if you would like to display a dollar sign as output you need an escape sequence I will precede my dollar sign with a backslash then it works just fine let me add your your pizza is 4.99 so that's another example of a floating Point number a float another could be a tax rate tax rate I'll make up a tax rate like a sales tax rate 5.1 sounds good let's Echo the sales tax rate is tax rate oop I'm forgetting a dollar sign tax rate percent then a line break the sales tax rate is 5.1 percent those are floats floating Point numbers they're numbers that contain a decimal portion integers are whole numbers the last data type we'll cover are booleans booleans are either true or they're false it's like a light switch it can only be on or off so what are some variables that could be considered booleans what if somebody is employed they either are employed or they're not employed equals true another could be online is somebody online or offline maybe a user's offline I will set that to be false what about for sale something is for sale or it's not for sale I'll set that to be true now with booleans when you display them as output you don't see true or false rather this is what you see let's Echo online status colon then I'll add my Boolean variable online so online is false online status and then nothing appears the Boolean values when you output them if it's false it doesn't display anything however if online was true that will output a one one means true zero means false however we won't display zero nothing is displayed for false usually with Boolean variables we don't normally display them as output we use them internally within a program we might use these within an if statement or a loop which we'll discuss in the future but at this point you should be aware of the existence of Boolean variables in summary a Boolean variable is either true or false I'm going to get rid of these Echo statements you can mix and match variables when you display output with Echo I will add two variables this time here's a hypothetical situation you own a pizza restaurant and somebody places an online order for a given amount of pizzas you have ordered let's add our variable quantity X then our variable food you have ordered three x Pizza let's add an S to the end to make it plural you have ordered three x pizzas then let's calculate a total what I'm going to do now is declare a variable but I'm not going to assign it a value quite yet we will calculate a total total equals null null means no value We'll add a value later after displaying our message you have ordered quantity X food let's reassign our total variable equal to are quantity times to use multiplication you use an asterisk our variable price so now our total should contain a number let's output it Echo your total is let's add our variable total and see what we have ooh I need a line break I'm forgetting about that you have ordered three x pizzas your total is 14.97 So I need to add a dollar sign or you can pick some other unit of currency however PHP is currently confused because we're preceding our placeholder with a dollar sign so I need to use an escape sequence your total is 14.97 now in my program if I were to change the quantity well this total is going to be updated four pizzas is 19.96 if I were to change the price that would also be reflected now the total is 23.96 all right everybody so those are variables they are just a named container for storing reusable data there are a few different data types strings which are a series of text ins which are whole integers floats which are floating Point numbers and booleans which are either true or false in the next topic we'll have more practice with arithmetic and PHP and well those are variables in PHP
