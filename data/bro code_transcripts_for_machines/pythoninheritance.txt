hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain inheritance in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running let's talk about inheritance the term inherit means to receive derive or be left with and we can apply this concept to programming classes can inherit something usually attributes and methods from another class these classes can form parentchild relationships where a child will receive everything that the parent class has much like you inherit jeans from your parents and classes can have children and give whatever they own to their children and in today's video we'll be creating a parent class called animal and children of the animal class will inherit the common attributes and methods that all animals might have to kick off this video i think what we'll do is keep all of our classes within the same file just so that it's easier for us to read and understand let's begin by creating a class called animal so at the top type class animal and what are some attributes and methods that all animals should have let's say we have a class variable called alive and we'll set this to true if you're an animal you begin by being alive and what are some methods how about an eat and sleep method so let's define those def eat what are we going to do when we call this method let's print something let's print this animal is eating let's also create a sleep method def sleep what are we gonna do when we call this method let's print something as well this animal is sleeping and we now have our animal class now let's create separate classes for specific types of animals let's say a class for rabbit a fish and a hawk so we can make objects of those classes so let's begin with a rabbit class class rabbit now to use inheritance with the class that you intend to be the child class after the class name add a set of parentheses and then pass in the name of the parent class in this case it's going to be animal so we will add that to the parentheses so now rabbit is the child class and animal is the parent class so the child class is going to inherit everything that the animal class has so for the time being i'm going to type pass so this rabbit class will have access to a class variable called alive and an eat and sleep method so let's define a fish and hawk class and i'm just going to copy what i have here and just change rabbit to fish and then do so again and change rabbit to hawk this is our family tree animal is the parent class and it has three children a rabbit class a fish class and a hot class and for the time being we're just going to write pass as a placeholder so i bet we can create objects from these classes so let's do so let's say we have an object called rabbit rabbit equals rabbit let's do the same thing for fish and hawk all right we now have three objects rabbit fish and hawk and let's take a look at their class variables i bet they have in a live variable let's check that so i would like to print rabbit dot oh would you look at that this rabbit class has a class variable called alive even though there's nothing within this class well that's because we used inheritance so each of these three children classes inherit everything from their parents all of these attributes and methods i bet they have eaten sleep functions as well so let's check that with fish let's have fish use its eat method and hawk will use its sleep method hawk.sleep so the rabbit is alive the fish is eating and the hawk is sleeping now even though we have nothing written within each of these specific types of animal classes all of these animals have access to these attributes and methods because of inheritance and another benefit of inheritance is that we don't need to keep on copying and pasting this code for example let's say we were not using inheritance so we would not need an animal class we could write our code this way where we would just copy and paste everything underneath each of our classes so what if we need to make a change to one of these methods as in your boss says you know what let's change sleep to slumber okay well we would have to go to each of these classes and make the change manually it's not too bad if you have like three classes but what if you have hundreds that's going to take a lot of effort so wouldn't it be nice if we just list everything that each of these classes has in common and then have all of these classes inherit from one common class and then if you need to make any changes you can do so just within this class and this change will apply to all of the different child classes so that's another benefit of inheritance and not only does it make any changes easier but each class can have their own unique attributes and methods as well along with the attributes and methods that they inherit from their parents so for rabbit fish and hawk let's have each of these classes have their own unique method as well so for rabbit let's define a run method if you're a rabbit then you can run so let's print this rabbit is running and i'm just going to fix some of the spacing here all right if you're a fish then you can swim def swim let's print this fish is swimming and lastly we have hawk if you're a hawk then you can fly def fly let's print this hawk is flying like i said before not only do these specific types of animals have access to all of the attributes and methods that they inherit from their parents but they can have their own attributes and methods as well so let's test some of these methods so we have our rabbit fish and hawk objects let's have rabbit use its run method fish we'll use its swim method and hawk will use its fly method and here we go this rabbit is running this fish is swimming and this hawk is flying so in conclusion classes can have children the children classes will inherit everything that their parent class has all of the parents attributes and methods but not only that the children classes can implement their own unique attributes and methods as well so that is inheritance if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that's the basics of inheritance using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
