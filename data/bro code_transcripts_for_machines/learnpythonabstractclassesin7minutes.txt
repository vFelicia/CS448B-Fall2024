hey everyone welcome back so today I got to talk about abstract classes in Python an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own abstract classes are meant to be subclassed they're supposed to be parents to children classes they can contain abstract methods which are declared but have no implementation abstract classes have a few benefits we can't create an object from a class that's abstract abstract classes you can say are incomplete we don't want to create an object that's incomplete also any children that inherit from an abstract class if there's any abstract methods we have to implement them so let me give you a demonstration we're going to create a class of vehicle for now I'll write pass to work with abstract classes we'll need to import ABC ABC meaning abstract base classes we need import ABC all capital meaning abstract Base Class as well as abstract method so my vehicle class it's going to be an abstract class we will inherit from ABC the abstract based class I don't want myself or any other developers to be able to create a vehicle object I will make this vehicle an abstract class also I can add some abstract methods these methods will be in herited by its children to declare an abstract method we need to use a decorator at abstract method so what should all vehicles be able to do let's say go and stop if you're a vehicle you can go with abstract methods we declare them but we don't Define them we'll Define them within each of the children classes that inherit from vehicle let's create another abstract method abstract method Define stop if you're a vehicle you can stop all right we have finished our abstract class A vehicle just to demonstrate that we can instantiate an object from this class let's attempt to do so and see what happens I will attempt to create a vehicle object vehicle equals vehicle and then run this type error can't instantiate abstract class vehicle with abstract methods go and stop this is good this is what we want our vehicle class is incomplete we don't want to accidentally make a vehicle object if we were it's kind of like the invisible boat mobile from SpongeBob instead we will create some children to inherit from this class so now we will create a class of car which will inherit from vehicle car is the child vehicle is the parent but we are receiving a warning Class Car must Implement all abstract methods what we're saying is hey if you inherit from the vehicle class you need to include these abstract methods so I'm not going to currently let's just see what happens I will attempt to create a car object and run it type error can't instantiate abstract class car with abstract methods go and stop if a class is inheriting from a parent that's abstract and there's abstract methods we have to finish defining those methods So within our car class really I'll just copy this because I'm lazy our method is go we will print you drive the car we also need stop I will print you stop the car okay let's see if this works this has run with no problems I will have my car go then stop we're calling the go method then the stop method you drive the car you stop the car let's create a few more children for the vehicle class class motorcycle will inherit from the vehicle class again we have to implement the abstract methods found within the parent go and stop for go I will print you ride the motorcycle then with stop you stop the motorcycle motorcycle equals motorcycle we're calling the Constructor then I will have our motorcycle go then stop you ride the motorcycle you stop the motorcycle all right last example let's say we create a boat class which will inherit from the abstract class A vehicle I will include a go method where I will print you sail the boat but I will forget to add a stop method because I'm not paying attention let's attempt to create a boat well what the heck is this type A can instantiate abstract class boat with abstract method stop then I'll look over my code and see oh I forgot to include a stop method with including abstract methods within a parent it acts as a set of checks and balances all vehicles should be able to go and stop if I forget to Define one of these methods well we'll receive a type error if we didn't I may not have noticed that we're missing a method so now we need to include that stop method I will print you anchor the boat this seems to have run with no problems I will have my boat go and stop you sail the boat you anchor the boat all right everybody so those are abstract classes it's a class that can't be instanciated on its own we can't create any objects from this class we don't want to because it's well incomplete they're meant to be subclassed they can contain abstract methods which are declared but we don't finish defining them we Define them within the children classes in this example car motorcycle and boat and while everybody those are abstract classes in Python
