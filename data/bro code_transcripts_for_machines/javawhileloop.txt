hey how's it going everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about while loops in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right guys and gals let's talk about while loops a while loop executes a block of code as long as its condition remains true it's like an if statement but it will continue that block of code continuously as long as its condition remains true here's an example let's create a program that will ask somebody for their name if they attempt to not type in anything well we'll keep on prompting the user to type in their name the only way for them to escape the while loop is to type in something aka their name so let's create a scanner scanner scanner equals new scanner within the parenthesis system dot in we'll need an import so be sure to include that at the top import java.util.scanner we'll need a name variable string name equals and we'll just set this to a pair of quotes for now this is how to create a while loop type while then you need a set of parentheses and then a set of curly braces it's kind of like an if statement we'll put our condition within the parentheses if this statement this condition remains true then we will execute this block of code continuously until our condition is no longer true until it evaluates as false this is our condition name dot is blank if somebody attempts to skip the process of entering their name it will keep on prompting the user to type in a name so let's create a print line statement actually i'm going to change this to a print statement enter your name and we will store the result within our name variable name equals scanner dot next line and when we escape the while loop we will display a welcome message hello class name all right that is it let's try this our program states enter your name i'm not going to type in anything i'm just going to hit enter so you can see it keeps on prompting me to enter my name enter your name no enter your name no this time i'm going to type in my name because i give up empty your name bro therefore our condition is now false because our name is no longer blank and we have exited the while loop and continued on with the rest of our code there is a variation of the while loop it's called a do loop and how we write this is that we move the condition to the end of the block of code and preceding this block of code we write the word do so what makes this different is that with the do loop we will always perform our block of code at least once and then we check the condition after so this will work much the same however we're always performing this block of code at least once so the do loop is a variation of the while loop but it works very similar it always executes the block of code once compared to the while loop it will first check the condition and then execute the block of code if this is true so everybody that is the while loop if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below also be sure to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
