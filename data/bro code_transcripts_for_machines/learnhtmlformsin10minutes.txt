hello again friends today I'm going to explain how we can create a form using HTML to create a form we'll need a pair of form tags the opening form tag has a few attributes we need to fill in first is an action attribute after submitting our form to what location do we want to send our form to form submission is done with the back end language such as PHP you might see a file name such as index.php or action page or something of that nature within your action attribute we're not actually going to do a form submission but just be aware that the action attribute sends data to this location to this file the file listed really can be anything but that's outside the scope of this lesson you'll also see a method the method attribute specifies if this is a get request or a post request post is used for confidential information such as a username and a password get is for insensitive data basically again this is outside the scope of HTML at this point in time if we have a form and we're sending sensitive data we should use post now let's create some elements within our form the first thing we'll create is a text box we need a selfclosing input tag so here's our text box by default the type is a text box but we can specify that with the type so type text there's other different types like passwords emails telephone numbers we'll cover that pretty soon we have a text box but if a user sees this text box they probably don't know what they should enter in let's add a label to the text box preceding my input tag I will create a pair of label tags what do we want our label to say maybe username we're telling the user hey we want you to enter in your username if somebody is using a screen reader if they're visually impaired we should add a four attribute what is this for well this is for my username another benefit of adding the four attribute to a label when you click on the label your cursor will move to the text box but we need a matching ID attribute within the input tag so the ID is going to be the same as the four attribute then when I click on the label our cursor moves to the text box there are a few other attributes you might be interested in as well but before we get to that we should create a submit button to submit our data at the end of our form we'll create an input tag the type will be submit it's a submit button but it currently doesn't do anything we're not using a backend language to submit form data to there are some useful attributes for text boxes within the input element for our text box let's add the required attribute in order to submit this form we need to type in a password if I just leave it blank then hit submit we have this little prompt please fill out this field I can't submit this form until I type in something then I can submit it you could set a minimum and maximum length that's another attribute Min length equals then some length the minimum length per username is six characters let's type in just three or some other number below six submit please lengthen this text to six characters or more I'll come up with a different username then submit and that appears to work you also have the capability of setting a maximum length with the max length attribute let's make the max length 15 characters so let's type in a username I'll add a bunch of characters afterwards so I can type in any more than 15 characters there's a maximum to reset your form there's a reset button let's copy this input tag paste it then change type to reset so here's my reset button I'll type in a username press reset then we can reset the data for our form but afterwards I'm just going to add a break line just to put the submit button on a new line with text boxes you can add a placeholder to give the user an idea of what we want them to enter in and in what format I'm going to add a place holder attribute what do we want our placeholder to be I don't know SpongeBob SquarePants or maybe just SpongeBob so the placeholder is faded it gives a hint to the user as to the format in which they should enter in information if I were to click on this text box the hint is still there until we type in something okay let's cover passwords to create a password we'll use an input tag the type is going to be password we should probably add a label to let the user know that we would like a password so I'm just going to copy the label that we have for our username the four attribute of our label should match the ID attribute of our input tag so the ID is going to be password the for attribute of the label will be password and then change the text to there we are I'm just going to change one thing after my password I'm going to add a break line so I will add that here all right so with the password the text is hidden I can type in a bunch of characters and you can't see it you could add some of these attributes as well like a minimum length maximum length and the required attribute so I'll copy those and paste them within the input tag from my password I can type in a username if I attempt to submit this form data without a password we have that prompt please fill out this field that's because we have the required attribute set there's also a minimum length and a maximum length set too I'm required to type in a password that's at least six characters long right now this is only five anything between 6 and 15 is okay for the rest of this demonstration I'm going to get rid of these attributes let's cover email next I'll create a label first this will be for email the text will be email then we'll need a corresponding input tag input type equals email for the ID I will also set that to be email I'll add a line break after then I'll add a placeholder s Square Pants at gmail.com again the placeholders letting the user know the format in which they should type in their information if I were to type in some text but we're missing that at sign hold on let me type in something real quick all right click submit we have a prompt please include an at sign in the email address because we're looking for a valid email address format that's input for email let's copy our label for phone the text will be phone number again we need an input tag the type will be Tel for telephone we need a matching ID that matches the for attribute phone I'll add a break element to the end we can type in a phone number I'll add a placeholder too placeholder equals with American telephone numbers you have three digits such as one two three dash then another three digits like four five six dash then four digits seven eight nine zero So currently we can type in any numbers then submit them uh hold on I need a username we can limit the format in which a user can type in some numbers for a phone number we would need a pattern attribute for the digits 0 through 9 within a set of straight brackets you would type 09 then how many digits do you allow afterwards three then we'll need a dash that's required add a dash then another three digits zero through nine zero Dash nine then another three digits Dash number zero through nine let me move this in a little bit then I would like four digits so now our phone number needs to be in this format three digits Dash three digits Dash four digits one two three dash four five six seven eight nine zero hold on I'm going to get rid of this required attribute just because it's kind of annoying right now one two three4567890 there that seems to work but if I were to type in a random amount of numbers well then we don't meet this pattern matching this pattern is required in order to submit this data all right then we have dates like a birth date we'll need a label this will be for a birth date four b day input type equals date the ID should match the four attribute of the label then I'll add a break element so with dates there's an interactive calendar to select a date pretty simple then we have a number element a user is going to enter in a quantity like they're buying something like how many do you want let's change the text to quantity for quantity we need an input element the type will be number ID equals quantity then I'll add a break so here's our quantity we can use these arrows to go up or down however normally you can go into negative numbers we can set a minimum and a maximum with the Min and Max attributes so the minimum will be zero we don't want to go below zero the max I think 99 is good so we can't go below zero but we can go all the way to 99 and no further you can add a default value with the value attribute I'll set the default to be one that is for number input it's good if you need a quantity of something all right then radio buttons radio buttons are a little tricky with radio buttons you can only select one from a group I think a good label will be for a title are you a mister a miss a doctor whatever like what's your title so title for title we have our title so far then we'll need individual buttons I'll create a label for Mr Miss and doctor Mr Miss in the U.S doctor is p h d the four attribute will be Mr for Mr Miss for Miss then p h d for PhD I'm gonna get rid of these colons so after each label we'll create a radio button input type equals radio the ID will match the four attribute of the label we have Mr then we'll want to add a value to when we submit this form so mister okay let's copy this input then apply it to miss add PhD so type radio ID will be Miss value Miss then we have PhD ID will be PhD value PhD so we have three radio buttons um let me just add a break afterwards with a group of radio buttons you should only be able to select one however we can select all three that's because we need to add all of these radio buttons to the same group we're going to add a name attribute we'll name this attribute title whichever radio buttons you would like in the same group they need to share the same title now we only can select one those are radio buttons okay let's create a drop down menu this will be for a payment like what kind of card are you paying with is it a Visa card MasterCard gift card four payment instead of an input element we're going to be using a pair of Select tags for a select element then add a break afterwards so we have a drop down menu but there's no options we will add option elements within our select element so these have opening and closing tags let's create three options an option for Visa Mastercard then gift card for option one the value will be Visa the text will be Visa so we have one option let's add two more value MasterCard the text will be MasterCard then a gift card value equals gift card the text will be gift card then I forgot to add an ID to the opening select element ID equals payment there we are all right so that is a drop down menu you need a pair of Select tags within the select tags you can create option tags then we have a check box again let's create a label this will be for a check box I think a good use of a checkbox will be a subscribe button the four attribute will be subscribed the text will be subscribe we'll need an input element input type equals checkbox the ID will match the four attribute of the label then add a break element after I can subscribe by checking the check box or by clicking on the label this one's a little tricky we're going to create a text area again we'll need a label the text next to the text area will be comment for comment we'll create a pair of text area tags so we have a text area the ID of the text area will match the four attribute of the label so comment you can change the dimensions of your text box by adjusting the rows and columns I would like three rows rows equals three columns that will be 25. so now we have different dimensions for our comment you can type in anything you suck bro code that's how to create a text area for a file submission again we'll create a label we're kind of following the same pattern file for file again we need an input tag input type equals file the ID will match the four attribute of the label file then I'll add a break so now we can choose a file however by default we can accept all files to limit the type of file that you're looking for there is an accept attribute what file types will we accept Let's do an image for a PNG that would be image slash PNG when I choose a file we're looking for a PNG now you can add more than one file type each file type is comma separated let's also look for any jpegs so that would be jpeg so now we're looking for a bunch of files anything within this range now if you're sending a large amount of data there's one change we'll make to the form we're going to change the encryption type within the opening form tag let's say we're sending an image and the image is a large file so we will set the encryption type equal to B multi part slash form data in simple terms when we send our large amount of data we'll break it into multiple parts then when all of that data is received those multiple parts will be reassembled it's a little more complicated than that but at this level that's all you need to know so if you're sending a large file such as an image I would recommend changing the encryption type to multipart slash form data alright everybody so that's how to create a very basic form using HTML it really doesn't look too pretty right now you can always style it with CSS which we'll be covering very soon and well yeah that's how to create a form using HTML
