yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you guys how we can create a button to close out of our programs in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people let's create a simple logout button so we'll need a pane to work with pick a pane of your choice i'm just going to pick an anchor pane and to give your pane a unique id under the code drop down menu i'm going to call this scene pane now let's create a button drag and drop it anywhere i'll place it in the middle you can set the text although it's optional i'll set this to log out and for the id i will name this logout button and for the action we haven't defined one yet but i will create a method named logout that we'll define later and let's just be sure that we're setting our controller so under the controller drop down menu go to controller class and select the controller that you need let's save and close now head to your fxml document just to be sure that everything updates because sometimes it won't update unless you actively select it now within our controller class let's define all the things that we'll need we're going to inject our fxml into our controller class so add that annotation at the top let's define our button private button and i named mine logout button and for your pane we actually need a separate fxml annotation so private and i picked an anchor pane but you might have picked something different anchor pane scene pane and you might want to head to your fxml document just to verify that so we have our button named logout button and our pane is named scenepin and let's define a stage stage stage and get your imports to make sure that you're importing from javafx and not anyplace else now it's time to define that logout method so this will be public void log out and there is one parameter action event event all right now the first thing that we'll do within our logout method here is that we need to get the current stitch that we're working with in order to close it so let's add this line we already declared our stage we just have to initialize it stage equals we're going to add a cast of stage and then scene pain dot get scene followed by dot get window so that our stage is the current stage that we're working with and let's print something just to test this logout method let's print you successfully logged out and to close the stage you type stage dot close all right let's test this so we have our logout button to close out of this window you just click on this button log out you successfully logged out now if there's anything that you need to do after you click the logout button but before we actually close out of the stage you can just add some code before these lines here so let's say we would like to create an alert box that asks the user hey are you sure you want to log out and then they can confirm with ok or cancel so if we would like to add a feature like that this is how we can do so let's create an alert object named alert equals new alert and within here we can set an alert type alert type dot and one good one is confirmation and then get your imports due so with this alert you can set a title header and content let's set the title alert dot set title and i will set this to log out we can set a header set header you're about to log out and lastly set content this will be the content of the body of our alert box do you want to save before exiting okay so then we're going to place all of this code within an if statement if alert dot show and wait followed by dot get so depending on their response if they click okay button type dot okay that means they would like to exit let's put all of this within an if statement and we should be good so let's test things here's our logout button when i click log out we will call that log out method and here is that alert box that we created we're not actually going to close out of the stage until we select okay here if i were to click cancel we will cancel the process of logging out or closing the window so this time let's click ok to close out of the window you successfully logged out although we can click this logout button that we created to save any progress of our program and close out of our stage if you were to click this red x in the corner that's going to circumvent this method what we could do next is that we can call this method when we click on that red x in the corner so to do that let's copy this method that we have and head to our main java file and paste that here within the logout method there are two changes that we're going to make we no longer need to instantiate a stage because that is created for us already when we call the start method when we begin this program and second we're going to change our parameter from action event event to a stage because our stage is currently not recognized so we will pass in a stage as an argument and within our start method we're going to take our stage and use the set on close request so when we click that red x in the corner of our window it's going to call this method and we can create some sort of event or call a method before we actually close out of the program so we're going to pass in a lambda function event then that arrow for lambda functions and then we will call it the logout method and pass in our stage so when we run this program and we hit that red x in the corner we will call the logout method and this window will pop up this alert however there's one issue though if i were to hit cancel we're not going to interrupt our event it's still going to continue so we can consume this event so let's add our code within a set of curly braces because we're writing more than one line of code via a lambda function and we are going to type event dot consume we will consume the event and that will prevent our program from closing when we hit that red x normally unless we confirm it via the alert message that we have so let's test this now so when i hit this red x we get our alert and when i hit cancel we will not close out of this window but if i were to hit that red x again then okay we will close out of this window oh and here's a fun fact if you hold alt plus f4 that will close out of the program too and we'll still get this logout alert as well so you can either for this application click the log out button to log out you can click the red x to log out or you can hold alt f4 to log out so that is how to create a basic button to close out of your window if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how to create a simple logout button in javafx hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
