all right let's get started everybody in this video i'm going to show you how we can accept some user input in c plus plus we're familiar with c out followed by the insertion operator which is two left angle brackets well to accept some input we would type c in for character input followed by the extraction operator which is two right angle brackets here's a demonstration let's ask a user for their name i'll create a string variable string the name will be well name then i'll create a prompt which will ask the user what their name is standard output insertion operator what's your name then to accept some user input we would type standard cn for character input extraction operator then where would we like to store the user input let's store it within our variable name at the end of our program let's display what the user's name is standard output insertion operator hello name okay we're gonna have one problem though if we're using vs code as our text editor we need to begin using the terminal tab previously we've been using output so i can't actually type in anything to this because it's well for output if you're using vs code this is what we'll need to do if you're not you can skip this step we're going to go to file preferences settings look up code runner then we are looking for run in terminal which is right about here check that close this tab let's stop this from running and we'll run it again okay here we go what's your name i'll type in my first name hit enter hello bro or whatever your first name was this time let's ask a user for what their age is i'll store this within a variable named age int age standard output your age standard input extraction operator age standard output insertion operator you are age years old and i think we'll need some new line characters right about here just one okay this should work let's try it what's your name i'll type in my first name hit enter what's your age i'll make up an age i like to think that i'm 21 still hit enter hello bro you are 21 years old so that's how to accept some user input you can use cn for character input uh but there's just one problem though if you type in a string that has spaces well once we hit a space we stop reading that string this time let's ask a user to type in their full name okay type in your first name and your last name hit enter what's your full name bro code what's your age hello bro you are zero years old if we need to read a string that could contain spaces there's a function that we can use to help us with that that is the get line function standard get line add a set of parentheses within the parentheses we will type standard c in then comma our variable name now we should be able to type in a string including any spaces what's your full name type in your own first name and last name hit enter what's your age i'll type in 21 hello bro code you are 21 years old if you need to accept a string that includes any white spaces you're better off using the getline function and if you forget i'll post this in the comments section so you can always take a look at it if you don't remember okay there's just one issue with this though i'm going to move the second question above the first let's take a look to see what happens what's your age 21 what's your full name hello you are 21 years old here's the issue if we accept some user input with cn followed by get line well in our input buffer there's a new line character and we don't pick up that newline character when we reach the getline function it accepts the newline character that's still within the buffer so to prevent that from happening there's one change that we can make to the getline function after cn add this extraction operator standard ws for any white spaces this portion will eliminate any newline characters or any white spaces before any user input so let's try this again what's your age i'll type in 21 type in your full name and there we go hello bro code you are 21 years old so yeah everybody that's how to accept some user input basically you can just use cn followed by the extraction operator but if you need a string that could include spaces i recommend using the getline function so yeah that's how to accept some user input in c plus if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to accept some user input in c plus plus
