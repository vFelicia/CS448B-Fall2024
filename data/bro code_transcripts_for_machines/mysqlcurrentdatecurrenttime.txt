hey everybody in this topic I have a super quick video on getting the current date and time in MySQL let's create a temporary table at the end of this topic we'll delete it create table I'll name this table test we will have three columns the current date I'll name the column my date the data type is date my time the data type is time then we'll combine both my date time the data type is date time let's create this table it was created successfully then I will select all from our table test we have three columns a date a time and a date time which combines both so how do we get the current date maybe we need to create a timestamp of when some event happened maybe a higher date for our employees so I'm going to insert into the name of my table test some values for the current date there is a builtin function current underscore date then add a set of parentheses this function will return the current date for the current time there is a current time function add a set of parentheses to the end of that function for the date time you could just say now the net a set of parentheses after inserting this row let's select all from our table test here's the current date of me filming this video October 21st 2022 the time is seven in the morning the current date time is October 21st 2022 7 in the morning a date time would probably be good for some sort of transaction you need to record for the time being I'm going to set the current time to be null as well as the date time to be null now if you were to take your current date then add plus one this part of my statement would refer to tomorrow October 22nd if you were to take your current date minus one that would technically be yesterday October 20th you could do something similar with your time and date time you can add or subtract seconds but I think that's pretty selfexplanatory we don't need this test table anymore so we can delete it drop table test and it's gone all right everybody so that was a super quick topic but I thought I needed to cover it that is how to get the current date time and date time in MySQL
