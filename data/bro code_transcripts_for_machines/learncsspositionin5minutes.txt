hey yeah let's talk about css positioning let's begin by creating two boxes i'll use a development let's name this first box box one and create a second box box two let's also create a whole lot of paragraphs because we'll want a scroll bar so if you need some sample text you can type lorem and then tab okay so copy this line and paste it maybe like 10 times that should be good enough and let's copy all of these paragraphs and paste them underneath our boxes doesn't really matter how many you have we just need a lot of room to work with okay let's design these two boxes now that we have a lot of sample text let's begin with box one i'll give this a border of one pixel solid a height of 300 pixels a width of 300 pixels and pick a background color any color is fine now let's style box two and we'll make this smaller 100 by 100 and a different color i like tomatoes so there is a position property where we can format the layout of an element there's five that we'll discuss absolute fixed relative static and sticky static is easy that's the default any element that is positioned statically is in its normal state so there's no change here now relative we can move this element relative to some point of origin the point of origin of box one our blue box is the top left corner and there are offsets top bottom left and right if i would like to displace this element down and to the right by 50 pixels i can set the top offset to 50 pixels or some other unit of measurement and then offset it from the left by 50 pixels as well so this does create an empty vacuum of where this element was so think of this as a reserved space take a look at this what if i were to set top and left to an even greater number like 150 this element will cover other elements underneath so that's something you need to take into consideration or we could do the same thing with box two now box two is displaced and this corner the top left corner is the point of origin okay now let's discuss absolute positioning any element that is positioned absolutely will be taken out of the flow of the document so with box two let's set the position to absolute so you probably noticed that all of this text is running underneath this element it's as if our document is ignoring box 2. it's kind of like it's ethereal or a ghost or something and if i were to set a position i'll set the top to zero then this box appears at the top of our document and here's the reason why any element that is absolutely positioned will search for any parents that are positioned nonstatically if it does not have a parent it will instead use the viewport we're setting the point of origin for box 2 to the top left corner of our webpage because it doesn't have any direct parents that are positioned nonstatically now if i set top to 150 pixels then the point of origin is the top left corner still and it will be pushed down by 150 pixels and maybe to the left by 150 pixels as well what if i would like box two to be positioned in the center of box one okay what i'm going to do is make box two a child of box one by placing box two within box one however box one is positioned statically that's the default so i will set the position to maybe uh let's say relative and let's uh set top to 100 and left to 100 there box 2 is now within the center and the cool thing about this is that if i move box 1 box 2 will follow and stay in that same place it's positioned absolutely so let's set the left offset to maybe 250 there and box 2 is staying in the same place then maybe the top by 250 as well that's kind of the idea behind absolute positioning it searches for a parent that is positioned nonstatically such as relative or some of the other positions i'm about to discuss if it doesn't find a parent it uses the viewport so we'll keep box 2 right there next we have fixed fixed will stay in position of your viewport so even when you scroll it's going to stay wherever you set it let's set this in the top right corner so top zero pixels and right zero pixels so this box will stay in the top right corner of my viewport so that is fixed and lastly we have sticky anything that has a sticky position will stick to an edge of your viewport when you scroll past so if i set this to top then this element is going to stick to the top when we scroll down past it but currently it's in its normal place but when i scroll past it will stick to the top of my viewport and then when i scroll up past it it will snap back into place or we can set this to the bottom when i scroll up past this element it will stick to the bottom then snap back into place or we could combine them both so if i scroll down past this element it will stick to the top if i scroll up past the element it will stick to the bottom so that is the sticky position so yeah everybody those are a few positions in css if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and
