hey everyone here's a quick program that we can make to calculate the circumference of a circle i thought this would be good practice for us now that we know how user input works let's declare all of the variables that we'll need i'm going to create a constant variable named pi and it's going to be of the double data type pi equals 3.14159 the reason that i'm making this a constant is that i don't want anybody else to be able to change the value of pi and let's declare but not assign a radius quite yet we'll have the user type that in and double circumference this will be calculated and displayed so we will need to prompt the user to enter in a radius i'll proceed this with a new line enter radius of a circle and then i will use scanf to accept some user input we need to list the format specifier of doubles which is lf comma address of operator radius then the formula for radius is 2 times pi times radius and then we will display our circumference using printf circumference then we need a format specifier we're displaying a double so the format specifier is lf comma circumference and let's run it enter well the radius of a circle uh let's say that our radius is 10 maybe this is 10 i don't know meters all right our circumference is 62.83 meters now why not take this a step further let's also calculate the area of the circle i wasn't planning on taking it this far but hey let's calculate that as well for practice so let's declare a double variable named area and we will calculate what areas the formula for the area of the circle is pi times radius squared pi times radius times radius then let's display the area so area we're using the double format specifier and area then let's add some new line characters to separate everything enter the radius of a circle let's say 10 meters the circumference is 62.83 meters and the area is 314.15 meters all right everybody that is a small program to calculate the circumference of a circle and i guess the area as well just because well why not so yeah if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
