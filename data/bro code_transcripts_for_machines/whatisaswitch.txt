all right everybody today we're going to discuss switches a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it compares one value against many matching cases here's an example of what you don't want to do i have this program we have variable month month is of the integer data type the user will type in a number 1 through 12 to represent the month if month is equal to 1 it is january else if month is equal to two it is february else if month is three four five so on and so forth this is what you don't want to do because it's inefficient it's how the game yandere simulator was created if you know what that is a better solution would be to use a switch this is how to write one i'm going to delete all of this we will type switch parentheses curly braces what value would we like to examine against matching cases let's examine our month to write a case we would type case then the value let's check to see if month is equal to one so case one colon on the next line what we want to do if month is equal to one let's display a message standard output it is january at the end of this case add break to break out of the switch so that is case one let's work on case two so case two it is february i think the rest is selfexplanatory i'll speed up the footage we have our 12 cases 1 through 12. each case corresponding with a month of the year let's run this enter the month let's say that the month is 4 for april it is april one more time the month is 12 it is december so a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read if there are no matching cases we can execute a default case type default then what would we like to do standard output let's say please enter in only numbers 1 through 12. enter the month uh let's type negative 42. please enter in only numbers 1 through 12. so the default case is kind of like the else statement if there are no matching cases we execute whatever's within the default case let's try one more example this time we'll have a user enter in a character a letter grade will display a custom message depending on what grade they have char grid standard output what letter grade standard input grade then we'll create a switch switch parentheses curly braces we're examining our letter grade against matching cases the first case will be the character a what will we display if somebody receives an a standard output you did great then break case b standard output you did good then break case c standard output you did okay break case d standard output you did not do good break case f standard output you failed break then let's add a default case please only enter in a letter grade a through f let's try it what letter grade i received in a you did great what letter grid f you failed then let's test our default case what letter grid pizza please only enter in a letter grade a through f so yeah that's a switch everybody it's an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read your assignment is to create a switch and post it in the comments section and well yeah those are switches in c plus
