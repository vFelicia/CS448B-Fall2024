all right people here's how to add an image to a webpage find or download an image of your choosing i just so happen to have a picture of shrek within your folder containing your index.html file you're going to move or paste that image within the same folder and within the body element we're going to create a new element an image element within angle brackets type img for image this is a self closing tag and many elements have different attributes that we can change we need to change the source attribute of this image element the source attribute is src and we will set this equal to within double quotes the name of our image mine is shrek.png and then save what i like to do if i'm working with a webpage that has a lot of images i like to create a separate folder for my images this isn't necessary but if your image is located within a separate folder we need to find the file path relative to your index.html file so i'm going to create a new folder and let's name this images it will contain all the images from my webpage then i will move my image to my images folder so we can no longer locate this image we need to find the file path relative to the index.html file to look within my images folder i will precede the image name with forward slash the name of the folder images slash the name of the image and there it is personally if i'm working with a lot of images i like to place all of my images within one folder if you decide to do that as well you just need to precede the file name with the name of the folder that it's in here's my image but it's fairly massive we can change the width and height attributes if we need to i will change the height attribute height equals maybe 200 and that's a lot smaller hm maybe 300 that's a little bit better the height and the width will scale proportionately with each other but you can change them individually let's change the width width equals let's say 100 what we get is an extra skinny shrek and if i change this to maybe 600 well shrek is extra thick now so i will just only change the height attribute so that the width attribute scales proportionately now if somebody is visually impaired they may be using a screen reader to navigate a web page it would be good practice to add some alternative text that is read out loud by a screen reader so that is the alt attribute within double quotes i'll type a brief description of this image this is a picture of shrek so when you add an image it's considered good practice to add some alternative text you can also add a title too a title will be a small popup box that appears when you hover your cursor over an image to add a title set the title attribute equal to some text shrek is shrek see and then i'm going to save hover my cursor over the image and we can see a small popup box that has my title shrek is shrek see we can also turn an image into a hyperlink to turn this image into a hyperlink we need to surround our image element with an opening and closing a tag so open and close within the opening a tag there is an href attribute that we can set to a url of our choosing i think i'll set this hyperlink to the wikipedia page for shrek so just type in the url between these double quotes save then if i were to click on my image this will take me to the wikipedia page for shrek or some other url depending on what you type here so yeah that's how to add an image to a webpage within the body element you need to add an image element and then set the source equal to the image name if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
