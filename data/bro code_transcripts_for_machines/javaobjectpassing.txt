hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can pass objects as arguments to a method so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm well well well welcome back ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can pass objects as arguments so let me give you the rundown of what i have so far here i have a main class as well as a class called garage and a class called car what we're going to be doing is sending our garage class some cars so we can park some cars in our garage so let's create an instance of our garage class and an instance of our car class so let's create a garage object garage let's call this garage equals new garage let's also create a car car i'll name this car equals new car and i'm going to set up a constructor for this car class let's say that all cars should have a name so string name let's declare this variable and within the constructor of our car class we'll set up one parameter of a string that will be called car this dot name equals name now if we were to instantiate an instance of the car class we need to send a car name so let's say we're attempting to park a bmw within our garage class so let's create a method within our garage class called park so this is void it's not returning anything and we will call this park because we're going to be parking cars all right we need to set up the parameters for this method so we first list the data type kind of like what we did with the parameter for our string so the data type is string but this time since we would like to pass in our car to the garage the parameter is going to be car kind of like what we did with our string because strings are also objects and then a name for this car we can keep the same just to be consistent but really you can name this whatever you want like that but i don't know the point of naming it that but whatever so let's just call this car car and what we can do is just maybe have a print line statement such as the car dot name is parked in the garage and that should be good for now so in order to call this park method of our garage we need to send a car to park so we type in the name of the class garage well the name of the instance of the class garage dot and we do have a park method here and you can see that we need to send a car in order to call this method if i attempted to run this it's not going to work just like that so in order to park a car using the garage's park method we need to send a car object so let's send our bmw garage dot park and we're sending our car the bmw is parked in the garage now let's park a second car so let's create a second car i'm going to call this car 2 and rename car as car 1. car 2 equals new car and let's say that this is a tesla and this time i'm going to park cartoon so garage dot park i'm going to send a different car object i'm going to send car 2 this time so we're going to park car 1 and car 2. so the bmw is parked in the garage and the tesla is parked in the garage as well so in conclusion you can pass objects as arguments to a method but when you declare that method you have to have the parameters set up to accept objects of that data type so for our example we have the data type of car so we can only send in cars to our garage to park if we had an additional class such as bicycles and created a bicycle object well we could not use the park method of our garage to send in a bicycle object because we can only pass in cars because that is the parameter that we set for this park method so that's the basics of sending objects as arguments if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to pass objects as arguments in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
