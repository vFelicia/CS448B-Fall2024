hey what's going on people it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you how variable scope works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right let's do a thing people let's discuss the scope of a variable now the scope of a variable is the region that a variable is recognized a variable is only available from inside the region that it is created let's say that we have a function and i just gave this function a name of display name i created a variable inside of this function named name and you can assign this a value of whatever your name is preferably a last name for this example and what i'll do is just print whatever my name is so this variable is known to have a local scope because it's declared inside of a function and a variable is only recognized inside of the region that it is created this variable of name since it's created inside of this function it is known as a local variable that has a local scope it's only available inside of this function that it's created now let's attempt to access this variable from outside of our function so i'm going to print my name variable but we'll have an issue though so name name is not defined so local variables are declared inside of a function and they have a local scope they are only available inside of this function in which they're created on the other hand a global variable is a variable that is declared outside of any function but within your module that you're working with a global variable is known to have a global scope they are available inside and outside of any functions now if i was to print my name variable this is going to print bro or whatever your first name is and it is entirely possible to have both a global and local version of the same named variable so we have both a global version of name as well as a local version of name if i was to print my name variable from outside of this function it's going to print my global version however if i print my version of name inside of that function in which it's created we're going to first use the local version before the global version of name and let's try that so i'm going to call my display name function and this will print my last name code and then my first name of bro so it is possible to have a global and local version of the same named variable now if i was to remove this line where we declare a local version of name well then the next best available name to us would be the global version of name so if you use a variable inside of a function you'll first use a local version of that variable if it's available if not you'll use a global version instead and python will follow this rule known as the legb rule you use any local variables first then enclosed variables then global and then any builtin variables in that order so that's the main difference between local scope and global scope the scope of a variable is the region in which it's available and it's limited to the region in which it's created a local scope is available only inside of the function in which that variable is created a global scoped variable is a variable that is available inside and outside of any functions but within your module that you're working with so that's variable scope in python if you would like a copy of this code i will post this code to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how variable scope works in python
