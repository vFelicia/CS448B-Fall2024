what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a simple checkbox in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everyone we're going to be creating a j check box this is a gui component that can be selected or deselected so let me give you a rundown of my setup that i have we covered this in the last video so we have two classes a main class it doesn't really matter what you call it as long as it contains a main method we're going to create a new instance of my frame so my frame will extends jframe so it behaves exactly like a j frame but it also implements an action listener interface within the constructor of my frame i have this dot set default close operation jframe exit on close we're using a flow layout manager we're going to pack this frame and set the visibility to true and then we'll also need an action performed method so we can listen for events all right once you have all that we're ready to begin this is how to create a j check box so within the constructor for now i'm just going to declare a j check box j check box and we will call this check box equals new j check box we'll probably need an import so include that and then i'm adding this checkbox to the frame so before we pack this this dot add the name of your checkbox and this is what we have so far just a simple selectable checkbox but we'll probably want to add some text we don't know what we're selecting exactly so after we create this checkbox let's set the text you can either pass this into the constructor or we can use the set text method so check box dot set text and we'll place some sample text like i'm not a robot seriously guys i'm not and this is what we have now i'm not a robot last time i checked i wasn't so there's this annoying border around the text we can get rid of that you have to set focusable to false check box dot set focusable and that will take care of that issue so this text is somewhat small and difficult to read we can actually change the font too check box dot set font new font and pass in whatever font you want you can copy me if you want so console us font plain and then a size 35 is good but doesn't matter what you pick that's a little bit easier to read so what can we do with this let's create a button and when we click on this button it's going to tell us if this is selected or not so let's create a button before this checkbox so that's a j button we'll call this button equals new j button and we'll need an import as well and let's set some text you can either pass this into the constructor a string or we can use the set text method so button.set text and i will set this to submit we're also going to need to add an action listener so button dot add action listener since we're implementing an action listener interface we can simply just pass in this alright so we have an action listener that's attached to this button when we click on the button it's going to trigger this action performed method so we need to check to see if the event that happens is equal to the button so if e dot get source is equal to our button now let's take a look at this button this button is not recognized or this action performed method does not recognize this button that's because we declared this button within the constructor so we should make this global by declaring this outside of the constructor because right now it's only local to everything within our constructor so i'm going to copy this portion paste it and we do not need to declare this twice so at the top j button button then button equals new j button so then our action performed method now recognizes this button and we'll need to do the same thing with our checkbox so check box equals new checkbox now we're going to determine to see if this checkbox is selected so there's a function to do that check box dot is selected and this is going to return true or false for now i'll just print this so system.out.printline and we're going to print the result you can also assign this to a variable too that would work as well and let's try this i'm not a robot oh we need to add the button crap let's do that so this dot add button i sometimes forget to add components you will too probably alright i'm not a robot cool this says i am not a robot now i am a robot now i'm not now i am so did you guys know you can actually change the appearance of this checkbox we can set this to an image so i have a few images that i want to use this picture of an x i just called this x.png and a picture of a green check mark so i want to change the check box to these images when the check box is deselected or selected so i'm just going to create some image icons feel free to pause the video if you want to look for some icons that you want to use so image icon i will call the x icon just x icon and then we have another image icon and i will call this check icon and then i will finish instantiating this within our constructor right here is good i suppose all right so x icon equals new image icon and we list where this is located since this is within my project folder i can just list the name so that is x dot png and i'll do the same thing for my check mark icon here so that is check icon and the name is checkmark.png to add an icon to a checkbox when it's deselected you type in the name of the checkbox and we use the dot set icon method and we pass in an icon that we want to use we want to use this x icon which is the red x that we have and this is our icon however if we were to click on this it doesn't appear to do anything even though we can toggle this between checked and unchecked selected or deselected so we're also going to combine this with set selected icon so check box dot set selected icon and i'm going to use my check icon and then now when we run this we can actually change the image when we select this checkbox alright so that's the basics of creating a simple checkbox in java if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating a check box in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help
