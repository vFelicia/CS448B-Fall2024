hey what's up everybody so in today's video I'm going to show you how we can work with an array of objects in JavaScript what we'll do is create an array of fruit objects we'll create five fruit objects to create an object you need a set of curly braces each object will be comma separated just for my own readability I'm going to place each object on a new line objects can have their own unique properties and methods our first fruit object will have a name name of Apple a color of red and calories meaning calories per serving of 95 this is our first object let's copy these properties paste them for object two change name to be orange color will also be orange calories 45 object three name will be banana color yellow calories 105 object 4 coconut color white calories 159 then our last object will be pineapple color yellow calories 37 all right and here is our array of objects there's a lot we can do with this if you ever need a property within one of these objects of your array you would take the array in this case fruits add an index number dot the name of the property for example name I need the name property of the first object which would be Apple so let's test that console.log what is the name property of our array fruits at index zero that would be apple one is orange two is banana three is is coconut for pineapple let's select a different property let's go with the calories 95 45 105 159 37 that's how to access a property within an array of objects to add a new object you can use the push method let's take our array of fruits use the push method we will push a new object into our array the name will be grapes Color Purple calories 62 then let's console.log rray console.log fruits so we have six Apple orange banana coconut pineapple and grapes uh which I misspelled grap you can use the pop method to remove an element fruits. pop this should remove pineapple Apple orange banana coconut no pineapple or splice splice will remove elements at certain indices fruits. splice let's select indices 1 through two all we're left with is Apple coconut pineapple you can use the four method to Loop through the elements of your array let's display each object's name fruits. for each we need a call back a function expression or an arrow function let's use an arrow function for every fruit do this console.log each fruit this will return entire objects for one of the properties we'll select dot the property name we have have all the fruit names let's go with the colors and the calories there we are there's also the map method the map method will run each element through a function and return a new array let's create an array of fruit names const fruit names equals take our array of fruits use the builtin map method we'll use an arrow function for every fruit Arrow return the fruits name then we will console.log our array of fruit names and here's our array of fruit names let's do this with colors fruit colors return every color property of each fruit then console.log are fruit colors red orange yellow white yellow let's do this with calories fruit calories return each calories property console.log our fruit calories array so the map method will return a new array let's cover filter filter will return a new array after using each element and checking a condition let's return a new array where the color of each fruit is yellow there's two const yellow fruits equals take our array of fruits use the filter method we have one parameter a fruit Arrow then a condition we'll return this fruit if the fruit's color property is strictly equal to Yellow then console.log array of yellow fruit and there's two bananas and pineapples their colors are both yellow let's create a new array of any fruits that are low in calories where the calories are below 100 const low cal fruits take our array of fruits use the builtin filter method for every fruit Arrow check the calories of each fruit is it less than 100 if it is put it within this new array and here we are we have three fruits that are low in calories Apple orange pineapple the calories are 95 45 37 they're all less than 100 let's find any high calorie fruits change our Ray to be high Cal fruits where the calories of each fruit is greater than or equal to 100 console.log Ray of High Cal fruits there are two bananas and coconuts the calories are 105 and 159 let's use the reduce method now I'll admit this is going to be a little tricky but I'll try my best to walk you through it the reduceed method will return a single value in this case an object one of these objects let's return the object with the greatest amount of calories we'll store that within a constant const Max X fruit equals take our array of fruits use the reduce method there's going to be two parameters an accumulator which keeps track of the greatest value during each iteration and the next element but I think we should rename these let's rename our accumulator as Max it's going to be the current record holder of the object with the greatest amount of calories element will be fruit meaning the next fruit here are the two parameters Arrow what are we going to check is our fruit the next fruit in line are the calories greater than our current record holders calories max. calories just for readability I'm going to put this on a new line we're going to use the trary operator is this true does the next fruit have more calories than our record holder if it does will return our fruit meaning the next fruit colon meaning otherwise return the max again let's see if this works let's console. log our fruit with the maximum amount of calories which is our coconut with 159 calories if you just need the calories you would type dot calories that will just give you the calories but in this case we're returning an entire object let's find the fruit with the least amount of calories let's copy our code paste it and make a few changes Min fruit change Max to be Min the condition will be is the calories of the next fruit less than the Cal iies of the minimum record holder then console.log are Min fruit which is our pineapple with 37 calories all right everybody so those are a few ways in which you can work with an array of objects there's a lot you can do with them you can map you can filter you can reduce you can splice you can pop you can push all sorts of things and well that is an example of an array of objects in JavaScript
