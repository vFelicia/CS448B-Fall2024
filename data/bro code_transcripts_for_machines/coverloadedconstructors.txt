all right overloaded constructors by using overloaded constructors this is a technique to create multiple constructors within the same class much like that video on overloaded methods so with overloaded constructors multiple constructors can have the same name but they need a different set of parameters because a method's name plus its parameters equals a unique method signature and each method must have their own unique signature so let's create a class named pizza and there's going to be four fields let's have string bread for the type of bread we would like for our pizza like is it flatbread stuffed crust plain a field for sauce cheese and topping then let's create a constructor public pizza and then we need to set up the parameters string bread string sauce string cheese and string topping and then we'll need to assign these this dot bread equals bread this dot sauce equals sauce this dot cheese equals cheese and this dot topping equals topping all right then let's construct a pizza object pizza let's call this pizza all lower case equals new pizza then we need to pass in something for the bread the sauce the cheese and the topping because we can't construct a pizza object without bread sauce cheese and a topping we need all four in order to construct a pizza object so let's pass in something for the bread let's say i would like a stuffed crust pizza stuffed crust for the sauce let's say red sauce and the cheese what about mozzarella i don't remember how to spell mozzarella mozzarella i'm taking a guess here and a topping pepperoni so we can construct a pizza object just fine right but what if we would like a pizza without any toppings like a plain cheese pizza so i'm going to get rid of that topping well we can't construct a pizza without a topping we need to add something because we only have one constructor set up and we need to pass in something for a topping so one way in which we can solve this problem is to have multiple constructors overloaded constructors we can pass in a varying amount of arguments so if we would like a cheese pizza without any toppings we can use that specific constructor that will construct a plain cheese pizza so let's copy this constructor they can have the same name but they need a different set of parameters so i'm going to remove this topping parameter and we will not assign this.topping equals topping and we can now create a plain cheese pizza and let's do the same thing with i don't know maybe somebody doesn't want cheese on their pizza so pizza with only bread and sauce and then another pizza with only bread i'm not even really sure if it's considered a pizza then maybe it's garlic bread or something but i don't know though we can now create a pizza object that has no toppings no cheese and no sauce so by using overload constructors we can construct objects with varying amounts of fields maybe we would like toppings maybe we don't well we have a choice now so yeah that's overload constructors it's a technique to create multiple constructors with a different set of parameters they can share the same name but you need a different set of parameters because a constructor's name plus its parameters equals a constructor's signature and each constructor needs a unique signature so yeah those are overloaded constructors in c sharp if this video helped you out help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and well yeah those are overloaded constructors in c sharp
