hey y'all everybody so let's talk about tree traversal tree traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes of a tree we don't have random access so we begin at the root node and follow a certain procedure to visit all of the nodes of a tree and there's three that we're going to talk about in order post order and preorder traversal in this example we will be working with a binary tree not a binary search tree because these values are not in binary search tree order so each node has at most two children a left node and a right node let's begin with an inorder traversal here's a recursive method that will navigate a tree in order using recursion we visit as many left nodes as we can followed by the root node and then any right nodes the entry point is always the root and using recursion we will go as far left as we can so we go from a to b to d so we will mark this node as visited then visit the root node next and then the right node since we can't go left anymore we're going to visit the root node a all that's left is to go right so we will go to c however we can go left so we will visit f first then c then g so this is in order traversal when used in the context of a binary search tree we will visit all of these nodes in nondecreasing order so again that was d b e a f c g we go left root right and here's that method again and here's post order traversal it's used to delete a tree from leaf to root and we follow this pattern left right root we will use recursion to visit the left children then the right children then the root so a is our entry point we are going as far left as we can go from a to b to d mark d is visited then we go right using recursion go from d to e then root left right root so we go back up go as far right as we can unless we encounter a left child which we did so we will mark f as visited then g right root left right root and all that's left is the root node so that is post order traversal it's used to delete a tree from leaf to root and lastly we have preorder traversal preorder traversal is used to create a copy of a tree we visit any root nodes first then left then right so we will mark a as visited our entry point then visit the left child and we will continue to go left then go right so we can't go left anymore we're going to go right mark the root as visited then left then right this is used to create a copy of a tree but in order to create a copy of a tree you need to create a root node and a branch node to hold the leaves so again that's root left we're still going left right root left right a b d e c f g that is preorder traversal it's used to create a copy of a tree well okay then everybody that is a few ways in which we can traverse a tree like i said normally we don't have random access so the entry point is the root node and you can either follow an in order post order or preorder traversal depending on what you need to do with this tree so that's tree traversal and computer science if you liked this video please be sure to give it a thumbs up leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
