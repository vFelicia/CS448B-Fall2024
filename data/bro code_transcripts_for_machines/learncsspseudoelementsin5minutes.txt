hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to explain pseudo elements in CSS pseudo elements are keywords added after a selector that are used to style a specific part of an element you have a selector for example H1 then two colons then a pseudo element one you might see is first Dash letter we can add some CSS properties and style the first letter of our H1 element that's the formula selector two colons pseudo element let's begin in this example we will need an H1 element why don't you go ahead and type in the word hello or something I really don't care and we will need a paragraph to generate some text you can type lorem then hit tab and a list let's create an unordered list with an ID of fruit we'll have three list items the first list item will be apple second will be orange third banana let's give each of these list items a unique ID as well ID will be apple Orange then banana all right that is good enough for now let's head to our style sheet we will use the first letter pseudo element to change the first letter in our H1 element we have our selector H1 two colons then a pseudo element first letter is one what would we like to do with the first letter let's set the font size to be 2 em basically that's 200 percent the H and hello is larger now and I will set the font style to be italic that is the first letter pseudo element let's select our paragraph paragraph two colons we can apply CSS properties to the first line of some text first dash line what would we like to do let's change the background color background Dash color I'll pick a yellow color something like that's fine all right so the first line is now a highlighter yellow color if I change the size of the window the first line is still going to have that background color then the selection pseudo class is anything that's currently selected with our Mouse we're selecting our paragraph element two colons then we will use the selection pseudo element anything that's selected with our Mouse normally the text is white and the background is blue let's change that let's set the color to be white well I guess that's the same and the background color to be let's go with the dark grayish color no better yet let's make the color green for the text yeah that's kind of cool so anything that's selected will have a font color that's green and a background color that's dark gray now let's go to our list the list had an ID of fruit then I would like to select any list items with any list item we will use the before pseudo element we can add something before each list item I'll add a check mark Emoji we can do that with the content property then within a set of quotes I can select an emoji so if you're on Windows you can hold the Windows button then semicolon and there's a prompt for an emoji I will find a check mark that looks good now before any list item add a check mark which we have there's also the after pseudo element we have a list item with an ID of Apple after after this selector let's add some content I will add an emoji of an apple Apple there we are let's do this with orange and banana as well Apple Orange banana let's change these emojis Orange then banana those are the before and after pseudo elements before or after some element we can add or change some content now with the list item you can change the marker for an unordered list the default is a bullet point but let's change that with our unordered list of fruit let's select any list items and use the marker pseudo element let's change the marker to be a check mark but I'll delete what we have with the before pseudo element I will also change the color of this check mark to be green pretty cool let's make it a little bit bigger too font size 1.2 em there all right everybody so those are pseudo elements you have a selector two colons then a pseudo element which can add specific CSS properties to that selector and those are a few pseudo elements in CSS
