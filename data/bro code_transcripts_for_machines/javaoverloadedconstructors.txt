hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and i have a special treat for you guys in this video we're going to be using overloaded constructors to bake some pizzas so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm ladies and gentlemen we're going to be discussing overloaded constructors these are multiple constructors within a class with the same name but they have different parameters and that's the key thing to take away from this when you combine a constructor's name plus its parameters it's also known as a signature and if you have constructors with the same name they need to have different parameters because they should all have their own unique signature to best demonstrate this we're going to be baking some pizzas within my same project folder i have a pizza class as well as a class that contains my main method so let's create the constructor for this pizza it's the same name as the class followed by parentheses and then a set of curly braces let's also instantiate an instance of the pizza class create a pizza object so it's the name of the class followed by a unique name for this object i'm going to call this pizza a lowercase equals new pizza parentheses semicolon so we now have a pizza object and let's assemble this pizza and pass in some ingredients as arguments so let's say that in order to bake a pizza we would like a bread a sauce a cheese and a topping so let's declare some of these variables outside of the constructor so we have string bread is it thick crust flatbread whatever a sauce a cheese and a topping i guess all of these variables will be strings for this video but you can mix and match them all right so if we instantiate an instance of the pizza class create a pizza let's assign some of these values that we receive and let's set up the parameters for this pizza constructor so we would like a bread so that would be one parameter a sauce a cheese and a topping now in order to create our pizza we need matching arguments because the parameters are the rules we have to send our pizza four strings and they will serve as the bread the sauce the cheese and the topping so what kinds of ingredients should we use to bake our first pizza let's say we need a bread so let's say this is a thick crust pizza and a sauce tomato i guess a cheese maybe mozzarella i probably spelt that wrong and a topping let's say pepperoni i probably spelt that wrong too but i don't care so we can now construct a pizza object and for this pizza constructor it requires four strings that will serve as a bread a sauce a cheese and a topping and then let's assign these real quick so this dot bread equals the bread that is passed to us as an argument repeat the steps for sauce cheese and topping this dot sauce equal sauce this dot cheese equals cheese and this dot topping equals topping and let's print this pizza system.out.printline let's display a message such as here are the ingredients of your pizza and i'll just print these all on a new line for each system.out.printline pizza dot bread because i want to access the bread variable of our pizza object and we'll access the other stew so we have sauce cheese and a topping so we're passing in four strings here are the ingredients of your pizza it's a thick crust tomato mozzarella pepperoni pizza all right now here's the situation what if we want a plain cheese pizza we don't want any toppings so you know what i'm going to get rid of the pepperoni but wait a second we're going to have a problem we need to pass in four strings and we're only going to be sending in three one way that we can solve this problem is to create overloaded constructors so overloaded constructors they can have the same name but different parameters so what we can do is create another constructor with the same name i'm going to copy all of this paste it so right now these parameters are the same they have these constructors the same name as well as the same parameters so this is not legal because they have the same signature let's create a constructor that doesn't have a topping it's only a bread a sauce and a cheese and we do not need to assign this topping so we can take that out and you can see that that issue went away we can now construct a pizza that has only three ingredients but if we were to attempt to display the topping it just says no but everything works just fine now what if we were to remove the cheese let's say it's a vegan pizza just tomato sauce and bread so we need a constructor that takes two arguments two strings so let's copy one of these constructors paste it and change the parameters so this pizza constructor only takes two arguments a bread and a sauce and it functions just fine and why stop there let's remove the sauce entirely so we can create a pizza that only has bread and that's it so we'll need to create another overloaded constructor that has only one parameter a string value string bread and we will assign this bread equals bread and for some reason if you wanted to create a pizza that only has bread well you can do so here are the ingredients of your pizza thick crust and then you know you can also create a constructor that has no arguments so that's kind of like what we had in the original video on object oriented programming so we have the name of the class with no arguments and no parameters so you could create an object that has no attributes assigned where all the ingredients are empty so a pizza that has nothing will cost you zero dollars and zero cents in real life i guess well everybody that's the basics of overloaded constructors in java if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of overloaded constructors in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
