hey people i have a super quick video for you today on the differences between the continue and break statements so when using either statements within the context of a loop a continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop a break statement will exit out of a loop entirely another place where you see break statements is when used within a switch after each case so here's an example let's say that we would like to count the numbers 1 through 20 but i would like to skip the number 13 because 13 is considered an unlucky number so if i were to write a program like that that would look something like this so let's use a for loop and i will set an index of i equal to one continue this as long as i is less than or equal to 20 and then increment i by one then let's print our index so prince f we're displaying an integer and let's display i i'm just going to add a new line character after each iteration when we use a printf statement okay so this is what this looks like we have the numbers 1 through 20. so if i would like to skip the number 13 i can use a continue statement but we need to check to see if i is equal to 13 we can use an if statement so if i is equal to 13 then we will continue and let's take a look so we have the numbers 1 through 20 but we are missing 13 so a continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop now if this was a break statement this will break out of our loop entirely so once we reach 13 then we will exit out of this loop entirely so here we only have the numbers 1 through 12 and then we break we exit out of the loop so that's a quick demonstration of the differences between continue and break the continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop a break statement exits out of a loop entirely so yeah that's a super quick video on the differences between the continue and break statements if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah those are the major differences between the continue and break statements in c
