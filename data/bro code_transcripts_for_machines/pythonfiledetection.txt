hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be covering some basic file detection using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm welcome ladies and gentlemen to the beginning of a mini series involving doing stuff with files using python and in this video we're going to be doing some basic file detection and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module it's already included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it all we'll be doing is checking to see if a file exists someplace on our computer so we'll probably need a file to work with what i'm going to do is go to my desktop for convenience and just create a new text document i will call this test.txt now i probably need the file location so i'm going to copy that and then we can use this so let's create a variable called path that will include the path to the file that i would like to detect so that was test.txt now if you have backslashes in your file path you'll probably need double backslashes because that's the escape sequence for a backslash within a string so we now have this variable path that we can work with now i would like to check to see if this location exists on my computer so if os dot path dot exists and you can see that we can pass in our path as an argument so i will pass in my path and if this returns true if that location exists i will print that location exists so this will not tell me if this is a file or not we'll be covering that later else let's print that location doesn't exist alright so if this location exists this will return true if not this will execute our else statement that location exists so what if i were to delete this file and we run this program again that location doesn't exist now this won't tell you if the location you're dealing with is a file or not there is a separate function for that it is if os dot path dot is file what we'll do is pass in our path and print that is a file all right so let's create another file because i deleted the previous one test.txt it's in the same location let's run this again that location exists that is a file now what if this was a folder so i'm going to create a new folder i will call this folder i will delete my test document and let's change the location to folder that location exists but it is not a file you can check to see if a location is a directory so let's write an else if statement os dot path dot is directory and we will pass in our path and let's print that is a directory all right so we have our folder we're going to check to see if this location exists and if it's a file or a directory that location exists that is a directory well everyone that is the basics of file detection we'll be building upon this concept in future videos so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of simple file detection using python
