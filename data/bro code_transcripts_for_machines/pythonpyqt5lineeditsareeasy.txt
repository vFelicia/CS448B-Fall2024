why hello everybody today I got to explain line edit widgets in pi qt5 also known as textboxes in pretty much anything ever made ever why are they called line edit widgets I really don't know let's begin from the module of QT widgets we will import the following class of q line edit to create a text box I mean a line edit widget we are accessing our window of self we will call this line edit widget line edit equals call The Constructor of the class q line edit then we will pass in self to add this line edit widget to the window let's set the geometry but we do have a text box in which we can type in stuff I have a method to initialize the user interface within this method I will access self do the line edit widget and set the geometry let's set it in the top left corner where X is 10 Y is 10 set a width 200 is good and a height 40 that's not too bad now the text is really small we can change that by applying a stylesheet access our window with self access access our line edit widget then call the set stylesheet method we can pass in some CSS like properties including a font size let's pick 25 pixels and here's my new text box we can read the text now let's also change the font family font family I will pick aial this text box by itself it really doesn't do anything we need some way to get the text from the text box let's add a button when we click on the button we will get the text from the text box and do something with it cuz right now it doesn't do anything we will need to import Q push button let's create one button self. button equals call The Constructor of the class Q push button let's say that this is a submit button I will pass in a string of submit and we are adding this button to our window and we do need to set the geometry of the button we're not using a layout manager right now access our window with self access our button that we have previously created in our Constructor then call these set geometry method we'll place our button where X is 210 Y is 10 the width will be 100 and the height will be 40 not too bad let's change the font size of the button I'll copy these two lines of code because I'm lazy instead of selecting our line edit widget we will select our button that's better if I were to click on the button it doesn't do anything we'll set up the signal of clicked to connect to a method that will do something let's define a method of submit we're submitting something we're submitting the text within the text box and for now I'll write pass we'll get back to this in a second we're going to take our button self. button we'll connect the signal of clicked clicked. connect method we will connect the method of submit self. submit so when we click on the button we will call this method let's print a test message you clicked the button let's type in something press submit and we get our test message you clicked the button let's get the text from the text box then do something with it let's create a local variable of text text equals now we have to get the text from our line edit widget self. line edit that's the widget to get the text we can use the text method to return the text then let's print the text I'll use an FST string we'll say hello add a placeholder then display the text so now after typing in something why don't you type in your name then press submit we will display hello your name you could add some placeholder text too let's do that here let's take self. line edit widget set placeholder text and let's say enter your name when I run this program we have some placeholder text that says enter your name this time I will type in SpongeBob then press submit hello SpongeBob all right everybody so those are line edit widgets also commonly referred to as text boxes and well everybody those are line edit widgets in pi qt5
