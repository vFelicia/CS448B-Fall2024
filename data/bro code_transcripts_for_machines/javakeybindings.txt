how's it going everybody its bro here hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing at key bindings in Java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright everybody we're gonna be discussing key bindings what this does is that this binds an action to a certain keystroke so for example let's say that within certain games you might be able to move your character forward by clicking the W button or a for left s for down or D for right so this is very similar to key listeners but there's a few subtle differences so with key bindings they actually don't require you to click a component to give it focus and all swing components at least all swing components that I know of actually are capable of using key bindings and the reason that you might want to use key bindings over key listeners is that they give you more flexibility and you can actually assign different keystrokes to individual swing components so let's say that you have player 1 and player 2 you could have player 1 have a certain set of keys on the keyboard and player 2 could have a different set although one downside to using key bindings over key listeners is that they tend to be more difficult to utilize and set up but I'll give you guys just a quick demonstration of how these could be useful so if you're ready let's begin I'm going to create a new class within my project folder so file new class I'll call this maybe just game not any specific game just a game and then let's create an instance of this class so game game equals new game then let's create the constructor for this game okay so we can actually bind actions to keystrokes so if we want to create an action we can actually create an inner class for a specific action so we're going to create an action for an up action down action left action and right action so I'll make this public this will be a class not a method and we'll call this up action and it's going to extend abstract action so we need an action performed method within here so add unimplemented methods and then we're going to create a separate class for down left and right so we have left action let's add up down action as well maybe right here so up down left as well as right so let's head back to the top before our constructor we can actually create an action object so it's going to look like this action is the data type and we can list a specific action like up action this is an instance and then action down action action left action and action right action so there'll be more on this in just a moment let's just create the frame so let's declare AJ frame called frame as well as a label we'll be able to control the movement of this label so J label and we'll call this label then we'll need to import this and I'm just going to import everything related to Java X dot swing and AWT dot event so we don't have to worry about those okay let's begin by setting up the frame so frame equals new J frame let's call this key binding demo although it's not necessary and then frame dot set default close operation J frame exit on close let's set aside so frame dot set size for 20 by 40 is a decentsize and then I do not want to use a layout manager so set layout no and then at the end let's set the visibility for the supreme to true set visible true then let's create our jlabel so let's instantiate this instance label equals nu J label let's set a background color label dot set background how about red color dot red let's set the bounced label dot set bounce these are the coordinates let's place this where X is 100 y is 100 the width will be 100 and the height will be 100 so it's going to be a square and we need to set opaque true and then add this label to our frame frame dot add label let's run this and take a look okay here is our label what we're going to be doing is actually binding some keystrokes to these specific actions and we'll have this label either move up down left or right what we've done previously is that we declared these actions but we need to finish instantiating them so let's do that within our constructor and I'll just do this after our label so we need to instantiate the up action down action left action as well as the right action so up action equals new up action then let's do the same thing for down left and right so down action equals new down action left action equals new left action and then right action equals new right action now let's head back to each of these inter classes and let's begin with the actionperformed method within each of these inner classes let's begin with up action so when the up action occurs what we'll do is set a new location for our label so it's going to appear to move so one easy way to do that is to take our label and use the set location method and we can give a pair of coordinates as arguments so we can actually get the current location get X and then label dot get Y and if we want to move up we can just say label dot get Y minus 10 so that will move this label up by 10 pixels let's do the same thing for down left and right so this will stay the same label dot set location we'll keep X the same as it is however label dot get Y we'll want to increase by maybe 10 pixels to keep it consistent and let's repeat the process for left action as well as right action so we're actually going to keep Y the same for this but we're going to either increase or decrease our xcoordinate so if we're moving left let's decrease X by 10 and then for right action we will increase X by 10 and that is it for all of these inter classes let's head back to our constructor now with Swing components in Java each component is able to have its own unique mapping of key events to actions so let's take our label for example this is a swing component so it's a candidate so if we want to associate some keystrokes with events these are the steps type in the name of the component that you want to use so in our example it's label and first we're going to use the get input map method and then after we're going to map and chain so dot put and put has two arguments within here a keystroke as well as an action map key so let's associate yup keystroke with moving our character up so within this argument we're going to type key stroke dot get key stroke and then a key character so let's say up and these are the arrows on your keyboard not wsad but we'll try that next and now we need an action map key name and honestly it doesn't really matter what you call this just name it something memorable because we're only going to use this once in the next line of code so I'll call this up action and that's it for this line now step two is we're going to get action map so type the name the component so label dot get action map and then method chain by adding dot put and this has a key as well as an action so this key is going to be whatever this is in the first line our up action and then we need an action so one of these so let's take our up action and that's it so when we click up on our pad on our arrows on our keyboard it's going to trigger this action performed method it's going to move our label up by 10 pixels on the yaxis so let's do the same thing for down left and right so we just need to change up to down and let's change this here as well changing these are easy to forget about so down down down then two more so this is going to be a left and then right and that's it let's run this okay so using the arrow keys I'm clicking updown leftright although you can't really see it but I guess we'll just have to believe me now let's change these two different keys let's associate the up action with the W key so since this is a single character make sure that these are within single quotes so W / up s / down left will be a and right will be D and let's try this again so W s a D we are good alright so that's the basics of key bindings there's still a lot more you can do with key bindings so I might make a second video in the future no promises though yeah if you want a copy of all this code I'll post all of this in the comments down below and that's the basics of key bindings in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
