hey everybody today I'm going to explain the spread operator in JavaScript the spread operator is represented by three dots the spread operator allows an iterable such as an array or string to be expanded in separate elements what this does is unpack the elements here's an example let's create an array of numbers pick some numbers I'll just pick 1 through five 1 2 3 4 5 then just to test this let's console.log my array numbers in this array what if I would like to find the greatest value well one way in which I could do that is let's declare a maximum let maximum this is going to be a variable equals I will use the max method of math what would happen if I place our array within this method then I will display our maximum so we have not a number using the max method we can't place an array directly within this method however by utilizing the spread operator we can spread this array into different elements so we will preedee this array with the spread operator we are going to unpack the elements now if I run this program again we have our result of five when you use the spread operator imagine that you're opening a box and taking out all the contents inside like you're unpacking something let's find the minimum this time let minimum equals math.min we will pass our array of numbers then use the spread operator to spread our array into different elements what is the minimum value from this array that would be one you can also do this with strings too you can separate a string into different characters let let's create a username equals type your name first name and last name I will create an array name named letters letters equals we'll create a new array let's take our username it's a string and use the spread operator then I will display our letters console.log letters and here's my name divided into different characters what we have is an array of characters with my array of characters I can join them back together and insert characters between each element I will meth chain the join method after our array we'll add a dash between each character so now my username is all one string but there's a dash between each character okay now this time we're going to create an array of fruits we'll make a shallow copy of an array using the spread operator add some fruit I'll add an apple an orange and a banana then I will console dolog my fruits I can create a shallow copy of this array using the spread operator a shallow copy means it's a different data structure but it contains identical values I'll create a copy of fruits named new fruits equals an array let's take our fruits array then use the spread operator let's display new fruits and it should be an identical copy yep there's no apparent change we have two different arrays but they contain identical elements we can combine two or more arrays using the spread operator let's create an array of vegetables let's add some carrots celery potatoes I'll rename new fruits as Foods let's add our array of fruits we're spreading it comma then we will spread our vegetables array then we will display our array Foods this array contains all of the elements from these two arrays fruits and vegetables we can use the spread operator to combine arrays we even have the capability to append separate elements along with unpacking these arrays I will also add eggs and milk we have all of the elements from our two arrays plus a few extras eggs and milk all right everybody so that's the spread operator it's three dots it allows an iterable such as an array or string to be expanded into separate elements and well everybody that is the spread operator in JavaScript
