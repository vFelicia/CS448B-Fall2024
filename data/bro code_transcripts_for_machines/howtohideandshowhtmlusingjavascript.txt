hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can show and hide an HTML element using JavaScript in this video you'll need an image to work with once you find your image add it to your website folder then we are ready to begin we're going to create a button and an image element let's start with the button the text on the button will be initially hide to hide an element I will give this button a unique ID of my button I'll add a break then we'll create an image element this is a selfclosing tag with this image I will set the source equal to either the relative file path or the file name so my file is car.jpg it's a little too big I'll set the width attribute to be like 400 pixels that's a decent size I will give this image a unique ID of my image my IMG and just so we can see this button I'm going to apply a little bit of CSS to the button let's select the ID of my button take the font size I will set it to be 2 RM that's decent enough all right let's go to our Javascript file I'm going to create a reference to my button and my image let's start with the button const my button equals document. getet element by ID the ID that I'm selecting is my button let's create a reference to my image as well my IMG the ID was my IMG when I click on this button I would like to do something we will take my button and add an event listener add event listener there are two arguments an event type and a call back to a function the event type is going to be click when we click on the button we're going to do something for the Callback we'll write an arrow function we are provided with an event parameter by the web browser Arrow do this when we click on the button what code do we want to perform we're going to take my image access its style access its display property set it to be a string of none so when you click on the button it's going to hide the image the display property is set to none not only that let's change the text on the button after we hide the element let's take my button change the text content equal to be show because now I want to show the element so hide BEC show when we click on the button a second time nothing nothing happens we would like to toggle between hiding and displaying this element we'll write an if statement let's check to see if the display of my image is strictly equal to none is the display of my image currently none if so we're going to set the display to block because it's a block level element take my image access its style access its display property set it to be BL then within an lse statement place these two lines of code and we will change the text content of my button to be hide now when clicking the button we can toggle between hiding and showing this element the image now let me demonstrate something if we were to take my button then add it after the image here's what would happen let me add a break to so by setting the display To None we don't Reserve any space for that image my button moves up near the top of the window until I show it again another option if we would like to reserve some space for the image is to toggle the visibility not the display property replace display with visibility we're going to check if the visibility is hidden set the visibility equal to be hidden if we would like to show the image the visibility is going to be set to visible when we toggle the visibility of this image we at least reserve the space for it the elements that come after aren't going to shift near the top of the window you can use visibility or display depending on the project you're creating all right everybody so that is how to show and hide HTML elements using JavaScript
