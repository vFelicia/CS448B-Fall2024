hey what's going on everybody to bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the abstract keyword in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right let's talk about the abstract keyword so this is a keyword that can be applied to both classes and methods when you define them let's begin with abstract classes an abstract class cannot be instantiated but they can have a subclass that can be and here's an example i have two additional classes a class called vehicle and a class called car that extends vehicle so car is the subclass also known as the child class of the vehicle class and we can create objects from both of these classes and let's try that so first let's create a car car car equals new car and let's also create a vehicle object because we can so vehicle vehicle equals new vehicle so we can create instances of both of these classes just fine but we may not want to be able to do so so adding the abstract keyword to a class adds a layer of security so here's an example let's pretend that we walk into a car dealership and we ask a salesperson for a vehicle and they might reply with well what kind of vehicle are you looking for are you looking for a car a motorcycle a truck and we just say no we want a plane generic vehicle and they might think you're crazy because a vehicle is too generic it's an idea it's abstract well at least it should be abstract we need a certain type of vehicle so what we could do to prevent somebody from creating an instance of a class that is too vague or abstract we can use the abstract modifier when we declare this class so with vehicles let's add the abstract modifier and we can no longer create an instance of this class and it says cannot instantiate the type vehicle so this adds a layer of security to this program so in order to get this to run we cannot declare a vehicle object we have to pick a certain type of vehicle a child class of the vehicle class whether it's a car a bike a truck whatever now we can also create an abstract method too so let's declare this within the vehicle class and an abstract method is declared without an implementation so that means without a body so let's say that all vehicles should have a method to go because that's the point of a vehicle so all vehicles should go this is going to be an abstract method we're going to use the abstract keyword we need a return type we'll just make this void and this will be go and we do not need a body for this method and if we attempt to add a body a set of curly braces well we're going to have a problem and this says abstract methods do not specify a body so what this does is that it forces us to implement this method in one of the child classes that our vehicle class has so if we attempt to run this actually you can see that it's popping up already the type car must implement the inherited abstract method vehicle.go so what we could do is add unimplemented methods and what we're doing is actually method overriding so we can add our own implementation of this go method more specifically for cars so let's say maybe the driver is driving the car and that should be fine so we can no longer create an instance of the vehicle class because it's abstract and a vehicle object is too vague so we would like to force a user to pick a certain type of vehicle a class that inherits from the vehicle class and we can also use the go method that is found within the vehicle class too but we are forced to override it or implement it in each of the child classes that our vehicle might have and it's just the same as what we would normally do with calling a method so car dot go and this will print the driver is driving the car so that's the whole point of the abstract keyword it adds a layer of security to your program and this can be applied to both classes and methods if it's applied to a class a user cannot instantiate an instance of an abstract class and with abstract methods they are declared without an implementation but a subclass or child class has to implement that somewhere well that's the basics of the abstract keyword if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the abstract keyword in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
