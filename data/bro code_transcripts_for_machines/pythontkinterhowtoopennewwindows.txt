hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys a few different ways in which we can create new windows using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running let's get started everybody so we're going to create a window and we'll add a button to this window when we click on this button it'll create a new separate window for us so window equals tk followed by window.mainloop we'll need to add a button so let's do that button we're adding this to the window let's add some text to the button let's say create new window and we'll set a command command equals and we'll need to define a function let's create a function called create underscore window and let's pack this as well so we will define this function create window and let's do so at the top def create window and what do we want this to do well we're going to create a new window and let's call this next window new underscore window equals and there's two popular ways of creating a window one is we can use tk and the other is that we can use something called top level and let me explain the difference between the two here's a definition for a top level window this is a new window on top of other windows and it's usually linked to a bottom window our main window is serving as the bottom window and our new window is serving as the top window the top level window so let's try this and just experiment here is our main window the bottom window and if we were to click on this button it's going to create a new window for us a new top level window if we were to close out of the bottom level window any top level windows associated with this would also close kind of like what you just saw now however it's not the same case the other way around if we have a bottom window and a top level window and we close out of the top level window our bottom level window is just fine it didn't close out of that so think of these like jenga pieces if you were to pull one of the pieces one of the windows out from underneath the bottom any pieces or windows on the top of it will close out as well or collapse kind of like in the game jenga so that's one way to think of top level windows they're stacked on top of any bottom level windows if you remove a bottom piece it removes any from the top on the flip side we have tk this is a new independent window and we've actually been doing this since day one of our gui programming tk is a new independent window and our main window and the new window that we create are not linked whatsoever they're completely independent so if we were to create a new window this is our new window and close out of our old window well this new window still persists so this could be useful for let's say a login form or a login screen after you log in you'll be brought to your main program which could be within the new window one other thing that you can do too you can also destroy the old window after creating a new window so we need to type in the name of the window that we want to destroy actually let's call the main window just old underscore window just to clarify things so let's rename that here here and here as well so we want to destroy our old window as if we're closing out of it so we type in the name of the window old underscore window and we use the destroy function and that sounds pretty sweet so we're going to destroy our old window after creating our new window so let me add a comment that this will close out of old window and let's test it so we have our old window our main window will create a new window it creates our new window and then closes out of the old window so that's one of the few ways in which you can create a new window for your program so if you want to copy all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to create a new window using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
