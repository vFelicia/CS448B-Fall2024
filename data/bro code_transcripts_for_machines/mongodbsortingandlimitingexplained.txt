all right everybody today I'm going to show you how we can both sort and limit documents in mongodb to return all documents we can type DB the name of the collection dot then we can use the find method to return all documents to sort these documents in some sort of order again we would type DB the name of the collection students dot find method then we'll do some method chaining after the find method add dot then we will call the sort method the sort method takes a document by which field would we like to sort let's sort names in alphabetical order we would type the name of the field Name colon then one for alphabetical order or negative one for reverse alphabetical order so if we were to sort by alphabetical order here's the results we have Gary then Larry Patrick Sandy SpongeBob then reverse alphabetical order that was Name colon negative one now we have SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's sort our documents by GPA grade point average so again we use the find method then we'll method chain the sort method we're passing in a document object with our criteria we will sort by GPA in ascending order so we will use one I'm going to copy this because I'm going to use it later okay now we're sorting by GPA Patrick has the lowest GPA 1.5 2.5 2.8 3.2 then 4. to sort our GPA by deciding order we would type GPA negative one then we have Sandy at the top with the gpf4 then SpongeBob with 3.2 2.8 2.5 1.5 now we have the limit method we can limit the amount of documents that are returned to us let's type DB dot students dot find method dot limit method we will pass the number of documents we would like return to us as an argument if I would like one document returned to us I will pass in one currently my documents are sorted by object ID this would give us the first document of SpongeBob if I were to use limit 3 we would be returned three documents SpongeBob Patrick Sandy we can combine both the sort and the limit methods too I would like to return the student with the highest GPA we'll use the find method then method chain the sort method we are sorting by GPA we're going to sort in decreasing order so negative one followed by the limit method I would like just one document who has the highest GPA that would be Sandy with a GPA of four who has the lowest GPA we should sort an increasing order that would be one then limit one so Patrick has the lowest GPA of 1.5 now let's work with sorting and limiting Encompass to sort the documents in your collection you can press more options then add some sort criteria I will sort by name colon one then find so we have Gary Larry Patrick Sandy SpongeBob then negative one for reverse alphabetical order SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's sort by GPA GPA negative one that would give us decreasing order so Sandy's at the top to limit the amount of documents that are returned you can enter in a number for the limit box I will limit the records to one so we are returned with Sandy she has the highest GPA limit three would give us the top three students or leave limit MTU to return all documents all right everybody so that is basic sorting and limiting in mongodb
