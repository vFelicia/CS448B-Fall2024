how's it going everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys a few useful methods of the math class and at the end of this video we're going to create a program where we will find the hypotenuse of a triangle so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm alrighty then guys and gals in this video i'm going to demonstrate a few useful methods of the math class to begin we'll need maybe two numbers let's say that these will be double variables double x let's set the sequel to 3.14 and double y we will set this to let's say negative 10. all right the first useful method is the max method this will find the larger of two numbers so in order to use the max method we're going to type math with a capital m dot and there's a few recommendations here what we would like is the max method that is right here so there's a few to choose from we can compare two integers two long values two floats and two doubles i'm going to compare the values of x and y so i'm going to put these within the parentheses of my max method and then we can either display the result or assign this to a new variable let's say double z equals math.max and we'll compare x and y and assign the larger number to variable z and we will display the result system.out.printline z and the larger of these two numbers is in fact x which is 3.14 and there is also a min method which will find the lesser of two values which is variable y which is negative 10. another useful method is the absolute function method it's just abs like abs sixpack abs and we'll pass in y and this will display the absolute value of y which is 10. so the absolute value is basically a number without the negative sign i'm not a mathematician so i could be wrong in that definition all right we also have the square root function that is sqrt square root of y i don't know what the square root of negative 10 is but we're about to find out uh i don't know i guess that didn't work let's change y to 10. 3.16 blah blah blah blah all right that is the square root function we can also round let's round x so x rounded is 3.0 on the other hand seal like ceiling this will always round up so 3.4 or 3.14 always rounded up is four and floor will always round down so 3.14 always rounded down is 3.0 here's a project that we can work on let's create a program that will find the hypotenuse of a triangle and we will ask the user for side x and side y so to begin let's declare two variables double x and double y actually i take that back let's declare double z as well because z will be the result the hypotenuse we'll also need a scanner to accept some user input scanner scanner equals new scanner within the parentheses we're going to type system.in we'll need an import so include this import at the top import java.util.scanner we'll need a prompt for side x and side y we can do that with a print line statement enter side x i can't type today and we will store the result within variable x x equals we need some user input scanner dot next double because we would like a double value let's repeat the process for side y enter side y will store the result within variable y now here's the tricky part there is a mathematical formula to calculate the hypotenuse given two angles well two sides of a triangle so this is what we're going to do first we'll multiply x times x plus y times y then we need to put this within the square root function of the math class math make sure it's with a capital m dot sqrt and we are going to take all of this and place this within the square root function and we will assign this to our variable of z so z equals math dot square root x times x plus y times y and with a print line statement we can display the hypotenuse is plus z that should be good oh then it's good practice to close your scanner i always forget to do that although it's not necessary scanner.close all right let's test this enter side x that is four enter side y let's say five the hypotenuse is six point four add some change all right so that's just a simple program that you can make using a function of the math class so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's a few useful methods of the math class oh and i forgot to tell you guys like comment and subscribe that is all
