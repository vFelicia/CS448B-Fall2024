all right guys we are on nested loops a nested loop is just a loop that's inside of another loop it doesn't matter what kind of loop you're working with it can be a while loop or a forward loop or whatever here's an example we'll create a loop to count the numbers 1 through 10. we'll count to 10 three times so let's create a basic loop for now and i i'll set this equal to b 1 the condition will be i is less than or equal to 10 then i will increment i by one during each iteration i will display whatever i is then i'll add a space there this loop will count up to 10 just like that so now i would like to count up to 10 three times well i can stick this loop in another loop so let's create the outer loop four and i i'll set this equal to be one i'll continue this as long as i is less than or equal to three then increment i by one so i'm going to take this loop and stick it within the curly braces of the outer for loop however you don't want these loops to have the same index a common naming convention for the inner loop is to use j as the counting index j j j j okay let's take a look okay now we count up to 10 three times but what i think i'm gonna do is that every time we exit the for loop the inner for loop i'll just print a new line character standard output new line yeah that's much better so yeah a nested loop is just a loop inside of another loop just as a practice project let's create a program that will print a rectangle made out of symbols we'll let a user specify how many rows and columns we'll use our nested loop that we created previously so we have int rows int columns then char symbol we're going gonna ask for some user input we'll need some prompts standard output how many rows standard input rows let's copy this paste it change rows to columns then enter a symbol to use standard input symbol we'll continue printing rows as long as i is less than or equal to rows whatever we typed in we don't want any more rows than what the user wants the inner loop is going to be in charge of the columns j is less than or equal to columns in place of printing j let's print our symbol whatever the user picked and we do not need to separate these with any spaces all right let's try this how many rows what about three rows then six columns enter a symbol to use what about the at sign and there's our rectangle there's three rows and six columns let's try it one last time how about four rows and five columns i'll use a dollar sign okay we have four rows one two three four five columns one two three four five so yeah everybody that's a nested loop it's a loop that's inside of another loop when you'll use these it really depends on the situation i thought this would be a fun practice project if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah those are nested loops in c plus
