hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can send data between controllers in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right ladies and gentlemen let me give you a tour of what i've set up currently i have my main java file i have two fxml files named scene 1 and scene 2. i have a controller dedicated to each scene i have a scene 1 controller and a scene 2 controller what this program does currently is that i have a label a text box and a button what i would like to do is type in my username and then submit it and pass this information along to the next scene and display hello plus whatever your username is kind of like a welcome screen so here's how we can do that oh and i forgot to mention the name of this text field that i have set has an id of name text field but you can change it to whatever you like and this button to change scenes has an id of login button and it's linked to an action of login so when i click this button it will call the login method within my scene 1 controller and within scene 2 i have a single label with an id of name label but like i said before you can name these whatever you want within my scene 1 controller i'm reusing some code from the last video on switching scenes except i have a method that is named login when i click that login button we will call this login method however we actually do not need this line of code let's switch to the scene 2 controller there's just a few things that we need to fill in within this class so let's create a label that is named name label whatever you called your label within cn2 name label and i will inject my fxml document by adding that annotation so let's get these imports i'm missing a semicolon and there will be one method set within this class and let's call it display name this will be a public method named display name that will accept one argument string username and when we call this method we'll take our name label set the text equal to i'll say hello plus user name and that is it for this class for the scene 2 controller we'll be handling everything else within our scene 1 controller so let's head back to our scene one controller and we'll need to declare a few things within this class so at the top let's declare the name text field of scene one uh so that would be this that's that text box so within scene 1 let's declare a text field and we will inject our fxml now when we click on that login button to call the login method the first thing that we should do before we switch scenes is to get the text found within the name text field so we would like to extract that so i will declare a string and we will call this username string username equals name text field dot get text so this will store the text found within our text field into a string variable that we can reuse now the second step is that we're going to create an fxml loader instance so let's declare fxml loader and i will call this loader equals new fxml loader then within a set of parenthesis get class get resource and the resource name will be scene2.fxml looks good okay and the next line here we'll set our root node equal to loader dot and use the load method lastly there's just two more lines we're going to create an instance of our scene 2 controller scene 2 controller and i will name this instance scene to controller equals loader dot get controller okay and the last thing that we need to do since we're creating an instance of our scene 2 controller we have access to any methods within this class so all we need to do is to call this display name method so let's type the name of our instance and use the display name method and we will pass in our username as an argument and then when we call that method all we're doing is setting the text equal to the username that is passed in so this should work now let's verify that all right enter your username i'm just going to say bro and click login hello bro well everyone that's how to pass some information between controllers basically what we did is that we created an fxml loader instance and we set the resource equal to our intended scene that we would like to pass information to and then we created an instance of our scene 2 controller within our scene 1 controller we used one of the methods found within our scene 2 controller and lastly we changed the scene from scene 1 to scene 2 via these lines from the previous video on switching scenes so that's how to send data between controllers if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this code to the comments section down below but yeah that's how to send data between controllers and javafx hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like
