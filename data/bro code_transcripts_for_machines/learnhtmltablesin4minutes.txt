hey everybody today I'm going to show you how we can create a table using HTML let's create a table of store hours for a fictional business I'll create a title using H3 header tags the title will be store hours what are the hours of operation for our store to create a table we need a pair of table tags for the first row we need a pair of TR tags meaning table row so the first row is going to be filled with table headers how many columns do we have well if we have a table of store hours they're seven days in a week we will need seven pairs of table header tags so let's copy and paste these tags six additional times for a total of seven one two three four five six seven all right now for the First Column the header will be Sunday we have Sunday then Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday so here's my first row the first row is your table headers add one header for each column in your table for another row we need another pair of TR tags meaning table row so for my second row I'll include table data we need TD tags so we'll need a total of seven on Sunday our fictional store is going to be closed I'll type closed as we can see that this data is underneath this header for the second row Monday the hours will be nine to five let's apply that for the other days besides Saturday Monday through Friday the store is open between nine to five Saturday will be reduced hours ten to two alright not too bad to align the table data what you're going to do is within the table row take the Align attribute set this to Center or otherwise if you would like to write justify it you would type right but let's stick with Center let's align the first row as well we can also add a border within the opening table tag set border equal to zero that's for no border then increase the number depending on the thickness that you want so one will give us a border that is this thick two and three let's stick with one let me move this a little these table cells aren't exactly the same size the word Wednesday has a lot of characters within each of these header tags I will set the width to be maybe 100. this column is a little bit larger now let's copy the width and make each header have a width of 100. okay this table is All Uniform now but if we were to shrink this window the cells would be compressed okay let's change the background color let's begin with the table I will set the style attribute to be a CSS property let's set the background Dash color to be black the whole table is black now so let's change the color for the headers and I'm just going to copy this style attribute let's change the first row to have a color of light blue we can at least see the text now and then for the second row let's pick a different color I think this color would be good Alice blue yeah that's not too bad if you need additional rows for your table use another set of TR tags meaning table row then you can add another set of data alright everybody that is how to create a table using HTML
