hey everybody let's talk about arrays an array is a data structure that can store many values of the same data type here's an example let's say i have a variable named price and i have the price of maybe one item in a fictional store of ours so by using an array we can actually store more than one value but it has to be of the same data type so i can turn this variable price into an array and i can do that by following the name of the variable and add a set of straight brackets and then any values i would like to add to this array i will surround with a set of curly braces and there we go we have turned our variable price into an array but i'm going to change the name to prices because i think it would be more descriptive because we can store more than one value now so we can add multiple values each separated with a comma so let's say we have another price that is 10. 15 25 and maybe 20. now you may have noticed some parallels when we create a string it's really an array of characters so if i need a name we would say the data type is char and we will create a name array followed by a set of square brackets and i will set this equal to some amount of characters a string is really just an array of individual characters and with my name here i have three individual elements three individual values now if i need to access one of these values i need to use an index number so let's print one of these numbers so printf i'm going to use the format specifier for a double and i'm going to list my array name prices then follow this with a set of straight brackets then i need an index number so each spot within an array is known as an element so we have five elements within our array and to access one of these elements i need to list an index number the first element has an index number of zero because computers always start with zero so if i display prices at index zero this contains the number five i'm actually going to format this let's display it two digits after the decimal and i'll precede this number with a dollar sign much better all right so then if i display prices at index one that is technically our second number of ten dollars so prices at index two is fifteen three is twenty five and four which is our last element is 20. so arrays they have a fixed size we can't change the size after we compile and run our program another thing that you can do too if you do not know what values you would like to initialize your array with you can always just set a size let's say i would like a size of five elements but then i'll assign some values later so later on in our program we can say prices at whatever index let's say index zero i'm going to assign with five and i'll do the same thing for the other elements so prices at index one is maybe ten prices at index two is fifteen three will be 25 and 4 will be 20. that's another way in which you can initialize an array you can always set a size and then add elements later another option is that you could combine the two we could set a size right away so maybe prices will have a size of 10 and we can right off the bat assign some values right away so we have five elements that are currently filled but then the other five are empty so there's a few different ways in which you can initialize an array so yeah that's basically an array it's a data structure that can store many values of the same data type initializing an array is much like creating a variable except you will add a set of straight brackets after and then you can either add some values right away or later on in your program but you need to list an index number of where you're placing a value within the array and then to access a value within your array you type the array name followed by an index number kind of like a parking spot number so yeah those are arrays in the next video i'm going to show you how we can iterate over the elements in an array using a for loop if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's an introduction to arrays in c
