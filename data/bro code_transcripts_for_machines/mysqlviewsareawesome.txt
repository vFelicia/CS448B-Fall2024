hey everybody today I'm going to be explaining views views their virtual tables they're not real they're made up of fields and columns from one or more real tables and they can be interacted with as if they were a real table so here's an example I'm going to select all from my employees table our boss Mr Krabs he would like us to create an employee attendance sheet made up of just the first and last names of all the employees well I could create a view that is made from the first and last name Columns of the employees table now A View isn't a real table but it can behave as if it were I may want to create a view of the employee first and last names instead of another table because we try not to repeat data if we don't have to if I had two tables one of employees and another of employee attendance if I need to remove an employee I would need to do so in two places with the view it's always up to date any changes to one or more of these real tables will also update the view so let's create a view of the first and last name of our employees table to create a view you would type create view then the name of the view let's say employee attendance than as I'm going to zoom in a little bit what would we like to select let's select first name last name from a real table let's say from employees so everything was successful let's refresh our schemas window underneath the views category we have a new view employee attendance I'm going to select all from that view name employee attendance and let's see what we got yeah here's our attendance sheet we have the first and last name columns from the employees table this view can be interacted with as if it were a real table I will add order by last name ascending you can use keywords and operators that we've learned about in previous lessons on A View to drop a view you would type drop view the name of The View employee attendance and it's gone all right here's another example so views they're always up to date right let's create a view of customer emails select all from customers let's take a look to see what we have so far I'm going to add one more column a column of customer emails alter table customers add column email data type will be varchar I think varchar 50 should be enough space and there's our new column let's update these rows update customers set email equal to the first email will be for Fred fish f isch gmail.com then we'll need a where Clause where customer ID equals one that's our first email customer ID 2 will be L Lobster gmail.com three is be bass gmail.com four will be puff gmail.com everybody really likes Gmail I guess let's create a view from these customer emails create View customer emails as what are we selecting let's select the email column from our customers table let's refresh our schemas window yeah we have a customer emails View then I will select all from customer emails and look at that we have a listing of all the customer emails and we're going to spam these people with coupons or something I don't know when you update one or more of the real tables in your database those views would reflect any changes let's add one more customer so let's take a look at our customers table select all from customers let's add one more customer insert into our customers table some values we have five columns a customer ID first name first name will be pearl last name is crabs referral ID let's say null email will be P crabs gmail.com okay there's our new customer let's take a look at our view let's see if it updated select all from customer emails yeah look at that it's up to date that is one of the benefits of a view it will update automatically because we're using components from real tables any views that use that data will also be updated the other benefit of a view is that we don't have to repeat data in a real table ideally we'd only want to make a change in one place rather than across multiple tables alright that's a view everybody a view is a virtual table based on the results of an SQL statement they're not real tables but they can be interacted with as if they were real the fields found within a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database so yeah those are views in MySQL
