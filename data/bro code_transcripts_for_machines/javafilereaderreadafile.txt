hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use the file reader class to read the contents of a file so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay guys and gals let's discuss the file reader class the file reader class allows us to read the contents of a file as a stream of characters one by one and when we use the read method it's going to return an integer value which contains the byte value of whatever character we're currently reading and we can easily cast that as a character value so let's create an instance of the file reader class file reader let's call this reader for short equals new file reader and we're going to need an import as well so let's include that import java.io.file reader within the constructor of the file reader we're going to list the file name or the file path i'm going to create a text file called art.txt i'm going to read and display some ascii art today and we'll also need to surround this with a try and catch block because this is considered dangerous code my next step is that i need to create a txt file called art what i'm going to do just to make this easy is create this on my desktop and then copy and paste it over to my project folder so this is going to be called art and just to verify the details i'm going to go to properties take a look at the name art and it's a txt file so we should be good so i'm going to paste some ascii art from the internet if you don't want to do so you can just write some lines of text for this example maybe a poem roses are red violets are blue but instead i want to have some fun with this and find some art to use this looks like a decent website to get some ascii art ascii art archive find a piece that you like i'm going to copy this one paste it within my file and then save it then i'm going to take this file and paste it within my project folder our next step is to use the read method of our file reader to read the first character of our file this is going to return an integer value which contains the byte value of that first character so we can store this integer value within a variable so let's create an integer variable called maybe data and data equals reader dot read all right we'll need an additional clause to our try and catch blocks so we would like to handle any io exceptions that happen then we should be good so we're going to read the first character within our file but we would like to continue reading but if our read method returns negative one that means there is no more data to be read that is the end of the file so we would like to continue reading as long as our read method does not return negative one what we would like to do is continue reading this file as long as the value returned does not equal negative one and we can accomplish that with a while loop while our data does not equal negative one if it is negative one that means there is no more data to be read so let's print to the console window our data but we'll need to cast this as a character value so make sure you use print and not print line because if you do it's going to print a new line after each individual character and then we would like to read the next character so let's copy what we have here and paste it data equals reader.read then lastly outside of the while loop let's close our reader so reader.close and then when we run this it will display the contents of our file the ascii art that i posted or if you have something else it will display that so that's the basics of the file reader class if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the file reader class in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
