hey everyone we're going to be learning about icons in this video so let's get into it before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm everyone so for this lesson this is going to serve as a mini bonus video on how to add icons to a webpage now there's a few ways that you can do this this is what I do I tend use this website called font awesome and here's the URL I'll also post this in the description if you want to copy this or feel free to pause the video so you can actually use a lot of icons from this website there's a free version and there's also a pro version which you have to pay for but since I don't like to pay for things I like to use the free version now with these icons you can either download these otherwise you can link an external style sheet that has all of these icons then so I'll include this link in the description otherwise you can pause the video and copy this down but once you have this link in the head of your HTML file you're good to go then let's say that we want to include some sort of a home icon so we can do a search for that in a gallery here so let's look up home and see what we find this will be fine now in order to use this icon you'll want to be sure to include this eye tag and I'll just copy this and paste it here so there's one trick though if you're using the free version you want to be sure that you're typing in FA space FA and the name of the icon so here it says FA s space FA home we'll just want to be sure to take that s out other versions might have other letters here so let's save this and test it yep here is our home icon now we can actually use a larger version of this icon so after this class name what we're going to type here is FA and how many times we want to basically expand this which version do we want let's say we want the version that is two times larger we're going to place 2x here so now we get a larger version of this icon but I think I'll stick with 4x for this demonstration and this is a suitable size I would say I'll include just a few other icons you can always search for some icons that you might like within the gallery so there's one for YouTube which I'm going to include so I'm going to change home to YouTube and there's also one for Twitter so I'm going to change home to Twitter and we're using the Forex version so let's save reload the page and here are a few icons and with these icons you can individually style these using CSS so let's say we want to change the color of our YouTube icon so what we'll do is target our YouTube class that was dot FA YouTube and we will say we want this to be red and let's do the same thing for Twitter but a different color so FA Twitter and we want this color to be 1 D a1 F I didn't remember that I had to look it up so let's save it reload the page and we have some nice colorful icons now okay last one here's a spinner so this is what you might see in during a loading screen it's FA spaced FA spinner and there's different styles of spinners I kind of like this one it's FA pulse and then we'll make this fa for X and here is our spinner this is something you might see during a loading screen ok guys one last thing before we go I'm actually refilling this part because I forgot to mention this we can actually turn these icons into a hyperlink that'll take us somewhere when we click on it so let's say that we want to go to YouTube when we click on this icon so what we'll do for this icon is surround this with a pair of 8 eggs now within the opening 8 egg we'll use the H breath attribute and set this to the website that we want to go do so we'll say HTTP colon two forward slashes ww youtube.com let's save reload the page now one thing that you might see is that there tends to be like this underlined you might not see it here you can actually get rid of that that's standard with all hyperlinks just say target all 8 eggs and we're going to use a text decoration of none and that will get rid of that underline that you might see okay let's try this now and it brings us to YouTube's homepage well that concludes the CSS tutorial for now thanks for watching everybody hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
