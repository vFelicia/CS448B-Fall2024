hey everybody so let's talk about do while loops a do while loop is a variation of a while loop so a while loop first checks a condition then it executes a block of code if that condition is true so we may not even execute that block of code at all if that condition is false from the get go a do while loop always executes a block of code once and then we checking condition at the end if that condition is true we will continue another loop so here's what i'm thinking for a demonstration we'll create a small program where we will have a user type in as many numbers as they want as long as it's above zero and then we will find a sum so if we're writing a program like that we can first declare two variables int number i'll go ahead and assign these some values right away so we'll set number to zero and int sum equal to zero as well to keep track of the sum we'll first begin by creating a while loop so we will use a while loop and our condition is if number is greater than zero then we will continue to ask the user to type in some numbers if that number is zero or less than we stop so let's ask a user for a number enter a number above zero and then using scanf we will accept some user input and store this within number and let's check to see if number is greater than zero if it is we will take sum set this equal to sum plus number but you can just shorten the statement to plus equals number that's fine too and then at the end we will print whatever the sum is sum we're displaying an integer and we are displaying some so with our number i set this to zero and since our while loop is checking the condition first we're not actually going to execute this body of code so our program skipped this while loop and went straight to the printf statement so a while loop checks a condition first a do while loop will check a condition last so to change this to a do while loop we will take our condition and move it to the end just after the last curly brace and add a semicolon and then before the first curly brace we will add the word do so we will do this once and then check the condition to see if we would like to continue so now if i run this we get that prompt enter a number above zero and i can type in as many numbers as i want so one two three four five so we check the condition at the end so our condition is that if our number is greater than zero we will continue this loop so if i type in negative one we will exit and our sum is 15. so that's the major difference between a while loop and a do while loop a while loop checks a condition first then executes a block of code if that condition is true a do while loop always executes a block of code once then checks the condition if that condition is true then we continue again so yeah that's a do while loop it's a variation of a while loop and if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well that's the do while loop in c
