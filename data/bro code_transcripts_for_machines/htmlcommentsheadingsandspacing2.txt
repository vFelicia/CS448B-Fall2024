hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here and in this video we're going to be discussing comments headings and spacing so let's get into it let's kick off this video with comments comments are useful if you need to insert some sort of note for yourself or for somebody else that's looking over your HTML document when you insert a comment they won't actually appear on your webpage but they will appear on your HTML document so this is what you do to write a comment you need the left angle bracket next clinician point and then two dashes everything after this will become a comment so you need to place an ending comment tag somewhere so to do that type in two dashes and then a right angle bracket everything between these two tags will be marked as a comment so we can say something such as this is a comment and notice that it's grayed out so this will not appear on the webpage so let's save it and test it out let's refresh the webpage and it doesn't appear and these comments can also take up multiple lines it really depends on where you place the ending comment tag if we were to put this at the end of our document all the content between here despite if it's on multiple lines or not will now be a comment and everything now disappeared because our text our content for our webpage is between these two common tags so place a comment wherever you want it's useful if you need to leave a remind you for yourself or some sort of note for yourself or somebody else okay so up next we have headings heading tags are used to show the structure of a document by transforming text to become headings such as titles to mark categories or sections so by default there are six sizes of headings that you can apply it to text they are h1 through h6 with h1 being the largest heading and h6 being the smallest so I'll demonstrate each of these so let's take out our content for now so if you want to mark something using the h1 heading tag you just write h1 with in angle brackets and then you need a closing tag for this too so make sure to write forward slash then h1 so whatever text we put in here is going to be affected by the h1 heading tag so here's an example we'll just say heading 1 and make sure to spell it right well save this and you'll notice that heading 1 is fairly large compared to the text that we had before in our document and these had are useful if you need to mark different sections of a webpage it's kind of like a title and there's different sizes so let's go through each of these and I'll just show you the h1 through h6 tags so this is h2 so let's change h1 h2 for the second line and let's save it run this and you can see that h2 is slightly smaller so the higher the number in your heading tag these smaller the font is gonna be all the way till h6 so let's try these out so let's add h3 h4 h5 and lastly h6 all right let's save it refresh the webpage and you can see that these are all the headings that we have they are of varying sizes depending on what kind of sized font you're looking for for some sort of heading so basically these heading tags are useful if you want to give your webpage a title or label sections place them wherever you like next I'm gonna teach you guys how the paragraph tag works but first we need some sample text to work with now if you're using sublime text and you need just some random text for your webpage or you can do is type in lorem and then hit tab and this is all I want to say dummy text it's all in Latin actually and let's save this and refresh the webpage and we have a nice little paragraph here it's actually all in Latin so I'm going to translate this because I'm actually kind of curious as to what this is so I place this within Google Translate and this is what it comes up in English the original language is Latin and in English it says lorem ipsum carrots enhanced rebates but they do a cat labor added pain and vitality so that at some important things well obviously that this is pretty much garbage but it's useful if you need some dummy text to work with I think what I'm gonna do is just pretend that this is some sort of magical incantation or spell instead of Latin lorem ipsum dolor sit amet it's like Harry Potter when they name their spells when to gaudium labios ah okay I'm starting to get offtrack again now if you want to separate some text and have it become its own separate paragraph just use the paragraph tag so what you need to do is type in P within angle brackets so this will split up our text and it will become a new paragraph so let's save this refresh the page and everything after this paragraph tag became its own separate paragraph so that's useful if you need to mark different sections if you have a lot of text to work with just use this paragraph tag and you can separate lots of text by paragraph now one thing that you might see is that a lot of people like to have these opening paragraph tags at the very beginning of a paragraph and where they want their paragraph to end they'll have a closing paragraph tag and then they'll actually separate these within the HTML document I think it's easier this way to read and then you know the next paragraph you just have the opening paragraph tag and the closing paragraph tag at the end so there's multiple ways of writing this there will be no change to the web page if you were to write it either way personally I prefer to have a opening paragraph tag and a closing paragraph tag F like before and after each paragraph basically but either way it works it really depends on what style you prefer so these paragraph tags are useful if you want to write a document or anything that contains a lot of information these will help keep it organized now if you ever need to add a line break you can add a line break tag you type in the are within angle brackets so let's try this out this should push our text down one line so with our HTML documents this really doesn't read like empty lines so you know if we had this with a bunch of empty lines between our heading and our text this won't actually read the way you think it would so if you ever need to add like a line like a line break or some space just use this BR tag and you don't need a closing BR tag because this is referred to as an empty tag it's one of the few exceptions where you don't need to place an ending tag for this just like the paragraph tag it's not required to have a closing tag for this so actually if you were to add a couple of these you can add a couple line breaks so each time I'm adding one of these it's pushing this all the text down by one line so I'll place these wherever you see fit next we have the HR tag it adds a visual break in a web page and note HR doesn't stand for human resources it's actually an abbreviation for horizontal rule and it's used to separate content by adding a horizontal line to separate whatever content you want so let's separate each of these headings I think so we'll just add a HR tag after each of these headings and I'll show you what effect these have so this is useful if you need to mark something off like section by section so if we were to add this HR tag after each of these headings and this is also an empty tag so you don't need a closing tag for each of these and let's add one more all right so now we have each of these headings in its own separate section lastly we're going to cover nonbreaking spaces so what do you think would happen if I added a bunch of random gaps between my text here you think these would display right but I'm refreshing the page and they actually don't because we ignored these large gaps between our text like I'll even hit Enter and add a bunch of gaps and this doesn't appear so if you ever need to add a space what you use is a nonbreaking space and you type in + + b SP that means nonbreaking space so if we were to refresh our web page you can see that a single space appeared it's like you're hitting the space bar so let's add a couple of these so this should add a few spaces yep we have a little gap here so if you ever need to add a few spaces just use this nonbreaking space so that's some of the fundamentals for comments headings and spacing if you're looking for some additional practice feel free to follow along because i'm going to create a new webpage and will utilize a few of these features that we just learned about so go to file new file and I'm going to copy all this and we're going to delete everything within the body and start fresh and let's just delete all this alright so feel free to pause the video if you need to catch up with this and lest's uh let's rename the title here let's call this perhaps test web page and let's save this the file name doesn't matter I'll just call this test dot HTML all right and we're probably gonna want to open this too so go to the file you just created right click it open with and then pick a web browser all right so here's our test web page all right so let's create a heading this will function as perhaps a title for this test web page so let's use the largest heading there is which is h1 and I'm thinking we can just name this perhaps translations of lorem then let's put a closing h1 tag here save it and test it out there it is translations of lorem now I'm thinking we can translate that lorem paragraph that we had before into various languages and Mark a different section for each translation so I think that would be some good practice for us and how about we add a horizontal rule so use an HR tag refresh the page and here's a line going across horizontally our web page now let's create another heading how about h3 this time let's call this Latin and a closing h3 tag let's test it out and and it says Latin here alright so we're going to want some dummy text so if you're using sublime text just type in lorem then hit tab let's save this run it so here's our sample text that we have it's all in Latin so why don't we create another section that's dedicated to this translated in English so let's create a new heading and we'll use h3 again that's like a middlesized heading and we'll call this English and what I'm going to do is actually translate all this to English so let me go to Google Translate real quick so I went to head and it translated our lorem sample text all to English it's not necessary that you do this but I thought it'd be fun to do so we could have like a translated version of our lorem text into various languages for our experimental web page so I'm going to copy this text and place it within here and let me just fix some of this formatting here alright so that looks good let's go back to our web page refresh it and we have another section that's dedicated to our lorem sample text translated into english this time except it still doesn't really make sense in English but you know it's sample text it really doesn't matter all right let's create perhaps one more section how about another in Spanish oh but we'll want to use the h3 tag then we'll put Spanish within here and use the h3 closing tag and it's going to be the same process let's translate this to Spanish I'll copy this and paste it again it's not necessary but I thought it'd be fun to do and let me fix the tabbing on here the spacing oops alright let's save this refresh the page and we have another section dedicated to Spanish so it's a Spanish translation of our lorem sample text do you need to indent something there's better methods than this in CSS but a basic way in HTML is to use the nonbreaking space four times before whatever text that you want to indent so I just place this nonbreaking space four times and I'll put this before each section perhaps they'll give myself a little bit of room to make things more clear all right let's save this refresh the page and all of our paragraphs are now indented again there's better ways to do this in CSS but this is what we have to work with in HTML for now all right I would say that this is a decent web page for our very second lesson there's still a few other things that we'll want to cover in the future such as like fonts and coloring and pictures and whatnot so what I'll do is that I'll post the code that I have in the comments down below so feel free to look through those or copy these and change things if you want they're meant to help you and you know what this website is starting to resemble a Wikipedia page so I would say it's fairly neat and organized right now so it's good that we get some of the fundamentals out of the way and I think in the next lesson will cover fonts so we can make our webpage a little more fancy and cool but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started with comments and headings and spacing in HTML hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd
