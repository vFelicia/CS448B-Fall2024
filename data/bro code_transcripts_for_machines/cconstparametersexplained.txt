hey everyone in this topic i'm going to explain const parameters a const parameter is a parameter that is modified with a const keyword that makes it effectively readonly there's a couple reasons why you might want to declare a const parameter your code is more secure within a function and it conveys the intent to other programmers it's especially useful for references and pointers here's an example of const parameters in action i have standard string name assign your first name then int age whatever your age is then suppose i have a function to print my info void print info and there will be two parameters standard string name int age be sure to add a function declaration if you're missing it then if i need to call this function i would invoke the function name pass in my arguments name age then we can print our info standard output name standard output age this of course does what you expect it prints our name and our age to make this function more secure we can instead use const parameters that means that we can't change the values that we receive name and age in this case just as a test let's set name equal to an empty space and age equals zero i don't want this to be able to happen at all now when i run this we don't have a name and we don't have an age to make these parameters readonly we can precede the parameters with that const keyword const string name constant age and you would probably want to add that to your function declaration as well just to display intent there we have an error assignment of readonly parameter age and name is somewhere up here but i don't feel like reading all that when we pass our string and our integer as arguments what we're doing is effectively making a copy of name and age technically we're not modifying the original variables in this case using the const keyword when we pass a variable by value isn't really that big of a deal but it at least conveys intent if we were working with reference data types now we'll pass by reference well now it's a bigger deal we don't want anybody modifying the original name and age variables all right everybody those are const parameters they are parameters modified by the const keyword that effectively make them readonly within a function your code is more secure and it conveys intent it tells other programmers hey don't mess with these values they're useful with references so that nobody can change the value found at that reference then in the case of pointers nobody can change the address of where a pointer is pointing to so yeah those are const parameters in c plus
