well hello again everybody it's me in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers in Python then at the end of this video as an exercise we're going to create a number guessing program let's begin we will be importing the random module type import random the random module gives us access to a lot of useful methods involving random numbers for a comprehensive list you can use the help function pass in the random module and then we would want to print this here's what we all have access to we have a shuffle method set state seed sample random range random random inch random bytes and there's a ton of others but we'll discuss a few of the more useful methods for beginners for a random whole integer maybe you're rolling a sixsided dice you would type the name of the random module dot that a method for a random whole integer type Rand int add a set of parentheses within the set of parentheses you will list a range if I'm rolling a sixsided dice I would like the numbers one through six one comma six then I will assign what is returned to maybe a variable print whatever my number is my random number is a four three one four all right I tend to play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons we use polyhedral dice that have more or less than six sides there is a 20sided dice for a random number between 1 and 20 I would set the range to be one comma 20. here I rolled a 16. and a seven and an eight within the Rand int method you can place variables as well as long as they contain numbers I will create a variable named low I'll set that equal to one and a variable named High I will set that to be 100. I will replace the numbers with my variables that behave as numbers give me a random integer between my low variable and high variable so between 1 and 100 in this example I have rolled a 75. now in 88 if you need a random floating Point number you can use the random method random dot random then let's assign this to a variable number equals the random method of the random module that would return a random floating Point number between 0 and 1. you can pick a random Choice from a sequence in the future we're going to create a game of rock paper scissors let's say we have a tuple of options options equals Rock paper scissors we are accessing the random module dot then use the choice method place your sequence within the choice method give me a random Choice from options I will store this within a variable let's say option equals random Choice from my options then I will print the option our computer has generated scissors paper Rock so the choice method is a great use for games if you ever need a random element now there's also Shuffle this time maybe we have a deck of cards cards equals I guess I'll use a list this time I have a list of cards that you would normally find within a deck of playing cards well besides the suit two through ten Jack queen king Ace using the shuffle method I can Shuffle this sequence access the random module dot Shuffle pass in your sequence in my case it's cards then I will print cards yeah look at that my cards are now shuffled in the future we'll be creating a game of blackjack the shuffle method will be used then to shuffle our deck of cards those are a few methods found within the random module for some practice let's create a number guessing game as an exercise a user has to guess a number between a certain range maybe between 1 and 100 I'll set low to be one High to be 100 guesses set to zero then we will generate a random number equals random dot Rand int the range is between our variables low and high we'll create a while loop while true while the user guesses the wrong number we'll have to continue the while loop we only Escape when they get the right number but we'll give them a hint so guess equals input I'll use an F string enter a number between low through High I'm going to surround this with a set of parentheses then I'm going to Typecast our input as an integer after making one guess I will increment our guesses variable by one guesses plus equals one now if our guess is less than our number let's print using an F string guess is too low else if gas is greater than our number we will print I'm just going to copy this is to hi then else if our guess is not lower than the number and our guess is not higher than the number well then our guess must equal the number that means we got the number right then I will print guess is correct then we will break so when we escape the while loop let's print the number of guesses it took to get the right number I'll use an upstring this round took you our guesses variable then the word guesses that should complete our program let's try it enter a number between 1 and 100 I'll guess something right in the middle 50. 50 is too high okay so our number is between 1 and 50. I'll guess something in the middle of that range maybe 25 25 is still too high 12. 12 is too high six is too low okay we know our number is between 6 and 12. nine nine is correct this round took you five guesses well okay then everybody that is how to work with random numbers in Python and hopefully you gained a little bit of experience working with random numbers with this number guessing game we'll be utilizing random numbers for a lot of games in the future and well yeah that's how to work with random numbers in Python
