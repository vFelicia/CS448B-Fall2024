all right people well i thought for practice we could create a sort of calculator program we can pick two numbers we can add them subtract them multiply them and divide them so let's get started this will be just a very simple project i'm going to write just calculator program when we begin this program and then maybe i don't know format it a little bit let's add some i don't know dashes or something just to kind of make this look nice this will all be within the console okay so we'll need to declare num1 num2 and result these will be doubles double num1 i'll set the sequel to zero let's create num2 and result double result and i will set that equal to zero as well okay we will need to ask for some user input console.writeline enter number one colon space and then we will assign num1 equals so user input's always a string we'll need to convert this to a double convert dot to double and within the parenthesis we need console.read line method okay let's do the same thing for num2 enter number two num2 equals convert dot 2 double pass in console.readline now we need the user to type in an option do they want to add or subtract multiply or divide so let's type enter an option console.writeline again what about plus colon space add then minus colon space subtract asterisk for multiply and forward slash for divide you can add other options if you want to okay let's take a look at this so far so we have calculator program enter number one what about three point one four enter number two uh let's say i don't know five okay a couple things i'm going to change real quick i'm going to change this right line to just right then i'm going to add a tab escape sequence that is backslash t for tab just so that it looks better okay let's continue so i'm going to create a switch that will read our user input switch console dot read line and we need matching cases case plus so if somebody would like to add we will take our result equals num1 plus num two console.writeline and i'll do some string interpolation your result colon space num1 plus num2 equals plus result and then we need to break out of this case okay let's do the same thing with minus case minus result equals num1 minus num2 num1 minus num2 and that's all we need then we need multiply case asterisk result equals num1 times num2 replace minus with asterisk and then divide case forward slash for division result equals num1 divided by num2 and replace the asterisk here and then we should probably add a default case just in case somebody doesn't pick one of these options default that was not a valid option and then break enter number one three point four enter number two uh let's say 6.9 and i would like to multiply these so i will add an asterisk 3.14 times 6.9 equals 21.666 all right i'm just going to change one thing i'm going to add one line right before we read our user's input for what operation they would like to use so let's add console dot right now right line enter an option then let's try it again 3.14 multiplied by 6.9 is 21.666 okay now what if somebody would like to continue using this calculator so what we'll do is place all of this code within a do while loop i'm not sure if i discussed this in the past but a do while loop will always execute a body of code once and then it checks the condition at the end so let's add that here so we have do at the top then we need our while with condition while all right now before this let's ask for some user input console.writeline would you like to continue capital y equals yes capital n equals no and then we will read some user input so within the while loop the condition this will be console.readline dot 2 upper so in case they type in lowercase y or n we'll just change it to uppercase via the two upper method and let's check to see if this is equal to y if it is then we'll reset our num1 num2 and result variables and do this all over again and if they would not like to continue let's write by okay let's try this again what is three point one four divided by two so enter number one three point one four enter number two two and let's divide these the result is one point five seven let's type y for yes all right then we can do this all over again what is five divided by three point one four so i will divide and the result is one point five nine something something something would you like to continue i'm going to type and for no bye so yeah that's a very simple calculator program in c sharp i will post this code in the comment section down below if you can give this video a thumbs up leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
