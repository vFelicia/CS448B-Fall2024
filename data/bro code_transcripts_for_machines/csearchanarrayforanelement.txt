hey welcome back so in this video i'm going to show you how we can search an array for an element let's create an array of numbers something simple int numbers this will be an array then assign some numbers i'll just assign the numbers one through ten because i'm basic like that there one through ten we'll probably need this later i'm going to calculate the size of the array and size equals size of my array numbers divided by the size of one of the elements i'll just pick the first element we'll need to keep track of an index like what index did we find something that we're searching for int index i'll declare this variable but we don't need to assign it as well as int mynum mynum will be the number that we're looking for let's accept some user input we'll create a prompt standard output enter element to search i'll for a new line because i can standard input my num i'm going to create a function that will search an array for us let's define that function outside of the main function this function will return an integer that will be our index the return type isn't i'll name this function search array there's a couple parameters we'll have three parameters an array of integers integer array the size of the array and size then some element that we're searching for int element then we should probably add a function declaration at the top that's good this function will return an integer the index of the element that we're searching for we will take our index variable set the sql to then i'm going to invoke the search array function that we just declared but we need three matching arguments for the three parameters that we have set up an array a size and an element we'll pass in our array numbers the size of the array that we already calculated and the element that we're searching for we're searching for mynum within the search array function we will iterate from the beginning of the array to the end and see if there's any matches we can do that with a for loop we'll begin at zero into i equals zero that's our index i will continue this as long as i is less than the size of the array that we're passing in as an argument then increment our index by one this would be technically a linear search we'll start at the beginning and check every value until we reach the end so let's check using an if statement within the for loop if our array we did name this array numbers but remember that you can rename parameters numbers is technically our array if our array that we receive at index of i that's our counter is equal to the element that we're searching for we will return whatever the index is i if we search through this entire array and don't find that element that we're searching for we'll return negative one in programming negative 1 serves as a sentinel value if you see negative 1 that typically means that something wasn't found we'll return either i or negative 1 then assign it to this index variable within the main function using an if statement we'll check to see what that value is if our index does not equal negative 1 that means the element that we're searching for is somewhere within our array let's display the index standard output my num is at index whatever the index variable is else standard output my num is not in the array okay let's see if this actually works enter element to search for let's search for one one is that index zero remember that computers always start with zero enter an element to search for let's search for ten ten is at index nine enter an element to search for four twenty sixty nine four twenty sixty 69 is not in the array for additional practice let's search through an array of strings such as food we'll create an array of strings i'll rename numbers as foods then think of some food that you like pizza hamburger hot dog end size equals the size of foods divided by one of the elements of foods let's rename my num as my food that's the food that we're searching for and that will be of the string data type in place of cn when working with strings let's use getline because the user input may contain spaces standard getline standard input my food within the search array function that we created we will pass our array foods the size can stay the same then pass in my food that's what we're searching for within the if else statements replace my num with my food then we'll need to change the data types of this function we're accepting an array of strings replace int with string do that with your element as well then we need to change the function declaration at the top of our program okay we can now search through an array of strings enter element to search for let's search for pizza pizza is at index zero hamburger hamburger is that index one hot dog hot dog is that index two then let's search for something that's not within this array what about sushi sushi is not in the array yeah everybody that is how to search through an array this would technically be a linear search you begin at the first element of an array check to see if the values are equal if they're not equal you move to the next element until you reach the end and that's basically it if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to search through an array in c plus
