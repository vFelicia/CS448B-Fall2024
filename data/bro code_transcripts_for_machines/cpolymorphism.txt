hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain to polymorphism in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right what's going on people polymorphism polymorphism is a greek word that means to have many forms with programming objects can be identified by more than one type they can have many forms for example let's say that we have a dog a dog could be considered a canine an animal and an organism so a dog has more than just one form it has more than one data type here's the situation we're going to have a race we'll enter in a car object bicycle object and boat object so i have four classes vehicle is the base class otherwise known as the parent class and car bicycle and boat all inherit from the vehicle class so with my race i need to create a car object bicycle object and boat object so let's do that car car equals new car bicycle bicycle equals new bicycle and boat boat equals new boat i would like to place all of these objects within an array for my race but what's the data type of the array going to be so let's try and make an array of cars and add our car bicycle and boat and let's just see what happens i will name this array just vehicles equals and then within curly braces add whatever objects you would like i would like to enter my car into the race my bicycle and my boat okay but we're running into some errors here cannot implicitly convert bicycle to car so i stated that the data type of this array is going to be cars i can only enter car objects so i have no issue there but i cannot enter in my bicycle and boat objects into this array but one way in which we can solve this is by using polymorphism so we can find what they all have in common they all identify as vehicles because they all inherit from the vehicle class these objects have more than one form they can be identified by more than one type so instead of my array being an array of cars i'm going to change this to vehicle because well these three objects identify as well a car a bicycle and a boat respectively but also vehicles because they inherit from the vehicle class so you can see that this is valid if you need to create an array of different types of objects you have to find what they have in common and then you can just use that as a data type they are all also considered vehicles let's move on to part two what i would like to do is have all of these vehicles use a go method so they will all begin the race at the same time so let's create a go method within each of these classes public void go and we'll just display the car is moving place that within the car class let's make a go method for bicycles change car to bicycle and then the boat is moving okay now to iterate over this array of vehicles we can use a for each loop for each now what's the data type of our vehicle array well it's vehicles vehicle vehicle in vehicles and now i would like each vehicle to use its go method vehicle.go so each vehicle will use its go method but there's one more thing that we need to do we need a go method within our vehicle class so all of these methods within our car bicycle and boat classes all are going to be overriding a go map that found within the vehicle class so let's create a virtual method public virtual void go and we don't necessarily need to define anything within the go method because we're going to be overriding this method okay then we need to use this override modifier all right now when we iterate over this array of vehicles each vehicle will use its go method it's as if when we would like to begin our race all of the vehicles within our array will use their go methods at the same time the car is moving the bicycle is moving the boat is moving so yeah that's polymorphism it's a greek word that means to have many forms objects can be identified by more than one type and in this example we created an array of vehicles our car identifies as a car but it also identifies as a vehicle and objects do identify as objects too so cars identify as objects and the same thing can apply with bicycle and boats in our example so yeah that's polymorphism if you found this video helpful be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
