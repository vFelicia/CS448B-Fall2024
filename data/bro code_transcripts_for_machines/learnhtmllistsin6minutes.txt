hey everybody today I'm going to explain how we can create different lists in HTML there's three different types of lists that we'll discuss today unordered ordered and description lists for an unordered list think of maybe a grocery list the order of items doesn't matter to create an unordered list you need a pair of UL tags UL meaning unordered list then between the pair of UL tags you need to list items Li means a list item so we have a little bullet point let's create a grocery shopping list maybe we need to buy milk let's create another list item we need another pair of list item tags let's buy eggs what else can we buy milk eggs bread and what about coffee there we are here's our unordered list each list item is bulleted hey let's add a title to this list preceding the pair of UL tags let's use maybe an H4 header tag let's say groceries here are the groceries I want to buy the order doesn't matter so we're using an unordered list now you can create nested lists too let's change coffee to Coffee supplies then after this list item we'll create another unordered list then we need more list items so for coffee supplies of course we would need coffee or maybe coffee beans now we have a hollow bullet point maybe you need some creamer for your coffee and or sugar so that's how to create a nested list within a list within your list you can create another list now let's go over order lists to create an ordered list you need a pair of ol tags meaning ordered list then you need some list items what about a todo list so we need a list item so number one that's first in our list we need to eat breakfast I'm gonna add a title to so let's use a pair of H4 header tags this will be my two do list one we need to eat breakfast two go to school or go to class so that's number two number three after class you have to walk your dog then four maybe you have to go to work all right that is an ordered list use a pair of ol tags then lastly we have a description list this one's a little more tricky a description list is made of key value pairs you have a term and a definition to create a description list you need a pair of DL tags meaning description list we need some terms to create a term you type DT then close it so I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons let's create some definitions for some mythological creatures like a dragon so that's my term let's create a few other terms dragon vnix vampire and werewolf so these are the terms underneath each term we can add a definition we'll need a pair of DD tags for description definition I'm going to Google each of these creatures then just paste the definition that I find so for a dragon I'm just gonna copy this definition then paste it within the DD tags here's my term and here's my definition of that term Dragon a mythical monster resembling a giant reptile sometimes shown as having wings let's do this with our other definition terms as well next we have Phoenix definition an immortal bird associated with Greek mythology we'll need a pair of DD tags add your definition then close it here's my second description definition then we need vampire and werewolf vampire creature definition let's copy this create another pair of DD tags then paste that definition here's the definition for vampire then lastly werewolf werewolf creature definition an individual that can shapeshift into a wolf so DD close it add that definition and there's our definition for werewolf so that's a description list in a way it's made of key value pairs you have a term which is represented with description term then a description with DD description definition I forgot to add a title to this list let's do that I'll use a pair of H4 header tags let's make the title mythical creatures not bad let's add a background color because well we can I'll add a background color to the opening DL tag so style equals background Dash color what's a good color for this what about light green I haven't discussed borders yet but to add a border you can type border colon then a size maybe two pixels then there's different borders but let's go with solid for now here's a border around my list all right everybody so that's how to create different lists in HTML we have unordered lists ordered lists and description lists you can style your lists as well but we haven't really discussed much CSS yet but yeah those are different lists in HTML
