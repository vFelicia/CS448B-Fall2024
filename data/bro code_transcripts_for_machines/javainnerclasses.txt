what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys about inner classes in Java yes it is legal to have classes inside of other classes let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running everyone we're gonna be discussing inner classes what this is is that an inner class is basically a class inside of another class it's kind of like that lesson on nested loops how you can have loops inside of other loops but in this case you can also have classes inside of other classes and this is useful if an inner class should be limited in its scope they're usually set to private but that's not always necessary and one of the reasons that we use inner classes is because it helps group classes that belong together and I would say that this is extremely useful for listeners for handling specific events and I would say that this is a necessary lesson when we move on to the next video on anonymous inner classes where we're actually going to be creating some customized action listeners so let's begin we have a main class here let's also create another class so I'm going to click on my source folder go to file new class and let's call this class outside and then click finish and then within our class outside we're going to create another class we'll make it public but we don't have to public class and we'll call this next class inside the inside class is going to be inside of the outside class now let's assign some variables so how about we create a string string x equals the word hello and I'll add a space after this and we'll also create a variable within our inside class we'll call this string y equals world now going back to our main class we can instantiate an instance of our outside class and our inside class well let's begin with our outside class so I'll type the name of the class outside and we'll call this instance just out equals new outside alright so we have an instance of our outside class and it's called out now we can also instantiate an instance of the inside class the inner class of the outside class and in order to do this this is what we're gonna do we first need to type in the name of the outside class that's acting as the container so we're going to type outside dot and then the name of the inner class and it's actually right here if you have intellisense setup so outside dot inside which is the name of the inner class and we will call this instance maybe in equals then type in the name of the instance of the outer class out dot new then the name of the inner class again inside parentheses semicolon so now what we have here is an instance of the outside class out and an instance of the inner class in so let's actually access these variables x and y so we're going to put these within a print line statement so we're going to type system dot out dot print line if we want to access X what we're gonna type is the name of the instance of the outside class so that's out dot X then we'll add plus then now we want to access this Y variable which is in the inner class so what we're gonna type here is the name of the instance of the inner class so in dot Y so now if we were to run this it displays hello world now we can actually access a method from an inner class so let's create a greeting method so we'll make this public public void greeting and all will do here is display our print light statement so I'm going to copy this and move it and then we can get rid of out dot and in dot we can just display X&Y so let's try this again and this time we actually need to call the method of the inside class so we're going to type in the name of the inside class which is in dot and use the greeting function that we just made and if we were to run this we can now access a method that's inside of an inner class all right well that's the basics of inner classes and in the next video we're going to discuss anonymous inner classes which are extremely useful for listeners for handling specific events but yeah that's the basics of inner classes in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
