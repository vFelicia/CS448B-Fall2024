hey guys in this video i'm going to show you eight useful math related functions in c plus plus let's begin by creating three variables double x and i will set this to be three double y that will be four then double z we will declare this but not yet assign it the first useful math related function is the max function which will return the greater of two values or variables i'll assign the result within z z equals standard max parentheses within the parentheses add two values or variables i'll compare x and y then let's display the result standard output i would like to display whatever z is the greater number between three and four as well you guessed it four alternatively there's the min function z equals standard min let's compare x then y so the minimum between these two values would be three so that's max and min now the rest of these functions are found within the c math header file at the top of our file let's include c math we have the pow function to raise a base to a given power z equals pow for power let's raise two to the power of three z would be eight two to the power of four would be sixteen that's the power function then we have square root z equals sqrt what's the square root of nine well the square root of nine is three then we have absolute value z equals abs if you place a negative number within the absolute value function it will give you the positive version of that number how far it is away from zero so negative three the absolute value of negative three would be three that is the absolute value function next we have the round function let's change x to three point one four z equals round let's round x 3.14 rounded would be three if you need to round up there's a ceiling function z equals seal seal means ceiling let's round x x rounded up is 4. alternatively there's the floor function which will always round down let's change x to 3.99 to test it z equals floor x x rounded down is three so yeah everybody that is a super quick video on a few useful math related functions if you head to this url c plus dot com slash reference slash c math there's a lot more useful math functions that you may be interested in but we just covered a few of the basics in the next topic we're going to create a practice program to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle so yeah those are a few useful math related functions in c plus plus
