all right before we begin everybody just so you know this is an optional lesson if you're ever interested in making any sort of games in JavaScript I would recommend learning about 2D arrays but there are a few other uses too a 2d array also known as a multidimensional array stores a matrix of data in rows and columns it's useful for games such as tictactoe chess Sudoku or any game where you need a matrix or grid of data to keep track of spaces mostly it can also be us used in spreadsheets think of excel Excel has rows and columns or representing images an image is a matrix of pixels our 2D array is going to look something like this each row is an individual array we're going to end up storing all of these rows within an array let's create one let's name our grid this will be a constant but it doesn't need to be Matrix we'll create a matrix of data our 2D array is going to store individual arrays in each element our first array let's say we have the numbers 1 through three each row should be comma separated the next row will be four five and six then 78 9 so what we got to do is store all of these rows within an array and there's our 2D array to give you a better visualization I'm going to place each of these rows on a new line there hopefully that makes sense our Matrix is a 2d array each inner array represents a row each element within the inner arrays represent a column 1 147 would be the first 2 58 would be the second 3 69 would be the third if we need to print the elements of this array here's one way in which we can do that let's use a for Loop this will be an enhanced for Loop let we need some sort of counter our counter is going to be Row for every row of our Matrix let's begin by console.log each row to see what we're working with each element in the 2D array is an array itself however I would like to print the individual values we're going to create a row string like let's use const row string we will join all of the elements together in each row row doj jooin join each element but separate them with a space character then console.log each row string there's our grid we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 N9 all arranged in rows and columns if you need to access an individual element within this Matrix you have to use two indices for example let's take our 2D array of Matrix the first index is for the row the second index is for the column you would think that Row one column one would be 1 one but arrays they start with zero the element at the first row at the First Column would have indices of 0 0 let's change that to be an X like we're playing TicTac toe now we have x 2 3 so on and so forth for the element at Row one column 2 that would be again our Matrix with two indices row 0 column 1 let's set that to be an O there we are again our arrays start with zero Row one column 2 would translate to 0 1 let's do this with the others I think we see a pattern now 02 Matrix at row 0 column 2 let's set that to be an X would be three now to move on to a different row we have to increment our first index Matrix Matrix at row two would be one column one would be zero let's set that to be an o that did change we're now within the second row 1 one would be row two column 2 row two column 3 would be 1 two okay last row again to move down to the next row you got to increment the first index Matrix Row three would be two column 1 would be zero we'll set seven to be an X row three column 2 would be 2 1 that will be an O Row 3 column 3 would be 22 we'll set that to be X there we are with the length of your rows they don't necessarily need to be all uniform for example with my first row I'll add Z to the beginning so now we have 0 1 2 3 maybe I'll remove the last element in the last row where we just have 78 you can also mix and match data types let's add a new row our Matrix will represent a telephone number pad we need a new row I'll add an asterisk zero and a a pound sign there our Matrix represents a telephone number pad all right everybody so that's a 2d array it's a multidimensional array that stores a matrix of data in rows and columns it's useful for games spreadsheets or representing images we won't be using these again until we start making some games later on in the series and well everybody that is an introduction to 2D arrays and JavaScript
