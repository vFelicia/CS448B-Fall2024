hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain why loops in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running so while loops a while loop is a statement that will execute its block of code as long as its condition remains true later on in this video for this example we're going to create a program where we will prompt a user to enter their name if they attempt to skip that prompt then we will continually ask the user to enter their name and they can't continue on with the rest of the program until they do so the key thing to keep in mind with while loops is that you'll want some way to eventually escape the while loop if you don't have any way to escape the while loop that's referred to as an infinite loop so let's create an example of an infinite loop because it's fun so to create a while loop type while and then some sort of condition so for our condition let's say while one is equal to one so this will always be true now what do we want to do when we execute this block of code let's print something print help i'm stuck in a loop all right so let's try this while one is equal to one print this statement and we will just continue on and on within this while loop because we have no way to escape this while loop so now let's use this concept and write a program where we will prompt a user to type in their name if they don't type in anything then we will continue to prompt them to type in at least something so let's say name is equal to and then to just keep this blank we'll just set this to a set of quotes and then let's write a while loop here while name and let's check the length of name if the length of our name is equal to zero then we will ask the user to type in their name name equals input enter your name so then once we escape the while loop let's print something print hello plus name oops hello plus name all right so when i run this we are giving the user a way to escape the while loop they have to type in something for their name as long as the length of my name is equal to zero keep on printing this prompt enter your name so i'm just going to hit enter a bunch of times enter your name no enter your name no enter your name no so we are stuck within this loop until we enter something for our name so this time let me type in a name then hit enter so therefore our condition is now false the length of my name is now one two three so three is not equal to zero therefore our while statement our while loop is false and we continue on with the rest of the program there are a few variations in which you could write the same program so let's write this a different way what we could do is say name is equal to none while not name and this will pretty much do the same thing it's just another way of writing this well everybody that's the basics of while loops a while loop is a statement that will execute its block of code as long as its condition remains true for our example we asked the user to type in their name if they were to leave it empty or blank we would keep on asking the user to type in their name so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that's the basics of while loops in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
