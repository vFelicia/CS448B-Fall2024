hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a simple clock program in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody let's create a clock so go to file new java project to create a new java project let's call this clock and then finish don't create a new module then go to your project folder and we're going to create two classes file new class let's call this first class just main because it contains the main method check public static void min and then we'll create our second class file new class i'm going to call this my frame because it's going to extend the jframe class so my frame extends jframe and then within our main class we're going to create an instance of our my frame class so let's just say new my frame now we'll need an import so we'll just include these as we go along and we'll create the constructor for my frame and let's go through the steps of creating the frame itself so this dot set default close operation jframe dot exit on close i'll set a title to this dot set title name this whatever you want this will appear on the top of the window let's call this my clock program and you can set a layout i tend to like flow layout manager so i'm going to set this to that this dot set layout a new flow layout and we'll need an import here as well and let's set a size this dot set size i already took some measurements so it seems for this program that 350 by 200 is not too bad of a size and i do not want this to be resizable but this really isn't necessary this dot set resizable i'm going to set this to false and lastly we're going to set the visibility to true this dot set visible and pass in true let's run this once just to test it this is our frame and we're eventually going to be adding three separate labels to this frame the first for the current time the second for the day of the week and the third for the date so let's create a calendar and we can actually get the current date and time using this calendar so we're going to create an instance of our calendar and we'll probably need to import this as well this calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields one other thing that we'll need is a simple date format and let's call this instance time format and according to this to the description is that the simple date format is a concrete class for formatting and parsing dates we can actually use format specifiers to arrange the time however we want if we want to include am or pm if we want to make this a 24 hour clock be sure to include an instance of a simple date format let's also create a j label and we'll call this time label in which we will use to display the time all right and that's what we'll need for now we'll include some other fields later so let's go to the constructor and create our instances of these objects so let's add these before we actually make the frame visible so let's begin with the time format time format equals new simple date format and then within the constructor we pass in some format specifiers to how we want to display this time format i'm actually going to go to oracle's website and show you a few here's oracle's documentation on their website for the simple date format i'll include this link in the description if you would like to take a look for yourself so within the constructor of the simple date format we can pass in some letters and that will format the time based on what we need for our program if we want the hours minute seconds that would be according to this documentation either lowercase h if you want a 12 hour clock capital h for a 24 hour clock lower case m for minutes lower case s for seconds and then am or pm is lower case a and there's other things you can include too like the month of the year the year itself error designator that's a d or bc i guess um so we're going to include a few of these and if you click on the presentation it'll get more in depth on different ways you can format these so let's head back to the constructor for the simple date format for the hours if you want two digits that is two lowercase h's minutes would be two lowercase m's and seconds would be two lowercase s's and i'm going to include am rpm so that is lowercase a now we need to set the label with the current time but we need to finish instantiating this label so let's do so time label equals new j label and we want to get the current time and actually let's declare a string to do that we'll call this string time and time equals time format dot format function and we pass in a date how do we get that date by using our calendar calendar this is with a capital c dot get instance and we're going to do some method chaining dot get time this will get the current time and store it within the string variable called time now we're going to set the text of the time label with our time time label dot set text and we're passing in our time string and we need to add this label to the frame this dot add and we're adding our time label and let's test this currently it is just after 7 a.m where i am now if you notice this time is not moving so we'll want to update this clock every one second so we're going to change our program around a little bit so let's create a method called set time and we're going to call this method every about one second to update so after we set the visibility to true let's create a method called set time and call this method set time and let's define what set time does so let's make this public void set time and what are we going to do when we call this well one let's move these two lines of code and place them within the set time function so then we need to actually update this every second one way in which we can do that that's fairly simple we can create a while loop while true this will continue until we close the program but we want to actually have this update only every one second and one way to do that is to use thread dot sleep so this main thread will sleep for approximately 1 000 milliseconds and then update again and then we need to surround this with a try and catch block and now this should update every one second or so yeah if you take a look it actually is i'm just gonna change the font so that it's a little easier to read and it looks better so let's change the font maybe right here so we're going to change the font of our time label time label dot set font and we'll pass in a new font pick whatever font you want i already picked one out for dana this is a font family um this is a font styling let's make this just plain and a size 50 is good let's also change the foreground and background color time label dot set foreground and we can pass in a color i'm going to create a custom color so new color and i'm going to use a hex value so i want green that is 0x 0 0 ff 0 0 but pick whatever color you want i'm also going to change the background color time label dot set background and i just want black so that is color dot black it's not necessary to pass in a new color and in order to display the background we have to set opaque to true time label dot set opaque and we pass in true and now this should look better it's more customized yeah i kind of like that and it's updating every one second now let's actually display the day of the week right underneath so let's create another label another j label and let's call this day label and we'll have a string called day let's finish instantiating this label and we need to create a format for this too so we're going to create another simple date format before i forget to add that so let's call this day format and we'll want to instantiate this instance of our day format so i'm just going to copy the line above and change time format to day format now we need to see what format specifiers we need to display the day of the week so let's go to our documentation according to oracle's documentation on the simple date format if you need to retrieve the day of the week that is capital e so we're going to pass in a capital e to the constructor of the simple date format and we'll need to finish instantiating this date label that we created so let's do so right underneath the time label that we have day label equals new j label and i'm going to change the font right away because we'll eventually be doing that anyways so this will be day label dot set font i'm going to pick a different font i am fond of ink free that's another one of my favorite fonts and then something slightly smaller so let's change this to 35 and then we need to add the data label to this frame this dot add and we're adding our day label and we'll need to get the current time using the calendar class so let's copy what we have here and paste it right underneath and we're going to use instead of time day and we're going to use our day format in place of our time format day label set text to our day string and now this will actually display the day of the week directly underneath and today it is currently sunday however with the way our format specifier is used a capital e gives you the day of the week in three letters for some reason if you want the entire day of the week spelled out that would be for ease for some reason according to the documentation so if you want the entire day of the week spelt that would be four years and now it displays the word sunday let's also display the current date underneath the day of the week so let's create another simple date format another label and another string and we'll call this date format jlabel date label and then string date and it's going to be the same process as before so we'll need a new simple date format and this will be date format and we need to see what the format specifiers are for date here we are back at this documentation one more time we want the month that would be capital m day would be lowercase d and year is lowercase y right here let's say we want the month first let's include two capital m so we have two digits to work with followed by the day that would be two lower case d's then i'm going to include a comma just to separate things and then space for y's for the year because this uses four digits then we need to finish creating our date label and let's do that underneath the day label date label equals new j label and i'll set the font maybe i'll just copy what we have before with the day label let's change day label to date label and i'll make this something slightly smaller 25 would be good and we need to add the date label to the frame this dot add date label and we need to get the current time so let's copy what we have here and change day to date make sure to include that with the uh format simple date format that you used so instead of day format this is date format instead of day label this is date label and set text to our date string and now this will get the current date and display it whoa hold on a second i'm going to uh allow this to be resizable because this is using a flow layout give me one second uh this dot set resizable we're just going to comment this out for a second and let's push this underneath all right so here's our date it is currently a september 6th 2020. now one thing you could do if you want to display the month instead of a digit you can display the actual name of the month that is for some reason five m's and now i'm going to let this be resizable again so now it displays september instead of zero nine and there's ways you can actually change this into different languages according to oracle's documentation so yeah if you want the name of the month that is for some reason five capital ms well everybody that's how to create a simple clock program looking back at the code for this we didn't even need this instance of the calendar class because we were able to call the calendar class directly to get the time sometimes after you code something you'll find a better way in which you could have coded that and that case would apply to this video so we didn't even really need this instance of the calendar class so if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's one of a few ways in which you can create a clock program in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
