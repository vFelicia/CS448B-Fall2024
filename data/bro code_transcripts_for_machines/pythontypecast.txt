hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about typecasting in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right welcome back everybody i have a super quick video for you guys today on the subject of typecasting now typecasting is the ability to convert the data type of a value to another data type here's an example that i've written already i'm just going to paste it i have three variables for this example x y and z x contains one this is a whole integer into for short y contains 2.0 this is a floating point number float4 short you can tell it's a float because it ends with a decimal portion and z contains a string of three a string is a series of characters and you can tell it's a string because it's surrounded with a set of quotes and remember with strings we cannot normally perform math on strings so i have three print statements for x y and z and as you would expect they contain the values of one two point zero and three now let's begin by converting both y and z to the integer data type via typecasting in order to perform typecasting on a value or variable type that value or variable and surround this with a set of parentheses whoops i missed and then presave this with the data type you'd like to convert this value or variable to i would like to convert y to an integer and then you can use this for whatever you need so i'm going to replace y within my print statement with y after we typecast it as an integer and this will display 1 2 not 2.0 it's the whole integer of 2 and then 3. so this is not a permanent change if you need to make this as a permanent change to y you'd have to reassign it so let's say y equals y and then we're going to typecast y so let's run this with a set of parentheses and precede this with the data type we'd like to convert y2 so now y is a whole integer and then we will print y without the typecast this time and our result is one two three now z z is storing a string and with strings we cannot normally perform any math on strings for example within my print statement i will state z times three you would think that the result would be nine right well you're wrong it's going to print three three times if you need to convert a string to a int or a float you would just have to typecast it so this time let's type cast z as an integer z int and we will type cast z as an integer so then if we have z times 3 the result is now 9 instead of 333 so that's the basic formula for type casting now let's convert these to floating point numbers but let's include x as well because x is feeling left out so let's convert x to a floating point number so float parenthesis and we will surround this with x and display x and actually let's convert y and z to floats as well because why not so the results are now 1.0 2.0 and 9.0 remember that we multiplied z times three and then if we need to convert these values to a string we would use the string cast so the results now are 1 2.0 and 333 now you might be thinking to yourself when would you need to convert an integer or a float to a string here's a situation let's say within our print statements we need to print these variables along with another string so within our print statement let's say x is plus x we would like to display these together and let me copy this and do the same thing for y we'll say y is plus y you cannot normally display a string along with an integer or a float because we're using some string concatenation so this will result in a compilation error can only concatenate string not int to string so that's a situation in which you might need to use typecasting to convert an integer or float to a string so let's display x and y as strings via typecasting so we'll surround x and y with a set of parenthesis and precede this with the data type we'd like to convert these values to we would like to convert x and y to both strings and now this will compile and run just fine well everybody that's the basics of type casting if you would like a copy of all my code i will post everything in the comments down below if you found this video helpful don't be afraid to help me out by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
