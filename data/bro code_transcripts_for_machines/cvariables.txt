hey uh it's you bro hope you're doing well and yeah we're doing stuff with variables today in c so sit back relax and well enjoy the show welcome back to another video so variables variables are allocated space and memory to store it value we refer to a variable's name to access the stored value that variable now behaves as if it was the value that it contains but to create a variable we first need to declare a name for a variable and then precede it with the type of data that we are storing creating a variable is done in two steps declaration and initialization so we need to first declare a variable to allocate some space in memory to store a value so we need to precede our variable name with the data type of what we plan on storing within this variable if i need to store a whole integer we would precede our variable name withint into for integer and let's say that this is variable x so this step is declaration we are creating space and memory to store a value and to actually store a value that step is initialization so we would take our variable name x in this example and set it equal to some value so we declared that this variable is an integer we can only store whole integers maybe the number one two three so this is initialization or you could combine these steps together and let's create into y into y equals three two one this is both declaration and initialization so creating and storing a variable takes two steps declaration and initialization and in order to create a variable you have to precede the variable name with the data type of what you plan on storing within that variable int for a whole integer but there's other data types too let's create some more variables what about int age with variable names you're not limited to only just x and y you can really name it whatever you want within some limitations but make sure that the variable name is descriptive of what it does so age is going to store an age let's say that i am 21 years old so this is an integer a whole number if we need a number containing a decimal portion that would be a float for floating point number so one example of a variable that could contain a floating point number is a gpa grade point average let's say that my grade point average is a 2.05 so this is a floating point number it's a number that contains a decimal portion we can also store single characters with the char data type like you're pronouncing charizard and this will be a letter grade let's say now to store a single character we have to place it within single quotes when we initialize it with my grade variable what about a c like my average grade is a c remember everybody c's get degrees so char stores a single character now c isn't an objectoriented language so there is no string data type because strings are technically objects so if we would like to store like somebody's name we need a series of characters so we can create what is called an array and to create an array we would follow our variable name with a set of square brackets and then assign this equal to some string of text some series of characters place your series of characters within double quotes and we can store more than one character so this data type would be technically an array of characters i'll create a whole separate video on arrays this is basically how you can emulate a string it's really just a whole combination of single characters there's still a lot more data types than just these four i thought i would cover just some of the more basic data types just because in this video we're going to focus more on variables than data types i'm planning a separate video just dedicated to data types because there's way more data types than just these four there's bytes there's doubles there's longs etc now how can we display the value stored within a variable within a printf statement here's how we have to use what is referred to as a format specifier let's say we have a printf statement and i would like to display my age within a message so let's create some text you are age years old if i would like to display the value contained within my edge variable wherever i would like to insert that value i will place a format specifier which is represented by a percent sign and then follow this with a secret character that represents the data type of what we're inserting so if i need to display my age variable i will use a percent sign as a placeholder followed by d for decimal and then after my string of text outside of the double quotes add comma then the name of the variable you would like to insert at this placeholder so at this location i will insert age and then let's try this you are 21 years old so let's try that again with a different variable let's say let's go with name i'll add a second printf statement print f and then let's say hello and i would like to insert my name here so use a percent sign as a placeholder it's a format specifier then to display a character array that would be s for string and then add comma name oh then we may need to add a new line character to the end of these because i forgot let's try that again hello bro you are 21 years old okay let's display our grade print f then within quotes your average grade is then to display a character variable that would be percent c for character then outside of our double quotes add comma the name of the variable we would like to insert at this location so comma grid i think i'm just going to space these out a little bit okay then i will add a new line character to the end of this hello bro you are 21 years old your average grade is c then to display a float that would be percent f print f your gpa is percent f then i'll add a new line character so follow this with comma the name of the variable gpa okay your gpa is 2.05 so later on we'll discuss more about format specifiers there's ways that we can format how our variables are displayed i just realized that i misspelled average twice so yeah those are variables they are allocated space and memory to store a value we refer to a variable's name to access the stored value that variable now behaves as if it was the value that it contains but to declare a variable we have to state what type of data that we are storing within that variable so yeah those are variables if this video helped you out help me
