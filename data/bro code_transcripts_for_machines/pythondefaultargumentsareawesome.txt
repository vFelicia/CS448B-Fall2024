hey everybody today I'm going to explain default arguments default arguments are a default value for certain parameters the default is used when that argument is omitted when you invoke a function in the last topic we discussed positional arguments today we will be examining default arguments then in future topics we'll examine keyword and arbitrary arguments let's begin let's define a function to calculate net price there will be three parameters an original list price a discount if there is one and sales tax we will return a net price and here's the formula list price times one minus our discount percentage times 1 plus our sales tax maybe I'm buying a PlayStation 5 for 500. I will pass in 500 for the list price well I can't actually execute this function without also passing in an argument for Discount and tax perhaps the discount is zero and the sales tax is five percent 0.05 well this would work and I should probably put this within a print statement so you can see it there we are my total is 525 dollars the list price of 500 no discount and 5 sales tax now suppose that maybe ninety percent of the time when we're executing this function most of the time discount is zero and our sales tax is almost always the same what we could do to make this function a little more flexible is to set these two parameters to have a default value in place of sending in three arguments we can pass in one then set our discount and our tax to have a default value so I will set discount to be zero and tax to be 0.05 meaning 5 percent so this function would work our total is 525 and that's assuming that our discount is zero and our tax is five percent the nice thing about using default arguments is that let's say that somebody has a discount well this function would also accept up to two additional arguments so let's print our net price 500 and our customer has a coupon for 10 off I'll add a second argument of 0.1 if we're passing in an argument for our discount we'll use whatever is passed in rather than the default our total now is 472 dollars and 50 cents or maybe this time they are not paying sales tax I will set the sales tax to be zero now the customer's total is four hundred fifty dollars so that's kind of the nice thing about default arguments it makes your functions more flexible and it can reduce the number of arguments especially if the arguments that you're passing in tend to be consistent most of the time people don't have a discount and almost everybody is paying five percent sales tax why pass in arguments we don't have to let's cover an exercise we'll create a count up timer we will import the time module we will Define this function Define count there will be two arguments start and end for x and range start comma and within the range function the second argument is exclusive so I'm going to add 1 to the end of our time then I will print X to make this thread that's running the program sleep you can access the time modules Sleep Method pass in one for one second then outside of the for Loop let's print the word done to invoke this function I need to pass in two arguments a start time and an end time I'll set the start time to be zero the end time to be 10 10 seconds so we start at zero then we will increment by one every second I'll speed up the video I think you get the idea but we'll stop at 10. let's assume that most of the time a user would like to begin at zero well we don't necessarily need to pass that in as an argument let's set our start parameter to have a default value of zero we only need to pass in one argument but we do have a problem nondefault arguments should follow default arguments so if you use any default arguments you'll want to be sure that they're after any positional arguments so let's reverse these and that should work so now when I run this program it's assuming we'd like to start at zero but we'll need to pass in an ending amount of seconds when do we want to stop that works the same but now we do have the option of starting at a different number this time let's end at 30 but we will begin at 15. we're beginning at 15 then we will count to 30. I'll speed up the video there we are all right everybody so in conclusion default arguments they are default values for certain parameters the default value is used when an argument is omitted they can make your functions more flexible and reduce the number of arguments you have to pass in especially if those arguments are consistent most of the time so those are default arguments and in the next topic we will discuss keyword arguments and well yeah those are default arguments in Python
