hey how's it going everybody in this series I'm going to show you everything you need to know to get started working with HTML then a little bit later on we'll cover CSS so why don't you go ahead and sit back relax and enjoy the show hey if you enjoy my videos please be sure to subscribe because subscribing is free just like how this video is free help me out yes I'm guilt tripping you that is all why should you learn HTML in today's age people spend way too much time on the internet myself included unfortunately knowing how to create or otherwise manage a website isn't a bad thing to know heck add it to your resume it really can't hurt even if you're not interested in web development as a career almost every business has some sort of online presence knowing how to manage that online presence could convince a potential employer to hire you over somebody else so why not HTML is an acronym for hypertext markup language the general idea is that certain types of tags also known as markup is used to convey to a web browser how some content should be displayed usually tags are in pairs with some content sandwiched between them header tags are typically used for titles P tags are used for paragraphs of text a tags are used for hyperlinks HTML adds structure to a web page if we were building a house you could say that HTML is the foundation the skeletal structure to support all content on a website then their CSS CSS means cascading style sheets it's a language that adds style to a web page in our house analogy CSS would be equivalent to the decorations design and colors of the Interior to begin working with HTML and CSS you'll need a modern web browser you can use Google Chrome Firefox Microsoft Edge Safari those are all fine you'll also need a text editor as well such as vs code it's free software that functions as a workbench for us to write code in this next part I'll show you how we can download and install vs code to download vs code head to this website code.visualstudio.com look for whatever operating system you're using and download that version I'm running Windows I will download the windows version then I will open it when it's done accept the agreement yes I did read it that fast next I'll create a desktop icon next install launch Visual Studio code and finish we need a folder to hold all of the documents related to our website go to Open folder I'll place this folder on my desktop new folder I'll name this folder website select folder there we go we are now within our website folder I'm going to create a new file I will name this file index.html whatever your home page is going to be I would recommend naming it index.html most servers return the index file as the home page so it would be good practice for us to name the home page index now what we're going to do is install the live server extension go to extensions look up live server and install basically what this does is that when you update your HTML file if you have a web browser open it's going to update automatically it'll save you some time all right everybody now what we're gonna do is fill in our HTML file at the top what we'll do is add a set of angle brackets then type this exclamation point doc type HTML this is a declaration that this document is an HTML5 document which is the most recent version then we'll create a pair of HTML tags we'll need an opening HTML tag and an ending HTML tag you can tell that this is an ending tag because it has a forward slash most tags are in groups of pairs that's if there's typically content between them this pair of HTML tags represents the root element of an HTML page between these two tags we will add a pair of head tags the head element contains information about your web page such as a title let's add a title to our web page title add a closing tag let's set the title of our web page to be my first website now what we'll do right click on your HTML file then open with live server here's our webpage the title says my first website just to make this easier on us I'm going to place our web page side by side with vs code when we save any changes we can see that update automatically the head element contains information about your web page whereas in the body let's add a pair of body tags after the pair of head tags the body element contains visible content in your web page between our body tags let's add a pair of H1 header tags H1 defines a large heading I'll add some text this is an H1 heading I'm going to save that should update my HTML document automatically this is an H1 heading let's try H2 add a pair of H2 header tags this is an H2 heading let's do H3 H3 this is an H3 heading H4 this is an H4 heading then we have H5 this is an H5 heading typically header tags are used for titles or other large text let's discuss paragraph tags if you have a paragraph of text you can place that within a pair of P tags thumb text goes here if you need some sample text to work with if you're using vs code you can type lorem then tab this will create some garbage text for you I think it's supposed to resemble Latin if I were to copy everything within the set of paragraph tags then save it paragraphs are separated with a line break otherwise if you do need a line break you can type BR meaning line break so this is a selfclosing tag pairs of tags usually have some sort of content between them with the line break that's a selfclosing tag we don't need a closing tag so add as many line breaks as you need wherever you need them so that's a line break there's also a horizontal rule which is HR think Human Resources HR that would add a horizontal line across your page that might look pretty good after a title paragraph tags don't care about any spaces or new lines I'm going to put all of this on separate lines just so it's more legible so when I save nothing appears to happen even if I were to add some line breaks between these sentences nothing appears to change you could always change your paragraph tags to pre meaning preformatted as in preformatted text that would retain any line breaks or spaces Within These tags it's up to you if you prefer the P tags or the pretags now the last thing I'm going to discuss are comments comments aren't displayed as output they're usually used as notes for yourself or for other developers you would type a left angle bracket exclamation point two dashes wherever your comment ends you would type two dashes right angle bracket this is a comment so when I save nothing appears to happen comments are used for yourself or for other developers that are looking over this document alright everybody well at this time let's go over an exercise just so that we have a solid foundation and really remember everything it'd be good practice for us we're going to create a separate HTML file that displays the lyrics of a song you like so let's create a new HTML file let's name this file lyrics dot HTML again we'll need to add this declaration doc type HTML that's a declaration that this document is an HTML5 document then we'll need a pair of HTML tags we'll need a head element and a body let's add a title to the head of our document title let's set the title to be my song lyrics then we will open this HTML file with live server my song lyrics pick a song that you like within our body tags let's add an H1 element this will be the title copy the name of your song place it within this pair of tags so that's the title add song by the name of the band or artist I'll use H3 header tags that's slightly smaller than H1 you know maybe H4 I think that'd be better I'll add a horizontal rule that's HR I'll add a pair of P tags take all of these lyrics copy them and paste them within the pair of P tags I'd like to retain the spacing let's change the P tags to pre tags for preformatted text that's much better let's add one line break after our horizontal rule one last thing I'm going to do within the pretags I'm going to add some blank lines between some of these verses there we go that's pretty cool I think we have the hang of basic HTML now in the next topic we'll discuss hyperlinks hey if you're enjoying this
