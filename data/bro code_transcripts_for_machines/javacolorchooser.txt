hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use the j color chooser class in java to color components so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay let's get started everybody so we're going to be discussing the j color chooser class this is a good mechanism that lets a user choose a color so here's an example of my setup i have two classes a class called main that contains my main method and a new instance of my other class called my frame so my frame extends jframe and implements the action listener interface i have a constructor called my frame within the constructor i have this dot set default close operation j frame x on close i'm using a new flow layout followed by this dot pack and this dot set visible to true i also have an action performed method for when we click on a button we're going to change either the background color or the font color of a label so let's declare a button and a label so let's declare these outside of the constructor so that they're globally available to our action performed method so we'll create a j button j button let's call this button as well as a label so j label called label and then we will finish instantiating these within the constructor so button equals new j button and i'm going to set some text right away just by passing in a string to the constructor of the j button i will say pick a color alright let's create a label so that is label equals new j label but this has to be capital okay i'm also going to set the background color so label dot set background and then we can pick a color maybe just white so color dot white so in order to display the background color we need to set opaque true so set opaque and we're going to pass in true let's also set some text and the font so label dot set text this is some text good enough let's also change the font too because this is going to be fairly small so label dot set font and we can pass in a new font pick whatever font you want i will pick one of my favorites which is mv bowling you can style this i'm just going to set this to plane and then a size i want something massive like 100 and that's all there is to it oh then we have to add an action listener to this button so button dot add action listener and i'm going to pass in this because we're implementing the action listener interface and then we need to add this button and this label to the frame so this dot add we're going to add the button followed by the label so this dot add label then we should be good all right so all we have is a button and then some text this is our label so when we click on our button we're going to launch a new instance of our j color chooser so if e dot get source is equal to our button then we're going to declare and instantiate a new color chooser so in order to do that we're going to declare j color chooser and we will call this instance color chooser or whatever you want equals new j color chooser so this will create a new instance of our j color chooser but we need to create a dialog box so we can actually assign that to a new color whatever this returns so color we'll call this color equals j color chooser dot show dialogue so for the arguments this takes a parent component a title and an initial color so for the parent component we're just going to set this to null because we don't have one we can set a title so pick a color i guess and then an initial color like what do you want the default to be so i'll just say color.black so this will create a dialogue for us and when we run this and click on our button to pick a color it's going to open this menu and it has our title pick a color i guess okay so we can pick a color and we can click ok this has a few other options too i don't really know what this crap is but feel free to mess with these settings so let's say i want this green color then i click ok well we have this color stored within our color called color coincidentally now we need to actually change the color of whatever it is we want to color so let's change the foreground color of our label first so label dot set foreground that's the font color and we're going to pass in our color that we select so now when we run this and we pick a color let's say i want that green color again i think it was something like that and click ok it's now going to change the foreground color we can also change the background color too of whatever component that we want so i'm going to change the background of our label so label dot set background and we're going to pick that color again so let's pick i don't know pink and the background is now pink so you don't necessarily have to do this with labels you can do this with all sorts of components but a label is kind of convenient just because you can add text to a label and you can also change the background color well that's the very basics of the j color chooser class if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the j color chooser class in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment
