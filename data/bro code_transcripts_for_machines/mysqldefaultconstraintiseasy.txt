hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the default constraint when inserting a new row if we do not specify a value for a column by default we can add some value that we set here's an example let's select all from our products table select all from products in an earlier example we have a table of products a few items on the menu for sale are hamburgers fries soda and ice cream let's add a few items on the menu that would be free this could include napkins straws forks and spoons something you would commonly see at a fast food restaurant if we're not using the default constraint we would have to enter in those prices manually so let's insert into our table products R values product ID 104 will be a straw the price will be zero dollars and zero cents let's do this all together we have 105. 106 107. product number 105 will be a napkin the napkin is zero dollar zero cents 106 is a plastic fork again zero dollars and zero cents 107 is a plastic spoon the price is zero dollars and zero cents then I will select all from my products table here's our new products table we have our four items that actually cost something then our free items which are included with whatever we buy in place of explicitly stating a price one way in which we can make our lives easier if we're adding a bunch of free items to the menu we could set a default constraint where if we don't explicitly set a price the price will default to be zero it will be free so I'm going to undo everything that we just did delete from products where product ID is greater than or equal to 104. and then we can execute that statement if we were recreating this table with the default constraint we would type create table the name of the table products in this case add our columns we have a product ID the data type is integer we have a product name the data type is VAR Char and I forgot what the size was looks like 25. than a price which is a decimal Max digit size of four Precision of two now let's use the default constraint after the column you would like to add that constraint to type default then some value I will set the default value to be zero dollars and zero cents or you could just say zero too that'd be fine you would just add this constraint when creating a new table however I do already have a products table so this technically wouldn't work because that table already exists now to alter a table to include that constraint you would instead type alter table the name of the table alter the name of the column price set default constraint then the value so zero and that appears to have worked let's select our products table select all from products then we will insert some new rows insert into products than our values so we had four rows 104. that was a straw 105 was a napkin 106. was a fork 107. is a spoon then finished the statement with a semicolon so since we set that default constraint we don't need to explicitly list the price but we are missing one thing though when I execute this statement the column count doesn't match so when we insert into products we will list what we're inserting explicitly the product ID and the product name after our table name within parentheses type product ID then product name now this should work yeah and here's our products table with our four inserts all of the prices were set to zero and we did not need to explicitly state that this time if you don't specify a value you'll use whatever the default is here's another example I think you'll like this one let's say we have a table of transactions after inserting a new transaction we will insert a timestamp of when that transaction took place and that time stamp will be the default create table transactions at the end of this topic we will delete this table so don't get too attached to it we will have three columns transaction ID which will be of the data type integer a transaction amount let's just say amount the data type will be decimal five digits Precision of two is good then a transaction date the data type will be date actually let's make this date time I'd like to include the time of when this transaction happened now for the default constraint after the date time let's add default then the Now function we don't need to explicitly add the date and time that will be done automatically which is kind of cool so I'm going to create this table let's select all from transactions if we're going to insert some values we'll need at least a transaction ID and amount the transaction date will be included automatically so let's insert into transactions some values let's do one at a time the first transaction of the day will have a transaction ID of 1 I suppose a customer came in and bought a hamburger and a soda for a total of 4.99 then we do need to list the transaction ID then the amount after our table name add transaction ID then amount so let's run this yeah cool so there's our transaction ID this was order number one the total amount was 4.99 and we do have a time stamp of when this transaction occurred so the second order of the day will be for a total of 2.89 and that happened at this time then the third order of the day will have a total price of eight dollars 37 cents yep there we are so we don't need this table anymore I'm going to drop table transactions we will recreate this table in the future but I'd rather start fresh all right everybody that is the default constraint when you create a table or alter a table you can set a default value of some value you specify then whenever you insert a row that value will be included automatically which is pretty useful but yeah that is the default constraint in MySQL
