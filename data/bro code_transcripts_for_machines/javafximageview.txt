hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to give you all an overview of the image view node in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay people image view image view is a node used for painting images loaded with images the way that i think of them is that an image is like a photograph and an image view is a picture frame for that photograph it holds an image a photograph for this demonstration i have two images that i would like to use with my image view i have two pictures named shrek1 and shrek2 so what i'm going to do is copy these images from my computer and place them within my application package the same package that contains my main java file my fxml file and my controller if you're working with a lot of images i actually recommend placing your images within a separate folder or a separate package just to keep things organized so let's open up scene builder so right click on your fxml file and go to open with scene builder within scene builder i'm going to use an anchor pane and i'll add a button what i'm planning is that when i click on this button we'll switch from picture 1 to picture 2. now i need an image view node that is located underneath controls so that is right here let me drag and drop it and you can resize it okay let me give this image view a unique id so i will go to code and let's say that this is my image view i'll name this button to my button okay now with our image view we can set a default picture click on your image view then go to properties image and i will set the initial image the default image to shrek 1 and then when i click on this button when the program is running i would like to switch to shrek 2 to be displayed within my image view so click on your picture open let's save this then open up our controller navigate to your fxml file tab because sometimes this doesn't like to update within our controller class we need to inject our fxml document by adding the annotation at fxml let's declare our image view image view my image as well as our button button my button and we'll need to create an image for image to image my image equals new image and within the constructor we have a few things to write in here get class dot get resource as stream and the name of your file your image shrek 2 dot jpg now we need to create a method that we will link to our button to change our image around within our image view so let's say public void display image and we will take my image view dot set image to my image and now we need to link this method with our button using scene builder within scene builder underneath controller add your controller and click on your button go to the code tab the code drop down menu and on action display image and save navigate to your fxml document so that it updates and then we can run this program so we have shrek 1 and when i click on this button we'll switch to shrek 2. we do have some extra time so let me show you all a few useful properties and settings that are available to you with image views so click on your image view and go to properties you can preserve the original ratio you can change the opacity on cursor you can change the cursor that appears when you hover over your image so i set that to hand you can add a special effect like sepia let me reset that or motion blur and there's a few others here as well underneath the layout drop down menu we can change the position of our image view for example i can change layout x to be 0 and then my image view would be left justified layout y would move my image up or down on the y axis if i set layout y to zero then my image will appear at the top and let me reset this to what it was originally we can also rotate our image by moving this thingamabobber around let me restore that you can change the scaling so let's say scale x is two instead of one now our image is super wide and thick scale y will make it taller and leaner and underneath the code drop down menu there's a multitude of different actions that we can take and link to methods within our program based on how we interact with our image view i'm not going to show you all these because there's a lot here but one that is basic would be on mouse entered so if we were to hover our cursor over our image view then we can perform some action let's say we would like to change our image view from image one to image two shrek one to shrek two so i'm going to link my display image method that we created within our controller and let's test it let's head back to our controller and run the program and just as a reminder open your fxml file just so that it updates and let's run this bad boy now if i take my cursor and hover over my image it should change from shrek 1 to shrek 2 which it did well everybody that's a basic overview of the image view node i like to think of the image view node as a picture frame and we load our picture frame with different images different photographs so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that's a basic overview of the imageview node in javafx
