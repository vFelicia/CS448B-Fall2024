how's it going everybody to bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can generate some random values in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you can become a hero and save our channel by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen in this video we're going to be generating some random values some random integers doubles and boolean values so if you're interested in game design at all this video is a must for you so in order to use random values we should probably import the random class bond within the library so outside of the class this is where we're going to type we're going to import java dot util dot random semicolon and now we have access to the random class and that provides us a few options we need an instance of the random class for us to use within the main method we're going to create an instance of the random class by typing random with a capital r it's the same name as the class random we need a name for this instance let's call it random all lower case kind of like what we did with that video on scanners random random equals new random that's kind of random then a set of parenthesis then a semicolon we now have access to this random instance to generate some random values for us but there's a disclaimer here these are not true random numbers but something called pseudorandom numbers which are pretty darn close so i just wanted to give you that disclaimer before we got started so you don't call me a liar let's generate a random integer and store this within an integer variable like into x into x equals and to generate a random integer we're going to type the name of our random instance random dot next and there's also a few others like next boolean next double next float i'll get to those later what we would like for now is next int and then we will display the result with a print line statement we will display the value of x so the results are on a scale between i would say just under negative 2 billion to just over positive 2 billion so you'll probably want to limit that let's pretend that we're going to roll a six sided dice so to limit the scale or the size of the random number that will generate we can pass in a value to our next int method so within the parentheses of our next int method we'll limit the size of the integer that's going to generate if we would like a sixsided dice we're going to place six here but there's one catch with this though this will generate a random number between zero and five because computers always start with zero and let's see if i can roll a zero nope there we go all right so one way to solve this is that if we want the numbers one through six we can just add one so now we'll get a random number between one and six just like that this time let's generate a random double value for now i'll turn this line into a comment and let's create a new variable called double y double y equals random dot next where is it double and we will display the value of y next double is going to give us a random value between zero and one so this probably has some uses for something what that is i'm not really sure but hey you know you can do this now let's also generate a random boolean value so boolean z equals random dot next boolean and we will display the value of z so this is going to give us either true or false well everybody that's how we can use the random class to generate some pseudorandom values for us if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's a few uses of the random class also be sure to leave a like drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
