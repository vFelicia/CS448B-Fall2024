hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how functions work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay let's do this thing a function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called this process is also known as invoking a function with programming we try not to repeat code if we don't have to that's why functions are useful because our function can perform some specific task for us some block of code for us whenever it is called so we only need to write that block of code once and if we need to repeat it we just call this function one more time so let's define and create a function we'll create a function called hello and in order to define a function we'll type def and then a unique function name so let's call this function hello and with functions they always end with a set of parentheses and lastly to finish defining this function we'll add a colon at the end so if you go down to the next line take notice that my cursor is now indented any code underneath a function that is indented belongs to that specific function and will only execute whenever that function is called so for now we need to type in something if you don't know what you want your function to do you can always type pass for now but let's print something print the word hello and in order to call this function all we need to do within our program is type the name of the function which is hello and then add a set of parentheses because functions always end with a set of parentheses so what this will do is execute my function once and perform this block of code whenever it is called if i were to remove this well our program currently isn't going to do anything because functions only execute their block of code only when it is called so this time let's print the word hello three times so i will call this function three separate times hello hello hello so when i run this our hello function will be called three separate times now with functions they are not limited to just one line this is an entire block of code so maybe we can do something else too let's print have a nice day now if i were to run this my hello function is going to execute this entire block of code three separate times hello have a nice day now an important feature of functions is that we can send our function some information and our function can do something with that information that it receives let's say this time i would like to print hello plus somebody's name currently name is an unresolved reference what we can do when we call this function is send our function some information this can be a value a variable a collection all sorts of different things so if you need to send your function some information within the parentheses when you call that function just list the data that you want to send your function so let's say i would like to send my function a string value of bro whatever your first name is when you send information to a function these are called arguments they are the information that you're sending to a function and when you define that function you need a matching set of what is known as parameters so our hello function is going to receive one argument a string value we need a matching number of parameters currently this isn't going to work you can see here that hello takes zero positional arguments but one was given our function needs a matching number of parameters so think of it this way when we receive this value we're going to give a nickname to this value so when we receive the string value what do we want to call it well let's call it name so in order to add parameters to your function just list the parameters within the parentheses of that function and well this should work now we have a matching set of arguments and parameters when we call the hello function this time we are sending one argument over and when our hello function receives this argument we're going to give it a temporary nickname of name or you can call this whatever you want to and then we can use this value for whatever we want within our function now if we were to run this this will print hello bro have a nice day now i can send maybe a different value let's say hello and then i will send a string value of dude hello dude have a nice day so this isn't limited to just values we can send variables to let's say we have a variable called name equals bro and this time i'm going to send this variable over hello and then send name so these don't need to be the exact same let's say this is my name and i'm going to send my name over and i will temporarily give this value a nickname of just name and then i can use this variable for something hello bro have a nice day now with arguments you can send more than one value over let's say this time i would like to send two values over so let's send pro maybe for a first name and code for a second name but you can use your first name and last name so this isn't going to work because we do not have a matching set of arguments and parameters we're sending two arguments over but our function is only designed to accept one argument because we have one parameter so let's rename name as first name and we need two parameters this time so what are we going to call this value when we receive it let's call this last name so this time we are going to receive two values they will be nicknamed first name and last name so this time let's print hello first name maybe i'll add a space plus last name and this is now valid hello bro code have a nice day with arguments you can mix and match the data types that you're sending as arguments so currently we're sending two string values as arguments this time let's send an integer value let's say we would like to send an edge over to our hello function so i'll just send maybe the value of 21 so currently this isn't going to work because the hello function takes two positional arguments but three were given when we call this hello function we're sending this argument over but our function doesn't know what to do with this argument so we need a matching parameter for this value that it receives so let's call this value maybe edge as a temporary nickname and then we can do something with this value when we receive it so let's print an additional message perhaps u r plus age plus years old so if you need to display an integer or number along with the string you do need to convert it to a string so let's just cast our edge as a string when we display this so this should work now we now have a matching number of arguments and parameters so this will display hello bro code you are 21 years old have a nice day so ladies and gentlemen in conclusion a function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called if i were to remove this function call well then our program is just going to completely ignore this function and this block of code would not be executed when we call this function we can pass information known as arguments but we need a matching number of parameters set up to receive these arguments there are a few advanced features of parameters but i'll hopefully get to that in future videos we'll just stick with the basics for now of functions so that's the basics of functions if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that is how functions work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a
