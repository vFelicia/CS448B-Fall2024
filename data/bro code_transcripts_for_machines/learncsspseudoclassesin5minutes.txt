hey pseudo classes a pseudo class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements what the heck does that mean so with elements elements can be in a special state like if you hover over them you click on them things of that nature so let's create a hyperlink for this first example let's create a hyperlink that will take us to google because i can't think of anything else at the moment so let's set the href attribute equal to the url for google by default this hyperlink is blue but we can actually change that type the element you would like to change the css properties of followed by a colon and then we have access to all of these pseudo classes so a pseudo class is a special state so anything that is a link let's change maybe the color color what about lawn green i guess anything that is using an a element that is a link is now lawn green so if i click on this link it takes me to google anything that's visited is also another state a pseudo class and the default color is purple let's change that to a colon the pseudo class is visited maybe gray for the color like it's been disabled so the color is now gray since we've already visited this link what if we hover our cursor over this link that is another state a hover color what about tomato i like tomatoes so by hovering my cursor over this link the state of this element is now hover and these css properties will apply when this element is within this state and there's another useful one for hyperlinks and that is active if we were to hold down our mouse over this element then let's change the color to what about i don't know yellow so with active if i hold down the mouse then this link is active it's within the active state now let's create a button this time button click me so anything that's a button we'll use the pseudo class of hover this time and let's change the color to light gray so by hovering my mouse over this button it's going to change the color let's make that background color actually background color if you have a navigation bar or menu bar setup it's actually fairly useful to have the background color change based on what the user is hovering over to let them know that they can select something let's change the active pseudo class for buttons as well uh let's say if we click on this then it will be white cool all right here's another we'll need a list it doesn't matter what kind of list i'll just make an unordered list and let's add 10 list item elements this next pseudo class is really useful it is the m child pseudo class so with these list items i would like to change the background of selected elements think of a child as an element within an element so these list items are all siblings and what we're going to do is change the background color of a few selected elements we will select our list item and say that the nth child will be will have a background color of yellow as if we're selecting something so place a value as an argument within these parentheses these list items are all siblings so let's say that the first child will have a background color of yellow so i will pass in a one or two three four five you get the idea this is really useful with javascript because you can place a variable within here and then increment or decrement to the variable so you can select a given item from a list i'm just going to turn this into a comment real quick now with this next one let's say that the color will be sky blue and i would like to apply this css property to all even siblings and let's do the same thing with all odd siblings and let's make the color what about powder blue so in this way we can alternate the highlighting of our elements so that they may be easier to read this next value is going to be somewhat strange it's a formula that we can pass in as an argument so what if i need every third element highlighted i would say three n n is the current number that we're on so elements three six and nine are highlighted if we change this to four n every fourth element is highlighted five n is every fifth element you can place an offset too if i need this to start at one i would add plus one or plus two plus three plus four so yeah you can pass in a formula as an argument to the nth child pseudo class and this is useful if you need some sort of pattern so yeah those are pseudo classes it's a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element so yeah those are pseudo classes if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
