hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to be teaching you guys about twodimensional arrays and C++ and at the end of this video we're going to be working on a project where we can create a virtual computer keyboard it currently doesn't do anything all it does is look pretty but I'll teach you guys how to create this using a twodimensional array so let's get started before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm think of a basic array as one dimensional as in it only contains a single row of elements while a twodimensional array can contain many rows of elements think of it as an array of arrays so on your screen right now I have a basic onedimensional array well we can turn this into a multi dimensional array by adding more arrays to it but there's a few changes that we have to make so if this is going to be a twodimensional array we need two sets of straight brackets right next to the array name and we're going to need to place the amount of rows and columns that we have in our multi dimensional array into each of these straight brackets so this is going to end up looking like some sort of grid or matrix instead of just a single row so we are going to create multiple rows and separate each with a comma and surround our entire set of rows and columns with another set of curly braces so all I'm going to do is just add another row so we need another set of curly braces and I'll put some more numbers in here so 4 5 6 7 I'm just going in order we'll separate each array with a comma then we'll add another array so we need another set of curly braces and I'll type in 8 9 10 11 all right now what we need to do is surround all these rows with its own set of curly braces so we'll put that here and here alright so this might be difficult to see it what I like to do with 2d arrays is just to put each of these rows on a new line just so it's easier to see and work with okay so what you see now is that this is starting to look like some sort of grid which is kind of the point of a twodimensional array so there's rows and columns to this with the first set of straight brackets we're going to place the amount of rows that we have which is 1 2 3 so we're going to place 3 here and this set of straight brackets is for the columns and we have 1 2 3 4 so we'll place 4 here and that ladies and gentlemen is a twodimensional array now if you ever want to determine how many elements that you have in your 2d array just multiply the amount of rows by the amount of columns that you have so in this example we have three rows times four columns so that's 12 elements so here we have 12 but remember that we start with 0 though so it's going to be the numbers 0 through 11 let's say that you want to work with or display one of these elements in the twodimensional array you'll need to retrieve that specific element so it's going to be very similar to a onedimensional array but there's one extra step so let's say that we just want to display one of these elements so well just see out then we need to type in the name of the array so for my example the array name is numbers but we need two sets of straight brackets we're going to place the row number here and the column number here of what we want to retrieve so let's say that we want to retrieve this number six so we need to find out which row that it's in and remember that we start with 0 so this is row number 0 and this is row number 1 so we're going to place one here and then let's count the columns so this is column number 0 column number one column number two so we'll place two here because we want this six and that's pretty much it let's run this just prove that I'm not a liar yep here's our number at 6 all right here's an exercise for you what do we place here for the rows and columns if we want to retrieve this number 11 take a moment to figure it out yep that's right we're going to place 2 here and then we're going to place the number 3 let's test this out yep there's our number 11 so let's say that you want to display all the elements of this array well one easy way to do that is to use a nested loop will have a outer loop that's in charge of the row that we're on and an inner loop that's in charge of the columns so for the statements for the outer loop this is what we're right so usually you can write it I and set this equal to zero right we could do that but I think for this demonstration I'm actually going to rename I to row all right and then we're going to continue this while our row is less than the amount of rows that we have which is three and then we're just going to increment our row by one and it's going to be basically the same thing for the columns so we can say int column equals zero we'll continue this column as long as column is less than the amount of columns that we have which is four and then we're going to increment our column by one so within the inner for loop what we'll type is C out and we're just going to display our array numbers at the index of row as well as the index of column and then inside the outer loop we'll just want to move down to the next line we can easily just do that with C out en DL and before we run this I'm just going to add a space after each of these elements just so everything's lined up nicely okay let's run this yeah and here is our twodimensional array it got kind of funky with these twodigit numbers but you can still see that it's a grid of some sort a matrix of rows and columns that contains values so that's the basics of twodimensional arrays if you would like to continue we're going to work on a project where we create a virtual keyboard kind of like the keyboard that's in front of your computer right now assuming you're not on a mobile device so if you want to continue let's work on that project well welcome back so for this project we're going to create a virtual computer keyboard maybe not the entire thing but we'll just include maybe the numbers and the letters and some of the other special characters and then afterwards if you want to go crazy and add like an escape button a backspace button and turn shift you could do so but I'll just keep it simple for now then you can go crazy afterwards so let's begin by making a 2d array of maybe characters so we'll make this up the charred data type and let's call this 2d array maybe keyboard and then we need two sets of straight brackets and we're going to set this equal to then all of the keys that we want to add to this keyboard so I'm just going to stick with the numbers 1 through 0 well 1 through 9 and 0 and then the first three rows of letters so that's qwe rty so on and so forth all the way until the last row of letters so I'm actually going to fast forward this video because it's gonna take a lot of time to actually enter in all these individual characters so feel free to pause the video otherwise I should have all of this code completed and post it in the comments down below so you can always copy this portion of the 2d array if you don't feel like typing this by hand so I'm just going to fast forward the video until the point in time where I already type out all of these individual characters and then I'll walk you through it a few moments later alright well welcome back again so here is our twodimensional array of characters the first row is the numbers then we have qwe rty blah blah blah blah the second row is asdf blah blah blah then Z X C V and then we had some extra space so I just added a few special characters here alright so then with the straight brackets we need to list the amount of rows and columns that we have so we have 4 rows we're going to place the number 4 within the first set of straight brackets and we have 10 columns so we're going to place 10 here so this is now our 2d array now let's say that we want to display this we're going to use a nested loop to do this kind of like what we did before so we need an outer loop for the Rose and an inner loop for the columns so what we'll type in here is maybe int then let's go with rose again so into row then we'll continue this as long as Rho is less than the amount of rows that we have so we can put four here all right and then we'll increment our row and we'll do the same thing but with columns so int column equals zero then column is less than ten all right and then column plus plus and then we are going to display each of these characters so we will see out our keyboard at whatever our row is as well as our column and then we'll just add a space between each of these characters when we display them all right and then we just need to move down to the next line so we'll place that within the outer for loop so I'll just see out en DL okay we should be good then let's run this yep and here is our virtual keyboard so someday if you ever learn about graphics for C++ you could easily replace all of these individual characters with labelled buttons and then you can click on each of these buttons to actually enter in a character or letter so that would be really useful then one day so basically a 2d array can be used to display like a grid or matrix of information whether it's like a table a chart a grid a 2d array is pretty useful because you can organize it in rows and columns so that's basically how a 2d array works if you would like a copy of all the code that we worked on I'll post it in the comments down below and if you're looking for additional practice why don't you post a program that you worked on that involves a 2d array but yeah that is how to do rays work in C++ hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
