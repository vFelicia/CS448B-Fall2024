hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can insert data into a MySQL table using PHP at this point in the series I am assuming that you have already established a connection to your mySQL database if you haven't here's some code that will do that in my index file I have included the code to connect my database at the end of my script I am going to close this connection just because I know for a fact I'm going to forget to mention that so I'm doing it now to close a connection you can type my sqli underscore close then pass in the connection our connection is underlined because vs code doesn't recognize it because we're including it from another file but it should work just fine now what we're going to do is write an SQL query I'll store that within a variable SQL this will hold our query So within quotes we can write some SQL query of your choosing we'll do a basic insert insert into the name of the database my databases users then list the columns I will insert a username and a password list the column user password then some values we're going to start with just some plain text my username will be SpongeBob for my password let's say SpongeBob's password is pineapple1 then to submit the query we can use the my sqli underscore query function then pass in our connection and our SQL query and that's it again vs code isn't going to recognize our connection because we're importing it if I were to run this query then refresh PHP in my admin we have our submission user ID of one it's set to Auto increment in this case the user is SpongeBob password pineapple and here's the registration date I set the registration date to be a current timestamp yes I am recording at two in the morning because I'm crazy let's say that for some reason we can't register a user maybe I forget a password well we get this fatal error fatal error uncaught mysqli exception we can surround our query with the try block we can try this code if there's any exceptions or errors that pop up we can handle them gracefully let's create a try block we will try some possibly dangerous code then handle any exceptions if they come up if this query is successful then let's Echo user is now registered if we encounter a problem let's catch that the exception we're catching is this one I'm going to copy it paste it then we will Echo could not register user oops I gotta fix that all right let's try this again my query is not technically correct but we should be able to handle that exception could not register a user as you can see here with our SQL query let's insert some variables let's declare two let's declare a username username equals Squidward this time and a password equals clarinet 2. with our values within single quotes we will list our variables username and password let's see if this works user is now registered then if we head to phpmyadmin refresh this table we now have an entry for Squidward with the password of clarinet2 art passwords are plain text it would be much better if we were to store a hash of a password just because you know these are plain text it's not secure so let's hash our password we'll create a hash equals we will use the password hash function the two arguments are the password and an option for an algorithm we will use the default password default technically we're using the bcrypt algorithm that's the default currently we will insert our username and our hash in place of our password let's change the username though let's assign Patrick his password will be rock3 let's see if this works okay refresh PHP my admin and there is Patrick user ID3 username is Patrick here's the hash of the password and the registration date all right everybody so that's how to insert data into a MySQL table using PHP
