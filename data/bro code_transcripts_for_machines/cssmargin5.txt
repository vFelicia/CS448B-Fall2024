hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be teaching you guys about margins in css so let's get into it well let's begin with margins margins are used to create space around an element and it can be easy to mix up margins with padding because they both perform a similar task so to begin let's add some sample text to our web page let's create a heading i'll use an h1 heading and i will write down margin demo and let's close this and we'll probably want a sample paragraph if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem hit tab and i'm going to surround this with a pair of paragraph tags so we need an opening paragraph tag and a closing paragraph tag i'm also going to give this paragraph tag a unique id and i'm just going to call this p1 we're going to have a few different paragraphs and we'll name each of these like p1 and then p2 and p3 and we'll follow that order and we're going to line these all up differently depending on the margins that we set let's save this reload the page and here is our sample text let's go to our style sheet and just make a few changes so let's add a border around each of these elements because with a border it's going to be much easier to see the difference between padding and margins so let's make some changes to our h1 heading let's add a border that is one pixel thick and is solid and perhaps i'll give this a width too so maybe 300 pixels and let's target all paragraph elements we'll also give this a border one pixel is good and we'll make the solid and let's give this a width as well maybe 250 pixels all right let's see what this looks like and now we have a border around our h1 header tag and our paragraph tags so let's add some padding just so we can see the difference between padding and margins so within our paragraph tag we're going to add some padding using the padding property and 25 pixels should work for this so remember that padding is the distance between an item within an element and where a border would be so think of it like you're receiving a package like think of this like a box this is your item that you're receiving in your package like you're receiving it in the mail and the padding is like the bubble wrap or the styrofoam that's keeping your items safe when it's being shipped and margins are the distance from an html element to other html elements or the edge of the browser window so let's add a margin around our paragraph element so we'll just type that here margin and then we can add maybe 25 pixels so this will add space around all sides of an element that has a margin and you can see that after we reloaded the webpage we now have extra space around this paragraph element so that's the main difference between padding and margins padding is the distance from an item within an element to where the border would be and the margin is the distance from where the border would be to either other html elements or the edge of the web browser and if you were to take a look on your web page you'll probably notice that there's a little bit of spacing at the top of your web page and on the left hand side so there's already some margin already on your html document so it is possible to use negative margins to pull items in closer together so what we'll do here is that we'll target the html tags and we're going to add a negative margin and you can also specify a specific side so we can just say the margin at the top and we can give this negative 21 pixels and that should be just enough to pull this to the very top of the web browser window now we still have this margin on the left hand side so to target that we'll just type in margin dash left and that is about negative 8 pixels so after adding negative margins we can actually pull html elements closer together too if i were to take this margin within the paragraph tag and i switched this to negative 25 this would actually begin to overlap but i don't like that so i'm going to change it back to what it was originally with 25 pixels for the margin so that's a very basic way of adding margins to an html element you just use the margin property and the amount of space that you want to surround this html element with so let's create a few different examples with different techniques to add margins so this time i'm going to target the p1 tag and i'm just going to move a few things around so i'm just going to move this margin to the p1 tag and i think i'll keep this the same then so this should be the same all right so let's take our paragraph our first one we're going to copy this and we're going to change p1 to p2 for the second paragraph and this time we're going to target the p2 id so we can add margins to different borders around an html element we kind of did that with the negative margins that we had so with p2 let's target the top maybe we'll add 25 pixels there's margin dash right maybe 75 pixels margin dash bottom 25 pixels again you don't have to use the same numbers that i do feel free to change these if you want and margin dot left or margin dash left 75 pixels okay let's see what this looks like yeah you can see there's a little more spacing on the left hand side and the right hand side but not so much on the top or bottom because we only gave ourselves 25 pixels worth the margin compared to the left and the right that has 75 so there's an alternative way to write this that's shorthand so i'm actually going to write a note here that says this is the same so a shorthand way of writing all this is that you just type in the margin property and then we're going to list four fields here the first is the amount of pixels for the top second is for the right hand side so margin right then third is the bottom and the fourth is the left so this is the exact same thing as what we did up here just in less steps so this would look exactly the same as what we had originally do let's create another paragraph for our next example i'm going to copy our p2 paragraph paste it and we'll change the id to p3 let's save reload the page all right now this is the one that we want to add margins to so on our css sheet we're going to target the p3 id and we can also list a percentage for a margin for example we can list maybe 10 percent now the margin is going to change depending on the size of the browser window so currently it's set to 10 if we were to change this to maybe 20 you can see that the change is going to be more drastic and it's going to adjust dynamically depending on the size of the window let's create another paragraph so i'm going to copy this and we'll create a p4 id let's save that and we'll type in number sign p4 all right so you can also have your um paragraph or other html element have an automatic margin so for example if we typed in margin dash left and set this to auto what would happen is that this element would actually stick to the right hand side but i think our previous paragraph is actually messing with its positioning so i'm going to comment this out for now all right so yeah you can see here that this paragraph is now sticking to the right hand side because we set margin left to auto so it's going to stay on the right hand side no matter what the size of the browser window is and likewise we can do the same thing for a margin right auto it would stick to the left hand side and let's change this to p5 and we'll copy our p4 paragraph and change this to p5 okay now the p5 paragraph is sticking to the left hand side of our browser window lastly we can have margin just set to auto and let's use this for a p6 paragraph tag so margin auto and this will vertically center an html element so let's copy this paragraph and paste it and then we're going to change the id to p6 so let's save this and reload the page now this is our p6 paragraph and both the left and the right margins are set to auto so this will stay in the center of your web page it'll vertically stay centered no matter how large the browser window is then so a lot of people like to do this they set their margins to auto so this will stay in the middle of the webpage well that's the basics of margins in css if you would like a copy of all the markup that we worked on today i'll post this in the comments down below and pin it to the top but yeah that is the basics of margins in css hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and
