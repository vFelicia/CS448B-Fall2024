hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain nested loops in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey all you people let's talk about nested loops a nested loop is a general concept of having one loop inside of another loop and that's really it doesn't matter if it's a for loop or a while loop so the inner loop will finish all of its iterations before we finish one iteration of the outer loop and to best demonstrate this we're going to create a program where we will draw a rectangle made out of a certain symbol that we choose we need to set a width and a height and to best do this we'll need to use a nested loop we'll create a few prompts one for rows columns and a symbol that we want to make a rectangle of so let's begin with rows rows equals input how many rows and we'll need to cast this as an integer data type because we're working with numbers okay let's do the same thing for columns so replace rows with columns for this next line input how many columns and we'll create a symbol variable symbol equals input and this we don't have to cast enter a symbol to use now it's time for the nested loops we're going to create an outer for loop as well as an inner for loop the outer for loop will be in charge of the rows the inner for loop will be in charge of the columns so let's begin by creating our outer loop so we'll write 4 i in range rows we would like our outer for loop to iterate as many times as we have rows and we're going to create an inner for loop that will iterate as many times as we have columns so within the block of code for the outer for loop we're going to create another for loop this time it'll be four and a common convention for inner loops is to write j as an index because j comes after i i guess so for j in range columns so our inner for loop will iterate for as many times as we have columns all we'll do within the inner for loop is print our symbol that we have except we'll have one issue using a print statement after we use the print statement we will enter a new line character in and move down to the next line we can actually prevent that by adding comma and equals quotes so after using a print statement this will prevent our cursor from moving down to the next line so pay attention to the indentation too so there's kind of two levels of indentation we're currently within the inner for loop so that's pretty much it for the inner for loop now we're going to print a new line once we exit the inner for loop and you can see that the indentation is on this line right here we're within the outer for loop now and that's pretty much it so let's try this program how many rows let's say five rows how many columns perhaps six what symbol do we want to use let's say the dollar sign and let's try it there we go there's our rectangle so we have let's see six columns one two three four five six and five rows one two three four five in summary a nested loop is really just this concept of having one loop inside of another loop it doesn't matter if it's a while loop or a for loop it's really situational the inner loop will finish all of its iterations before finishing one iteration of the outer loop so what we did to demonstrate that is that we had the outer loop in charge the rows and an inner loop in charge of the columns for our rectangle program so if you would like a copy of this program i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's the basics of nested loops in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
