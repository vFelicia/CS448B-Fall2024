hey welcome back in this video i'm going to explain the span and div tags let's begin with span span adds markup to text or portion of a document anything that i surround with a pair of spam tags i can apply markup or some effect too so in my example document i have a header and three paragraphs what if i would like this specific sentence to be i don't know red well what i could do is surround this sentence in my document with a pair of spam tags so i need an opening spam tag and a closing spam tag and that sentence ends right here and within the span tag i can change some of the attributes of this sentence um so i would like to change maybe the style i'll set the style color equal to red now you probably do want this closing tag if you do not have this closing tag your span will take up this entire section so basically that's what span is it adds markup to text or a portion of a document div is very similar except it divides a division of a document so what if i would like to change the background color of these three paragraphs well what we learned in the last video on colors is that we could set the style background color equal to some shade of gray maybe this value this does work and i could just copy this and paste it for each of these paragraphs or another way of doing this is that i can surround these three paragraphs with a pair of div tags so we need an opening div tag and a closing div tag and then i will apply this style attribute to the opening div tag and it will apply this attribute to anything between these div tags so yeah that's basically what the span and div tags do span adds markup to text or portion of a document div defines a division of a document so yeah that's span and div in html
