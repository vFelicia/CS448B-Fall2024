all right people so now that we know how to create an array of strings i thought this would be a good opportunity for us to create a quiz game so before we begin make sure to include these two header files at the top of your program so let's begin with a 2d array of characters and these will store our questions and i'm going to set a maximum size for each question to 100 bytes and we can go ahead and initialize this array with some questions so remember with strings each string is its own array so let's ask maybe three questions but feel free to pick any amount that you like and come up with any questions you would like as well or you can copy me i don't care what year did the c language debut then separate each string with a comma then just to make this more readable i'm going to go down to the next line so this is question two now who is credited with creating c and one more question what is the predecessor of c so now we have some questions we'll need some options this could be a separate 2d character array char options and i'll copy the dimensions from questions and we'll create four sets of options for each question this is the first set of options for the first question and then let's add a second set of options for the second question and a third set now we'll create an answer key this will be a onedimensional array so char answers and the size will be three and i will set this equal to my answer key so the correct answers for my quiz are b a b so these will be individual characters all separated with a comma b a b so let's calculate the number of questions that we have so i will declare int number of questions and set the sequel to sizeof operator pass in our twodimensional array of questions and divide this by one of the elements because they all have the same size questions at index zero and let's declare char guess to store our guess and int score to keep track of the player's score so now let's begin this i will print the title quiz game then add a new line okay now we need to loop through all of the questions so let's use a for loop so we will have an index of i set to zero and i would like to loop through this as long as i is less than the number of questions that we have then increment i by one and to test this let's print our questions so printf we're displaying a string so use the s format specifier questions add index of i and then i'll add a new line character after each printf statement okay let's at least test this so we should cycle through our questions okay here are my questions what year did the c language debut who is credited with creating c what is the predecessor of c and this part isn't necessary but i'm going to add some text decorations i'll just display a bunch of asterisks i'll do that before and after the question and let's try that again oh then add a new line character that's a little bit better after our question let's display the possible options so we will need a nested for loop so four now this parts can be a little bit tricky we need to begin our for loop at every fourth string within our for loop let's set int j equal to i times four so during the first iteration i will be zero so zero times four is zero but during the next iteration of the outer for loop i is going to equal one so one times four is four so that way we will begin the inner for loop with every fourth string within our 2d array of options and the condition is going to be j is less than i times four and then we would like to display four strings this for loop will cycle four times beginning at every fourth string and then we need to increment j by one now let's print every option so this is a string i'll add a new line and we are printing options at index of j and let's test this just to be sure that it works okay so we have our question followed by four possible options now let's accept some user input after the nested for loop currently our program isn't going to wait around for any user input that's why i displayed all the questions and options okay we will create a prompt to have a user type in a guess guess and we will use scanf to accept some user input we are accepting a single character and use the address of operator guess now let me show you what happens when we run this real quick so i'm just going to type in anything let's say a okay so we skipped question two that's because after using scanf when we accept a character we have that new line character within the input buffer so we need to clear that so one way in which we can clear that is to use scanf again use the c format specifier and that's it so this will clear the new line character from input buffer so this should no longer just skip question two okay let's say a b c okay so we know we can accept some user input now now here's one thing what if somebody types in a lowercase character i think that should still count even though we're looking for an uppercase character so let's take our guess and use the two upper function to make it uppercase guess equals 2 upper then pass in yes so basically we're passing in our guess making it uppercase and reassigning it to our guess and let's write an if else statement to check our guess if it's equal to our answer so if else our condition within our if statement if guess is equal to answer at index of i remember that we're still within the for loop the outer for loop so we have that index oh that's answers plural if a user's guess is equal to the answer then let's print correct and then give them one point so printf correct and then increment our score score plus plus else we will print wrong and you can give the correct answer if you would like just do that within here now once we cycle through all of the questions we can display a user score so be sure to do that outside of the for loop the outer for loop that is so let's use printf and display final score so i'm going to display two values so the first will be the player score divided by the number of questions so we have two integers to work with and we are displaying score and number of questions and then if you want you can add some text decoration to make it look cool so i'm going to run through this quiz once and intentionally get one question wrong so what year did the c language debut that would be 1972 that's b who is credited with creating c uh let's say doc brown so d and what is the predecessor of c that would be b okay and my final score is two out of three so let's try that again and this time i will try and get 100 so the correct answer is b a dennis ritchie and b and my final score is three out of three so yeah i thought that would be a simple quiz game in c if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's a simple quiz game in c
