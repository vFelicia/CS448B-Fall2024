hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can work with radio buttons in PHP let's get started to begin we'll need an HTML form I'm pretty sure you know how to create that already within our HTML form the action attribute will be set to our PHP file the method will be post to create a single radio button we can use a selfclosing input tag set the type equal to B radio let's select a credit card I will set the first radio button to have a value of Visa here's our little radio button I'll add some text afterwards let's say Visa then I will add a line break okay let's copy these two lines of markup paste these twice then change the second radio button to be MasterCard then the third will be American Express so let's change these values here are three radio buttons but we have a problem we can select more than one radio button if we would like these within the same group we only ever should be able to select one at a time we need a name attribute name equals let's say credit card be sure to set this attribute for all of the three radio buttons they all need the same name there we can only select one now if these had a different name such as credit card 1 Credit Card 2 credit card three well they're technically all in different groups we need them all in the same group to select only one then lastly let's add a submit button input type equals submit then name may be confirmed it's a confirm button we're confirming some payment type for the value I will set that to be confirm as well now when I click on this button I would like to Output a message depending on which radio button is selected Let's test to see that everything's working fine though I will create a local variable named credit card I will set credit card equal to now to get one of these values we need to use the post variable whatever we set for the method access post the key we are looking for is credit card whatever the name attribute is set to the name of the group now when I run and reload this we have an undefined array key credit card which is to be expected we're running our PHP script but we have not yet set the credit card key let's enclose our code with an if statement we'll check to see if our confirm button is pressed is it set if it is then assign our variable if parentheses curly braces we will use the is set function which we learned about in the last topic we would like to check to see if our confirm button is set let's access post the key we are looking for is confirm whatever the name is if we press the button then assign our variable of credit card then let's Echo our credit card for testing purposes Echo credit card let's see what happens I'm going to press the confirm button then we get that warning which is a step in the right direction if I make a selection then press confirm we will Echo whatever value is stored within our credit card variable it's going to be one of these three values either Visa Mastercard or American Express before assigning the variable I would like this warning to not display after pressing the confirm button instead let's display a message please select a credit card or something let's create a nested if statement we will use the is set function again this time let's check to see if our credit card is set if our credit card is set then get the value and store it within a variable then for testing let's Echo that credit card if our credit card is not set we can execute an else statement else let's Echo please make a selection if I don't make a selection then press confirm we will Echo this message please make a selection in order to continue we need to make a selection let's select Visa we will output Visa MasterCard then American Express currently we have a variable credit card that has one of these three values one thing you could do with this variable is check to see if it's equal to a certain value I'm going to change my program around a little bit if we press the confirm button and one of these radio buttons is selected then assign our variable let's get rid of this Echo I'll add some if and else if statements this is just for demonstration purposes if our credit card is equal to Visa then let's Echo you selected Visa let's add an else if statement else if credit card is equal to MasterCard you selected MasterCard else if credit card is equal to American Express you selected American Express then else if credit card doesn't equal one of these three matches then let's Echo please make a selection all right let's see what happens currently if I make a selection such as Visa we will Echo you selected Visa you selected MasterCard you selected American Express but currently if I press the confirm button without making a selection we have some warnings that our credit card variable is undefined but we still execute the else Clause as you can see here one change I'll make is that let's declare our variable credit card but we won't assign it a value credit card equals null then we won't receive that warning that credit card is undefined we have declared it I'll press confirm please make a selection I can select one of these credit cards and we will display a message in this circumstance I would probably use a switch we're comparing some value against many matching cases I think a switch would be more efficient so let's create a switch for practice within our switch we are examining our credit card we will examine our credit card against matching cases Visa if our credit card is equal to Visa then let's Echo you selected Visa then add a break statement to break out of the switch let's do this for MasterCard add a case for MasterCard MasterCard you selected MasterCard then American Express American Express you selected American Express then a default case if there are no matching cases let's Echo please make a selection so if I press confirm we will Echo please make a selection if I select Visa you selected Visa you selected MasterCard you selected American Express all right everybody so those are a few different ways in which you can work with radio buttons in PHP to get the value of a given radio button group you can use the post variable then access that key whatever the name is then you can assign the value to a local variable to work with and you can do whatever you want with it in this case I just used the switch and well everybody those are a few different ways in which you can work with radio buttons in PHP
