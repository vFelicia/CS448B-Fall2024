hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can retrieve data from a mySQL database using PHP I have already established a MySQL connection I'm going to include that file that establishes the connection then at the end of my script I will close that connection with the MySQL close function the first thing we'll do is write an SQL query I will store that within a variable named SQL in my table I would like to select a user let's select SpongeBob the query would look something like this let's select let's say everything from our table which I named users where if you don't write a where Clause your query is going to return more than one row I'll show you how we can handle that later select all from users where user is equal to SpongeBob but put that within single quotes this is our SQL query to make a query we can use the my sqli worry function we will pass in our connection object then our query SQL if successful this function will return an object we will store that as a variable named result so result is technically an object somewhere within this object there's an associative array to find how many rows are returned from our query function we can place that within an if statement we will use this function mysqli underscore num rows function this function will return how many rows are within our result really it should only be one in this example if there's at least one result we could write a condition such as if the number of rows is greater than zero there's at least one matching row to get that Row from our result let's store that within a variable named row set this equal to the my sqli underscore fetch underscore Asos for associative then pass in our result this function Returns the next available row within our object our row is an associative array we can access this data by a key then be returned one of the values let's Echo row at index of ID then I'll add a break afterwards let's see what we have we have the user ID of one let's get the username I think it's just user one SpongeBob then the registration date reg date so these are the names of the columns yeah here's SpongeBob's ID is username and the registration date those were the fields found within our table now if there are no results let's say we're looking for Sandy well we don't do anything let's add an else clause else else let's Echo no results found or maybe no user found no user found that's how to retrieve one row from a table what if you need to retrieve multiple rows we can make some adjustments we would want to utilize a loop I'll enclose this line of code within a while loop while there are rows we will display each user's information let's get rid of the where Clause we will return every user you would just need a looping structure of some sort to Loop through each row within your result alright everybody so that's how to query data from a database you write an SQL query use the query function this returns an object then you'll need to get each row from the object and then you can do that with this function if you need to return more than one row you can stick that within a loop like a while loop and that is how to query data from a mySQL database in PHP
