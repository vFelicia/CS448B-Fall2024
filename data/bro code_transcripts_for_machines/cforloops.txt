hey yeah welcome back so we have to talk about for loops a for loop repeats a section of code a limited amount of times here's an example let's say that we would like to count the numbers 1 through 10. so we can actually write a for loop to do that for us and here's how to create one type 4 a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces anything within this set of curly braces we can repeat a limited amount of times but before we do so there's a few statements we have to add to our for loop there are three the first is that we need some sort of counter or index and we can actually declare that within the for loop so we will declare an index int index and set this equal to some number let's say one so we will start at one and count to ten and then finish the statement with a semicolon now a common convention is that a lot of people will shorten index to i because it's easier to work with so this is the first statement there's two more and the second statement is a condition how long should we continue repeating this code so let's continue this for loop as long as i our index is less than or equal to 10 and then add a semicolon at the end so that is the second statement and the third statement is that we can increment or decrement our counter so let's take i and increment it by one after each iteration by using i plus plus so let's just test this so printf i'll just print the word test so this should print the word test 10 times then we should add a new line character at the end that's much better okay now let's replace test with a format specifier we're displaying an integer and let's display i our index and this should count from one to ten yep just like that one through ten so with this third statement we can increment or decrement by one or a greater number so this time let's count by two so we can set this to i plus equals two and we will now count up by two starting from one one three five seven nine or how about three one four seven ten you can also decrement this time let's count from 10 to 1 so let's set i to equal 10 and we will continue this as long as i is greater than or equal to 1 and we will decrement i minus minus so this will count from ten to one and then stop or we could count down by two i minus equals two then we have ten eight six four two or even three or a greater number so yeah that's a for loop it repeats a section of code a limited amount of times there's up to three statements that we can add we can declare an index a counter so to say some condition that we check after each iteration and then some way to increment or decrement our index and then place any code you would like to repeat within a set of curly braces so yeah that's a for loop if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are for loops in c
