hey everybody so in this video i'm going to show you how we can create an array of structs let's say we're working with students and we need to print each student's name and gpa so let's create a struct outside of our main function type struct and then a tag name for the struct let's say student so each student will have a name and a gpa so let's create a character array named name i'll set a maximum size of maybe 12 characters and a gpa that could be a float so float gpa now let's initialize some structs we type struct followed by the tag name and then some variable name to identify each struct so let's say we will have four students overall and i'll go ahead and assign some values right away when we initialize this struct so we need a name and a gpa so the first student let's say is spongebob and spongebob has a gpa of 3.0 so we can copy this and create a few more students so student one student two student three and student four next we have patrick patrick has a 2.5 then sandy sandy is smart so she has a 4.0 and squidward squidward has a 2.0 so we have four students now we will create an array so the data type of our array what it's containing will be structs it will be struct student it's kind of like the data type so with an array you have to declare what you're going to be putting within the array struct students and then we need an array name so this will be students and then specify a maximum size if you need one but i'm just going to initialize this array with some students so let's add student one student two student three and a student four and there we go we have an array of structs now if i would like to display each student's name i can use a for loop to loop through our array so for curly braces we will create an index into i set this equal to zero we will loop through this as long as i is less than and then we need to calculate how many elements are within our array so we have four elements but we can do that by using the size of operator pass in our array and then divide this by the size of one of these elements size of students and then pick maybe the first element of zero after each iteration we will increment i by one so then within our for loop let's print each student's name so let's use the s format specifier to display a string and we will display our array at index of i whatever our counter is and we will use the member axis operator of dot so follow students at index of i with a dot then we have access to a name and a gpa so let's display each student's name and then i'll add a new line after each printf statement so there we go we have spongebob patrick sandy and squidward now let's display each student's gpa so let's copy this line we are displaying a float so the format specifier for afloat is f students at index of i dot gpa then i'll get rid of that new line character and let's take a look to see what we have okay we can see each student's name and gpa but we may want to format this so after each student's name i'll add a tab and i'll allocate maybe 12 characters to display each student's name and then left justify it and then with our gpa let's display two digits after the decimal so i will add dot two so this should look better yeah that's much more organized so we have spongebob with the gpa of 3.0 patrick with 2.5 sandy with 4.0 and squidward with a 2.0 so yeah that's how to create an array of structs if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to create an array of structs in c
