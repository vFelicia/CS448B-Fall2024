all right everybody so in today's video I'm going to explain how we can create a table using phpmyadmin there's two ways to get here you can either go to your zamp control panel then press this admin button next to mySQL or you can head to this URL to create a table let's go to our databases we should have a database already created in the last video we created a database named businessdb so let's click on it let's begin by creating a table name I'll create a table of users these will be registered users then set the number of columns I'll stick with four then we will hit the create button in this column we will set the name of each column our first column will be for user IDs let's name this column ID we will set the data type to be int we won't specify a length if you would like a default value you can set that here we're going to use the ID field to be set to Auto increment you can set the characters but we will keep that as the default like for some reason if you need I don't know Greek you can use Greek but let's just use the default to add an index you can do that here we will set our ID to be our primary index then I will click the Go Button to enable auto increment on a column you can check the AI button it's for auto increment that should be it for this column let's create a column for usernames the column name will be user for the data type let's say varchar then set a Max size I think 25 is good for our users let's have each user be unique then press go then let's move on to the next column this will be for passwords for the data type let's set that to be char which is right here I recommend hashing passwords in our database we won't be storing plain text passwords in case you know we get hacked or in case somebody uses SQL injection we'll be storing a hash of a password I'll set the size to be 255. encrypting and hashing algorithms are always changing and updating let's future proof our password field just by setting it to something large then let's add a registration date maybe we'll name the column register underscore date let's select not just date but date time I want to know the time that they register for the default let's use a current timestamp that should be good for our table if you would like some SQL code you can preview the SQL this is what we would be writing but we're going to be doing this automatically with phpmyadmin so let's save and we now have our table if I were to go to browse this is our table but there's currently no rows we'll be adding some rows with PHP but for testing purposes let's insert one manually using phpmyadmin so we will insert some test values with our ID it's set to Auto increment we don't necessarily need to put in a value for the user let's say the user is SpongeBob and for the password his password will be pineapple one you can also encrypt this password using password hash we'll cover hashing passwords in the next video with our registration date this is set to a current timestamp so that's going to be done automatically let's press go this would be the SQL query but yeah one row has been inserted let's go back to our table the username is SpongeBob password is pineapple1 and here is the registration date well date and time then to delete a row you can click this delete button then press ok and that is how to create a table in phpmyadmin and in the next topic we will be inserting some rows into our table using PHP
