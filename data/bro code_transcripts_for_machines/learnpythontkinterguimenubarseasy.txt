hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a menu bar in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people let's create a menu bar not too different from the menu bar that you see at the top of many programs there's usually a tab for file edit view help stuff like that except we're going to create one that doesn't have as many options or features it's going to be the generic brand menu bar like the walmart variety so let's begin by creating a window so window equals tk followed by window.main then we're going to create a menu bar and add menus to the menu bar and each menu is going to function like a dropdown menu where you hover over one of these tabs and there's a dropdown so we need a menu bar let's just call this menu bar menu bar equals menu and we're adding this to our window so then we're going to take window dot config and we can set the menu of this window to equal the menu bar that we just created with each of these tabs for your menu bar you need to create a separate menu and add each menu to your menu bar and the menu bar is added to the window there's different levels to this stuff so let's create a file menu because well this one has a file menu why not our program so file menu equals menu kind of like what we did with our menu bar except instead of adding this to our window we're going to add this to our menu bar so menu bar like that there's one other step too we need to use this function menu bar dot add underscore cascade this will have a drop down menu sort of effect so let's create a label just called file to mimic the file tab that you see at the top of many programs so label file and we're going to set the menu to equal the file menu that we created so file menu and let's take a look just to see what we have so here's our menu bar and here's our menu there's a drop down effect for this but we need to add actual options to this file menu so let's do that so let's begin by creating let's see we got maybe open save and exit that should be good so file menu dot add underscore command so this is a clickable option and let's create a label called open and we can open a file and maybe two more so we got open save and exit open save exit and let's take a look at this so here's the drop down menu we can open save exit now you might notice that there is this annoying line this is called a tear off you can actually get rid of this if you want so when we create this file menu we're going to set tear off to equal zero and that should get rid of that and it's gone so sometimes you might see a line to separate sections well you can do that with a separator so let's separate the exit command that we have from open and save and to add that separator we just type in the name of our menu file menu dot add separator so this will separate your different commands from each other within a menu you can see that there is a line between save and exit because we placed a separator here now if you want each of these file commands to actually do something you need to associate a command with each of these commands it's a command within a command so command equals for our open file command will create a function called open file and we'll need to declare that function and then let's create a command called save file and then another called exit actually one shortcut if you want to exit something you can just say quit all right let's create an open file and a save file function so def open file let's just print something just to keep this simple i already have another video on opening files so print file has been opened and let's do the same thing for save file file has been saved and then our last command exit will just quit so let's try this so let's go to file here's the drop down menu we can open a file file has been opened we can save a file and then exit and exit will close out of our window let's create a second menu called edit to mimic the one that we have at the top of our ide so let's create a edit menu so it's the same process that we did with our file menu so let's call this edit menu equals menu we're adding this to our menu bar and i do not want a tear off so tear off equals zero then for the next line we need to add cascade so i'm going to copy this menu bar dot add cascade the label name will be edit and the file i mean the menu will be edit menu and we're setting this menu that we're adding to edit menu and let's try this so we have file and edit but we need to add commands to this edit menu so it's the same process that we did with our file menu i'm just going to copy this change file to edit and let's make a command called cut copy and paste so the label will be cut we'll create a command called cut we'll copy this and we'll create a another command called copy and then paste all right then we just need to create some functions for this so cut copy paste let's do that at the top so cut you cut some text so cut copy and then paste you copied some text and paste you pasted some text all right let's try this so here's our edit menu here's the drop down we can cut we can copy and we can paste not actually but it's going to call a function that can do something like that if you want to set that up maybe that's a video for a different day let's customize these menus well because we can so let's begin by changing the font so we can just type in within each of these menus font equals pick a font that you want and then a size so i'm going to add this font for both of these menus that we have and then when we hover over and click on these menus you can see that the font has changed did you guys know that you can actually add images next to each of these commands well you can and this is how we can do that first you'll need some images here's a few that i'm using so add these to your project folder i plan on using a floppy disk for save and open folder for open and for some reason a stop sign for exit because i couldn't really think of anything at the moment i guess an arrow would work too i guess so let's create some photo images out of these images so i already did this i'm just going to copy and paste the text that i had so create a unique name for each image i have open image save image and exit image they're all photo images and here is the file path or the file name for each of these pictures that i'm using so to add an image to each of these commands when you add the command we can just say image and then the photo image that you want to use so with my open command i'm going to use this open image photo image that i have and this is the open folder so i'm going to do the same thing for save and exit so we have save image and exit image but when we run and compile this let's take a look yeah so all the text is gone that's going to be a problem so we'll need to compound views so with compound we can add an image on a certain side of the text and keep the text so compound let's say we want the image on the left so compound left and i'm just going to add this to each of these commands and now we should have an image as well as some text well that's the basics of creating a menu bar in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how you can create a simple menu bar in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
