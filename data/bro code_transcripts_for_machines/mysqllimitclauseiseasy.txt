hello it's me again today I will be explaining the limit Clause the limit Clause is used to limit the number of records that are quarried it's very useful if you're working with a lot of data one use is that you can display a large data set on different pages also known as pagination here's an example I have a few customers not very many I'm working with a small data set if I would ever need to limit the amount of customers that are displayed I can add a limit Clause then set how many I would like to display I would like the first customer limit one that would return Fred fish in my example if I need the first two that would be Fred then Larry three is Fred Larry bubble that's kind of a weird first name and then four would be poppy currently these records are organized by customer ID we could combine the limit Clause with the order by clause let's order by last name then limit one that would return bubble bass it's in alphabetical order or we could do last name descending limit one poppy puff has the name and least alphabetical order I guess basically speaking limit limits the number of records that are returned it's very useful in combination with the order by clause which we learned about in the previous topic now with the limit Clause you can add an offset limit one one the first number is the offset limit to one record after the first that should technically return Larry Lobster yep Larry so limit two would add an offset of two which returns bubble Bass limit three would return poppy puff using an offset would be very helpful when working with a large data set if you need to display your records on different pages suppose that our data set is maybe 100 customers I need to display 10 customers per page so the first 10 would be just limit 10. but you know my data set's really small so it's not going to be apparent if I need the next set of 10 customers I can add an offset of 10. although I don't have that many customers to begin with the next set of 10 customers would be an offset of 20 then displayed 10 you know then 30 40 so on and so forth so yeah that's the limit Clause you will limit the results that are queried type limit then some number you could add an offset so display some number of Records after an offset but yeah that is the limit clause in MySQL
