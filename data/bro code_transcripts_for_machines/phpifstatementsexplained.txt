hey welcome back everybody in today's video I'm going to discuss if statements in PHP with the if statement we have a condition if some condition is true we can do something we can run some code however if that condition is false then we don't do it here's a situation suppose we have a website but you have to be 18 years or older to enter we can write a program to check somebody's age let's say we have a variable age age will equal make up a number 21. to write a if statement I would type if then I'll need a condition within parentheses what are we checking let's check to see if our variable age is greater than or equal to 18 then after the set of parentheses add a set of curly braces if this condition is true we can execute some code if it's false we skip over this code so if our age is greater than or equal to 18 let's Echo you may enter this site so I'm going to save run this program you may enter the site what if this condition was false maybe my age is 15. in our if statement this condition is false that means we do not execute this code we skip over it as if it never even happened if you would rather do some other code at the end of your if statement you can add else then add a set of curly braces if this condition is false then skip over this code and execute the else statement instead let's Echo you must be 18 plus 2 enter let's save and here's our other message you must be 18 plus to enter if I were to change age to 21 something that's above or equal to 18 well we execute the first statement this portion of our if statement you may enter the site if this is true do this if not do this instead between if and else you can add else if else if add a set of parentheses and a set of curly braces if our condition is false we would then check any else if statements before resorting to the else statement let's also check if age is equal to zero double equals is the comparison operator you could check to see if two values are equal you don't want to use a single equal sign because that is the assignment operator PHP thinks you're assigning age to be zero use double equals for comparison if somebody's age is zero then let's Echo a different message you were just born I will set variable age to be zero save you were just born this condition was false we skip it this condition was true so we execute it we never reached the else statement however somebody types in negative one well then we resort to the else statement because both of these conditions are false let's change our else if statement let's say else if age is less than or equal to zero let's change this message that wasn't a valid age negative one is not a valid age just to be funny what if we said you were too old too old to enter this site I'll add another else if statement just to demonstrate that we can add multiple else if statements else if age is greater than or equal to 100. then we will Echo you are too old to enter this site if I were to set age to be 101 the result states that you may enter this site the reason that we're executing this if statement and not this else if statement is because starting from the top we check the if statement first if it's false we continue down the line until we reach else age is 101 since this statement is technically true we would execute this code then skip everything else the order of your if and else if statements does matter I'm going to move this section of code to the beginning and make it the if statement first let's check to see if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 100 I will change this section to be else if and that should work you are too old to enter the site you do need to pay attention to the order of your conditions I'll give you another example if statements also work with Boolean variables and values we have a variable adult adult will equal a Boolean value of either true or false let's set that to be true with your condition you can check to see if your variable is equal use double equals for comparison true or false if adult is equal to true then we will Echo you may enter this site adult is true you may enter the site if adult is false then nothing happens so let's add else Echo you must be an adult to enter you must be an adult to enter now there is a shorthand if you're using the comparison operator followed by a Boolean value you could just write the Boolean variable itself that is also valid and that's my preferred way of using Boolean variables within a condition if adult do something so let's set adult to be true you may enter this site if it's false you must be an adult to enter so that is the second example let's go over and exercise we will create a program to calculate somebody's pay including overtime we will need three variables hours I'll set that to be 40 to begin with they're working fulltime a rate as in a rate of pay this person is making fifteen dollars per hour and then a weekly pay I will set that to be null to begin with depending on somebody's hours they may or may not make overtime pay or if they work zero hours they don't receive any pay this week first let's calculate their weekly pay if they work 40 hours or less if hours is less than or equal to 40 then we will calculate our weekly pay with this formula it's only hours times their rate rate of pay then at the end let's Echo you made at our placeholder this week within our placeholder let's display the weekly pay variable pick your unit of currency I'll use American dollars I'll need to add an escape sequence 40 times 15 I think that's 600. you made six hundred dollars this week if we worked 20 hours then we make half of that three hundred dollars what if somebody doesn't work this week you made zero dollars this week what if somebody enters in a negative amount of hours like negative one well somebody made negative money this week let's write a condition to prevent that let's add an if statement then change this statement to be an else if statement if somebody is ours are less than or equal to zero then let's set weekly pay to be zero just in case somebody enters in a negative amount of hours because you can't work a negative amount even if somebody enters in a negative number like negative one or negative 10 our message still displays zero which is what we want lastly let's calculate overtime pay we'll do this within an else statement here's the formula let's set weekly pay equal to the first 40 hours are going to be at the standard rate let's take our rate times 40. then we will add within a set of parentheses we need to calculate the overtime pay maybe an employee Works 50 hours this week let's take hours minus 40. I'm going to add another set of parentheses around this multiplied by rate times 1.5 because with overtime pay at least in the United States I believe you make one and a half times your pay your hourly rate of pay if an employee Works 50 hours this week their new weekly pay will be 825 dollars that is an exercise involving if statements and those are if statements in PHP
