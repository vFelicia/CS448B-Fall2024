hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain Auto commit commit and rollback Auto commit is a mode by default Auto commit is set to on whenever you execute a transaction within MySQL that transaction is saved what if we were to make a transaction and we need to undo that transaction for example what if we accidentally delete all of the rows of this table don't do what I do but I'll give you a demonstration I accidentally type in delete from employees but I forget to add a where Clause well all my rows are now gone how do I undo these changes well what we're going to do is set Auto commit to equal off with this setting set to off our transactions will not save automatically we would need to manually save each transaction it creates a save point so to say I'm going to create a save point by typing commit then execute now I'm going to select my table select all from the name of my table then I'm going to go ahead and delete all the rows delete from employees oh shoot but I forgot to add a where Clause my whole table is gone now luckily we created a safe point with that commit statement to undo these changes I can execute the roll back statement this will restore my current transaction back to the previous save point where we used commit now if I were to select all from the name of my table our table is back to what it previously was and again to save any changes let's say I delete my whole table again delete from employees if I want to save this change I would commit then again I will select my table and that last change is now saved my whole table is gone so yeah that is auto commit commit and roll back by default Auto commit is set to be on any transactions after executing are saved if that mode is set to off you can commit any changes manually to undo any changes use that rollback statement so yeah that is auto commit commit and roll back in MySQL
