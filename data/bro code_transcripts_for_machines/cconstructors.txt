all right constructors a constructor is a special method found within a class it has the same name as the class name in the last video we created a human class but it's missing a constructor if we do not explicitly create a constructor there is a hidden one behind the scenes that is automatically called and it is used to create an object for us so let's explicitly create a constructor so you type public because we want this to be publicly accessible and then it has the same name as the class name then add a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces this works just like a method and we can even set up parameters so let's set up name and age parameters so we need to list the data type string name and int edge now in order to create a human object we have to pass a matching set of arguments we need to pass in a name and an age well a string to function as a name and an integer to function as an edge so we don't manually need to assign these fields anymore we can just pass these values as arguments so with human one human one's name was rick and his age was 65 so i will pass these as arguments rick and 65 and you can see that that red underline went away so let's do the same thing for human2 morty and his age 16 and we no longer need to manually assign those fields however within the constructor we'll need to do so so type this dot the name of the field we would like to assign equals the name of the parameter and in this case they have the same name this dot name equals name and this dot age equals whatever this is age and this will work the same as before but we did not need to manually assign those values to those fields so after calling the eaton sleep method for both human 1 and human 2 this will display rick is eating rick is sleeping morty is eating morty's sleeping so that's kind of what a constructor is it's a special method found within a class and it's automatically called when we instantiate an object if we do not explicitly create a constructor but if we do we can manually assign some values to fields of an object let's try a different example this time instead of humans let's create a car class we will instantiate some car objects so let's delete our current class and create a new one class car then curly braces cars will have let's say four fields a make a model a year and a color string make string model int year and string color then to create a constructor this will have the same name as the class name precede this with public car parentheses curly braces and again this is a special kind of method and we can set up arguments and parameters so we have string make string model integer and string color and then when we receive arguments we can assign them to these fields this dot make equals make this dot model equals model this dot year equals year and this dot color equals color then let's create maybe a drive method public void drive and we will display something u drive the plus make plus a lot of space to separate make and model plus model okay now let's instantiate some car objects so we type the name of the class car then we need a unique name or identifier for this car let's call this first car car one equals new car parenthesis semicolon but to instantiate a car object we have to pass a matching set of arguments to these parameters we have to pass a make model year and color so car one let's say is a ford mustang ford mustang the year will be 2022 and the color is red and then let's have car one use the drive method so type car one dot drive then a set of parentheses to invoke it u drive the ford mustang now let's create cartoon it's the same process as before but we need a unique name or identifier car car 2 equals new car this will be a chevy corvette and the year will be 20 21 and the color is blue and then let's use the drive method of car 2. car 2 drive you drive the ford mustang you drive the chevy corvette so yeah that's a constructor it's a special method found within a class and it has the same name as the class name class car and the constructor name is car as well and it can be used to assign arguments to fields when creating an object there's a few other things you can do with constructors too but we'll discuss that in future videos so yeah those are constructors if you can smash that like button leave a random comment down below and well yeah those are constructors in c sharp
