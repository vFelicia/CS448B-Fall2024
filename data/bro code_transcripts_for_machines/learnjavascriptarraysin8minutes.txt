hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain arrays in JavaScript think of an array as a variable like structure that can hold more than one value for example let's say we had a variable named fruit go ahead and pick a fruit I'll pick an apple our variable can store one value but we can turn a variable into an array and it can store more than one value and we can do so by enclosing all values with a set of straight brackets now my variable of fruit is now an array it can store more than one value just be sure that each value is comma separated this time I'll add an orange and a banana just to make it more obvious that this is an array I'm going to add an S so that my variable name is plural it's not mandatory but it helps with readability I now have an array of fruits but let me show you something if I were to console.log my array of fruits well JavaScript is going to print out all of the elements in this array each item each value is known as an element we have three elements if you need to access an individual element following the array you have to add an index number in closed and straight brackets if I would like the element at the first position that would have an index of zero that would give me an Apple fruits at index of one would be orange fruits at index of two is banana if I were to attempt to access the element at index 3 well it's undefined we only have three elements within our array zero one two arrays always begin with zero you can even change one of these elements by accessing that array at a given element let's access our array fruits at index zero I will set the sequel to be a coconut so now we have coconut orange banana let's change fruits at index one to be a coconut Apple coconut banana index two will be a coconut Apple orange coconut if I set fruits at index three to be a coconut let me console.log that too fruits at index three we can add a new element to that array otherwise to add an element there's a builtin method of arrays fruits dot push to push an element to the end I will add a coconut to the end of my array Apple orange banana coconut then we have pop is going to remove the last element Apple orange undefined the unshift method will add an element to the beginning take our array use the on shift method on shift I will add a mango to the beginning of my array mango Apple orange banana then we have shift to remove an element from the beginning fruits.shift now we have an orange banana and my last two elements are undefined to get the length of an array there is a length property let's create a new variable let num of fruits to store the number of fruits that we have type the array name dot length then let's console.log the number of fruits we have we have three fruits I'll add another I'll add a coconut to the end and we have four so that's how to get the length of an array there's a length property type the array name dot length we can find the index of an element if there's a match let index equals let's search for an apple fruits dot index of method what are we searching for let's search for an apple then I will display the index so our apple is located at index 0. let's search for an orange that's index one banana that's two coconut three what if we search for an element that doesn't exist like a mango well this method will return negative one that could be helpful within an if statement you can check to see if this method returns negative one then if it does that means the element wasn't found and you can let the user know if index equals negative one display that element wasn't found now if you would like to Loop through the elements and display them there's an easier way to do that you can use a for Loop so four there's up to three statements we'll need a counter or some sort of index let I equal zero that's the first statement we'll continue this as long as I is less than our fruits array dot length property then we will increment I by One if we have four elements we should execute this Loop four times during each iteration I will console.log our fruits array but the index instead of being like 0 1 2 3 a hard number we'll use our counter our index of I and let's get rid of that line now we should Loop through all of the elements of this array and print them out individually using a for Loop we can even increment by a different number like two I plus equals two so here we're only displaying the apple and the banana if I set index to be 1 then increment by 2 will display orange then coconut so using a for Loop there's a few different ways in which you can display the elements of an array if you need to display the order of this array in Reverse we can change this around we will set our counter I to be the length of our array then we'll continue as long as I is greater than or equal to zero then I minus minus there's one change I'm going to make we have undefined coconut banana orange Apple so the length of my array is four but if I were to access our array fruits at index 4 where would that be zero one two three that's out of bounds I'm going to set our index to be fruits.length minus one zero one two three our length is four minus one is a total of three now we're printing our array in Reverse coconut banana orange Apple there's also an enhanced for loop it's a shortcut to displaying the elements of an array you can write something like this let fruit of array fruits really this variable can be anything but I like to write a singular version of my array name then during each iteration I will display each fruit Apple orange banana coconut this is an enhanced for loop it's kind of like a shortcut to displaying the elements of an array if this array name were I don't know like meets you could say let meat of meats and then display each meat but of course they're still fruit that's a shortcut you can use now to sort an array you can use the sort method fruits dot sort and that should sort the elements in alphabetical order apple banana coconut orange to sort them in reverse order you can tack on the reverse method to the end fruits.sortmethod.reverse method now they're all backwards in Reverse alphabetical order orange coconut banana apple all right everybody so that's an introduction to arrays we'll have a lot of practice with this in the future so if you don't remember everything that's okay an array is a variable like structure that can hold more than one value a variable can hold one value an array can hold many and well everybody those are arrays in JavaScript
