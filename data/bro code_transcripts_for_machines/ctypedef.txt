all right typedef typedef is a reserved keyword that gives an existing data type a nickname here's an example let's create a character array of 25 bytes and we'll say that this is user one so character user one and the size is 25 bytes and then make up some username okay so writing some of the syntax can be somewhat tedious what a lot of c programmers will do is that they will use this type def keyword to give some data type a nickname let's use this typedef keyword to give a character array of 25 bytes some nickname so i'll do this outside of the main function we will type type def then our data type so this is a character array of 25 bytes and we need some sort of nickname so let's say that a character array of 25 bytes will be known as a user now i don't need all of the syntax now i can type my data type user and then some variable name let's say user1 from this point forward if i need a character array of 25 bytes i can call that a user that's my nickname now one place where you see this used a lot is with structs this time let's create a struct at first we won't use the typedef keyword and then i'll show you the benefits later so let's say this is a struct and the tag name is user users will have let's say three members a character array named name of 25 bytes a password of 12 bytes and int id like an id number so to create a struct we would have to type struct then the tag name user and a variable name and let's assign some of these values i'll assign a name password and id looks good to me okay then if i need to create user two i would type again struct some unique variable name and make up some values okay so with a struct if i would like to use the typedef keyword i will precede the struct keyword with typedef and i don't necessarily need this tag name and after the last curly brace here i will add my nickname i'll call this a user if we need to create a user struct we no longer need to use the struct keyword we can remove this and this should work so let's print some of these members and here are the two users that we created yeah so in conclusion typedef is a reserved keyword that gives an existing data type a nickname and it's mostly used for convenience if we use the typed up keyword when declaring a struct we no longer need to use that struct keyword to create a struct we can just use this nickname as the data type and then come up with some unique variable name so yeah that is the typedef keyword if you found this video helpful please be sure to give this video a thumbs up leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
