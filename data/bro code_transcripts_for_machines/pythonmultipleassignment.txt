hey people what's going on it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain multiple assignment in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running well then since you clicked on this video i should probably explain what multiple assignment is now multiple assignment allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code here's an example of us using standard assignment let's say we have a variable name and i will set this to a value of my name but you can use your name for this example let's say edge equals 21 and how about a variable called attractive i think i'm gonna set this to true okay so we have a bunch of variables and then we can print the value of these variables with some print statements so let's print name age and attractive so we have name age attractive and as you would expect this prints bro 21 and true now another way in which we could write the same code is to use multiple assignment and this allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code so i'm going to turn all of these lines into comments and this time we will only use one line of code but to do this we're going to list all of our variables separated with a comma so that would be name comma edge comma attractive and we will set them equal to those values but in the same order separated by commas so that would be bro comma 21 comma true and this would do the same thing only using one line of code here's another example let's say we have four variables spongebob patrick sandy and squidward and let's pretend that they're all around maybe 30 years old at least it seems like they're around 30 years old but i could be wrong i'm not too familiar with spongebob lore so let's set them all equal to 30. now we could write this using four lines of code or we could use multiple assignment to write the same thing using one line of code so if all of these variables are all equal to the same value there's a little bit of different syntax here so let's begin with the first variable of spongebob equals patrick equals sandy equals squidward then we're going to set them all equal to 30 and this should work just fine using only one line of code well everybody that's pretty much it for multiple assignment it allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code i will post all of this code in the comments section down below and well yeah that's how multiple assignment works in python
