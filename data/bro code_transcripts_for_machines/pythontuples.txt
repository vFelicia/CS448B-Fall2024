hey what's going on people it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain tuples in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm so tuples they are collections which are ordered and unchangeable they're very similar to lists but they're ordered and we can't change them they're useful for grouping together related data let's say we would like to create some sort of student record so we can create a tuple to take care of that for us so let's say we would like to create a tuple called student the process of creating a tuple is very similar to lists but instead of using a set of square brackets to place all of the values within we're going to use a set of parentheses and now we can add a bunch of values related to this collection of student so let's add some student information let's say that this student's name is bro let's give him an age as well as a gender all right so there you have it we now have a tuple called student and let's take a look at some of the functions related to tuples and you can access them by typing student dot and then there are a few here not as many as lists we have count and we have index so we can find the count of how many times a value appears let's count how many times the value of bro appears so we'll need to put this within a print statement so we can actually see it so bro appears one time within this tuple there is also an index method as well so type the name of your tuple dot and we will use the index method we can find the index of a certain value let's say we would like to find the index of mail and then i will just print this to the console window so the index of the value male would be at two zero one two that's it for the methods available to tuples a few tricks that you can do with tuples is that you can display all of the contents within a tuple using a for loop let's say for x in student we will print x so this will iterate once through all the values found within our tuple of student and we can also check to see if a certain value exists within our tuple using an if statement let's say if bro in student if this is true then what do we want to do let's say print bro is here all right so since bro is within here this will be true and this will print our statement of bro is here all right everybody like i said this is a super quick video on tuples they're very similar to lists except they are ordered and unchangeable if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below and don't forget to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
