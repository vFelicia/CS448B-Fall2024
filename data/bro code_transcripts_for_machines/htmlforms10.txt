it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm gonna teach you how to create a form using HTML let's get into it the form ailment is used to collect user input from a visitor to your site this can be anything from personal information to surveys payment info etc there are different form input elements such as text fields radio buttons dropdown lists checkboxes and there's even a form element for a submit button just like we covered in the last video so let's get started the first thing that we're going to do is use a pair of form tags so we need an opening form tag and a closing form tag usually on an HTML form there's an action attribute that you may find within the opening form tag and this defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted the data from the form may be sent to a page on the server when the user clicks on some sort of submit button there might be a PHP file or some other script within the action attribute that the form sends data to it might be a file such as du underscore something dot PHP or it might be named something like action page something around there but I like do something dot PHP so we won't be doing much with the action attribute in this lesson but we might cover it in a different tutorial okay let's create a textbox for somebody to enter in their first name let's create a prompt or a label that says first name and let's see what this looks like alright so then what I'm going to do then is that we're going to use the input tag and this is a self closing tag and we're going to use the type attribute and set this to text so this will place a text box when we use the typed text attribute and set this to text now there's one trick and it's called using a label so sometimes people might have difficulty with clicking on the text box so one thing that we can do is that with our label well text that is functioning as a label there's actually a label tag that has some benefits so what we're going to do is take our first name and surround this with a pair of label tags and I'll show you what this does in just a moment alright then what we're going to do is in the opening label tag we're going to type before equals and then we need to come up with an ID for our input and we can say something such as first underscore name now we'll want to create an ID for this textbox and we'll have it match whatever we placed for the four attribute so first underscore name so this label and this textbox are now linked but you have to make sure that these have the same name so this ID has to match whatever the four label has and an added benefit of this is that if we click on first name it's going to place our cursor within the textbox so that's kind of a nice feature to the ID attribute is the clientside identifier mostly used for CSS and JavaScript to uniquely identify this specific element and there's also another attribute called name so let's create that here and with the name a common practice is to set the ID and the name to be the same so I'm going to type in first underscore name so the name attribute is used during form submission to post or get the values that we submit when we hit some sort of submit button so this is only used when we're using a serverside language such as PHP or a few other languages out there while the ID and the name attributes really aren't required for this tutorial it would be good practice just to become familiar with them as you advance your skills then you know what these things are then well now we have a text box where we can enter in our first name so let's do the same thing for a last name and honestly I'm just going to add a few line breaks and then we can copy and paste this and we can change a few things so we're going to change any instance of first name to last name so last name last name and we'll changed ad two last name and the name to last name let's save reload and we now have a box for a last name now with these text boxes we can add a placeholder if we want to let the user know what kind of format that we want them to enter their user input in so for example let's use the placeholder attribute and we can set this equal to some default value and the text that's going to appear within the text box is going to be like gray and faded so let's come up with a first name I like the name spongebob and then let's do the same thing for the last name input box and I will pick a last name of SquarePants but you don't have to pick the same thing I do you could always pick like John Smith or something I just want this be entertaining alright so then within the text box it says Spongebob Squarepants it's like some sample text and if we were to click on this text box and enter something in this would actually disappear until we clear out the text box then it goes back to our sample text so this is useful if you want to let the user know what kind of format that we want them to enter their information and so it's useful for like phone numbers or email addresses stuff like that let's create a few buttons doesn't that sound good but I'll add a few line breaks so there's another option to create buttons on a form and that's by setting the type attribute of the input element to either reset if you want a reset button or submit if you want a submit button so let's create an input element and we're going to use the type attribute and set this to reset let's save reload we now have a reset button so let's type in some text so I'll make up a first name and a last name so if we were to hit this reset button it's actually going to clear out this form for us which is pretty sweet let's do the same thing and create a submit button so I'll add a few line breaks we'll use the input element and we'll set the type equal to submit let's save reload we now have a submit button so with the submit button if we were to click on this this HTML file is going to send the information from this form to whatever page is listed than the action attribute of your opening form element so you might have some sort of file here like do something dot PHP or some other action page so let's refresh this and actually attempt to send some information and see what happens so I'm just going to send a first name and a last name and hit submit so this is going to attempt to send this information to this page on the server but we don't currently have anything set up though but that's how you would actually submit information from a form so that's the basics of forms if you want to continue I'll show you a few other different input methods for forms and I've already went ahead and made a few labels for stuff that might be related to form submissions such as like a title payment type email birthdays phone numbers passwords stuff like that so if you're interested let's begin I'll include timestamps in the description if there's anything or any type of input that you'd be interested in let's begin by creating some radio buttons for a title and by title I mean like mr. mrs. doctor titles like that so let's create a few labels to begin so label four equals and then perhaps the first one will be mr. then let's add some text to the screen so we'll just put the text mr on here and then close this label and we'll copy this and paste it a few times perhaps four and we'll make the second label for mrs. the third one for miss and then we got to change the text to and PhD and we can probably stop there even though there's many more titles PhD let's save this reload all right so we want to add a radio button after each of these options so we're going to be adding an input element after each of these specific labels so let's begin with mr. so we're going to set the type equal to radio for radio button we're going to set the value equal to missed and then we want to set the ID equal to whatever we have within the four attributes so it matches so mr. as well so there's one other attribute that we want to add and it's that name attribute but first I want to show you what happens if we don't have the name attribute setup so we're going to be adding that in in just a moment so what I'm going to do is copy this and paste it underneath each of these specific labels and we'll make a few changes so we have the mr. radio button setup so let's do the same thing for mrs. we're just going to be editing some of these fields we need miss and PhD okay let's save this reload the page and we now have a radio button after each of these titles but take a look to see what happens if we select more than one we can actually select all of these and with radio buttons for each group you only want to be able to select one of these selecting one will deactivate any others so we need to add a name attribute and each group of Rayo buttons needs to have the same name so I will give this name perhaps title so I'll copy this and paste this name attribute into each of these input elements so they each have the same name so they're all within the same group so let's save this reload and when we select a radio button it actually D selects any others that are selected so we can only select one then let's move on to dropdown menus and this would be perfect for some sort of payment where we can click a drop down menu and select a payment type so I already created a payment label so the first thing we're going to do is use the Select tag and we're going to set the ID equal to perhaps payment and then we need to set some options but we also need a closing select tag and all the different items within the drop down menu are going to be within these pair of select tags and we have to add options so we're going to have opening option tag and a closing option tag for each of these available options so for the first value we'll use the value attribute and set this perhaps to visa like you can pay with the Visa credit card and let's add some text so we'll just say visa so let's save this reload the page and we now have a drop down menu but it only has one option so we want to add a few while there's so I'm going to copy this paste it a few times and change a few things for is a good amount perhaps the second value can be a MasterCard and will change the text as well and then for the third option perhaps a gift card so make sure to change it within the value attribute and the text as well gift card and lastly perhaps a check so change the value and the text let's save reload and we now have a dropdown menu with a few options and we can select one of these for our payment let's create an email field so we're going to use the input element and we're going to set the type equal to email the ID equal to email and B name equal to email let's save reload the page and we now have a field where we can enter in our email we can also place a placeholder as well so we'll use the placeholder attribute and set this equal to some default text that will display within here so for our default text our placeholder for our first name and last name it was Sponge Bob Squarepants so perhaps I'll make a false or fake email address based off of that so s Square Pants @ uses Gmail Gmail com let's say reload the page now somebody can enter in their email if we attempted to write in an email that didn't contain the @ sign this would actually yell at us then so I'll just type in the word fake calm and we'll attempt to submit this and we have this little warning message that says please include an @ sign in the email address so let's actually add that the @ sign and I'll just make up a fake email so fake @ gmail.com and then only then can we actually submit this form to have some sort of server page process this information so that's an way of error checking if you have an email field setup it will actually prompt the user to enter in a valid email that has that @ sign which is pretty cool let's cover the date input type and this would work perfect for a birthday or birth date so after our label for a birthday we're going to use the input element and set the type equal to date the ID equal to birthday and the name also equal to birthday let's save reload the page and we now have this input element for like a year month and day there's also a dropdown menu too if you want to select something as well and you can also add a minimum or maximum value to the dates you can select for example let's say that we want to limit the latest date that we can select so we'll use the min attribute and set this equal to perhaps January 1st 2000 so 2000 0 1 0 1 so let's save this reload and we can only go so far back now all the way to the year 2000 so that's the latest date so you can keep that in or take it out if you want but you have options based on what you want to do with the number type this would be perfect if you're setting up some sort of online shop and you need to select a quantity like how many of something do you want to buy how many tshirts you want to buy so we can set a quantity so we'll use the input element set the type equal to number and we want our ID to match our for attribute so quantity and we'll need to set a name and we'll set this equal to quantity let's save real low and we now have an input box for an amount but there's really no limit on here like we can buy like these many of something and a user could also buy a negative amount of something like for example they could buy negative ten tshirts and you'd probably end up giving the money or something so you'd probably want to limit the quantity so in order to do that within the input ailment we're going to use the min attribute and set this equal to perhaps zero like they want to buy zero at the for the minimum amount and maybe max we can set this equal to maybe 99 so let's say real of the page and we cannot go below zero nor can we type in a number bigger than 99 and successfully submit it it says value must be less than or equal to 99 so if we were to type in 99 which is actually the max that's submitted this would work then you can also set a default quantity like for example use the value attribute and set this equal to one so by default you're going to have a quantity of 1 in case somebody's like checking out something in an online shop they'll end up buying at least one item but they can increase this if they want telephone numbers will use the input element and we're going to set the type equal to te l which is short for telephone we'll set the ID equal to phone and the name equal to phone as well let's save reload and we can now import a phone number let's create a password field so we'll type this in after the password label input type equals password B ID equal to pass I guess passport works I already wrote past and I don't feel like changing it now and name also will be passed let's save this reload and we now have a password field all the text that we add within here is bulleted but there's really no limit to the amount of characters we can add to this password so we can actually limit this so let's say that we want the max length of the password to be perhaps 12 characters first let's just add a note after that that lets the user know that max is 12 characters so max 12 characters all right within the input element of our password field we're going to use the max length attribute and let's set this equal to 12 let's save reload and let's attempt to type in more than 12 characters so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and that's our limit so we can't type it anymore so that's a good way to limit user input for a password field hang on because we're almost finished we are on the range input data type so this works like a slider think of like the star system when you rate somebody it's like on a scale this one isn't as pretty though you can do some designing with CSS and whatnot but we're going to use the input element and set the type equal to range and let's see what this appears like alright so we have this sliding scale here but let's say that we want to add some numbers to this like maybe a number before this and after this so we're going to add some text right next to this input type let's pretend that we want to rate somebody's service between 1 and 5 stars so before and after this slider scale we're going to add one before this range and then 5 after this so let's save reload and we now have a slider bar between a certain range however there's perhaps 100 different positions that this slider can be in so let's say that we want to limit that we can actually set up some steps so we'll use the step attribute and we can set this to some value that is preferably divisible by 100 let's say that we want 5 different steps well we'll actually put 25 here and this is the reason why so each notch or step in this slider bar will actually count as 25 but we always count 0 as well so if we set the step equal to 25 physicians will end up with 5 different stars 5 different position so let's just count this to test it out so we have one two three four five just like we intended however if you made this twenty we would actually end up with six different positions then so one two three four five six even though one hundred different positions divided by 20 is still five we always count zero though with that and with this range input type you can also set a default value so let's set the value equal to 100 so when we reload the page our rating is already at five stars and we can lower this otherwise we can change this to a different number like 50 and it would end up being right in the middle so you can also place a default value for your sliding scale as well checkboxes are very simple and a perfect example of us using a check box would be for some sort of subscribe button so under my subscribe label we're going to use the input element again and set the type equal to check box then the ID equal to subscribe because that's what I decided the four attributes gonna be four and the name also set to sub described alright let's save reload and we now have a check box next to our subscribe label that we can check on or off okay I promise this is the last one we can use the file input type to upload a file to a server page so I have the upload a file label and we're going to use the input element and set the type equal to file and the ID equal to my file because I already wrote that and the name also equal to my file let's save reload okay so we can now click this button to upload a file and let's click this button choose file to upload a file okay well here's a folder where I'm keeping some related HTML files let's say that we want to upload this test excel file so we'll click open and this file is now uploaded now if you want to limit the types the file extensions of what files you can upload you can actually use the accept attribute so we'll say accept and then we'll place perhaps dot txt like we only want to upload plain text files so let's try this one more time then so let's say reload the page and I'm going to choose a file again within the same folder and here we only have that test file now the plain text file so before you can see that HTML file and that excel file but now we can only upload the file type that we specified which was plain text so then we can just upload that and then you know we can submit this then but yeah that is pretty much all the basics for using forms in HTML I'll post all the code that I have in the comments down below but yeah those are the basics of forms in HTML
