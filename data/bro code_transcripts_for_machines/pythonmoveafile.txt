hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can move files using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running welcome back everybody to another video regarding that thing that we do called programming and in this video we're going to be moving files using python and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module this is included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it and now let's create two variables a variable called source that will hold the location of where our source file is located as well as a variable called destination to function as well the destination now for this video i'm going to move a file within my project folder to my desktop so to do so i'm going to create a new file i will name this test.txt but take the liberty to name this whatever you want so i'm going to list the location of where my test file is located since this is within my projects folder i only need the file name if this was someplace else on your computer you would probably need the file path and now where would i like to move this file to i would like to move this file to my desktop so i just need the file path so i'm going to go to my desktop right click go to properties i'm going to copy this location and paste it within my destination and i will add slash desktop slash test.txt you can also rename this too if you want i will just keep it the same now if you have single backslashes you'll likely need to change these to double backslashes because that is the escape sequence to print a backslash within a string so we have a source location as well as a destination location now we can begin i would recommend writing our code within a try and accept block to handle any exceptions so i would like to handle any file not found error exceptions just in case our program cannot locate our source file so let's print a message if that is the case perhaps source plus was not found now within our try block let's check to see if there is already a file at this destination because i would not like to save over it if there's already a file there so let's do some basic file detection if os dot path dot exists and i will pass in my destination as an argument to the exists function so if there is already a file here i should probably let the user know print there is already a file there else we can replace our files honestly if you do not care about saving over any files you can omit this part so else os dot replace and we will pass in our source and our destination as arguments and let's print a message to the console window to let the user know that source plus was moved all right let's try this oh i accidentally deleted my file test.txt all right now this should disappear in three two one and it's gone test.txt was moved and it should now be on my desktop which it is now you can also use this to move a directory as well i'm going to create a new directory i will name this folder and i will change source to folder and the destination from test.txt to folder and now this should move my folder there is already a file there oh let's delete that okay folder was moved alright everybody so that is how to move a file and or directory using python if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that is how to move a file and or directory using python
