how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about expressions in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you can become a hero and save our channel by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro now an expression is a combination of operands and operators an operand is the values variables numbers or different quantities that you might see in a program and operators they are those arithmetic symbols that you might see such as the plus sign for addition subtraction multiplication division and then modulus so let's go over a few examples just so that we know how they work let's say i have an integer variable called friends and i will set this equal to maybe 10. so we can change the value of the friends variable by using an arithmetic expression so let's say that we make a new friend so we're going to add one to my variable of friends to increment my variable friends i can just use the plus operator and then add a new operand to my variable friends so if i would like to assign a new value to my friends variable i'm going to type in the name of my variable equals friends plus one because we made a new friend and then i will print the value of friends so our friends variable now contains 11. so we could also subtract take a wild guess as to what's gonna happen we just lost a friend let's multiply uh let's multiply our friends by two and now we have 20 friends and let's divide we're going to divide our friends into two and we have five friends now the modulus gives you the remainder of division so we have 10 friends what if we had modulus 3 well that does not divide evenly so we're going to have a remainder of one friend it's kind of like in group projects where everybody has to get into a group of three and there's always somebody that's left over think of it that way although if our group of friends was divided into groups of 2 there would be no remainder because 10 divided by 2 equals 5 evenly and there is no remainder so that's all what the modulus is it gives you the remainder of any division that occurs now there is a shorthand to increment a variable by one so normally the long way of writing this out would be type in the name of the variable equals because we're going to reassign a value friends plus one right well there's a shorthand way of incrementing this and that is to use the increment operator which is just plus plus and then a semicolon so this will add one to a value and now we have 11 friends if you want to decrement that would be minus minus and now we have nine friends hold up wait a minute before you go i gotta discuss integer division because i forgot to talk about it so if we divide a number by an integer if there is normally a remainder well our program is going to truncate the remainder here's an example let's say we have 10 friends and we're going to divide our friends by three so we're dividing by a whole integer so our result should be 3.33 repeating right wrong it's three that's because with integer division we truncate any decimal portion because we cannot store it one easy fix for that is we can cast our result as a double value or a float as well to cast a value as a different data type to the left hand side of our expression we're going to list the new data type that we would like to convert this value to so we would like to convert our integer as a double value because we would like to retain that decimal portion of our result however our data type friends is an integer so it cannot store a double data type so we should probably convert this to a double so that we can store this value and now this program will successfully store this decimal portion of our expression well that's really all you need to know to get started with expressions if you would like a copy of all this i will post this in the comments down below and if i could ask for a favor of you guys just to like this video drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
