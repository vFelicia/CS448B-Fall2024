yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to give you all a demonstration of the color picker node in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back people we're going to be using the color picker node to change the background color of our pain so let's pick any old pain i'll use an anchor pain just because that's what we've been working with and i will give this pain a unique id let's say my pane then we need a color picker let's go to controls and drag and drop it normally the default color is white you can change that if you want so to change that go to properties value and pick any sort of color that you want i'll just set it to black you can also change the transparency too now let's head to the code drop down menu and give this color picker a unique id my color picker works and when we click on the color picker and select a color what method do we want to call so let's create a method named change color okay let's save make sure that our controller class is linked and let's head to our controller class now head to your controller class we need to inject our fxml and we will declare our pain pain my pain as well as our color picker at fxml private color picker my color picker and we need to declare that method of change color public void change color there is one parameter action event event now when we select a color we need to get that color color my color equals my color picker dot get value this will return a color object so we will store that within color my color and to change the background color of a node or pane type the name of that pane or node dot set background and we will pass in a new background and then pass in a new background fill there's kind of layers to this and then pass in my color there's three arguments here my color then corner radii dot empty insets dot empty alternatively you can set these last two arguments to null i think i'll change them to null just to keep it simple okay and we should be good so here's our fancy color picker and we can change the background color of our pin well everybody so that is the simple color picker in javafx i will post this code to the comments section down below but yeah that is the color picker node in javafx
