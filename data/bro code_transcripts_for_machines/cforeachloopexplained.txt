all right guys the for each loop the for each loop is a loop that eases the traversal over an iterable data set an array is an example of an iterable data set suppose we're using a standard for loop and i have this array of strings named students we have spongebob patrick and squidward using a standard for loop i would need three statements an index a condition then we could increment or decrement our index this does work but there is another way of writing this using a for each loop there's less syntax than a typical for loop but it's less flexible using a for loop we can go forwards backwards or even skip iterations of something we're iterating over using a for each loop we start at the beginning and go to the end there's less flexibility so let's change this to a for each loop first we'll add the data type of what we're iterating over we're iterating over strings then we'll need a name for the current element that we're on we have an array of students let's name the current element student colon then our iterable data set which would be our array string student colon students during each iteration let's display whatever the current element is which i named student then i'll add a new line and there we go we have our three students then you could change the amount of students if you would like let's add sandy now we have spongebob patrick squidward sandy let's try a different example let's work with grades this time these will be of the int data type int grades equals make up some grades 65. 72 81 93 good enough the data type of what we're iterating over is not a string this time it is an int integers let's name each element simply grade colon the name of my iterable data set which would be my array grades for every grade in grades let's display each grade and here are the grades 65 72 81 93 so that's a for each loop it's a loop that eases the traversal over an iterable data set there's less syntax involved in a for each loop but it's less flexible if you just need to display the elements of an array a for each loop would work perfect so yeah that's a for each loop everybody your assignment is to post a for each loop in the comment section down below and well yeah that's the for each loop in c plus
