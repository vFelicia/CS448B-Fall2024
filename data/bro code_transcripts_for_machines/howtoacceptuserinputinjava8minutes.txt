hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can accept some user input in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm going to explain how we can use a scanner to accept some user input the scanner class is found in the java utility package of your library and we need to import that before we can use the scanner so outside of the class at the top of our program this is what we're going to type import java dot util and the name of the class we would like to import which is scanner then a semicolon now we can use the scanner class to create a scanner object so we're going to be performing a little bit of object oriented programming we'll be covering object oriented programming in the later part of the series so don't worry so repeat after me scanner then we need a name for the scanner let's call it scanner a lowercase equals new scanner then a set of parentheses and a semicolon within the parentheses we're going to type system dot in and there we go we have our scanner so we can use the scanner to accept some user input so let's let the user know that we would like them to type in something maybe a name let's create a prompt that will ask somebody for their name so within a print line statement we'll type what is your name and next what we'll do is take our user input and assign it to a variable perhaps a string variable called name string name equals and now we're going to use our scanner so we type in the name of the scanner dot and to enter a line of text we're going to use a certain method of the scanner it is the next line method and when we type in user input we type it into the console window here at the bottom so let's do something with this name maybe display this within a message system.out.printline hello plus whatever your name is so let's compile and run this what is your name now our program is currently paused until we type in some user input and then press the enter key when you press enter that's how you submit some user input into the console window so i'm going to click within my console window and type in something i'm going to type in bro and to submit some user input you press the enter key and it states hello plus my name which is what i entered bro now there's different types of input that we can accept this time let's accept only an integer number perhaps we can ask somebody for their age so let's write a prompt for that system.out.printline how old are you and this time we will declare an integer variable maybe called age int age equals scanner dot next and we are looking for int so we can only accept a whole integer u r plus age plus years old okay let's try this again what is your name bro how old are you let's just say that i'm 18. hit enter hello bro you are 18 years old so what happens if we do not enter in a number so let's try and break this what is your name bro how old are you we're not going to enter a number this time let's type in the word pizza and see what happens well we encountered an exception we encountered an input mismatch exception because when our scanner is looking for an integer we typed in a string so we need to make sure that the input type the data type matches in a future lesson we'll be covering exception handling where we can prevent this very thing from happening but for now since we're beginners we'll just have to be sure to type in the correct data type of the input that our program is looking for now there's one more thing that i want to show you guys this is a common problem if you use next line after next int or anything else that's not next line so let's ask somebody for their favorite food this time so let's add that at the end system.out.printline what is your favorite food then we'll create a string variable called food string food equals scanner dot next line and we will display this system.out.printline you like plus food all right so here are the questions what is your name bro how old are you 18. now pay attention to this when i press enter when we reached the question on what is your favorite food well our program skipped our user input and continued on with the rest of the code so it states hello bro you are 18 years old but we were not able to input anything for our favorite food here's the reason why here's what's going on let's pretend that this box is a representation of our scanner and we're going to use the next line method of our scanner to read a line of text so we type in our name and then press the enter key to submit so this backslash n is an escape sequence for a new line the next line method will read an entire line of text and stop when it reaches a new line character so after we call the next line method our scanner is going to be empty however if we were to call a different method that doesn't read a new line character such as next ins so we type in our input such as the number 18 and then press the enter key that will add a new line character so our next int method is only going to read this numeric portion of our scanner and then when we submit it well this new line character is still going to be within our scanner and if we were to use our scanner again and call a different method like next line well our next line method thinks that we're at the end because there's this new line character within our scanner so we would need some way to clear out that new line one easy fix for this is that after you call the next and method what we could do is call the next line method to clear our scanner so i'm just going to copy this portion and paste it we're not really going to do anything with that newline character this will just clear the scanner for us so now we should be able to answer all three questions so type in your name what is your name it is bro how old are you let's say i'm 18. what is your favorite food and you can see that it paused to this time unlike the first time and my favorite food is pizza press enter hello bro you are 18 years old you like pizza well then that is one way in which you can use a scanner to accept some user input scanners are capable of much more you can also use them to read the contents of a file and a few other things but we'll learn about those in future videos and if you need to use a scanner be sure to include this import at the top import java.util.scanner because the scanner class is found within the utility package and then you'll need to create a scanner object just by following these steps scanner you can call it scanner equals new scanner well guys and gals that is how scanners work in java before you go i would greatly appreciate it if you could do a favor for me and like this video leave a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
