hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the grid geometry manager in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's talk about the grid geometry manager well because we have to this is a useful way to organize widgets within a container imagine our window is being arranged into a series of rows and columns similar to an excel spreadsheet i tend to use that example a lot the top left most cell is row zero column zero computers always begin with zero so that's why our grid doesn't begin with row one column one and we can list which row and column we would like our widgets to be placed within and by default we only have one row and one column to work with at the start but we can explicitly state which row and column this widget should be placed within relative to the container that it's in and python will create new relative rows and columns for us if we state where these widgets should be placed so let's create a small submission form and then organize all of our widgets using our new grid system that we have so let's begin by creating a window window equals tk followed by window.mainloop now that we have our window we'll need to create some widgets to add to this window so let's say that we want an entry box and a label for a first name last name and email address as well as a submit button so let's create a label and an entry box for a first name just to demonstrate this so let's call this label first name label equals label we're adding this to the window and let's set the text to first name for now i'm just going to use that pack to demonstrate the differences between pack and grid and let's create an entry box let's call this first name entry equals entry we are adding this to the window and for now we're just going to pack this and let's take a look so here's our label on the top it says first name and then it has our entry box right underneath so what if we want to have this label on the left hand side and our entry box on the right hand side of the label we're better off using the grid geometry manager so we're going to replace pack with grid and we have to set which row and column that we want each of these widgets to be placed within normally if you use the pack geometry manager as you create new widgets they're just going to be placed directly underneath in one long column so let's say that for our name label we want to place this where the row is zero and the column is zero that's the top left corner so within the grid geometry manager when we call it we're going to set row to equal zero as well as column to equal zero and then for the first name entry we want this to be on the right hand side of our label so we'll place this within the same row row equals zero but in a different column column equals one so column one is directly to the right of column zero and then when we compile and run this we now have our entry box to the right of our label that we have so let's repeat the process for a last name an email address and then a submit button so i'm just going to copy what we have here and change first name to last name so last name label and we'll change the text to last name last name entry and we'll keep that the same now we want this last name label to be underneath the first name label because right now they're going to overlap because we have them in the same row and columns so you can see that we can no longer see the first name label or the first name entry so let's place this directly underneath we're going to put these underneath by one row so we'll keep the columns the same but we're going to put this underneath by one row so row one and row one for the last name entry and what you get is that these two labels and entry boxes are arranged neatly into rows and columns and let's do the same thing for an email so i'm going to copy what we have and we're going to change last name to email so email label and email entry and then change for the text last name to just email and we're going to place these where row equals 2 and we'll keep the column the same and for email entry row 2 column one so doesn't that look a lot better now let's create a submit button so let's call this submit button equals button and then we're adding this to the window and we should set some text text equals submit i guess dot grid and we want to place this underneath currently kind of just shoves it underneath for now let's say that we want this between these two columns so we'll want to set the row and the column to begin with row is going to equal three and column we'll set this equal to zero for now there isn't going to be any apparent change it's still going to be in the same place but one thing that we can do is use an option called column span we can have a widget take up more than one column and it's going to place this widget in between both of these columns in between the combined width of both of them so we'll add column span equals two so this widget is going to take up the next two available columns including the one that it's currently in and you can see that our submit button is now between these two columns that we have one thing that you should know is that the column width is dependent on the width of the largest widget that is contained within that particular column let's say that we increase the width of our first name label well our column is going to expand to actually fit that widget that we have so for our first name label let's set the width to maybe 20. and this is going to increase the width of column 0 and to even better demonstrate this let's color each label a certain color just for a visual for our first name label let's say this is red and then for our last name label let's set this to green and then for email maybe blue now all of these are color coordinated and you can see that the background color of our first name label is taking up the entire column space now what if we changed the size of our email label to something even larger like 30 so width equals 30. and now the column 0 has expanded to accommodate the size of our largest widget which is our email which has a width of 30. and before we finish this video let's add a title to the submission form right on top of the first name label and the entry label so let's call this title label equals label writing this to the window let's set some text let's say enter your info and let's pick font font equals what am i feeling like today maybe just arial and then a size maybe 25 we're going to use the grid geometry manager and we want this at the top so we want row zero at least i want this to take up two columns so we'll say column equals zero and then set a column span column span equals two now a few things are going to overlap here so we're going to move everything down by one row besides our title label so we want this first name label to be directly underneath our title label so let's move everything down by one row and our title is going to be directly on top of our first name label as well as the first name entry box that we have all right so that's the very basics of the grid geometry manager if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the grid geometry manager in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
