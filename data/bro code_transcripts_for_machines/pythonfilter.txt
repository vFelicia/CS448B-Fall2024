yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in today's video i'm going to show you all how the filter function works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right all right let's discuss the filter function the filter function creates a collection of elements from an iterable for which a function returns true now what the heck does that mean let me explain let's say that we have a list of tuples named friends each tuple has the name of a friend as well as their age i just made up some ages for all of these friends what i would like to do is to create a separate list for all the friends that are 18 or older so let's say that we're all going out drinking and i would like to create a list of my drinking bodies because they're of drinking age i'm in the united states and the drinking age is currently 21 but i think worldwide it's 18 so let's go with 18 for this example since i have a worldwide audience all right now with this filter function we have to pass in our iterable as well as a function to get anybody's edge that is over 18. so let's begin by writing a lambda function for this expression here our filter function so let's say h equals lambda data will be the parameter colon data at index one so the first index the first column in this chart here would be zero for all the names the next index of one would be all the ages data at index one is greater than or equal to 18 and that is it that is our lambda function and now we're going to filter our iterable by this function of age so let's write filter pass in our function which is edge comma and our iterable of friends now this filter function will return a filter object you can easily cast this i would like to cast my friends list back into a list and i will assign this to a new list let's say drinking buddies equals list filter age and friends and i should be able to print all of the friends that are 18 or older for i in drinking bodies print i and we have rachel monica chandler and ross well everyone that is the filter function it creates a collection of elements from an iterable for which a function returns true i like to think of it as the search results we're searching for any results that meet this criteria where age is greater than or equal to 18 and then you can create a separate collection or other list if you want from the results but yeah that is how the filter function works in python
