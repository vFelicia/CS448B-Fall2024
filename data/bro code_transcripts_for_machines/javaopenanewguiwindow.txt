hey how's it going everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how we can open a new window using Java swing so let's get into it before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm alright everyone so we're going to create a new project so if you're using Eclipse go to file new Java project and I'll call this project how to open a new window I know I'm really creative like that and then click finish and we're not going to create a module for this now we're going to go to our project locate the source folder and we're going to create three files so file new class I'll call the first one main and it's going to hold our main method so you'll want to be sure to click this checkbox here click finish let's go back to our source folder file new class and let's call this second file launch page it's going to launch a new window when we click on a button and then click finish and then back to the source folder file new oops file new class and we'll call this new window this is the window we're trying to open so new window and then click finish all right now within your main class this is what we're going to type we're going to create an instance of our launch page so we're going to type in the name of the class launch page and we'll call this launch page with a lowercase L equals new launch page and that's it for our main method in fact our entire main class here so we're going to do some things on our launch page here so the first thing that we're going to want to do is to create our constructor we'll call this launch page so it matches the class name and then we're going to declare two objects within our class but before the construct a jframe frame equals new J frame and I'm thinking what we can do or this project is that this page will only contain a button and when we click on the button it'll bring us to a new page so we'll do something simple like that then I'm just going to import these things so Java X dot swing and then let's create a J button to put on this frame so J button and we'll call this my button equals new J button and we can set some text on this button right away we'll just type in new window and then we'll need to import this okay let's go to our constructor and add a few things so let's create the frame first so frame dot set default close operation and then within the parentheses J frame dot exit on close so this will actually stop when we exit out of it and then we'll need to set a size for this frame so frame dot set size I usually pick for 20 by 420 and then we need to set a layout frame dot set layout and then I usually type in null because I like to manually place everything and then we need to set the visibility to true so frame dot set visible true okay let's create our button and add it to our frame so we'll do that before our frame within our constructor so that is called my button that's the name of our button my button dot set bounds and we'll place this where X is 100 and then maybe where Y is 160 this will be 200 pixels long and 40 pixels for the height then this is normally focusable so we want to set focusable to false it's not entirely necessary but sometimes buttons are high light and it's kind of annoying and then we need to add an action listener so my button dot add action listener and then within parenthesis parenthesis just type in this now we'll need this class to implement the action listener interface so right next to your class name type in implements action listener and we'll probably need an import okay so we'll need this import as well and we need to add unimplemented methods so this is going to be our action performed method when we click on the button but first we should make sure that everything is here so let's see if our button is actually on the panel oh nope not yet because we need to add the button to the frame because I forgot so frame dot add my button honestly that's very easy to do to forget to add something to your frame okay it should be there now yeah we're good so it currently doesn't do anything so what we should do is that we're going to create a new instance of our new window class whenever we click on this button so go to your actionperformed method and this is we're gonna type if a dot get source parenthesis is equal to my button we're going to trigger an event so what we'll do is create a new instance of our new window class so new window and we'll call this maybe my window equals new new window that's kind of a tongue twister maybe I should have named it something different but hey it works okay so then when we click on this it's going to launch an instance of our new window class but we actually have to work on that class now because it doesn't appear to do anything so that's pretty much everything for our launch page there's one more line that we're going to add near the end of this so we'll be heading back here later so let's go to our new window class then so what we're going to do here create a constructor first so new window parentheses curly braces and outside of our constructor we're going to create a J frame so we can actually see what's going on so J frame and we'll call this frame equals new J frame parentheses semicolon and let's create a label that'll just say hello so we can see something so we'll create a J label will call this label equals new J label and let's set some text such as hello then we're going to do a few things within our constructor but we need to import a few things all right so within our constructor we're going to create a frame and honestly we can just copy this from our launch page so frame dot set default close operation we need to set the size a layout and the visibility and I'm just gonna copy all this because I'm lazy and paste it right in here near the end let's work on our label so label dot set bounds we'll place this where X is zero where Y is 0 this will be 100 pixels long and a height of 50 pixels and let's also set the font just because it's normally like very small so label dot set font new font parentheses so we don't really care for a font type but if you want a specific font you can place that here I'll just set it to the default and put a null here we'll have this be plain so font dot plain and a size of 25 and we need to import something as well there we go and we need to add the label to the frame so I'll do that here frame dot add label okay so let's run this okay let's click on the new window button to launch a new window all right we got one one problem though if we keep on clicking on this button will keep on getting new windows so we have like a bunch here so if you only want there to be one window this is what you can do so going back to our launch page so the first line within our actionperformed method within our if statement this is what we're gonna type frame dot dispose parentheses semicolon so it's going to basically close out of our frame so now if we were to run this and we click on the new window button it's going to get rid of the launch page and open a new window so to sum up everything if you want to open a new window you'll want to create an instance of the class that contains the window that you want to appear and then you'll want to hook this up to like some sort of event to trigger it and in my case it's a button so when we click the button here it's going to perform the action performed method and then create a instance of our new window class then so there's other ways that you can instantiate a new window of this class or whatever else you want to name this but you usually need some way to actually trigger this being instantiated but for this example we just have this hooked up to a button but yeah that's the basics of opening a new window in Java if you want a copy of all this code I'll post it in the comments down below and that's one of a few ways to open a new window in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like
