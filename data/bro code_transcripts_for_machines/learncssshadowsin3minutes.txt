hey everybody today I'm going to show you how we can create text shadows and box Shadows we'll need some sample text to work with I'll use an H1 element type in your name and we will need a div element we will eventually create a box I'll give this div an ID of box one good enough I would like to give this H1 element a shadow I will select my H1 element I will set the text Shadow property to be we need two numbers a horizontal offset and a vertical offset let's do one pixel and one pixel we have an offset to the right of one and down by one if I were to increase the horizontal offset let's change this to two while the shadow is moving more to the right let's try five ten fifty the first number is for the horizontal offset let's change that to three the second number is for the vertical offset if I change that to five well the text is going more downwards 50 would be this all right let's keep that at three though you could add a third number for a blur here's a one pixel blur two three four five if this is a really large number like 100 you can't even see the shadow anymore let's stick with five that's a decent amount you can even change the color too let's pick a red color oh that's good you can add more than one Shadow within the tech Shadow property for more than one Shadow effect each Shadow is comma separated so add a comma afterwards let's copy what we have paste it again I'm gonna give the second Shadow a negative offset so it's up and to the left I'll change the color so it's more distinct let's go with the blue color yeah I don't like that one yeah that's fine all right now let's cover box Shadows let's select our ID of box one I'll give this box a width of 100. and a height of 100. let's pick a color too background Dash color let's go with a whitish color so it's just barely visible something like that's fine for other elements besides text we have box shadow and really it's the same process as before we have a horizontal offset let's do three pixels a vertical offset let's do three pixels again a blur let's do five pixels and a color if we so choose but I'll keep that the same now our box has a 3D pop effect which is pretty sweet all right everybody so we have text Shadows for text and box Shadows for other elements and well everybody those are shadows in CSS
