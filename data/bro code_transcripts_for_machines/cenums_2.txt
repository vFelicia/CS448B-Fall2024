all right what's going on people enums enums are a special kind of class that contains a grouping of named integer constants we tend to use enums when we have values that we know will not change so here's an example let's create an enum of planets and we will associate a planet number with each named planet so to create an enum type enum then a unique name kind of like we're creating a class then curly braces so i'm going to add the name of each planet within our solar system beginning with mercury and then separate each with a comma so we have mercury venus earth then just continue on in this pattern this isn't necessary but i like to place each of my members on a new line within an enum i think it's easier to read okay we now have an enum of planets and there's an associated integer with each of these members if we do not explicitly set an integer by default the first member is zero then one two three then you just follow that pattern so let's access one of these members of our enum of planets let's display a message planets dot pluto is a planet so taxes a name of one of these members you type the name of your enum planets dot the name of your named member pluto this will return the name not the integer let's try it pluto is a planet this is no different from using the two string method this will do the same thing pluto is a planet okay now if we need the associated integer with each of these named members we would cast this member as an integer let's change our message around let's say that planets dot mercury is planet number then to access one of the integers stored within a member that would be planets dot the name of a planet mercury and then we will precede this with parentheses and this will convert our named member into an integer so our message is now mercury is planet number zero so these named members always begin with zero but we can change that and set them let's say that mercury equals one venus equals two and then continue on in this pattern let's display pluto as well because pluto is feeling left out planets dot pluto is planet number planets dot pluto then cast as an integer okay mercury is planet number one pluto is planet number nine let's try something a little bit more complex let's create an enum to keep track of the radius of each planet enum planet radius and let me just copy this okay here's the radius of each planet in kilometers mercury is two four three nine six zero five one for venus and then i'll just fast forward the footage you can copy this down if you'd like all right we have the radius and kilometers of each planet so these are in name integer pairs let's create a variable to store the name of one of our planets string name equals what about earth planet radius the name of our enum dot the name of our member earth so if we're going to store this within a string variable we need to use the to string method and then let's display this just to test it let's say planet colon space plus name and this should display just earth planet earth okay let's get the radius of earth int radius equals planet radius dot earth then cast this as an integer console.rightline let's say radius colon space plus radius radius 6371 let me add kilometers so that's kind of the nice thing about enums is that we don't necessarily need to remember all of these numbers it's kind of like restoring variables so to say they are name integer constants that will not change through the life of a program now let's move on to a challenge round let's create a method that will calculate the volume of one of our planets when we pass in a radius public static will return a double and this will be the volume method and there is one parameter the parameter is planet radius and we will name this just radius okay we need to return let's say volume and double volume equals and here's the formula to calculate the volume of a sphere 4.0 divided by 3.0 times math dot pi times our radius to the power of 3 so we can use math dot power pass in our radius make sure to cast this as an integer to the power of three and let's call the volume method and store this within a double named volume double volume equals we will invoke the volume method and pass in planet radius dot earth and then we'll display the volume console.writeline volume colon space plus volume and i think that's in cubed kilometers all right and the volume of earth is whatever number this is one zero eight three something something something something cubed kilometers so yeah those are enums they're like a special class that contains a set or grouping of named integer constants we tend to use enums when we have values that we know will not change and to get the integer value from an item you must explicitly convert it to an integer so yeah those are enums if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
