hello again so today I got to talk about membership operators in Python they are the operators in and not in they're used to test whether a value or a variable is found within a sequence which include but are not limited to Strings lists tles sets or dictionaries here's an example I'm going to create a word a secret word let's say apple I'm going to turn this into a game I will have a user guess a letter I will accept some user input guess a letter in the secret word what I would like to do is check to see if my letter is found in my word I can write the following statement if our letter in our word in is going to return a Boolean value of true if that letter is found or false if it's not so if our letter is found I'm going to print the following statement I'll use an F string there is a at a placeholder insert our letter else let's print I'll use an F string our letter was not found Let's test this guess a letter in the SEC secret word I will guess a capital A so all these letters are uppercase do take note of that is there an a there is an a let's guess a letter that's not within this word such as z z was not found the in membership operator will test to see if a value or a variable is found within a sequence if it is it returns true if not it returns false or for the inverse you could say not in if letter is not in word we would have to flip these statements around if this value or variable is not found in this sequence it returns true otherwise false so it does the opposite of in guess a letter in the secret word is there an e there is an e is there a q q was not found depending on the statement you're trying to write you can use either in or not in whichever makes more sense in that context let's go over another example we were searching for a value or a variable found within a string let's try a set list tles and sets are going to behave similarly I will create a set of students for a set you need a set of curly braces let's add a few student names such as SpongeBob Patrick and Sandy I will have a user type in a student to search for we will accept some user input enter the name of a student we're going to check if our student is in our sequence of students if in returns true let's print the following I'll use an F string insert our student is a student else we will print I'll use an FST string insert that student was not found enter the name of a student let's search for SpongeBob SpongeBob is a student enter the name of a student let's attempt Squidward Squidward was not found and much like the first example we can do the opposite see if a value or a variable is not in a sequence we would have to switch these statements around enter the name of a student is Sandy a student Sandy is a student enter the name of a student is Laria student Laria was not found now we'll cover dictionaries I will create a dictionary of grades student grades like a grade book let's say that the student of Sandy she will be a key has a value of a Squidward the key of Squidward has a value of B SpongeBob he is also a key SpongeBob has a grade of C then Patrick Patrick has a grade of D here is my dictionary of grades then we'll search for a student student equals input enter the name of a student we'll check if let me close this if our student is found within grades then I will print the following we're looking for keys is there a matching key if we find that student I'll make this an F string let's display the associated value of that key student students grade is I'll add a placeholder once we find a student we have to get that value at the given key to do that we'll take our dictionary of grades at index of student this will retrieve the value at a given key if we don't find a student we'll output the following again I'll use an FST string student was not found so now if I search for a student such as SpongeBob we're given a grade we're given the value at that key that we're searching for Let's test Sandy Sand's great as a Squidward Squidward's great as B and Patrick Patrick's great is D but Larry is not a student if I search for him well Larry was not found let's go over one last example we're going to create a variable of email it's going to be a string type in whatever your email is brocode gmail.com I would like to see if this email is valid does it contain at and a period I will write if our value of at that character is is in our email and a period is in email we have two conditions check if at is an email and check if a period is an email if so it's a valid email then we'll print valid email else we will print invalid email is my email valid that email is valid I'll get rid of the at invalid email I'll get rid of the period following Gmail that email is also invalid in this example we're checking two conditions if this value is found within this sequence and this value is found within this sequence all right everybody so those are membership operators in and not in they will return a Boolean based on whether a value or a variable is found within a sequence which include but are not limited to Strings lists TPP sets or dictionaries and well everybody those are membership operators in Python
