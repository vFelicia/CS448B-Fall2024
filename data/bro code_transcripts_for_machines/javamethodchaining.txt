how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys a little bit about method chaining in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right welcome back guys and gals in this video we're going to discuss method chaining this is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object oriented programming that's the definition i found on wikipedia this is useful for condensing code into less lines so let's create an object a string is a type of object let's say string name equals bro a lowercase you can use your own name if you want we can perform multiple methods on this variable name let's begin by concatenating our name with another name maybe your last name name equals name dot and let's use the concat method and i'm going to concatenate another string with our variable of name and i'll just add code to this and let's display our name system.out.printline name and my result is bro code so let's perform another method on this name for this example name equals name dot what do we got here how about two uppercase so this will make my name all uppercase so everything is all caps and let's perform one more method name equals name dot let me find a good one uh trim that's good so trim will remove any blank space before and after a string so i'll add a few spaces before and after my string and this will remove these blank spaces currently this program is taking up three lines of code to call three separate methods to condense this into less lines of code we can perform a little bit of method chaining so what i'm going to do is turn these three lines into comments for now and we will condense all of these three methods into one using some method chaining so let's begin by reassigning our name variable name equals and then we'll begin with name dot concat instead of adding the semicolon at the end i'm going to follow this with another dot and then i can call another method right away this time i'm going to call the two uppercase method and then why stop there i will follow this with another dot and use my trim method next so where is it there it is so this is name dot concat dot to uppercase dot trim and then add the semicolon at the end so we're combining all three method calls into one so that this takes up one line of code it's like a three hit combo boom boom boom so even though we have written this in less lines of code it is a little more difficult to read and understand especially if you're a beginner but i thought i would mention this because this is probably something that you will see one day this particular phenomenon so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below and please be sure to drop a like leave a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
