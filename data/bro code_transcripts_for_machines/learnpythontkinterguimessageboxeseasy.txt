hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create message boxes in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay people let's create some message boxes but first we'll need an import so from tk enter import message box and what this will do is import the message box library so it's not necessary to add this comment uh so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop let's create a button so button equals button we're going to add this to the window we're going to set the command to execute a click function that will have a message box appear when we click on the button and let's set the text so text equals click me and then we will need to pack this button so button.pack now we'll need to create a click function so let's do that at the top def click and what do we want to do so there's a few different message dialog boxes that you can use so let's begin with a basic show info message box so message box dot and there's a few options let's begin with show info show info this just displays a simple message so if we were to run this we have a button we click on the button and it's going to create a message box for us and it just shows some info but we don't really have any info to show yet so we can set a title and we can set a message so let's set the title title equals this is an info message box although part of the title got cut off let's also set the message message equals you are a person click me you are a person thanks i didn't know that so there's a few other message boxes that we can use too so for now i'm just going to turn this into a comment and i'll just copy this just to save some time and the next one that we have is show warning so this will have a different icon so the title let's say warning and the message you have a virus so now we get this annoying warning message but you can just click okay to get rid of it uh so one thing that you might see with tech support scams they'll have a message box like this that shows a warning but they'll put this within a while loop that's set to true so this will just continue on and on kind of like this so if we were to try and close out of this it's just going to reappear while true is true basically uh so that's just something funny that i wanted to show you so let's move on i'm going to turn this into a comment then the next one we have is show error so show error title set it to whatever you want error message something went wrong there's a few more sophisticated ones too we can ask for some user input so this next one is message box dot ask and there's a few to choose from let's go with ask okay cancel first we'll set the title title equals ask okay cancel and a message message do you want to do the thing so we can actually put this within an if statement so this returns either true or false depending on what you click so let's put this within an if statement if this is true print you did a thing if it returns false we can use an else statement else what else do we want to do we'll say else print you cancelled a thing and let's test this but i am forgetting a colon there do you want to do the thing okay you did a thing let's try it again do you want to do the thing cancel you cancelled a thing cool there's a few others so i'll turn all of these into comments and the next one we can go over is ask retry cancel and this is fairly similar to what we had before i'm going to copy this let's change this to ask retry cancel ask retry cancel do you want retry the thing you retried a thing or you cancelled a thing so it's very similar to what we had before do you want to retry the thing retry you retried a thing and cancel you cancelled a thing okay the next one we have is ask yes no so we can get some user input if it's a yes or a no so this returns a boolean value a true or false value so message box dot ask yes no and we'll set the title title equals ask yes or no and a message do you like cake so let's put this within an if statement because this returns a true or false answer print i like cake too else they answered no then if this is false print why do you not like cake and i'm missing a colon there we go so if they click yes this returns true and we execute this line of code i like cake 2. if they answer no it's going to execute this else statement do you like cake no why do you not like cake now what we have next is ask question and this doesn't return a boolean value of true or false it actually returns a string of yes or no so this is message box dot ask question and we'll set the title to ask question and a message message equals do you like pi so let's just print the result what this returns so print everything within here so like i said this doesn't return it true or false but yes or no so what we could do is assign the response to a variable such as answer so answer equals whatever the answer is whatever they click whatever button they click on so if our answer is equal to yes we'll print a message print i like pie too then else the answer is no will print why do you not like pie so do you like pie yes i like pie too do you like pie no why do you not like pie so this next one is probably the most difficult it's ask yes no cancel so it's message box dot ask yes no cancel it's this last one so let's set the title title equals whatever you want yes no cancel and a message message equals do you like to code so let's just print the results what this returns so print everything just so we can take a look so the possible answers are true false or none so we can just run some if statements for this so if answer is equal to true what we can do is print you like to code oh but we need to assign this to an answer so answer equals all of this else if answer is equal to false let's print then why are you watching a video on coding and then else the response is none so we can just use an else statement so else you have dodged the question let's try this do you like to code yes you like to code uh but this should really be a smiley face right do you like to code no then why are you watching a video on coding do you like to code cancel you have dodged the question no one other option available to you is that you can change the icon that you're using so let's say that we want to change this icon so right now it is currently this question mark so we can set this to one of a few preset icons so icon equals and let's set this to warning so instead of that question mark we get this yellow exclamation point and you can also use info it's just an i and error so do it fits best for you all right well that's the basics on message boxes in python if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of message boxes in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and
