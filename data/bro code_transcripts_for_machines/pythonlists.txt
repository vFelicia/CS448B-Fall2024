what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain lists in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right ladies and gentlemen let's get down to business i got to explain lists to you all now a list is used to store multiple items within a single variable for example let's say we have a variable called food and i will store a string value of pizza because i like pizza what we could do is that we can store multiple items within this variable by turning this variable into a list and in order to do so we're going to surround all of the values that we would like to add to our list with a set of square brackets and boom there you have it we now have a list called food it is no longer a variable so what we could do is add multiple items to this list of food so let's add some other food items that we might like let's see i also like maybe some hamburgers and a hot dog and maybe some spaghetti i think i smelled spaghetti right okay so we now have a list called food now what happens if we attempt to print this list of food so print food so this will print all of the elements found in this list each item in a list is referred to as an element if we need to access a certain element of this list we have to list the index so next to our list we'll add a set of square brackets again and we need to list the numbered index of the element that we're trying to access now computers they always start with zero so the first element in our list would be element number zero the next one would be one two and three so if we need to access element zero which is in the first position we would say food square brackets and then within here list the index so the first position is zero and this will now print the first element of our list which is pizza let's attempt to access some of these other elements so the element at index one would be you guessed it hamburger two would be hot dog and three would be spaghetti now what happens if we attempt to access the element at index 4 well currently that's out of range because we did not assign a value so we're experiencing an error an index out of range error but if i were to add another element let's say pudding all right well then the element at index four would be pudding then one important concept with lists is that you can always update and change the elements found within a list later on in the program after you declare one so let's say we would like to immediately change one of these elements let's say food at index zero i want to replace with maybe sushi because sushi is great so if i were to print the element at index 0 this would no longer be pizza because we updated element 0 to be sushi then and this prints sushi now if you need to display all of the elements found within a list you can easily do so with a standard for loop what we'll do is say for x in the name of our list which is food print x and let me turn this line into a comment all right so this for loop will print all of the elements found within our list of food and the results are sushi hamburger hot dog spaghetti and pudding all right people for this next portion i'm going to demonstrate a few useful functions of lists and to access some of these functions type the name of your list dot and there's a bunch to choose from here let's begin with append we can add an element to this list let's say at the end i would like to add ice cream so then if i were to display my list we now have ice cream at the end because we appended this value to my list of food so let's go over a few others so we can also remove a value food dot remove let's say i would like to remove hotdog so i'm going to type that within my function and this will remove hotdog and that is no longer here next we can pop food dot pop pop will remove the last element so this will remove pudding we can insert a value at a given index food dot insert we need to list an index let's say zero that would be the first position technically that's where pizza is currently and i would like to add cake and at index 0 we now have cake so next up we have sort food dot sort this will sort a list alphabetically so in the first position we have hamburger hot dog pudding spaghetti then sushi we can also clear a list food dot clear and this will remove all of the elements of a list so this will not print anything because we cleared the list well everyone in conclusion a list is really just a variable that can store multiple values think of it that way so if you would like a copy of all the code that we have written here today i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how lists work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if
