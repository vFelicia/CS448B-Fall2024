hey welcome back everybody in this video we're going to create a practice program to find the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle and the formula to solve that is c equals the square root of a squared plus b squared we'll create two variations of this program first we'll accept some user input via some prompts then later on we'll adjust this program and accept some user input through some html text boxes let's begin let's declare three variables each for side a b and c let a let b and let's see we'll accept some user input for sides a and b a equals window dot prompt and the prompt will be enter side a when we accept user input it's a string we'll need to convert that to a number a equals number pass in a let's do the same thing for side b let's copy and paste what we have but change a to b and the formula to calculate the hypotenuse goes a little something like this c equals we'll need to square sides a and b and add them together we can use javascript math dot power function a to the power of two plus copy this paste it b to the power of two then we need to square all of this and that equals c so in the next step we could set c equal to math dot square root and pass in c if you would like to do this in less steps you could copy all of this cut this line and paste what we just copied so this would only take one line of code then at the end we will display side c side c c okay let's run this enter side a a is three b is four side c equals five okay now let's make a more advanced version of this program we'll accept some user input via some html text boxes so let's head to our html file and add a couple elements we'll create three labels label the first will have an id equal to maybe a label then close this tag and i'll add a line break then i'll copy this paste it will have a b label and a c label i'll change the text to side a colon side b and side c okay and this is what we have so far i'll add two text boxes right underneath a and b and then a button later we'll create a selfclosing input tag then i'll add a line break at the end before i forget set the type equal to text because it's a text box and i will give this a unique id of a text box okay let's copy this then underneath b label and give this text box an id of b text box okay this is what we have so far then i'll create a button underneath this second text box so right here so we'll create a pair of button tags and a line break i'll set the type equal to button and an id of what about submit button then i should probably add some text so between the button tags submit so let's save then heading back to our javascript file this is what we have to type this will be a little bit advanced for us because we haven't discussed functions yet when we click on this button we need to do something to select this button we will type document dot get element by id within the parentheses we will list a unique id i would like the id of my submit button then follow this with dot on click when we click on this button we would like to do something we would like to perform a function function parentheses curly braces within the curly braces we will execute some code and actually we can copy a lot of what we have here so let's copy our previous code and paste it but we need to change a couple things around we would not like window prompts so let's change this line to a equals document dot get element by id and i would like to get the value of this text box which has a unique id of a text box follow this with dot value we're taking the value of this text box and assigning it to variable a when we accept user input it's normally a string we're going to convert it to a number let's do the same thing with b so copy that line paste it change a to b here and here as well then convert it to a number we can keep this line of code the logic is still the same and lastly we can update this label i'm going to change this around real quick i don't want to display anything but we'll still keep the label i'm going to change the inner html of this label c label document dot get element by id we are selecting c label and i'm going to change the inner html and set this equal to side c colon space plus c okay so make sure you save both your html document and your javascript file and let's run this so side a is three side b is four let's press submit and side c is five so yeah everybody that is a practice program to find the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post this in the comments section down below if this video helped you out feel free to help me out by smashing that like button leave random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
