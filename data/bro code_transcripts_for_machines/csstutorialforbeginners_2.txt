hey it's your bro i hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about css so let's get into it so what is css css is an acronym for cascading style sheets the purpose of css is to customize the elements of a web page to be displayed and we can even use css to style multiple pages at once by linking separate independent html files to a single style sheet so i've described our house analogy for building a web page in the past but here it is one more time for any of you new people so instead of building a web page imagine that we are constructing a house while html adds structure to a page such as flooring roofing walls support beams the skeletal structure of the webpage css is like the decorations it's the styling like paint furniture interior decorating and javascript adds functionality to our house we can include things like lighting plumbing heating cooling basic utilities things that add functionality to a house so this is a very good analogy i would say for a web page but i'm a little biased because i made it up there's three ways to include css for a web page the first is inline which we actually have some experience with already from the html tutorial it's really only useful for adding a few custom elements internal we create a pair of style elements in the head of our html document useful for a single page website and external in my opinion which is the best we can link a css file to our html file to style one or all pages of a website useful if you make a site with many many pages but don't worry i'll give you a demonstration of how we can use each of these three so there's a set of rules for declaring css properties first you'll want to identify the html element that you want to customize with css this is an internal and external example this wouldn't apply for inline it's slightly different but i'll give you a demonstration on that later so here we have a css property that we want to change so we need to list this followed by a colon and the value that we want to give this property and then if you want to add multiple properties you just separate each line with a semicolon so it's simple as that if you have an html document ready then we can begin let's create some sample text first let's create a title for this page and perhaps we'll use an h1 header and i will type in the text css demo and close this and let's create a sample paragraph if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem and hit tab and i would like to surround this with a pair of paragraph elements let's save reload all right that's good enough so far so let me give you a demonstration of the inline way of using css which we have a little bit of experience with already now with the inline style of using css is that we can find an element that we want to customize then we'll just type in style equals double quotes and then we can place our css properties and values between these double quotes for style let's say i want to change the background color i will type in the property of background dash color colon and then i can set a color you can either just use the name of one or you can use a hexadecimal value and let's say that i want this background to be black well that would be all zeros then so that would be six zeros all right now we can add another css property but we need to separate each with a semicolon and i want to change the font color so all text will have this colored font if it's within the body so color then colon and then perhaps i'll just type in the word green because i don't remember the hexadecimal value for green so let's save this reload the page all right the background color is black and the text is green just like we wanted now you can adjust these values too let's say that i want a slightly lighter shade of black well i'll increase these hexadecimal values to perhaps all ones i'll refresh the page and the background is like a grayish black no it just got slightly brighter and i'll change the color to i believe a green color would be let's see zero zero then perhaps a a zero zero i think that should be green you can always look these up too just go to hexadecimal color picker or just look that up in a web browser so that's like a slightly brighter shade of green then which i think is better so you can adjust these values however you want or pick a custom color if there's a color theme you like now for this example let's target a different html element instead of targeting the entire body of the document so i'm just going to copy this and place it somewhere else let's say that we want to place this within our h1 header well we would just put it within the opening header tag it's the same process as before really for inline you just type in style equals then list the css properties you want to change and give it a value so let's save this reload and now what you see here is that only anything between these specific h1 header tags is affected by this css styling leaving the rest of our web page clean and pristine then now pay attention to this if we were to create another pair of h1 header tags save this and reload the page you'll notice that this pair of h1 header tags is left untouched basically by css and that's because when you use inline css styling it only effects anything between these two tags no more no less and that's a perfect transition into our next topic which is internal css styling so with internal css styling we can target all instances of a certain tag that is used and it will be affected by whatever css properties we list there this is what we do for internal styling you need to write a pair of style tags between your head tags so we're going to write style and then we'll need to close this as well all right next we need to list the html element that we want to target with css let's say that we want to target any instances of us using paragraphs so we're going to write the html element that we want to target so in this case it's p for the paragraph tags then we need a set of curly brackets and within these curly brackets we're going to list our css properties so let's say that we want to change the background color and we will change that to the hexadecimal value of all ones so six ones now if we want to add another property we'll need a semicolon and we can add another property on the next line so color and i liked the color zero zero a zero zero which is green so now if we save this reload the page now any instance of us using a pair of paragraph tags will be affected by css now if i were to copy this paragraph and paste it directly underneath then this paragraph would also be affected now you can also target html elements that have a particular id that you identify so let's give each of these paragraphs their own id attribute so i'll call this paragraph one and for the next paragraph i will call this paragraph two all right so let's save this and reload the page alright so with our css styling we're still targeting all paragraphs but you can also target something with a specific id so in order to do that you just use the number symbol and then type in the id that you want to target let's say that we want to target paragraph one we'll use the number symbol and type in paragraph one so let's save this reload now only paragraph 1 is targeted and it's leaving paragraph 2 alone because it has a different id and we cannot change this to paragraph 2 and now only paragraph 2 is affected by css leaving paragraph 1 not affected by css then there's also a similar attribute to id but it's called class and this is reserved for a unique grouping for parts of your web page so for our h1 header let's create a class and perhaps we'll call this maybe top like the top of the web page and maybe we'll throw in i guess uh the first paragraph within this class as well alright so now we can actually target an entire class but you need to put a dot here than the name of the class so we want to target anything with the class of top so let's save this reload and now our internal css is targeting anything with the class of top then so that's useful if you want to target a specific section of your web page and it includes many different types of elements then and you can take this a step further too although this is a little more complex you can list a specific html element and you can have it target something within a certain class right here we typed in p dot top we want to target any paragraph tag that also falls within the top class so what ends up happening is that it only targets this paragraph with our css we're only targeting this specific paragraph because unlike this paragraph it has this class of top then which we listed as a target any paragraph tag that has the class of top and one other trick available to you is that if you want to have multiple html elements with these same exact properties you can just list all of them but you have to separate each element with a comma let's say that we want to target any instances of h1 tags as well as paragraph tags we would just list these here separate each that you want to add with a comma so this will target all h1 tags and paragraph tags and last but not least is the external method of css styling so we're actually going to create a separate css file where we're going to list all the different elements that we want to target and the css properties that we want to apply so if you're using sublime text you can just go to file new file and i'm immediately going to save this so file save as name this whatever you want you can place this within the same folder that contains the web page you're working on if it's in a different location you just have to know the file path and you can name this whatever you want i'll just call it maybe something simple as style but you have to make sure it's a css file so i'm just going to add dot css otherwise you can always change the save as type too alright and now it's the same process as before with internal styling but we don't actually need to include those pairs of style tags we can just list all the html elements that we want to target let's say that we want to target any h1 tags we'll just type in that there and then use a set of curly brackets and then we list all of our css properties here so let's change the background color to whatever we want i liked the color one one one one one one that was like a lighter shade of black as well as the font color and i liked the color zero zero a zero zero all right and then let's do the same thing for the paragraph tags perhaps i'll choose a slightly different color though for the font color um maybe let's make this a brighter green so that's zero zero maybe ff00 okay now we'll want to link our web page to this css file so what we're going to do between the head tags is use this link tag and there's a few attributes that we need to include within this link tag the first is rel which is short for relationship this states the relationship between this document and the mentioned linked document and we're going to type in style sheet all right next we're going to type in the type attribute and this specifies the media type it's not required but it's considered good practice to include this and we're just going to type text slash css and then lastly we're going to type in href which stands for hypertext reference we will place either the file name or the file path or the url of the css file that we want to link here so that was style dot css let's save this reload and boom we have css now the external method of css styling is extremely useful because all you would need to do is have a single css file and all you would need is just to include this link to each webpage that you want to style with these css properties so imagine you have a website with like 50 different pages you wouldn't have to type all of this in on every single page you can just link each of these 50 pages to this one specific css file so that will conclude this primer to css if you would like a copy of each of these documents we worked on today i'll post all of this in the comments down below and pin it to the top if you would like to take a look but yeah that is your introductory lesson to css hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in three
