hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain 2d arrays also known as multidimensional arrays in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you can become a hero and save our channel by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right everybody welcome back in this video i'm going to be explaining 2d arrays a 2d array is an array of arrays think of a 2d array as having a number of rows and columns that's how i think of it at least we're going to be assigning some cars some card names into each element of our 2d array think of it like a parking lot and each element has a row and column kind of like a parking spot number so to begin let's declare a 2d array and allocate some memory so the data type will be string then for a 2d array we need two sets of straight brackets this time and then the name of the array we will call this cars equals new the data type again which is string two sets of straight brackets and then we will list the amount of rows and columns so let's say this will be three by three three arrays and each array is going to have three elements so let's begin assigning some cars into our 2d array let's begin with row zero so in order to access a certain element of our array we type in the array name and this time we will add two sets of straight braces we would like to access element zero zero so this is row zero column zero equals and let's assign a name of camaro now we would like to access row zero column one and let's assign a different car maybe a corvette cars at row zero index two will equal maybe a silverado all right we're going to move to row one now actually i'm just going to copy what we have here paste it so we are now on row one column zero and let's assign a different car maybe a mustang and let's repeat the process just to speed this up i'm going to do a little bit of copying and pasting so we're within row one and then we have column zero one and two and let's change some of these names for row one column one i will assign a value of ranger and row one column two maybe f one fifty okay so we are now within row two column zero so i'm going to copy that change some of the values row 2 column 0 i will assign a value of ferrari we are now on row 2 column 1 i will assign a value of maybe lambo for lamborghini and then lastly row two column two and i will place a tesla in this element and there we have it we have assigned all of the values within our 2d array so let's display all of the elements of our 2d array using a nested for loop so we will have a outer for loop in charge of the rows and an inner for loop in charge of the columns so let's create a nested for loop so this is the outer for loop we'll need an index int we'll call it i for index equals zero and then we will continue this for loop as long as i is less than cars dot length and lastly we will increment our counter our index i by one within the for loop let's add a blank print line just so that we move our cursor down to the next row within the console window when we display each row of cars that we have now we need an inner for loop to display each column each element within each column of our 2d array so we'll need an index let's call this int j because j comes after i set this equal to zero that's the first statement our condition is going to look a little funky we'll continue this inner for loop as long as j is less than cars at index i dot length so this will take the length of our first row and we'll continue our counter our index of j as long as it's less than the length of our row that we're currently on and then we will increment our index j by one within the inner for loop all we'll do is print our array of cars at element i for this first set of straight brackets and j cars at row i column j and then maybe i'll add a space just to separate these and what we get here is that this will display our 2d array of cars that we have now there is an additional way to write this 2d array instead of allocating all of the memory for this 2d array what we could have done is assign all of the values right away to this 2d array when we declared it if you prefer to write it that way this is what we'll change instead of allocating all of the space all of the elements that we would like for this 2d array we're instead going to assign all of the values so let's get rid of this portion and we're first going to assign all of the values within row number zero this is our first array so within our set of curly braces we will add our camaro followed by our corvette and lastly our silverado so this is row one it's its own array we will add a second array for row number one the first row was row number zero so in our second array of row one we have our mustang followed by our ranger and lastly our f150 okay that is array number two also known as row one we are now on row two so let's add another array and we have our ferrari followed by our lambo and lastly our tesla all right and then with all of this i'm going to enclose all of these arrays within another set of curly braces then i'll need to add a semicolon to the end and just so that this is easier to read i'm going to separate each array within a new line so it should look something like this ah that's good enough sorry i'm very particular about the appearance okay so this is our 2d array of cars that we have and you can see that it will work much the same even if i remove all of these lines of code the only difference is that we're assigning all of the values to our 2d array when we declare it alright everybody so that is the basics of 2d arrays it's really just an array of arrays think of it as having rows and columns if you'd like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below please be sure to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to
