hey there it's me again in today's topic we're going to create a weight converter program in Python this is an exercise that will follow up the lesson on if statements we'll convert pounds to kilograms or kilograms to pounds the user is going to decide we will Begin by creating a weight variable we will assign some user input enter your weight we will convert this input into a floating Point number so add that cast then we will ask for a unit is this weight in kilograms or pounds input kilograms or pounds we want the user to type in either K for kilograms or L for pounds and these are capital letters by the way using an if statement let's first check to see if our unit is equal to a capital K that means the current weight is in kilograms we need to convert that weight to pounds let's reassign weight equal to our weight times 2.205 else if unit is equal to l we need to convert to kilograms weight equals weight divided by 2.205 else the user did not type in something that was valid let's print using an F string unit was not valid at the end of our program we will print the new weight I'll use an F string your weight is our new weight after it's reassigned now we need a unit of measurement this is what I'm thinking we'll do within our if and else if statements let's reassign our unit we're reassigning unit to be lbs for pounds else if unit equals kgs four kilograms in our results we will display our new unit let's take a look enter your weight actually I'm just going to make one change I'm going to add colon space there that's much better enter your weight let's say I'm 180 pounds this is in pounds I'll type capital l your weight in kilograms is 81.63 I think I'm going to round this I will enclose the weight variable within a round function we will round to one decimal place let's try this again enter your weight maybe I'm 81 kilograms I'll type K for kilograms your weight is 178.6 pounds let's make sure that this else statement works too and to your weight 180 pizzas pizzas was not valid so we're still displaying our output we would want to avoid that if somebody doesn't type in a valid unit so let's cut this line then paste each within the if and else if statements when we exit the else statement we're not printing the output so let's make sure that this works and to your weight I am 100 80 pizzas pizza was not valid alright everybody well that is a weight converter program in Python I thought this would be a helpful exercise now that we have finished the section on if statements and yeah that is a weight converter program in Python
