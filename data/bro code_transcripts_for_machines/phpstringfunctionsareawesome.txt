hey welcome back everybody in today's topic I'm going to explain a few useful string functions you might be interested in let's begin with creating a username assign this your first and last name the first function I'll discuss is the string to lower function I'm going to reassign our username and use the string to lower function then we will pass in our username as an argument then let's Echo our username after we make it lowercase Echo username there my username is all lowercase alternatively there's string to Upper string two upper my name is all uppercase then we have trim will remove any white spaces before or after your string there there's the string pad function we can pad a string up to a certain amount of characters with a character we specify let's say I would like to pad my username to a Max size or 20 characters with zeros here's my new username or maybe we could use forward slashes or something then we have string replace string replace within our string we can replace one character with another you know what let's create a new variable how about a phone number let's say phone phone equals make up some phone number 1234567890 here are the order of arguments what would we like to replace let's replace any dashes that'll be the first argument the second argument is what we're replacing the dashes with let's use an empty string then third is our string or variable containing a string we are reassigning our phone number here's a new phone number with all the dashes removed or we could replace them with something else like a forward slash that is the string replace function then we have string reverse s t r rev let's reverse our username then Echo our new username there it is it's all backwards then we have String Shuffle we can shuffle a string compare strcmp we can compare a string or a variable against another Stringer variable I'll assign this to a new variable let's say equals so if these two strings are the same then this function will return zero if they're different we'll either return one or negative one think of it as if these two strings are the same string compare returns zero it returns false so that's how to see if two strings are equal then we have the string length function string length let's create a new variable count how many characters are within our string in my string we have eight characters one two three four five six seven eight let's do that with our phone number our phone number has 12 characters that is the string length function we can use the string position function to find the position of a character with my username let's find the first position of a space the character or string you're looking for is the second argument I'll create a new variable index so the index of the first space within my username is three zero one two three let's do that with our phone number then let's find the position of the first Dash which would be three as well zero one two three then we have the substring function sub string we can create a new string from a portion of another string with my username I'll take the first three characters and create a new string I'll create a variable named first name here are the order of arguments take your original string let's say our username the second argument is the starting index I would like to start at the beginning the index will be zero then an ending index I would like to end at this space in my name but if you're using your own first and last name you're going to have a different position so for me I'd like to end at the third index then I will echo my first name we have created a new string from an original string but we have to specify the beginning and ending index this time let's take the last four characters I'll create a new variable last name we'll use the substring function again username now you can list a beginning index and then don't specify an ending index then you'll create a new string all the way up to the end if I set my index to be 4 we'll create a new substring with everything after the index of four no matter how long the string is so let's Echo our last name and there's my last name in my example so to get everything after the beginning index just don't list a third argument okay now we have the implode and explode functions with your username add your middle name or maiden name or whatever or a nickname doesn't matter just something we can use the explode function to assign each of these portions of our name into an array let's create an array named full name we will use the explode function we are exploding our username however at which character or characters do we separate each element in our array we'll do so by any spaces in this example so that will be the first argument explode our username let's see if this is actually an array let's Echo our full name warning array to string conversion so that's a good sign that means that our full name is an array you know what let's use a for each Loop to demonstrate for each take our array full name as name then I will Echo each name there here's my array and I've taken each portion of our name and placed them as elements within a new array now we have implode which takes an array and creates a string out of them a single string let's say our username is an array so type your full name then we will use the implode function username equals implode what are we imploding let's implode our username then you can add characters between each element I will add an empty space between each element when we implode it then let's Echo our username Echo username my array is all one long string now or maybe I can separate each element with a dash it's still one string all right everybody so those are a few useful string Methods I think you might be interested in in PHP
