hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well in today's video i'm going to show you all how the map function works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm what up everybody let's discuss the map function the map function will apply a function to each item in an interval that would include lists tuples things like that and the map function accepts two arguments are iterable as well as the function we would like to apply to each item within our iterable for example let's say that we have an online store to represent this i have a list of tuples named store each topple within this list corresponds to an item for sale within our store there's shirts pants jackets and socks and each item has a price in us dollars let's say now what i would like to do is to convert all of the prices within my store to euros and currently the conversion rate as of the filming of this video is one us dollar to 0.82 euros so let's begin we can easily convert dollars to euros with a lambda function so let's say two euros equals lambda the parameter will be data colon and the next part's a little bit tricky within a set of parenthesis to represent a tuple we'll take data at index zero that corresponds to the first column comma data at index one this represents the index of our prices we're going to take data at index one times 0.82 and that's it the first column will be left untouched but the data in column 1 will be multiplied by 0.82 now our map function is going to create a map object but we can easily cast that to a different type of iterable so let's say that store underscore euros equals map parenthesis and then we can pass in our function as well as our iterable our function is our two euros function comma and our iterable is our store and that is it now if you want to convert this map object to an iterable you can easily surround this with a cast i would like to convert this map object to a list and we will now have a new store named store euros which will have all of the different prices of our store in euros and to display this i'll use a for loop for i in store euros print i and let's try it yep that seems about right all of the prices in our store are now in euros let's pretend that these prices are already in euros and we would like to convert these to american dollars so we will use the same conversion rate but divide by 0.82 so let's create a separate lambda function two dollars equals i think i'll just copy this but we are going to divide the first index of data by 0.82 and let's say store dollars to represent our store in dollars because we're pretending now that it's currently in euros and we will display 4i in store dollars so if all of these prices are in euros we are now converting them to american dollars but you may want to do some rounding as opposed to the nearest descent well everyone that is the map function it applies a function to each item in an iterable those include lists tuples the like you pass in your iterable and your function as an argument to the map function so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how the map function works in python
