hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can add images to a web page using HTML so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody here's how to add an image to a web page but you'll need an image to work with I have a picture of a dog I'll add that to my website folder next to my index file I have a picture of a dog to add an image we'll use a selfclosing image tag then set the source equal to B the name of your image including the extension mine is dog and this is a PNG file so this picture is fairly large you can change the dimensions with the height or width attributes I'll set the height to be 200 200 pixels now the width will adjust automatically however you could change that too if you wanted if I need this image to be a perfect square I will also set the width to be 200 however this does compress the image depending on the dimensions of your original picture you may need to change the height and or width I'll set the height to be 200 though then keep the width the same it'll adjust automatically now for some reason if your image isn't displaying let's say that I get the file extension wrong I'll say that this is a JPEG well the image won't display you can add alternative text with the alt attribute the alternative text you could say anything this is a picture of a dog this image doesn't display you at least display the alternative text now the nice thing about the alt attribute is that if somebody is visually impaired and they're using a screen reader the screen reader will read this alt description just to test my screen reader I'm going to add some text before and after this image as well let's add an H1 header tag this is a cute dog then I'll add some text after I'll use an H3 header tag woof woof I'll use my screen reader this is an extension on Chrome you can download my first website this is a cute dog this is a picture of a dog woof woof the screen reader read the alternative text for this image so it is good practice if you include an image to write a brief description of the image another cool thing you can do with images is that you can't turn them into hyperlinks I will surround our image element with a pair of a tags a meaning anchor then I will set the href attribute equal to a URL I'll find the Wikipedia page for dogs all right I'll copy this URL then I will set the href attribute to be this URL when I click on this image it takes me to the Wikipedia page for dogs so yeah you can turn an image into a hyperlink another cool thing you can do too is that you can include gifs in your web page this is my gift that I'll include I'll add that to my website folder I'll include a selfclosing image tag set the source equal to B the name of my image then be sure to get the file extension right this is a gif I'll set the height attribute to be maybe 200 as well height equals 200. then I'll add some alternative text alt attribute will be smiling dog gif now with a website you may have all of your images within a separate folder like this I'll go to new folder I'll create a folder named images then I will move my images to the images folder so my images are no longer being displayed we have our alternative text this is a picture of a dog and smiling dog gif with your Source attribute we're using a relative file path we need to navigate to the images folder then find the appropriate image files I'm going to precede these images with the name of the folder they are found within the images folder you may also need another forward slash for me either work let's move on to an exercise in the last few videos we were working on a web page for song lyrics Let's include some album art for my song that I picked I have a picture of the original album art that this song is found from I will move that to my website folder then I will move it to the images folder within my website folder I need a selfclosing image tag set the source equal to B we need to navigate to the images folder I will list that first Images slash the name of the file for me it's album cover dot jpeg then I'll change the dimensions I will set the height equal to B 200. I'll add some alternative text alt equals album art cover then a line break maybe two then I'll turn this into a hyperlink as well I will surround our image with a pair of a tags I will set the href attribute to be the original YouTube video where you can find this song so href equals the YouTube video that I linked before so this should take me to YouTube there we are all right everybody well that's how to include an image on a web page using HTML
