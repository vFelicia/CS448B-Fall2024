hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to explain the auto increment attribute in MySQL the auto increment attribute can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our primary key can be populated automatically then each subsequent row is auto incremented I'm going to recreate this table transactions but first I need to drop it drop table transactions then we will recreate this table but apply that auto increment feature create table transactions there were two columns a transaction ID the data type was int and an amount the data type was decimal five digits Precision of two the auto increment feature can only be applied to a column that is set as a key our transaction ID will set to be the primary key to apply the auto increment feature add the keyword Auto increment Now by default the primary key is going to be set to 1. so after creating this table I will select all from transactions okay we have successfully created our table then I will insert some values insert into transactions R values so we don't need to explicitly insert a transaction ID that'll be done for us automatically but we still need an amount I will insert 4.99 for the first amount since we're not inserting all of the values into a row explicitly we would need to specify what column this value is for that is for the amount okay let us execute this and take a look yeah so the transaction ID was set to one even though we did not manually insert that value let's insert the next amount so we have 289 yep transaction ID 2 is 289 3 38 transaction ID3 4.99 transaction ID of four we could set our primary key to begin at a different value to do that we would type alter table the name of the table Auto increment let's begin at 1000 instead of one then I'm going to go ahead and drop all the rows we'll start fresh delete from transactions select all from transactions okay then let's insert those rows again and see what happens insert into transactions R values 4.99 was the first amount this value is for our amount column now this transaction ID it begins at one thousand then it should Auto increment the next value was 289 our next transaction ID is 1001 338 1002 then 4.99 1003 all right everybody that is the auto increment feature it's a keyword that can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our key will be incremented by one for each row that we insert but yeah that is auto increment in MySQL
