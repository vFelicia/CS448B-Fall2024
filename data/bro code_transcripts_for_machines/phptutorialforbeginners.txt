hey everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know to get started working with PHP so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you would like to be notified if I release new courses in the future be sure to subscribe because I kind of release them randomly that is all PHP is a serverside scripting language it's used to build Dynamic web pages it runs on a server not the user's web browser although haters say PHP is dead it's still used on 70 percent of all known websites I don't know that doesn't sound dead to me many developers prefer PHP for its speed Simplicity and flexibility it's a popular choice for small businesses and Freelancers especially since in the news lately you hear about layoffs in the tech industry PHP was released in 1995 it was originally an acronym for personal home page but that was later changed to PHP hypertext preprocessor to reflect the language's evolution in fact PHP was never intended to be a new programming language it grew organically and out of control until it became the Behemoth that it is today fun fact the mascot of PHP is an elephant which is named elephant Ella PHP find I don't know how I would describe the basics of PHP is as follows a browser sends a request to a server PHP on that server processes that request then the server sends HTML back to the browser our server running PHP can even communicate to a database then back to the web browser PHP is most commonly used with relational databases such as MySQL postgres and Oracle PHP can be written alongside with HTML before beginning the series you'll want to have a solid foundation on HTML you will need to know MySQL but that won't be until about video 20. for your web server I recommend zamp zamp is a crossplatform web server solution stack it's basically a software suite it contains an Apache server MySQL and PHP you'll also need some sort of text editor where are you going going to write the code vs code tends to be the most popular nowadays and that's what I use for my own personal projects we'll write our code with vs code then run our code on our xampp server since we can't run it on a web browser I'll show you how we can download both the xampp server and the vs code text editor now we will begin the installation process of a server that we can execute PHP code within go to this URL apachefriends.org like I said before PHP code is executed on a server and returned to a web browser click on one of the relevant download links for your operating system I'm running Windows I will download the windows version okay for me the installation process has started and it's done so let's open it for setup we're going to click next all we really need is MySQL and phpmyadmin it looks like PHP is already selected for us then next remember this file location my folder containing all of my zamp files is located in my C drive next you can select a language I'll pick English next and give it a minute do you want to start the control panel now we might as well and finish here's the control panel for my zamp server we will start the Apache service if everything works the Apache module is highlighted green that means it's working if you ever need to stop this module you can hit the stop button let's start MySQL as well and our MySQL server is working if you see any red text within this log that means there is an error if you run into any problems just check to see what that error was but everything for me is running fine this control panel will run behind the scenes I can close out of it but it's still running which is important hey this is bro from the future I forgot to mention in this video that if you ever shut down your computer you will have to open up the control panel again and restart these Services yeah I forgot to mention that so be sure to do that now that our xampp server is downloaded we will need that vs code text editor I'm assuming that some of you have that downloaded already but if you don't here's how if you need a text editor I recommend Visual Studio code if you're interested in downloading this text editor head to this URL code.visualstudio.com I'm going to click this blue download button select the correct download link for my operating system I'm running Windows I will select this one then we will run this executable accept the license agreement yes I did read it that fast you do have the option of selecting a destination location I'll keep it as the default next next I'll create a desktop icon then next and install we might as well launch vs code then finish I have vs code open along with the modern web browser I'm using Google Chrome in the series we're going to create a new file within our zamp folder so let's open a folder remember that file path for the zamp server that's where you're going to look for me that was in my C drive go to xampp under htdocs we're going to create a new folder new folder I'll name this folder website to contain my website stuff then I will select folder within my website folder I'm going to create a new file I will name this file index.php the reason that I'm naming this file index is because that is the default for a home page so we now have a PHP file in vs code If you're receiving a warning that states cannot validate since a PHP installation could not be found we need to validate the executable path of the PHP executable found within our xampp server to do that we're going to find our settings file it's a Json file PHP validate executable path edit in the settings Json file let me maximize this next to PHP validate executable path we need to find the file path to the PHP executable again within my C drive within my zamp folder go to PHP then copy this file path for the executable I'll right click go to properties copy this location close out of this window paste that executable path then add PHP dot EXE then these may have to be forward slashes let's save on Windows you can press Ctrl s to save close out of these settings and that warning goes away I also recommend a few extensions the first extension is PHP intellifence it should be this one it gives you access to a few tools that are useful for PHP development let's install that plugin then look up the live server extension it offers a live reload feature then lastly PHP server it allows you to serve your project with PHP those are the three extensions that I recommend alright we are now ready to get started in a web browser to access your xampp server you can type localhost as the URL this will bring you to the zamp dashboard we would like to access the website folder of the zamp server so let's add localhost slash the name of that folder website our PHP code will execute on the server and be returned to this web browser whatever the output is to write some PHP code Type left angle bracket question mark PHP wherever our PHP code ends type question mark right angle bracket our PHP code will be between these two angle brackets to display a message you can type Echo either single quotes or double quotes then a semicolon at the end a semicolon is kind of like the period at the end of a sentence in English I will type a message I like pizza to save you can go to the top file save or use the shortcut which I'll be using so for me that's Ctrl s if I were to reload this webpage it displays my message I like pizza to make your life a lot easier we can add a live server extension to your web browser currently I'm using Chrome to add a live server extension I'm going to go to settings extensions open Chrome web store then search live server and that should be this one add to Chrome ADD extension let's close out of these tabs I'm going to go to extensions select live server web extension enable live reload we'll need the actual server address as well as your live server address this URL is the actual server address if you're on a Mac it may contain a port number such as 8080. so let's copy this address go to extensions then add the actual server address now we need the live server address to find this we can go to vs code press this go live button there should be a new tab that pops up copy this address that is the live server address then we will paste it within the live server address of this live server web extension then press apply you may need to restart your web browser as well all right that was localhost Slash website you know what I don't just like pizza I love pizza if I were to save this file it should update automatically see within our website it now says I love pizza let's add a second line with Echo Echo double quotes add a semicolon to the end let's add another line it's really good the output is all on one line to add a line break within your set of quotes you can add a Break Tag I love pizza it's really good to add a comment a comment is used as a note for yourself or other Developers all you have to type is double forward slashes then some message this is a comment our comment is not displayed as output it's mostly just used for notes for a multiline comment you would type forward slash asterisk that will begin a multiline comment this is a multiline comment the end of our PHP script is currently green that means it's being included within this multiline comment wherever you need your multiline comment to end you would type asterisk then forward slash the end of the script is blue again and you can see that this multiline comment isn't being displayed as output now the cool thing about PHP files is that they can contain HTML CSS JavaScript and well of course PHP so I will also include some HTML code within this PHP file so in vs code to generate some boilerplate code you can type exclamation point and then tab we now have some HTML markup within our PHP file within the body of our document I'll add maybe a button I'll create a button to order a pizza I should probably precede this button with a line break so there's our button it currently doesn't do anything but that's just a demonstration that you can include more than just PHP code within a PHP file alright everybody so that is an introduction to PHP in the next video we'll discuss variables hey if you're enjoying this video please let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down
