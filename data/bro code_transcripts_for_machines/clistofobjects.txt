all right what's going on everybody so in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create a list of objects from a custom class of ours in the last video i showed you all how we can create a list of strings but what if we would like to create a list of players to keep track of the amount of players in our game and their names so let's create a list list then we need angle brackets and the data type of the object we would like to store within our list i would like to store player objects and i'll name this list players because we're keeping track of the players players equals new list angle brackets our data type again player parentheses semicolon so we now have a list that can store player objects so let's instantiate some player objects and i have a field setup username you can also set up getters and setters too if you prefer so let's create some player objects player and we'll call this player player one equals new player but we need to pass in a username as an argument let's say that this is chad and i'll create maybe two more players so player 1 player 2 player 3. player 2 will be what about steve and karen okay now to add our player objects to our list type the name of the list dot add and then pass in the name of the object players dot add player one then do the same thing with player two and player three then i'll use a for each loop to display all these four each the data type is player player in players so let's take a look at this i'm going to console.writeline each player but since we're displaying each object directly what's going to be displayed is the namespace plus the data type of our object we can access the username field and that will display each player's username or we can overwrite the tostring method so we have chad steve and kieran or we can override the tostring method so let's try that too public override to string and i'm going to return username so then when i use console.writeline i can just type in the object's name so we have chad steven karen now another thing that you can do when we instantiate these player objects we can do so anonymously so within the add method of our list players we can simply just pass in new player then pass in a name and then we don't necessarily need to create a name for each of these objects so i'm going to pass in new player steve and new player karen so this is optional but i like to create anonymous objects it's less work so we should have our three players chad steve and karen so yeah that's how to add objects to a list within the angle brackets you just list the type of object that you would like to store within your list so yeah that's a list of objects in c sharp if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
