hey what's going on everybody so in today's video I need to explain switch statements a switch is a replacement to using many lcif statements switches are more efficient and take less code to write compared to using many else if statements here is an example I have a letter grade a student's grade can be a b c d f or if their grade is invalid we have an else statement that states that letter grade is not valid depending on what our grade is we will execute one of many statements if our grade is a then we will Echo you did great if it's B you did good see you did okay d you did poorly F you failed if we have a grade that isn't valid such as Pizza well that's not a grade Pizza is not a valid grade using many else if statements is fairly inefficient and it's a lot to write to I would like to propose a better solution and that is by using a switch which is the topic of this video to create a switch we will type switch add a set of parentheses then add a set of curly braces within the parentheses of the switch what would we like to examine let's examine our letter grid then we'll probably want to change our letter grade to something valid like a within the switch we're going to create cases one case for each match that we're looking up type case what are we comparing our grade to let's compare our grid to the letter A then add a colon if our grade matches this case we'll write some code what do we want to do let's Echo you did great after all of your code add break to break out of the switch this is the first case let's copy this case underneath it after the break statement let's paste it then we will have case b you did good let's copy this again k c you did okay then d you did poorly case f U failed our grade is currently in a you did great Let's test out case b you did good see you did okay d you did poorly F you failed what if we have a grade that isn't valid like pizza again well nothing happens there were no matching cases we simply exit the switch if none of these cases match you can add a default case type default I can't spell it right today if there are no matching cases what are we gonna do let's Echo some sort of message I'll add a placeholder our grade variable is not valid so Pizza is obviously not a letter grade Pizza is not valid there were no matching cases therefore we resulted to the default case the default case is kind of like the else statement now the reason that you have break in here let me demonstrate is because you will break out of the switch what if we were missing these break statements temporarily I'm going to remove them let's say that our grade is B you did good you did okay you did poorly you failed B is not valid you need the break statement to break out of the switch wherever there's a match we will execute the code followed underneath then any subsequent code followed after so be sure to include those break statements unless you want to execute every statement afterwards in some cases that could be helpful but not for this one let's go over another example we're going to get the current date I'll create variable date to get the current date we will use the date function within the parentheses of the date function within a set of quotes Type L just to be sure it's working fine let's Echo our date for testing L will give you the day of the week currently for me it's Monday so let's place our date within a switch we'll create a switch parentheses curly braces we are examining our date then we'll need a case case Monday if today is Monday let's Echo I hate Mondays then break so it's Monday I will Echo I hate Mondays so let's copy this case paste it change Monday to Tuesday what can we say for Tuesday it is Taco Tuesday So currently for me it's still Monday just for testing purposes I am going to change our date after we get the current date I just want to be sure that our switch is working what if our date was Tuesday it is Taco Tuesday what if it's Wednesday the work week is half over let's change our case to be Wednesday the work week is half over Thursday it's almost the weekend change our date to be Thursday it's almost the weekend Friday the weekend is here the weekend is here Saturday time to party time to party then Sunday time to let's relax on Sunday time to relax it's optional but we could add a default case if there are no matching cases let's Echo our variable date is not a day let's change our date to something like pizza well Pizza is not a day so I'll remove this line depending on what day you're executing this code it will display a custom message depending on the day of the week like I said today for me it's Monday so my message prints I hate Mondays alright everybody in conclusion a switch is a replacement to using many lcip statements they're more efficient and take less code to write I would recommend a switch if you're checking some value or variable many times over and well everybody those are switches in PHP
