hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the super function in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if i could have just a moment of your time please like comment and subscribe i would greatly appreciate it well then since you clicked on this video i should probably discuss the super function now the super function is used to give access to the methods of a parent class it returns a temporary object of a parent class when used here's an example of why the super function would be useful let's take this program that i've written there's three classes a class called rectangle which is the parent class to two children classes square and cube and all we're doing is creating a square object and a cube object but we need to pass in a length and a width for squares and a length width and height for cubes now with programming we don't like to repeat code we like to reuse code and if you take a look within my knit methods for both square and cube we're repeating self.length equals length and self.width equals width twice for our init methods so one thing that we can do any similarities between the square and cube class we can place within the rectangle class and then reuse this code so what i'm going to do is copy this init method within our square class and paste it within our rectangle parent class and then in order to access this init method we can use the super function so we no longer need these two lines of code what i'm going to do is ask the rectangle class to use its init method so we're going to type super parentheses dot and then the name or the function of the parent class that we would like to use and i would like to use the init method but i need to send a length and a width because it requires that so let's send these so we're going to pass in our length and our width and now we can do the same thing for our cube init method so i will copy this line of code we no longer need these two lines of code because we will be reusing our init method within the parent class of rectangle but we'll still need to keep this line in to assign the height because that's a difference between our square and cube class and now we can just reuse this init method within the rectangle parent class now i'm thinking that we should probably test to see if length and width are assigned to these attributes and one way that i think would be fun would be to create an area method for squares and a volume method for cubes so let's define an area method within the square class def area and i would like to return self dot length times self dot width and we can create a volume method within cubes so let's do that def let's change this to volume we'll multiply it length times width times height but we need to type self dot pipe and we can call these methods to get the area of a square or the volume of a cube let's print square dot area and then cube dot volume so if our init method is actually being used we should have a length and the width assigned to these attributes and it looks like we do in conclusion the super function is used to give access to the methods of a parent class it returns a temporary object of a parent class when used in order to access the methods of the parent class also known as a super class and in this example within the init methods of both square and cube we immediately called the init method of the parent class to pass in some arguments that both of these classes have in common so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how the super function works in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro foreign
