okay it looks like we're on constants constants are immutable values which are known at compile time and do not change for the life of a program let's say that we have a double variable named pi and this equals the first few digits of pi 3.14159 if this is not a constant people can actually change the value contained within this variable and that could be a security concern let's say pi now equals 420 and then i will display the value contained within pi so if you do not want people to be able to change this value we can precede the data type of this variable with the const keyword and this variable is now a constant and we can't update this variable now that it's a constant so yeah that's a constant it's an immutable value which is known at compile time and does not change for the life of the program and it adds a little bit of security to our programs because people cannot later change these values so yeah those are constants in c sharp
