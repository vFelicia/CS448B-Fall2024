hey everybody so today we got to talk about both multiple and multilevel inheritance we'll begin with multiple inheritance that's when a child class inherits from more than one parent class for example a class of C can inherit the traits from both class A and B in Python you can have more than one parent multilevel inheritance we'll talk about near the end of this topic so in this example we're going to create two parent classes prey I'll write pass for now and Predator we'll create a class of rabbit a class of Hawk then class fish rabbit Hawk and fish are going to be children classes prey and Predator will be parents if one of these classes rabbit hawk or fish inherit from prey they get the ability to flee we will Define a method of flee all we'll do in this example is print the following text this animal is fleeing if you're a predator you get the method to hunt Define hunt we will print this animal is hunting rabbits they will inherit from the prey class they're typically not Predators except that one rabbit and montypython in the Holy Grail that's the exception rabbit will inherit the prey class then it gets access to a flea method Hawks are predators they will inherit the Predator class now fish they will hunt smaller fish and flee from bigger fish you could consider fish both prey and predators so they will inherit both classes we will use multiple inheritance they will inherit everything from the prey class and the Predator class now let's see if this does in fact work now we'll create a rabbit object rabbit equals rabbit there are no parameter setup we don't need to send any arguments to the Constructor Hawk equals Hawk and fish equals fish so let's take our rabbit object and they should have a flea method rabbit. flea method this animal is fleeing but they do not have a hunt method because they're not Predators rabbit object has no attribute hunt Hawks can hunt they're Predators they inherited that method this animal is hunting but they can't flee they're not prey Hawk object has no attribute flea fish can do both they inherit from the prey class and the Predator class fish. flee this animal is fleeing fish. hunt this animal is hunting children classes can inherit from more than one parent which is what we did for fish they are both prey and predators whereas in rabbits are just prey Hawks are just Predators if you need to inherit from more than one parent you just add that additional class to The Inheritance list with multilevel inheritance a parent can inherit from another parent we will create a class of animal and for now I'll write pass prey and Predator are going to inherit from the animal class so we need to add animal to each inheritance list let's say if you're an animal you get a method to eat all animals will eat print this animal is eating and you can sleep Define sleep print this animal is sleeping so think of rabbit Hawk and fish as children classes prey and Predator are those classes parents and animal is the grandparent prey and Predator will inherit everything that the animal class has rabbit Hawk and fish will inherit everything the prey and Predator classes have so now our rabbit Hawk and fish classes should have the ability to eat and sleep and we'll test that rabbit. eat this animal is eating rabbit. sleep this animal is sleeping let's check out fish fish. eat this animal is eating fish. sleep this animal is sleeping okay we're going to expand upon our example a little bit let me zoom out each of our objects is going to have a name our rabbit will have a first name of bugs Hawk will be Tony as in Tony Hawk our fish will be Nemo within our classes we don't have any Constructor set up in which class should we assign the name attribute let's do so within our animal class so we will Define a Constructor to assign these attributes we will receive a name we'll assign self. name equals name now with these other classes if you're not assigning any attributes or if you don't need any other initialization logic you don't need a Constructor we'll implicitly use the Constructor we inherit from the parent let's convert each of these print statements to an F string replace animal with self. name now let's have our rabbit use the E method oh we should get rid of this there we go bugs is eating rabbit. sleep bugs is sleeping rabbit. flee bugs is fleeing let's check out our Hawk Hawks don't have a flea method because they're Predators not prey let's eat Tony is eating let's sleep Tony is sleeping let's hunt Tony is hunting let's check our fish next our fish can eat Nemo is eating our fish can sleep Nemo is sleeping they can flee Nemo is fleeing and Hunt Nemo is hunting okay everybody that is both multiple and multilevel inheritance with multiple inheritance a child can inherit from more than one parent class you just add each additional class to The Inheritance list with multilevel inheritance a child can inherit from a parent which inherits from another parent Class C can inherit from B where Class B inherits from a think of C as the child b as the parent and a as the grandparent c will have all the attributes and methods even available within the grandparent class of a and well everybody that is both multiple and multi level inheritance in Python
