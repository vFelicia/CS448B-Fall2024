all right welcome back people switches a switch is a more efficient alternative to using many else if statements it allows a value to be tested for equality against many cases here's an example of where a switch would be useful i have a small program we will tell a user to enter in a letter grade and depending on their grade we will print a custom message if grade equals a we'll print perfect else if grade equals b will print a different message so on and so forth so it's considered bad practice to use a lot of else if statements a better alternative is to use a switch here's how we can create one type switch parenthesis curly braces whatever value you would like to examine for equality placed within the parentheses i would like to examine my grade and now we need to write some cases case and then some value you would like to test for equality so i am comparing characters i will write the character a colon then if these values match we will execute some subset of code kind of like an if statement let's print perfect and then add a break afterwards then you can add another case so case b you did good okay see you did okay case d at least it's not enough case f you failed now you can add a default case this functions like an else statement if no other cases match we will execute whatever's within our default case so that means there are no matching letter grades so let's print please enter only valid grades and let's test it enter a letter grade a this will print perfect whatever's within our matching case let's try it again b you did good see you did okay d at least it's not enough f you failed and if there are no matching cases we will execute our default case uh how about w for win please enter only valid grades the reason that we add breaks after each case is so we can break out of our switch and exit let me show you what this looks like if we do not have any breaks now let's say that we have a c letter grade you did okay at least it's not enough you failed please enter only valid grades so the reason that we have breaks is to exit out of our switch if we have a matching case and there are no breaks we will continue executing each case that comes after so it is important to have those breaks if you want to exit out of your switch well yeah that's a switch everybody it's a more efficient alternative to using many else if statements using a few elsif statements is okay but it's considered poor practice to use a lot of them so yeah those are switches if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
