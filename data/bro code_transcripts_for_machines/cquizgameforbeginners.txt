hey everybody in this video we're going to create a quiz game using c plus let's begin by creating an array of questions these will be of the string data type i will name this array questions and then let's think of some questions really add any questions that you want here's a few that come to mind for me what year was c plus plus created okay that is the first question i'll add an additional string question two who invented c plus plus third question what is the predecessor of c plus plus and i couldn't think of a fourth question so i'm gonna ask is the earth flat good enough with each question there will be four corresponding options i think a two dimensional array would be perfect for this this will be a twodimensional array of strings named options we'll need to set the number of columns four columns is good this first array will be for the options for the first question a will be 1969 b 1975 c 1985 1985 is the correct answer d 1989 now we have our next array who invented c plus guido van rossum he's the creator of python so that's not the correct answer yarn strow strip i'm sorry if i mispronounce your name dude hopefully you're not watching right now uh b is the correct answer in this case c john carmack d mark zuckerberg we're on question three what is the predecessor of c plus plus the correct answer is c that would be option a c plus c minus minus or b plus plus okay last question is the earth flat yes no sometimes what's earth all right then i just need to surround all of these arrays with another set of curly braces and there is our twodimensional array named options to hold all of the options for our questions we'll need to create an answer key next this will be an array of characters answer key array equals here are the correct answers c b a then b 1985 bjorn strosstrup c the language seed that is and no the earth is not flat i looked it up on wikipedia just now let's calculate the size of our questions how many questions do we have and size equals the size of our array of questions divided by the size of one of the elements questions at index zero we'll create a character to hold our guess and score to hold the score now we'll need to iterate over our questions for let me move down here and i equals zero we'll continue this as long as i is less than the size of our array the size of questions this would effectively be the amount of questions that we have then i'm going to increment i by one we will iterate once through all of the questions we have standard output let's access the string that's within questions at index i i'll add a new line just for some text decoration i'm going to add a bunch of asterisks before and after the question so let's get rid of this i think that'll look pretty cool there we go then we'll need to iterate over our 2d array we'll use an inner for loop for that we'll need a different index i is already taken let's pick j inch j equals zero we'll continue this as long as j is less than now we'll need to calculate how many elements are within each array so we can do that with size of our options array at index of i divided by the size of options and there's two indices here i then zero then we will increment j by one we will display our options standard output options there's two indices i then j i'll add a new line so if i were to run this this should display all of the questions and all of the options yeah here we are what year was c plus created who invented c plus plus what is the predecessor of c plus plus is the earth flat after all of the options are laid out we will accept some user input standard input we will place the user's input within guess then just in case the user types in something that's lowercase like a lowercase c we're looking for capital c so let's take the user's guess then make it uppercase guess equals to upper pass in guess so that will capitalize the character the user enters in then let's check to see if the user's guess is equal to the answer we'll need to access the answer key at index of i that's the current numbered question if those two values are the same we will display correct i'll add a new line then increment the user score score plus plus else the user's guess is not correct standard output wrong then we will display the correct answer standard output answer colon space we'll access the answer key at index of i then i'll add a new line okay let's try this so far what year was c plus created c who invented c plus plus that would be b what is the predecessor of c plus plus that is c the language c but it's option a is the earth flat what's earth d okay wrong answer b okay so we know that we can cycle through the questions outside of the for loop we will calculate the player score so right here i'll display the word results standard output results i'll add a new line actually now that i think of it i'm going to steal some of these text decorations let's make it look pretty something like this would look cool but not necessary standard output correct guesses then we will display the current score add a new line standard output number of questions that is simply the size of our array add a new line then we will calculate a percentage what percent of the questions did they get right score score divided by size times 100 then we'll add percent so at first this isn't going to work because we're using integer division but i'll explain that momentarily about typecasting so let's run this once let's say a b c d correct guesses one number of questions four our score was zero percent even though we got one right we'll need to add a cast to the divisor let's cast size as a double to hold that decimal portion then this should work a b c d correct guesses one number of questions four our score was 25 now let's go for a hundred remember that the correct answers are c b a b 1985 bjorn strosstrup the language c but that's option a is the earth flat no b correct guesses four number of questions four score 100 well yeah everybody that is a quiz game you can make in c plus you can impress your friends or have your friends take the quiz you know you can change your questions around if you want if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comment section down below and that is a quiz game written using c plus
