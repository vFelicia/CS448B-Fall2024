hey everybody today I got to talk about class variables in Python class variables are shared among all instances meaning objects created from a class instance variables are defined inside of the Constructor class variables are defined outside of the Constructor with class variables they allow you to share data among all objects created from the class with instance variables each object has their own version with a class variable all those objects share one variable here's an example we will create a class of student we also need a Constructor when we create a student object this Constructor is automatically going to be called but we need to pass in some arguments we are provided with self self refers to the object we're currently working with we will set up a name parameter and an age parameter we will assign self the object currently working with set the name attribute to equal the data for the name that we receive from this parameter and self. AG equals age let's construct two student objects we will have student one equals then call the Constructor for student so type the name of the class followed by a set of parentheses to invoke it this will automatically call The Constructor but we have to pass in data for the name and the age for the name let's pass in SpongeBob because basically everybody in the world knows who SpongeBob is I don't know how old SpongeBob is we'll say he's 30 we'll create another student object which we will refer to as student 2 we will call the Constructor of our student class pass in data for the name and age student two will be Patrick Patrick will be 35 okay let's make sure this works let's print student 1's name followed by student 1's age and we should get SpongeBob and his age is 30 let's print student 2's name and student 2's age Patrick Patrick is 35 now we'll create a class variable class variables are defined outside the Constructor and they are shared among all objects created from that class each object has their own name and age property these are instance variables but class variables are defined outside the Constructor each object will share this one variable so if we're working with students let's say there is a class variable of class year what is the graduating year of this class 2024 now now let's print student 1's graduating year print student one. class year okay so SpongeBob has a class year of 2024 that's when he's graduating let's check student 2 Patrick his age is 35 his graduating class year is 2024 now with class variables you can access them through any one object such as student one or student 2 it's good practice to access a class variable by the name of the class rather than any object created from the class since we're accessing class year we'll access this class variable by the name of the class of student make sure the S is capital this helps with clarity and readability if I was looking at this print statement I can tell that class year is a class variable because we're accessing it directly from the class and not any instance from this class without looking at this class I can't tell if class year is an instance variable or a class variable but if I access it via the class name it's more explicit so it's good practice to access a class variable by the class name itself and not any one instance of this class let's create another class variable we'll create a class variable to keep track of how many students we have created this class variable will be num students meaning number of students equals z So within our Constructor we can write any code that we want this code will always be executed when we instantiate an object I would like to take our number of students and increment it by one each time we construct a new student object so instead of using self self refers to the object we're currently working with if we're constructing student one just imagine we're replacing self with student one or student two if we were constructing student two if we're going to be modifying a class variable in place of self we'll use the name of the class student access our class of student get the class variable of number of students then I will increment it by one plus equals 1 we are constructing two student objects I will print access our class of student get the number of students and print it we're constructing two student objects if I print the number of students that we have it should be two then just to be sure that this is working let's construct a third student object student student 3 equals student this student will have a name of Squidward Squidward's age will be 55 now we have three students and for good measure let's construct one more student 4 equals we will create a new student with a name of Sandy sy's age will be 27 the number of students is now four just as an exercise using an F string let's print the student classes class year as well as the number of students I will print use an F string my graduating class of let's add a placeholder access the class of student then access the class Year my graduating class of 2024 has then we need the number of students we'll add a placeholder access the class of student access the number of students has blank students let's see if this works my graduating class of 2024 has four students now if I were to change 2024 to 2025 my graduating class of 2025 has four students let's print the name of each student these are instance variables student one. name then we need Student two three and four my graduating class of 2025 has four students SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy all right everybody so those are class variables class variables are shared among all instances of a class they are defined outside of the Constructor the benefit is that they allow you to share data among all objects created from that class and well everybody those are class variables in Python
