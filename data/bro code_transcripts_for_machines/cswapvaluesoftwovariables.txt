all right what's going on people so in this video i'm going to show you how we can swap the values of two variables now you may be wondering why the heck do we need to know this so swapping variables is actually very common within sorting algorithms and when we reach the next topic on sorting arrays we'll need to learn how to do this so let's begin i have two variables x and y x contains the letter x y contains the letter y and let's print these values i'll use a printf statement let's display x and y x equals x y equals y so how can we swap these let's try x equals y and see what happens within both x and y the value is y what about y equals x well then both variables contain the character x so what can we do it seems like we're stuck what we could do is that we could introduce a third variable let's say char and let's name this temp because it's a temporary variable so we have a third variable to work with as temporary storage for some value so let's assign temp is equal to x and then we will assign x equals y and then lastly y equals temp and this should work let's try it yep x equals y and y equals x now this is a little bit different if you're working with strings so let's say these are character arrays and we'll pretend that these are maybe glasses holding some fluid x contains water and y contains maybe lemonade and let's make temp a character array as well but we need to declare a size let's say 15. okay so this isn't gonna work we're already receiving problems expression must be a modifiable l value so when working with arrays it's not enough to simply assign values we could use the string copy function so let's get rid of these and we will use string copy oh also make sure that you include this header file okay so we will copy the contents of x over to temp and it's the same procedure as before string copy y over to x and string copy temp over to y and then make sure you change these format specifiers to strings did contain water now it contains lemonade y did contain lemonade and now it contains water when swapping variables i like to imagine my variables as glasses and they contain some fluid if we pour the contents of one glass into the other well then the contents will be pushed out and overflow so it would be wise of us to introduce a third glass that's empty to hold one of these fluids so then we can pour the contents of one variable into the other now here's one issue that you may run into when using the string copy function if the length of the second argument is less than the first argument this can lead to unexpected behavior i'm going to replace lemonade with soda and let's see what happens so x doesn't contain anything but y contains water one solution is that we can make these character arrays the same size let's say that they're both 15 and that should solve that issue so that's something you may need to take into consideration when using the string copy function if you're going to swap strings so yeah everybody that's how to swap the values of two variables if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and in the next video i'm going to show you how we can sort the elements within an array and well yeah that's how to swap the values of two variables in c
