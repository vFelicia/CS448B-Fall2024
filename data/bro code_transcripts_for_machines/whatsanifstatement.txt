all right guys we are on if statements with an if statement you do something if a condition you set is true if not then don't do it it's as simple as that we'll ask a user what their age is if their age is greater than or equal to 18 they'll be allowed into our site if they're under 18 well we won't let them in let's declare variable age int age then we'll create a prompt standard output enter your age standard input age okay this is how to write an if statement you type if then a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces if some condition within the parentheses is true you perform some subset of code we are going to check if age is greater than or equal to 18. greater than or equal to is a comparison operator there's other comparison operators such as less than or equals to less than greater than if you need to compare if two values are equal you use two equal signs you don't wanna say equals because then you're setting age equal to eighteen equals is the assignment operator so let's check to see if age is greater than or equal to eighteen then we'll print a message standard output welcome to the site okay let's try this enter your edge let's say that i'm 12. well it doesn't do anything since this condition evaluated to be false we skip over this body of code if it were true then we execute it this time my age is 21. i hit enter welcome to the site if you would rather do something else if a condition is false you can use an else statement an else statement you will place at the end there is no condition else we will print standard output you are not old enough to enter okay let's try this again and to your age i'll say that i'm 12 you are not old enough to enter that's an if statement if some condition is true you do something if not you can do something else or nothing at all there are more conditions you can check by using an else if statement we can check another condition by adding else if if this condition is false check this else if condition uh let's check to see if age is less than zero that means somebody hasn't been born yet you haven't been born yet okay now check this out let's say that my age is negative 10. then i hit enter you haven't been born yet since this condition was false we skipped this section of code then we check the else if statement since this condition was true we execute this body of code then skip over the else statement let's add one more elsif statement else if age is greater than or equal to 100 standard output you are too old to enter this site okay enter your age i am 120 years old i hit enter welcome to the site we check these conditions one by one starting from the top we stated that our age was 120 years old even though we were expecting to execute this body of code we instead executed this body of code within the if statement that's because our age was technically still greater than or equal to 18. so the order of your if and else if statements does matter it makes a difference if we need to execute this body of code if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 100 well then we should probably move that to the top then turn it into an if statement else if age is greater than or equal to 18 we will display this message let's try this one more time and to your age i am 120 years old i hit enter you are too old to enter the site so yeah that's an if statement you do something if a condition is true if not then you don't do it if you would rather do something else you can use an else statement if there's other conditions you would like to check before reaching the else statement you can use an else if statement and there's really no limit to these if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah those are if statements in c plus
