hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can generate some random numbers in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people here's how to generate some random numbers just so you know these are not true random numbers but rather pseudorandom numbers and they're fairly darn close so to create some random numbers we'll need to instantiate a random object type random with an uppercase r random with lowercase r equals new random parentheses semicolon so the name of our random object is random really you couldn't name this anything but i usually just call it random and we can use this object to generate random numbers and there's a few builtin methods of this random object to access them add a dot and we'll focus on the next method and next double method next we'll generate a random whole integer so we'll want to specify a range this by itself will generate a random number between i believe zero and just over two billion so we'll probably want to set a range let's pretend that we're rolling a six sided dice i need a random number between one and six so i can set that range within the parentheses so the minimum would be 1 comma and the max would be technically 7 because the second number is going to be exclusive so this will give us a random number between 1 and 6. just specify the range and we'll store this within a variable int num equals random.next a random number between one and a six all right then let's display this console.writeline num and we should have a random number between one and six and we got six all right then you can always make adjustments to this too like you can add i don't know 100 and that should give us a number between 101 and 106. so that's always an option too okay now what if you need to roll a 20sided dice like we're playing dungeons and dragons we use polyhedral dice so that would be 1 comma 21 and this will give us a random number between 1 and 20 and we rolled an 8. now there is a next double method which will generate a random decimal number so let's say double num equals random dot next double and the random number will be between zero and one so we have 0.7016 something something something something so if you need a random decimal or random double number you can use random.next double otherwise if you need a random whole integer you're better off using the next method of random now if you need let's say three random numbers we can keep on reusing the same random object we only need to instantiate it once let's say we're going to roll three dice so three six sided dice let's copy what we have and paste it twice so we have num1 num2 num3 then let's display these console.writeline num1 num2 and num3 so we will have 3 random numbers and the result is 3 6 and 4. well okay then everybody that is how to generate random numbers in c sharp i will post this code to the comment section down below if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well that's how to generate random numbers in c sharp
