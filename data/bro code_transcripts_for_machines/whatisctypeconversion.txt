hey what's going on everybody in this video i'm going to explain very basic type conversion type conversion is the conversion of a value of one data type to another two ways in which we can do this are implicit and explicit implicit is done automatically if done explicitly we precede a value with the new data type within a set of parentheses you list the new data type put it before a variable or a value let's perform an implicit cast suppose we have variable int x i will assign x the value 3.14 integers can only hold a whole number if i were to display x standard output x well the value is three we truncated the decimal portion and implicitly converted this number into an integer what if x was of the double data type double x equals 3.14 well then we would retain that decimal portion what would happen if i cast 3.14 as an integer then assigned it to a double variable before the value add a set of parentheses then the new data type i will convert 3.14 to an integer then store it within this double x x now equals three it's a whole integer that is one example of implicit and explicit type conversion here's a few other examples i have character x equals some number like 100 if i were to display what x was standard output x well we will implicitly cast this number 100 as a character we'll convert it using the ascii table to whatever its equivalent is the number 100 converted to a character is the letter d let's try an explicit cast i will display the number 100 explicitly cast to a character and that value is the letter d as output how is this useful suppose we have an online exam we have to give the user a score how many questions did they get right divided by how many questions were total let's write something like this int correct equals maybe eight the user has eight questions that are right and questions equals ten there are ten total questions i need to calculate the score as a percentage we could say double score equals correct divided by questions times 100 then let's display whatever the result is standard output score then i'll add a percent sign to the end eight divided by ten is point eight right times one hundred that should give us eighty percent uh we have zero percent well that's because we're using integer division questions is of the int data type when we're dividing 8 by 10 we're truncating that decimal portion we're getting rid of it then multiplying whatever remains by 100 i'm going to explicitly cast questions as a double of the double data type and we should retain that decimal portion yeah there we go 80 where you'll use type conversion it really varies but you should be aware that you can do it such as when using integer division so yeah that's type conversion in c plus plus hey if you're enjoying this series let me know by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
