hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a text field in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody we're going to be creating a j text field this is a gui text box component that can be used to add set or get some text so imagine you're logging into a website and you type in your username and password well those boxes are perfect examples of text boxes we're also going to create a submit button so that when we enter in a username we can submit whatever text we enter in but we're going to implement an action listener so it's best if we create a new class to do this so within my source folder i'm going to go to file new class and i will call this class my frame my frame will extends jframe so it's going to behave exactly as a jframe this will also implements the action listener interface so that this frame can listen for events like a button click when we want to submit a username so make sure to add all of these imports and since we're implementing an interface we need to add any unimplemented methods so make sure to add public void action performed we're also going to create a constructor for this class so my frame and we have to go through the motions of setting up a frame i just i'm going to copy and paste this so you just type in this dot set default closed operation j frame exit on close we're going to use a flow layout for this example so make sure you use a flow layout you can also set this to null if you want but you have to manually place your components we're going to pack this frame so that the size of the frame will adjust to fit the components that you add and then finish this up with this dot set visible true and then we have to create an instance of this frame so we'll say my frame frame equals new my frame let's head back to our my frame class and we're going to create a j text field so j text field we'll call this text field equals new j text field and we'll need an import for this import j text field and let's set some dimensions for this text field so text field dot set preferred size and we'll pass in a new dimension let's say 250 by 40 so 250 for the width and 40 for the height and we'll need an import for dimension now we need to add this text field to our frame so make sure you add this before you actually pack the frame so this dot add we're adding our text field and we should have a text field now within our frame which we do and we can type in text like this if we want to submit some text we'll probably want a button so let's create a button to the left hand side of this text field so j button we'll call this button equals new j button and we can set some text right away too let's say submit and we're going to add this button to our frame so this dot add button now you notice we have a submit button but it currently doesn't do anything so we need to add an action listener so let's do that here button dot add action listener since this class is implementing an action listener interface we can simply just pass in this and when this frame detects an event we can check to see if that event is the button so if e dot get source is equal to our button we're going to do something we're going to take our text field dot get text okay but let's take a look at this our button and our text field are not recognized that's because we declared our button and text field within the constructor so they're only local to the constructor we need to declare these outside of the constructor so that they're global so we'll copy this and paste it j button button that's all we need as well as j text field text field so here we're declaring this twice we don't need to do that since we declared these components outside of the constructor they are now global so that this action performed method now has access to them so make sure to take out j button for the button and j text field for the text field and now these should be recognized all right so we're going to use this method get text to retrieve whatever text is within our text box our text field so let's print out a message i'm going to surround this with a print line statement so we could say maybe welcome plus whatever the text is that somebody types in let's try this so let's say we enter in our username bro code and click submit it says welcome bro code let's customize the appearance of this text field well because we can so let's begin by changing the font so text field dot set font and we can pass in a new font and pick whatever font you want i will pick consoles and then we can say font.plain or bold or italic and then we can also pick a font size so i will pick 35 35's a good number and let's take a look that's pretty sweet let's change the font color so we do that with set foreground text field dot set foreground and we can pass in a color like color dot green or we can pass in some rgb values or a hex value so we can do that with new color and i'm just going to use a hex value this time you can look these up online that is for green 0x 0 0 ff00 so this is a bright green color sweet let's change the background color so text field dot set background and we can pass in like a preset color or a new color i'm just going to turn this to black so color dot black and now we have a black j text field but you can see that the carrot that's that line that is blinking it's a little difficult to see we can actually change the color of that as well so text field dot set carrot well set carrot color then we can pass in a color so i will pick color dot white and this carrot this line when you type in something is now visible let's set the text of our text field so text field dot set text and we pass in a string we can place the string username here so that somebody knows to type in their username so it just says username but you can edit this and type in whatever you want hacker123 if for some reason you need to prevent somebody from editing this text field you can do so with the set editable method so we type in the name of the text field dot set editable and we can set this to pulse so that when set editable is set to false we can no longer edit this text field even though i'm trying really hard to do so here's an idea what if we disabled the text field as well as this button after we submit a username so within this action performed method we're going to get rid of this line textfield.set editable false place this within our actionperformed method and let's also disable that button as well so button.set enabled and we'll set this to false so that after we submit a username like hacker123 and click submit we can no longer submit another username so that's an option that's also available to you so yeah that's the basics of creating j text fields in java if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating a j text field in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow
