hey guys in this video we're going to create a simple calculator program now that we know how switches work this will be a very simple program let's begin by declaring our variables at the top we'll need a character for an operator we'll name this op the operator will be either addition subtraction multiplication or division double num1 double num2 double result this next part isn't necessary but i'm just going to add one line of text when we begin the program i'll add a bunch of asterisks let's say calculator then i'll add a new line to the end wherever my program ends i will create another line of asterisks and i can get rid of that newline character our code for our program will be within these two lines of output let's ask the user what operand they would like standard output enter either addition subtraction multiplication or division standard input will store the response within the variable op standard output enter number one standard input num1 let's copy these two lines paste them change one here and here now we need a switch switch parentheses curly braces we're examining our operator against matching cases the first case will be addition make sure the operand is within single quotes because it's a character if the user wants to add two numbers we'll take result equals num1 plus num2 display the result standard output will display the word result followed by the variable result then i'll add a new line to the end then break then we need a case for subtraction case subtraction num1 minus num2 multiplication case multiplication num1 times num2 then division case division num1 divided by num2 what if somebody doesn't type in a valid operator let's add a default case default standard output that wasn't a valid response then break i'll add a new line too okay we are good to go let's save run this calculator let's add two numbers enter number one one point two three enter number two three point one 3.14 the result is 4.37 let's run this again we will subtract two numbers 1.23 minus 3.14 is negative 1.91 let's multiply two numbers 1.23 times 3.14 that's 3.8622 now we will divide two numbers 1.23 divided by 3.14 that is 0.39172 let's type in an operator that's not valid how about a w enter number one one point two three three point one four that wasn't a valid response actually i think it would be better if we said that wasn't a valid operator all right everybody that is a simple calculator program in c plus using a switch if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comment section down below if you're enjoying this series please let me know by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
