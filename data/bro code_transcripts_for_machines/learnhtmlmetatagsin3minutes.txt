yeah let's begin so meta tags the meta element represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the title base link style and script elements metadata is data about data we can add metadata to the head of our document and this tells the web browser what our web page is about with the meta tags we place them within the head not the body so we can tell the web browser some information about our web page meta tags are selfclosing we do not need a closing tag meta tags do have a name attribute that we can set to one of many settings let's say we would like to add a description to this webpage and the web browser is going to read this description after setting the name equal to description i can set the content equal to a brief description of my webpage uh perhaps free html tutorial for beginners okay so that's one example of a meta tag so let's create another so meta again these are self closing tags and i can add some keywords for search engine optimization so name keywords content and i'll explain my web page in just a few keywords uh perhaps html separate each of these with a comma tutorial beginners that'd be good we can add a author meta name equals author content equals and then type your name so if somebody is viewing your web page on a mobile device you can have your web page scale to their mobile device by adding this meta tag name equals viewport content equals and this will set the width of our web page equal to device dash width then comma we can set the initial scale equal to 1.0 so by adding this meta tag if you were to view this webpage on a mobile device this web page will scale proportionately with that mobile device another meta tag is a char set we can tell a web browser what sort of character encoding that we're using so authors are encouraged to use utf8 for unicode so if you want to use basic ascii encoding you would write ascii here although that's discouraged authors are encouraged to use utf8 for unicode all right and the last thing i'm going to show you is that we can set our webpage to automatically refresh after a given amount of seconds so meta http dash equiv is the attribute name equals refresh and the content equals how many seconds you would like to wait to have your browser refresh uh perhaps 30. okay so i'm going to open this with live server so if i set this to 30 seconds it's not going to be that visible you're gonna have to wait until we see this refresh let's set this to something more drastic like two seconds let's crank this up yep see it's refreshing every two seconds uh but let's set that back to 30. two seconds was just an example so yeah those are meta tags they represent metadata metadata is data about data by adding meta tags we can tell a web browser information about our website such as a brief description keywords author we can set the viewport for mobile devices you can set a refresh rate stuff like that and then be sure to add meta tags to the head element of your document so yeah those are meta tags if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
