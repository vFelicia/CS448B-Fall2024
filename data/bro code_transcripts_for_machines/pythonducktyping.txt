hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain duck typing in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running i hope you all like ducks because that's the topic of this video duct typing is the concept where the class of an object is less important than the methods and or attributes that that class might have the class type is not checked if the minimum methods and or attributes are present it's based off of a popular phrase if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck then it must be a duck here's an example i have two classes class duck and class chicken both duck and chicken have walk and talk methods but they print something different with the duck class the walk method will print this duck is walking and the duck talk method will print this duck is quacking the chicken class has the same named methods walk and talk but they print something slightly different a slightly different variation the print method will print this chicken is walking and the talk method will print this chicken is clucking now let's say we have a third class a class called person now there is one method within our person class let's say we're attempting to catch a duck we'll pass in self and we need to pass in a duck object as an argument so let's type duck now within this method we'll have our duck use its walk method as well as its talk method duck dot walk and duck dot talk and then maybe we'll print something such as you caught the critter now let's create an object from each of these classes let's create a duck object duck equals duck a chicken object chicken equals chicken and lastly person person equals person now if we would like our person to use the catch method we need to pass in a duck as an argument so with our person let's type person dot catch and we need to send a duck object because that's a required parameter here so we're passing in our duck object that we created and as soon as we catch the duck it's going to use its walk and talk method and then we'll print you caught the critter so as you would expect this will print this duck is walking the stuck is quacking you caught the critter now with duct typing we can pass in a different type of object as long as it has the same methods and or attributes as our duck we could pass in a chicken because a chicken can also walk and talk so this time let's pass in our chicken as an argument and this will still work even though our parameter is set up to take a duck object this chicken is walking this chicken is clucking you caught the critter in layman's terms think of it like this python is examining this chicken object it's using its walk method it's using its talk method which are required and python is saying well that's close enough remember if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck then it must be a duck so duct typing is the concept where the class of an object is less important than the methods and or attributes that it might have the class type is not checked if the minimum methods and or attributes are present now let's say with our chicken object our chicken can no longer walk well we cannot pass in our chicken object anymore we have an attribute error chicken object has no attribute walk so python took a look at this chicken and noticed that it does not have a walk method well it's not walking like a duck but it's talking like a duck so it doesn't count as a duck because it doesn't have its walk method in conclusion the class type of an object is not as important as the methods and or attributes that that class might have when using duct typing the class type will not be checked if the minimum methods and or attributes are present since chickens can both walk and talk like ducks then they can be a substitute for ducks when we pass in our duck object to this method so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of duct typing in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
