okay everybody we gotta discuss variable scope i'll explain local variables and global variables local variables are declared inside of a function or block of curly braces such as within the main function or inside of another function global variables are declared outside of all functions you tend to see them at the top of your program there's some major differences between the two let's begin with local variables suppose i have some number int mynum num equals one if i need to display my num i can use standard output my num and of course this will display my num which is one now what if i have a function to display my num void print num let's move this line of code to our print num function i'll need to add a function declaration to the top of my program then we will invoke this function print num okay this isn't gonna work and here's why my num was not declared in this scope functions can't see inside of other functions my function print num has no idea what this mynum variable is mynum is a local variable to the main function that's why we pass arguments to functions we'll make the function aware of this value but you'll need a matching set of parameters int my num then add that to the function declaration int my num and this would work that displays the number one but let's get rid of these parameters it is legal to reuse the same variable name as long as it's within a different scope within the print num function i'll also have a mynum variable that has the same name but i'll give this a different value when printing my num it prints two we have two versions of the same variable and this is fine because they're within different scopes now a global variable is declared outside of all functions you see these at the top of your program i will declare int my num equals three i'm going to delete these two local variables if i was to invoke the print num function and print my num well then that number is three this global variable is also available within the main function so i will print my num here as well within the main function so we have three and three it's best to avoid global variables if you can because it pollutes the global namespace also variables declared within a function are much more secure because like i said functions can't see inside of other functions if we had both local and global variables mynum within the main function will be 1 within the print num function it will be 2. if i was to display my num for both of these i'm going to add a new line to each of these new line and new line a function will use any local variables first before resorting to any global variables that's why our print number function prints too and the main function prints one if you'd rather use the global version you can use the scope resolution operator so precede your variable name with two colons that is the scope resolution operator i'll do that here as well in place of using the local version of mynum we will use the global version and we will print three we're using the global version of mynum instead of the local version so yeah that's variable scope local variables are declared inside of a function or anytime you see a set of curly braces a variable declared inside a set of curly braces is hidden to the outside world a global variable is declared outside of all functions and is accessible to all functions within the program like i said you should try and avoid using global variables if you can because it pollutes the global namespace and these variables are less secure so yeah that's variable scope hey if you're enjoying this series let me know by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
