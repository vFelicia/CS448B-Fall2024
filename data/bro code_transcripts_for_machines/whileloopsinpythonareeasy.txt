hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain while Loops a while loop will execute some code while some condition remains true here's an example we'll use an if statement first we will ask a user for their name name equals input enter your name if our name is equal to an empty string that means the user didn't type in anything let's print a message you did not enter your name else we will print using an F string hello our user's name if I were to skip this prompt we would execute this if statement then we continue with the rest of the program what if I would like to continually prompt the user to type in their name we can't continue until they type in something well we could replace this if statement with a while loop while this condition is true continue to execute this code within the while loop I'm going to reprompt the user to type in a name than if we were to exit the while loop then we will print hello whatever your name is so let's run this and to your name I'm going to hit enter you did not enter your name enter your name no no no okay I give up I'll type in my first name hit enter hello whatever your first name is while this condition remains true execute this code potentially forever until this condition is no longer true so that's one of the main benefits of a while loop if it's not true then you exit out of the while loop and that's why we're able to continue then print our name hello name you do want some way to escape out of the while loop otherwise you'll run into what's known as an infinite Loop so let's say while name is equal to an empty string we will print you did not enter your name so I'm going to hit enter so we are stuck in an infinite Loop we can't actually escape this Loop we didn't give ourselves an exit strategy that's why previously we reprompted the user to type in something we're giving them a chance to escape in a way it kind of works like an if statement but instead of executing some code once it's potentially infinite here's another example this time let's ask for a user's age age equals and I will convert the input to an integer enter your age we'll need the user to type in a positive number while age is less than zero let's print a message to let the user know that they can't do that age can't be negative then we need some strategy to escape let's reprompt the user to enter in their age once they type in something that's valid we can escape out of the while loop so let's print using an F string you are age years old so enter your age I'm going to say negative one H can't be negative negative two negative 1 million okay I give up how about 21 you are 21 years old so that was another example while our Edge variable is less than zero repeat this code Forever let's go over example three I'm going to introduce some logical operators we will have the user type in a food they like food equals input enter a food you like but in order to escape they need to press Q to quit while food is equal to the letter q continue this while loop however I'm going to make one change we want to exit the while loop when they press Q so you could say while not food equals Q So within this while loop let's print the food that they stated that they like I'll use an upstring you like your variable food then we will prompt the user to enter in another food that they like enter another food you like cue to quit then once we escape the while loop we will print just buy okay enter a food you like cue to quit I like pizza you like pizza I like sushi you like sushi I like Ramen you like Ramen okay this program's kind of lame so I'm going to press Q to quit and we escape the while loop we have printed bye so you could do something while something is not true by using the not logical operator all right last example example four we will use the or logical operator we'll ask a user to type in a number between 1 and 10. let's say num equals input enter a number between 1 through 10. then I will Typecast the input as an integer while our number is less than one or our number is greater than 10. let's reprompt the user let's print using an F string are variable num is not valid then we will reprompt the user enter a number between 1 and 10. once we escape the while loop then we will print our number using an F string your number is our variable num enter a number between 1 through 10. zero zero is not valid negative one 100 nope uh five your number is five that's an example of how you can add logical operators to while Loops while this condition is true or this condition is true execute this code Forever all right everybody so those are while Loops a while loop will execute some code while some condition remains true it's fairly useful for verifying user input if a user types in some input that is not valid you can reprompt them and there's many other uses that we'll discuss in the future but yeah those are while Loops in Python
