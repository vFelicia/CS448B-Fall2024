hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know to get started using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay let's do this css css is an acronym for cascading style sheets it's defined as a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as html i stole that definition from wikipedia i like to think of building a website very similar to building a house we need three things structure style and functionality we can use html for structure this would be like the skeleton the frame of our house with css we can add styles such as colors decorations lighting and with javascript we can add functionality in our house analogy this would be similar to plumbing heating electricity but in this video we're going to focus on style now to work with css you'll need a text editor i just so happen to be using vs code so let's jump over to that here we are within vs code or some other text editor that you prefer so you'll need an html document to work with if you don't have one just go to new file and then you can create one just make sure the extension ends with html there are three ways in which we can apply css properties to html elements inline internal or external external works the best especially if you have a large website we'll need some sample text to work with so let's create a title for this webpage using a pair of h1 header tags this is my website and let's create maybe four paragraphs as well so these are in pairs of p tags and we'll need some sample text if you need some sample text type lorem and then tab to generate some sample text so let's copy that line and paste it three additional times okay there we go so we can apply css inline so whatever element you would like to apply css properties to within the opening tag you would set the style attribute equal to some css properties within quotes let's say that i would like to change the background color of my webpage so within the opening body element i will set the style attribute equal to one or many css properties let's change the background color so type background color colon and then end it with a semicolon and then we will list either a color name like black you can use rgb values and these come in groups of three so black would be three zeros so depending on what values you have here this will change the color or there's hexadecimal values hexadecimal values are preceded with a hashtag and there are six digits that follow so black is 60 rows where white is six fs but you can always look up a color picker and then just copy the values after you find a color that you like it's a lot easier perhaps we would like a black background so i'll just keep the simple and use color names instead but you can use rgb values and hexadecimal values okay now i would like to make my h1 header tag white so i will set the style attribute equal to the color property this time color is for the font color background color is for well the background color so color white now with our paragraph tags let's apply more than one css property so let's set the style equal to and list whatever properties you would like to apply within double quotes and then separate each with a semicolon uh let's begin with the background color let's make this maybe gray and let's change the color to what about white then i'm just going to copy the style attribute and paste it for each of these paragraphs this is somewhat redundant but there's an easier way of doing this with internal style sheets to apply an internal style sheet within the head of your html document you'll need a pair of style tags whatever element you would like to apply css properties to you will list that element for example the body then follow that with a pair of curly braces then you will type the name of a css property like background color and set it to some value like black and then we no longer need this style attribute there we go you may need to save and refresh this time let's apply css to the h1 header tag via an internal style sheet uh so let's copy this value and get rid of it okay this time we would like to change our h1 header tags so list that here within our style element h1 curly braces list any css properties within the curly braces color white and we'll do the same thing with our paragraph tags so let's get rid of these so type p curly braces and then we will paste the css properties so you can apply more than one css property just place them within the curly braces so there we go and you can see that this is a lot less redundant instead of making all of the changes in line you can place them within an internal style sheet now the last method which i think is the best method is an external style sheet so we will create a new css file so i'm going to right click go to new file let's name this style.css i'm going to copy everything within my style element and then get rid of our style element tags and within the style sheet we will paste everything that we just copied now we just need to link our html file with our css file and to do that within the head tag we will type link rel equals rel is an attribute that names a relationship of the linked document to the current document so rel will be stylesheet then set the href attribute equal to the relative file path of your css file they're right next to each other i only need to list the file name there we go we have applied css properties via an external style sheet and this is the preferred way of doing things so you can reuse this one style sheet for many different html pages so let's say that we create a new html document like page2.html by the way if you need to generate the body of your html document if you're using vs code you can type exclamation point and then tab let's create a really quick html document for page two this is page two and then i'll create two paragraphs let's say okay i'm going to open page 2 with live server and take a look page 2 does not have any css filing but we can reuse the same css file all we have to do is link our html file with our css file within the head element i am just going to make that link so this is really convenient if you have to make any changes to your website let's say that you need to make all of the pages on your website instead of the background color black let's say maybe gray well you can just make that change here and that one change will apply to all of your html documents so you only need to make that change in one place that's why external style sheets are really useful one unique feature of css is that we can target any specific element by id or a class that they may be in any element that has these names will have these styles but what if i would like maybe one of these paragraphs to have a different font color i can give one of these paragraphs a unique id so within the opening tag i will set the id attribute equal to a unique identifier let's say p1 because it's well the first paragraph so then to target that specific id i will type that id and let's set the color equal to what about tomato now for practice let's give each of these a unique id let's say p1 p2 p3 and p4 if we need to change p2's color to tomato well then we target p2 what about p3 just change the id to p3 and then p4 so you can target a specific element by id you just have to be sure to fill out that id attribute or you can target anything within the same class a class is like a group in this example let's say that all odd numbered paragraphs should be read all evennumbered paragraphs should be blue so i'm going to instead give these each a class you can keep the ids if you want to so type class equals the first paragraph will be odd class odd the second paragraph will be class even then odd then even so to target elements by a class you type dot the name of the class so anything within the odd class let's say we'll have a color of red and i'm going to get rid of this tomato color our first paragraph is within the odd class the same applies with our third paragraph and then i would like to make any elements within the even class blue color blue so our second paragraph is blue and our fourth paragraph is blue so yeah everybody that is a quick introduction to css it means cascading stylesheets we can apply css properties in one of three ways inline internal or external in this series we will be using external style sheets so yeah that's a quick introduction to css if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a
