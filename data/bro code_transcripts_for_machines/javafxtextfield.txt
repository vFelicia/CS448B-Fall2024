yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can verify user input using a text field in javafx so sit back relax and enjoy the show let me give you all a tour of my setup here i have a total of four nodes two of which are labels this top label has a fixed id of my label this other label does not have a fixed id it's just going to function as a prompt to let the user know we would like them to enter their age into this text field down below and this text field has an id of my text field and lastly we have a button this button has an id of my button as well as a linked action of submit which we'll define later within our code let's pretend that a user is signing up for a credit card and in order to sign up for a credit card you have to be 18 years or older a user is going to enter their edge into this text field and click submit if their age is less than 18 the text for this welcome label will change to something such as you are too young to sign up however if they're 18 years or older that's the minimum criteria so this welcome message the text in this welcome message will change to display you are now signed up so before we begin let's make sure that our controller class is linked we have at least three fixed ids my label my text field my button and your button should have a linked action of submit or some other function that you're going to remember so let's save and head to our ide within your controller class we're going to inject our fxml code into this controller class by adding this annotation for each id that we have at fxml and we had three different nodes with ids we have a label so private label and the idea i gave was my label at fxml private text field my text field and we have a button at fxml private button my button will declare an integer variable named edge but we're not going to assign it a value quite yet we'll do so within our submit method that we'll create so public void submit there is one parameter of action event event and we're going to assign this variable of edge age equals my text field dot get text however this function is going to return a string so we need to cast the string to an integer variable so let's say integer dot parse int and add in our my text field dot get text method that we have so this will assign whatever text is within my text field into this edge variable and just to test this i'm going to print whatever our edges to the console window okay now let's test it so i'm going to refresh my fxml document and then run this program so enter your age let's say that i'm 21 then i press submit no problem it displays 21 to the console window but what if i type in something that's not a number such as a name like smitty warbin jaeger man jensen well this is going to interrupt our program so we should probably catch and handle any exceptions when they occur let's place our code within a try block because it would be good practice so try all of this code and we will catch any exceptions as they occur so for the time being we will catch exception e and i will print whatever this exception is to the console window by using a print line statement and i will print whatever e is okay let's try it again and let's see if we can get the name of that exception that occurs enter your age smitty submit okay so we have a number format exception so it's better if we catch that as well specifically so let's add an additional catch block preceding our catch all catch block so catch this right here number format exception number format exception e and we will print a message like enter only numbers please okay let's try it again enter your age smitty submit enter only numbers please and this did not interrupt our program if there's any additional exceptions you would like to catch specifically just be sure to write an additional catch block preceding our catchall exception e what we'll do at this point is that we'll change the text of our label to reflect what the user typed in let's begin with the catch blocks so let's say if somebody does not type in a number for their edge we'll change our label mylabel dot set text to enter only numbers please and if there's anything else that happens let's change this to maybe just air but remember it's better to catch specific exceptions beforehand okay let's try this again okay enter your age smitty warbin jagerman jensen submit enter only numbers please now if user takes this seriously let's write an if statement to check their age if age is greater than or equal to 18 we will change the text of my label to reflect a message such as you are now signed up else let's print you must be 18 plus for 18 years or older and let's try this again okay enter your edge let's say that i'm 21 i press submit you are now signed up but what if i'm 12 and i'm trying to sign up for a credit card well you must be 18 years or older 18 plus so everybody that's a basic form of validating user input via a text field i will post all of this code to the comments section down below and well yeah that's a basic way to validate user input using a text field
