how's it going everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain 2d lists in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i have a super quick video for you all today on 2d lists also referred to as multidimensional lists all it is is a list of separate lists so let's begin by creating a few separate lists let's say we have a list called drinks and let's assign a few values let's say we have coffee as well as soda and maybe some tea all right so we currently have one list let's make maybe two more let's make a list called dinner and maybe in here we'll place pizza then hamburger and hot dog okay then let's create one more for this example let's say dessert and maybe we'll add two items they all don't need the same amount of items or elements so we have cake and ice cream all right so we have three lists one called drinks dinner and dessert so what we can do is add all of these lists to one list and let's create a list called food food equals and for each of these elements we're going to place our lists so we have drinks dinner and dessert check this out what if i were to print my 2d list of food so what ends up happening is that this will print all of the elements found within each individual list and they are all grouped together so this first portion is my drinks list which contains coffee soda tea this next element is my dinner list which contains pizza hamburger hot dog and the last element dessert contains cake and ice cream if i need to access just one of these lists i will add an index after my food 2d list and set an index number so index 0 is referring to my first list of drinks and this will display all of the elements found within my first list and if i need just one of these elements i will add a second set of square brackets and list the index of the item that i'm trying to access so this very first item coffee would be index zero and then index zero again so we need two sets of square brackets and if i were to print this this will display coffee so if i go down the list the next element would be soda and then t if i were to change the index within this first set of square brackets well now we're working with a different list this time we're working with our dinner list so the element at index 1 index 2 that would be our dinner list and this will display the element of hot dog if i change this to the next list which would be dessert well we're going to receive an index out of range error because we only have two values within this list cake and ice cream there is no element at index 2 because we only added two elements to this list of dessert all right everybody so that is 2d lists also referred to as multidimensional lists it's a list of separate lists if you need to access one of the elements within your 2d list you need two sets of square brackets so if you'd like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's how 2d lists work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
