hey what's going on everybody today we're going to create an interactive image gallery using HTML and CSS so let's get started before you do jump in I would recommend downloading three pictures of your choosing I have a picture of a pizza a salad and soup if you're able to try and find images that are roughly the same height and width once you have your three or more images we are ready to begin we'll begin with the first image I'll use a div element and I will give this development a class of gallery because it's well part of our image gallery I will include my image image The Source attribute will be the relative file path of the image if you have a lot of pictures I would recommend creating an images folder you know what let's actually do that it'd be good practice new folder images I'll move all of these images to my images folder all right so I will list the relative file path I need to navigate to the images folder but of course you can use your own pictures depending on what you're building exactly images dot I think that was a JPEG all right so this picture is massive in case somebody is using a screen reader it's good practice to add an alternative attribute then give a description of the image salad I'll turn this image into a hyperlink by surrounding it with a pair of anchor tags we can open this image in a new tab by setting the target attribute to equal underscore blank then I will set the hrep attribute to be the source of my image I'll just copy and paste that just temporarily I'm going to set a width for this image width equals 200. what we'll do now is add a description it's entirely optional but I think it would look nice I will create a new development with a class of description I will type the word salads we'll do some CSS styling a little bit later let's copy this entire development paste it twice then we just need to change the images we're using my second image is soup I'll change the alternative text as well and the description soups then my last image is pizza the description will be pizzas all right let's go to our style sheet we are selecting our Gallery class I will set the display property to be an inline block currently these images are Block Level elements now they're all lined up I'll add a border border one pixel solid let's go with a dark gray color I'll use hsl values I'll set the lightness to 60 percent I'll add margin of 5 pixels the margin is applied outside of these developments if I were to increase this you can see the difference I'll keep that as five though let's work on the description for each image we are accessing our Gallery class then within the gallery class we have the description class that should be these developments let's add a little bit of padding 10 pixels then text align Center not bad when we hover over one of these elements let's change the Border color we are taking our gallery we'll apply the hover pseudo class then change the border and make it a little bit darker I'll set the lightness to be like 20. there we are now the Border changes when we hover over one of these elements I'm going to delete these with attributes then go to our style sheet we'll access our Gallery class with any images set the width to be 100 percent and height will be Auto then with the gallery class we can set the width 200 pixels so basically what we did is that we set the width of each image to be 100 of the width of our Gallery whatever this is set to if I were to set the width to be something larger then the size of each element would increase I think 200 is fine all right now let's test it if we click on one of these images we should see the full image in a new tab that's the salad image soup and pizza all right everybody so that is a simple image gallery using HTML and CSS
