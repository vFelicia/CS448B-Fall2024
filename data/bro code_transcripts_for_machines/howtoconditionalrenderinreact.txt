hey sup everybody in today's video I'm going to give you an introduction to conditional rendering in react conditional rendering allows you to control what gets rendered in your application based on certain conditions by utilizing conditional rendering we can show hide or change components here's an example we'll create a user greeting component let's go to our source folder new file user greeting and this will be a jsx file I will be using function based components function the name of the component user greeting we will have one parameter props we learned about props in the last video before I forget I'm going to export default the component name just so that we can import it later heading back to our app component we will return a user greeting component user greeing by using props we'll send two key value pairs to our user greeing component is loged in this will be a Boolean value we'll check to see if we're logged in or not and a username username equals this is a string so we do not need a placeholder type in your name or username then we do need to import user greeting import user greeting from alocation SL user greeting. jsx let's save everything head to our user greeting component we have these two key value pairs that are stored within our props object I'll use an if statement to check to see if we're logged in or not if props is an object we will access props followed by dot is logged in is this true or not if it is then let's return an H2 element with text of Welcome I'd like to include some JavaScript I'll use curly braces let's take props dot our username let's see if this works welcome bro code or whatever your name is so what if we're not logged in I will set is logged in to be false well nothing appears to happen going back to our user greeting let's add an lse statement else we will return an H2 element with text of please log in to continue please log in to continue within our function based component we can check some logic using an if statement if if some condition is true return this if not return something else now technically you don't need the else statement you could just say return because when you return you exit this would work too as you can see I don't think it's as explicit as using an L statement another option is to use the trary operator which we learned in JavaScript we will return check do is logged in add a question mark is this true or is it false if it's true then we'll return an H2 element that says welcome I'll add some JavaScript props do username I'm going to close this menu just so we can see if this condition is true return this otherwise add a Col in we'll return something else we'll add an H2 element please log into continue this statement is pretty lengthy I'm going to put each part of the statement on a new line just so we can read it easily if is logged in is true return this H2 element if not return this H2 element currently we're logged in that is true I set this to be false well then we get that login prompt please log in to continue you'll more commonly see people use trary operators rather than IFL statements just because they're more concise let's apply some CSS styling going back to our app component we'll set is logged in to be true We'll add a class name to each of these H2 components class name equals the first H2 element if our condition is true we'll have a the class name of welcome message our second H2 element will have a class name of login D prompt going to our CSS stylesheet let's select the class of Welcome message I'll apply the following CSS properties let's set the font size to be 2.5 em I'll change the background color I like using hsl values I'll go with this shade of green let's change the font color to be white I'll add a little bit of padding 10 pixels I'll add a border radius to round the corners then set margin to be zero here is our user greeting component if the user is logged in let's style the login prompt class next Dot Login prompt really I'll just copy these properties but we'll change the background color let's change the background color to be red all right let's set is logged in to be false then our user greeting component should have those different CSS properties please log in to continue if I set that to be true well then we're logged in welcome your username within our user greeting this tary operator is very verbose here's another way in which we can use the tary operator in this situation let's create two constants const the first will be welcome message be sure not to include any dashes though separately we'll store these h H2 elements I'm getting a copy of this first H2 element we'll store that within our welcome message just so we can read it I'm going to place each line on a new line then let's create another constant const login prompt be sure to eliminate any dashes we will be using a camel case naming convention take our second H2 cut it paste it and there we go I find that a lot easier to read so we're going to take our condition is logged in if that's true we'll return our constant our welcome message otherwise we'll return our other constant our login prompt and that will work still the same let's set that to be false please log to continue set it back to be true welcome your username I find this syntax a lot easier to read now it is good practice if you're accepting props to set up prop types just in case the values that are passed in are not of the correct data type you'll at least get a warning for debugging purposes it's a good habit that we should develop we learned about prop types in the last video so at the top let's import prop types from proptypes after our function take our user greeing component do propop types equals take our keys is logged in the value with this Associated key should be a Boolean prop that's capital T types dob then a string for username user name prop types. string all right the last thing we're going to do is set up default props what if somebody's logged in but they don't have a username we'll set a default for the username as guest so after our prop types we'll set up some default props again take user greeting that's the name of our component. default props equals is logged in will be false and username will be guest if there's no username passed in all right going back to our app component if a user is logged in but there's no username let's eliminate that we'll get the welcome message of Welcome guest now if a user is not logged in regardless we don't display the username all heard everybody so that's conditional rendering you can check some sort of condition based on if that condition is true or false we can show hide or change components there's many different ways in which you can do that and well everybody that is an introduction to conditional rendering in react
