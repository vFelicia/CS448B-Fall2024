hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be teaching you guys about check buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody so let's create a check button but first we'll need a window window equals tk and then we're going to follow this with window dot main loop now we'll need to create a check button to add to the window so i think i'm going to rename this as check box because i think that sounds better it's also shorter too so check box equals check button we're going to be adding this check button to our window we can set some text with text equals maybe i'll place python here we can also associate a variable with our check button variable equals and then we'll need to create a variable so i'm going to do this after we create our instance of our window let's create a variable just called x x equals int var so this is going to store an integer within x we're going to set the variable of check button to equal x or whatever else you named this basically so with this x variable we can assign x a value depending if the check button is checked or unchecked and we do this with on value and off value on value equals let's say one if we check our check button x is going to equal the on value which we'll just set to one and then off value is what x will equal if it's unchecked and we'll set this to zero then we can also associate a command with check button so command equals and let's create a function called display and we'll do that at the top def display we'll just print a message print i like python and then we'll need to add this checkbox so we can do that easily with pack checkbox.pack and let's give it a go here's our checkbox it says python and when you click on it it says i like python however if you uncheck this it still says i like python so why don't we upgrade our display function we'll check to see if the value stored within x is equal to one then we'll print i like python otherwise we'll display i don't like python so we'll check to see if the value in x is equal to one and it's not enough to say if x is equal to one since we're storing our value as an object by using int var we need to retrieve whatever value is within here so we can use x dot the get function if x dot get is equal to one we'll print i like python else will print a different message print i don't like python and i don't know why you wouldn't like python all right so let's give this a go then so i like python i don't like python i like python i don't like python all right now let's take a look at our checkbox it's somewhat dull so let's spice things up a little bit let's decorate this checkbox so let's begin by changing the font so we can do this with the config function font equals i will pick a font maybe ariel and a size maybe 20. that's a little bit better so this changes the font let's also change the font color so we can do that with another config function otherwise you can place this all within the same line but it's going to get kind of cramped in all one line so let's set the foreground color we can set this to a name like blue otherwise you can use a hexadecimal value so blue is 0 0 0 0 f f and now the fonts blue so this is the foreground color let's also change the background color that is bg for background color and i want this to be black so that's all zeros okay now pay attention to this if we check the checkbox this will flash to the original color or if i hold this down so we need to change the active foreground and active background if we want this to be consistent where it's not flashing every time you check this so we're going to change the active foreground and we're going to set this to the same color as our foreground so these are both the same values so this is active foreground we're also going to change the active background and we're also going to want this to be black as well active background so this should no longer flash colors when we check this it's all consistent and now what we're going to be doing at this point is adding an image next to our check button so i'm going to be adding this python logo that i downloaded and we're also going to be creating a second check button and i'm going to add a java logo to the second check button so if you need some time feel free to pause the video and download some images that you might want to use if you want to follow along otherwise let's get started so we're going to create a photo image i'll just name this photo photo equals photo image file equals either the file path or the file name since this is in the same folder as my python file i can just list the file name so i'm going to use my file called pythonunderscorelogo.png so i'm going to type that within file and then we're going to set the image of our check button to equal this photo so image equals whatever this name is photo sets image to photo image and let's try this so this image replaced our text if we want to keep the text we can use compound and we can set the image to the left right up down whatever i'll have this image be on the left and this should display the text yep it does now let's add some padding around our text so we can use pad x and pad y so pad x i'll set this to 25 this should add some padding on the x axis so that gives us a little bit of space and pad y maybe 10. that's not too bad for spacing let's also set the width and the height width equals maybe 250 and height 50. okay that's not too shabby now let's create a second checkbox now why don't we create a second variable we'll call this y and this is also into var and let's copy everything that we have for our first checkbox paste this underneath and we're going to replace the name of checkbox with a different name so a shortcut is to select all of this go to edit find replace we're going to replace checkbox with checkbox 2 and then click replace all and then we can close out of this we're also going to make a few other changes so text equals let's say java variable equals y or whatever else you named your second variable let's see we're going to use a different image so we're going to use java underscore logo or whatever else you named your second image and let's name this photo two so make sure to change that as well and image equals photo two now this should work okay so we have two check buttons now and we can check these independently however we can actually align these on the xaxis because they're centered right now and it usually looks neat if you have these check boxes aligned on the same axis so we can do that by using anchor so we'll do checkbox.config again anchor and we can set this to a cardinal direction like w for west e for east and for north as for south uh there's a few other ones too but let's anchor these on the west side of our window so checkbox.config anchor equals w and the same thing for checkbox2 so these are now anchored on the west side of our window so they're kind of aligned now that makes it look a little more neat and professional i'm just going to add a quick comment that this anchors widget to relative cardinal direction now let's change our display function now that we have two check boxes and we don't want this to say i like python i don't like python when we select java and now with our if statement we're going to add something if x dot get is equal to one and y dot get is equal to zero will still display i like python let's copy this and add an else if statement else if x dot get is equal to zero and y dot get is equal to one i like java let's add another elsif else if x is equal to one and y is equal to one i like both python and java else will display perhaps i don't like either okay let's try this i like python i don't like either i like java i don't like either i like python i like both python and java all right everybody so that's the basics of check buttons if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of check buttons in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below
