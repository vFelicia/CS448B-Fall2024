hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the format method in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay ladies and gentlemen let's begin the format method is a method available to strings it's optional and it gives users more control when displaying output to best demonstrate this i'm going to use a line from a popular nursery rhyme titled hey diddle diddle because well you know i'm a mature adult like that i'll be printing this line to my console window the cow jumped over the moon let's do so using a standard print statement and then i'll show you the benefits of using the format method later for this example i have two variables a variable called animal and i'm going to store a string of cow and item and i'll be storing an item name which is moon when we compile and run this as you would expect the output is the cow jumped over the moon there's a more elegant way of writing this line of code and that is by using the format method available to strings i'm going to turn this line into a comment and we're instead going to produce the same output but use the format method instead so we need a standard print statement like usual and then a string that we would like to format so we're going to write the same thing but in place of the variables we're going to add a placeholder the instead of the variable name or value name i'm going to add a set of curly braces so that functions as a placeholder for a value or a variable the this should be cow jumped over the and i'm going to insert another placeholder now this is a string we can format the string by following this string with dot format parentheses and within the parentheses of the format method we can insert some values or variables let's begin with some values i would like to insert cow as well as moon so this will produce the same output but it's written a little more elegantly we can also replace these with variables because they store these values so i'm going to replace cow with animal and moon with item and this will create the same output as it did before these curly braces are what's known as format fields they function as a placeholder for a value or a variable and they work in order the first format field will insert the first value at this location if you have another set or more sets of this format field you'll insert the next value that's listed within the format method so if we were to switch these around we'll switch the position of animal with item well then the first format field is going to insert our item and the second format field will insert our animal this time the moon jumped over the cow an additional way of inserting values at a given placeholder would be to use what's referred to as a positional argument within these format fields we will list the index of the value that we would like to insert at this location if you need to insert the first value well that has an index of 0 because computers always start with zero and following that pattern the next index would be one if you had let's say three values that you need to insert if you had another placeholder that would be two then so you would just follow that pattern so there's going to be no visible change but what we could do is reverse the positional arguments of these placeholders so what do you think would happen if i switched one with zero at these locations well this format field is going to insert the value found at index one this first value is index zero and the second one is index one so now the rolls are reversed this time the moon jumped over the cow our last way of inserting some values at a given format field would be to use what's referred to as a keyword argument within the format method we're going to list some keyword argument pairs we need a keyword name followed by a value so let's say animal is going to be the keyword we're going to say equals some value animal equals cow and item equals moon and you may have noticed that the color of your text might have changed so we no longer need these variables actually but i'm going to comment out these two print statements because we will get an error then so these are in keyword argument pairs and within our format field instead of keeping these empty or using an index we can use the keyword name at my first format field i'm going to insert my keyword of animal and at my second format field i would like to insert the item keyword so the result is going to be the cow jumped over the moon so let's reverse these now we'll place our item keyword here and then at the second format field we will insert our animal and this time the moon jumped over the cow here's an important concept that i'd like to bring to your attention with these values found within the format method you can actually reuse some of these more than once so let's say we would like to state the animal jumped over the animal we're going to use this animal keyword twice and our output is going to be the cow jumped over the cow if we're doing the same thing with positional arguments we can reuse the same index this time let's say that the moon jumped over the moon so our item has an index of one so within our first format field we'll state the index will be one and our second format field will also be one so our output's going to be the moon jumped over the moon all right let's take things up a level there's an even more elegant way in which we could write all of this what we'll do is store our string that we would like to format within a variable let's turn this line into a comment and let's create a variable called text text equals the string that we would like to format which is the format field jumped over the format field and if we need to format this variable we can just call the format method on it so within a print statement let's say text dot and then use the format method and pass in the values that we would like to insert at these placeholders so we're going to insert animal as well as item so our result as you would imagine is the cow jumped over the moon this next section i'm going to explain how we can add some padding to a string when we display it using the format method let's say we have a name variable and assign this a value of whatever your name is so i would like to display my name along with the custom message let's say hello my name is and then i'll use a format field here so let's follow this string by using the format method and i would like to insert my name at this location so currently this will display hello my name is bro or whatever else your name is so we can add some padding either before our name after or we can add some padding to the left and the right hand side of our value that we have so what we'll do to begin is let's add some padding to the right hand side of our name that we have so within our format field if we need to add some padding within the format field add colon and then the amount of space you would like to allocate to displaying your value so let's say 10. so i'm going to allocate 10 spaces worth of room to display my name you can't really see it right now but let's take a look so i can't move my cursor past this line at the end of my name but with my second line i have all of this room to work with so if i were to change my string that i have let's say nice to meet you well then all of this padding that i have is going to be more evident so we can add a number preceding with a colon to add some padding to a value and then you can left align this right align it or center align it so what i'll do is copy this line that i have if you need to left align it you use the less than sign but there's going to be no visible change because that's already the default if you need to write a line precede your number with a greater than sign so your value is going to be right aligned if you need to center this value then use the carrot so this will center align your value within the padding that you have allotted one question that you might have for me and i'll try and answer that now because it's relevant what if we need to add a positional argument or a keyword argument to our format field if there's already some text within here so what you would do before the colon you would just precede the colon with either your positional argument or your keyword argument followed by colon and then whatever you want to add afterwards to format your value that you have all right ladies and gentlemen we are near the end and i promise that this is the last section how can we format some numbers let's say we have a number variable and this will equal the first few digits of pi 3.14159 let's pretend that we would like to display only the first two digits after the decimal so we can do so using the format method let's print the number pi is and then i'll use a format field here and we will call the format method and insert our number that we have so if i need to display only the first two digits after the decimal within the format field i will add colon dot to f is for floating point numbers that's anything with a decimal portion so the result is that this will display only the first two digits after my decimal because we placed two within the format field so if this was 3 0.3 f this would display three digits after the decimal portion oh and apparently this will round your number so that's something that you should keep in mind so this time let's change our number to something larger like 1000 and i will copy this line and make a few changes let's say the number is and i would like to add a comma at the thousands place so after the colon within the format field i will add a comma so this will automatically add a comma to all 1000s places another cool thing that you can do is that you can display your number as binary so within the format field add colon b this will display a binary representation of your number you can do the same thing with octal by adding colon o so our number is now being displayed as an octal number and you can do the same thing with hexadecimal lowercase x for lowercase or uppercase x for all uppercase so my number 1000 is now in hexadecimal and lastly we can display this number in scientific notation using either lowercase e for lowercase or capital e for uppercase and mynumber1000 is now in scientific notation alright everybody so that's a few things that you can do with the format method it's an optional method that gives users more control when displaying output if you would like a copy of all the code that we've written here today i will post everything in the comments down below don't be afraid to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey you yeah
