all right what's going on people so today I got to explain what the Dom is in JavaScript the Dom is the document object model it's a JavaScript object that represents the page you see in the web browser and it provides you with an API to interact with it the web browser constructs the Dom when it loads an HTML document and structures all of the elements in a tree likee representation within my HTML document we have our HTML element as the root element the HTML element contains a head element and a body element and many various elements can be found within each of these they're arranged in a tree like data structure but we access this tree like data structure from the document object in past lessons in order to select an element by its ID we would type document dot then follow it with a method like get element by ID and then we would select an element by its ID our document is an object it contains properties and methods and other nested objects if I was to console.log the document well then it's going to display my HTML document now you can also use dur meaning directory this will list all of the properties of this object so here's my document object and all of the different properties it contains it's one gigantic object for example we have a title the title of the web page that would be found right here near the bottom document but you can change it I will access our document as if it was an object because it is access the title property change it to something else like my website now if I display the title that property has changed it's now my website dynamically after the page loads I would like to change the background color of my document later on in the series we're going to create a toggle button to toggle between light and dark mode just to give you an example if I need to change my theme to be dark mode I could access the document object access the body access the style then change the background color property to some color let's stick with black for now I'll use hsl the Hue will be zero saturation will be 0% and the lightness will be 15% even though we have no CSS we're still able to dynamically change the background color let me give you another example we'll create an H1 element this H1 element will say welcome I will give this element an ID ID welcome MSG meaning message and I'm just going to zoom in a little I will create a constant of username type in your username or your full name I'm going to conditionally change the content of this HTML document I will get this element by its ID our welcome message const welcome message I'm using camel case naming convention for this so I will access my document use the get element by ID method that ID was welcom Das message MSG for short I would like to update the text content of this element I'll take my welcome message access the text content of it then append some text using string catenation I'll use the tary operator to see if my username is strictly equal to an empty string is our username empty did somebody not type it in question mark If username is empty I will append our welcome message with guest otherwise our username my username has a name it's not empty it will display my name welcome bro code if it was empty if somebody didn't type it in it will display welcome guest so that's an introduction to the document object model the document object model is a JavaScript object that represents the page you see in the web browser and it provides you with an API to interact with it the web browser constructs the Dom when it loads an HTML document and structures all of the elements in a tree like representation by using JavaScript we can access the Dom dynamically after the page loads and change the content structure and style of a web page and well everybody that is an introduction to the document object model in JavaScript
