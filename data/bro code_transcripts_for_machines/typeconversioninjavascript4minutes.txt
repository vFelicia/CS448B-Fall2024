hey guys in this video i'm going to explain type conversion type conversion is the ability to change the data type of a value to another and i'll explain how to do this with strings numbers and booleans here's one issue when accepting some user input let's say we have variable age and i'll create a window prompt to ask a user to enter in their age how old are you once we accept some user input i'm going to increment age by one because let's say it's the user's birthday then let's display the user's age console.log happy birthday u r our age variable years old how old are you let's say that i'm 21 i press ok happy birthday you are 211 years old when we accept user input it's of a string data type we can't normally use strings for any sort of arithmetic expressions what i intended was to add our age 21 plus 1. that would give me 22. if you add a number to a string you just concatenate that number to the end of the string because a string is just a series of characters if i need to take some user input and use it with some sort of arithmetic expression i want to convert that string to a number and one way i can do that is to use the number constructor so i'm going to set age equal to then type number make sure it's capital parentheses and then pass in age this will convert a string to a number how old are you 21. press ok happy birthday you are now 22 years old if you ever need to get the data type of a variable there is a type of keyword let's display it type of age so before we convert our age variable it's a string then let's display the data type of age after we convert it at first it's a string we convert it and now it's a number and then we can use it in arithmetic expressions here's a few other examples we have three variables x y and z i'm going to set x to equal and we will use the number constructor and we will convert the string 3.14 into a number and then i will display whatever x is as well as the data type type of x remember we're converting a string into a number so 3.14 is now a number let's convert a number into a string y equals and we can use the string constructor and we will convert the number 3.14 into a string console.log y and type of y 3.14 is now a string and to convert something to a boolean you can use the boolean constructor so if you pass in an empty string just a set of quotes this will give you false console.log variable z and the type of z so converting an empty string to a boolean will result in false and this is of the boolean data type but if you type in anything else it will give you true so maybe i try and convert the word pizza when you convert a string to a boolean that's not empty this will give you true if it's an empty string just a set of quotes it results in false this would be useful if you need to accept some user input or user types in their name if they skip that step and using an if statement which we'll talk about later you can check to see if a user typed in something or not based on if that boolean is true or false but we'll get into that later so yeah those are a few basic ways of type conversion you can change the data type of one value to another if you need to get the data type of a variable just precede that variable with the type of keyword and to convert a value or variable into another data type you can surround that value or variable with a given constructor the number constructor the string constructor or the boolean constructor oh one fun fact too if you try and convert something into a number that normally shouldn't be a number like the word pizza well then this will result in nan not a number that's just a fun fact so yeah that is type conversion in javascript if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
