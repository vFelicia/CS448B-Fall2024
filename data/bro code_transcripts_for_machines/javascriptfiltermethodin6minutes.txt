hey again everybody it's me big surprise there today I'm going to explain the filter method in JavaScript the filter method creates a new array by filtering out elements in this example we'll create an array of numbers we will filter out any numbers that are odd let's add the numbers 1 through 7 now we need a function function is even we have one parameter we have an element that's going to be provided to us by the filter method we are going to return then write a condition we will take our element modulus 2 the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division you can use modulus 2 to check to see if a number is even if this condition is zero strictly equal to zero then we will return true we will be returning a Boolean true or false the filter method will will take any values that return true and stick them within a new array which will effectively filter out any elements we don't need that don't return true let's see if this works I will create a new array even nums equals take our original array use the filter method pass in a call back is even we will display console.log our new array even numbers and there we are 2 4 6 let's do this with odd numbers function is odd take our element modulus 2 is this strictly not equal to zero that means the number is odd let's create a new array let odd nums equals our original array numbers do use the filter method passing a call back is odd let's check out our new array odd nums there we are we have the numbers 1 35 7 any numbers that are odd let's go over another example I will create an array of Ages I'll use const this time instead of let const ages Pretend We're teaching a college class we might have some students still in high school let's say a student is 16 another is 17 two are 18 19 20 and then we have somebody that's just a little bit older they're um 60 we'll use the filter method to filter out anybody that is under 18 we will find all of the adults we will need a function function is adult we have one element as a parameter that's going to be provided to us we will return a condition return check our element is it great greater than or equal to 18 so that's our function let's create a new array of adults equals take our original array dot use the filter method pass in a call back is adult then display our new array console.log adults we have five elements the age of the students is 18 18 19 20 and 60 let's do this with is children to find anybody that's under 18 is child function return element less than 18 we'll create a new array const children equals take our original array use the filter method pass in a call back is child then display the new array we have two students that are children one is 16 the other is 17 last example we'll create an array of words const words add some words I think I'll add some fruit I'll add an apple orange banana kiwi pomegranate and a coconut I will filter out any words where the length of that word is above six so we will create a function function get short words we have an element as a parameter we will return a condition we will check if our element access the length property of that element they're strings so they all have a length property how many characters are they long that's the length check to see if the length of this element is less than or equal to six if it is return true if not return false we will create a new array let's call this array short words equals take our array use the builtin filter method pass in a call back get short words then we will console.log the new array short words in our array there are four elements with the length of the characters of each string is six surrender Apple orange banana kiwi then to finish this off let's get any long words we'll create a new function get long words check the length of the element to see if it's above six then we will create a new array const long words equals take our original array use the filter method pass in a call back get long words then we will display our new array long words within our original array there's two words that are considered long pomegranate and coconut these words each have more than six characters coconut is seven pomegranate is 11 all right everybody that is the filter method it creates a new array by filtering out elements your callback is likely going to check in condition does each element pass this condition and well everybody that is the filter method in JavaScript
