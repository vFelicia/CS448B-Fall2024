hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to discuss the walrus operator in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm alright people i hope you like walruses because that's the topic of this video we'll be discussing the walrus operator also known as an assignment expression it's a colon followed by an equal sign and it kind of looks like a walrus on its side now this is a new feature for python 3.8 what it does is that it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression here's an example of why the walrus operator would be useful let's say we have a variable named happy happy equals true if you're not happy or you're feeling so so you can set this to false if you want so let's print the value contained within happy so this will print true to the console window now wouldn't it be cool if we could combine both of these statements together so we would want to say something such as happy equals true and then print it to the console window using one line of code well normally we can't do this using the standard assignment operator now one thing that we can do is use the walrus operator this assigns a value to a variable as part of a larger expression so this would technically be allowed if this assignment operator was instead an assignment expression the walrus operator happy walrus true and when they're all within a print statement we can assign a value to a variable and use it as a part of a larger expression so as you can see this new variable of happy was assigned and used in one expression now here's a more practical example of why the walrus operator would be useful let's say we have the small program what this will do is consistently ask you what food you like and put it into a list called foods foods equals list while true food equals input what food do you like if food equals quit break then append our list of foods with this new food item that we have okay let's run this then so this while loop will continue as long as i don't type in quit and it will consistently ask me what food do i like and place that food item into a list named foods so let's begin what food do i like well i do like pizza i like sushi and i like ice cream and that should be enough for me i'm going to type in quit to exit this program now let's write the same program but instead use a walrus operator so that we can write this program using less lines of code now if i were to use the walrus operator this is how i would write the same program we would still need our list foods equals list now for my while loop it's going to look something like this while food walrus operator input what food do you like all right this is the assignment portion now we can use this assignment portion within a larger expression so let's also check to see if our input does not equal quit all right so then after each iteration of this while loop we will take our list foods dot append food and that is it so we have written the same program in about half the lines of code that we did previously so let's test it what food do you like pizza sushi ice cream and quit well everybody that is the basics of the walrus operator also known as an assignment expression it's a new feature for python 3.8 and beyond so if this doesn't work for you i would check to see what version of python you're using first it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how the walrus operator works in python
