hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about method chaining in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's talk about method training method chaining is used to call multiple methods sequentially and each call performs an action on the same object and return self here's an example of how method chaining would be useful let's say we have a class named car car has four methods turn on drive break and turn off they will all just print a simple message beginning with turn on turn on will print you start the engine drive will print you drive the car brake will print you step on the brakes and turn off will print you turn off the engine let's say we have a car object car equals car and i would like my car object to use its turn on method immediately followed by the drive method with how we've been coding things previously we may write something such as the name of the object in this case car dot and then the method to use i would like my card to use the turn on method followed by car dot drive so currently this will take two lines of code but this will print you start the engine and you drive the car now with method training we can call multiple methods sequentially now the format on this is going to be a little bit different and if we were to write the same code using method chaining it might look a little something like this after the first method call we would add dot and then an additional method that we would like to call so for example after the turn on method we'll immediately call the drive method but there's one more thing that we need to add when we're using python to do method training so normally this by itself will not work when we call a method in python if there is nothing that is returned python will return none so as you can see here attribute error none type object has no attribute of drive so we need to return itself under each method that we're using method training with so let's add return self to each of these methods so let's do that for drive break and the turn off method and this should work now you start the engine you drive the car so think of it like this after we finish calling this method python is going to return self so it's going to return car so then we'll immediately use car.drive now here's another example let's say i would like to call the break method followed by the turn off method so that would be car dot break parenthesis followed by dot turn off so this will print you step on the brakes you turn off the engine now here's an extreme example let's say we would like to call all four methods in order so that would be car dot turn on followed by dot drive dot break dot turn off so this will call all four methods in order starting with the leftmost method you start the engine you drive the car you step on the brakes you turn off the engine now if you have one long method chain like this it might become difficult to read after a while so what i would recommend if you're doing a lot of method chaining is that after each method call just hit enter to move each method call down to a new line so it'll look something like that and this backslash might be inserted this is a line continuation character so this is a little more readable but you know it still does the same thing basically all right everybody so that is method training it's used to call multiple methods sequentially and each call performs an action on the same object and returns self if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to do a method chaining in python
