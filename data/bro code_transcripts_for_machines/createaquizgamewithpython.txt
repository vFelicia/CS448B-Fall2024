hello again everybody so today we're going to create a quiz game in Python let's declare all of the different Collections and variables that we'll need first we will need a tuple of questions a 2d Tuple of options my quiz will have five questions but you can add more or less questions then a tuple of answers a list of guesses we will be appending guesses to our list that's why we're using a list rather than a tuple a score variable which I will set to be zero then question number this variable will keep track of what number question we're on all right let's begin with our questions I have five foreign here are my questions they're all science related feel free to choose your own this is what I have how many elements are in the periodic table which animal lays the largest eggs what is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere how many bones are in the human body which planet in the solar system is the hottest these are the questions but we'll need options let's add four options for every question that's why we're using a twodimensional Tuple each inner Tuple will consist of four elements they will be options a B C or D let's copy these elements then paste them within each Tuple this first element corresponds to my first question how many elements are in the periodic table I'll come up with some answers foreign I'll add some answers for the rest of these tuples too we have a tuple of correct answers the orders are C d a a B if you come up with your own options your answers may be different now that we have all of our different Collections and variables taken care of let's display each question I will iterate over our Tuple of questions they are iterable for every question in questions I'm going to print some decorative text I think that's probably good then I will print each question we're iterating over so let's see what we have so far there's all five questions after we display every question I need to display every option for every option in options are options options is a 2d Tuple let's add the index operator the index is going to be our question number variable it's a number so at first we're accessing options at index of zero then one two three four five we will print every option in options at a given row number Let's test this okay we have some options but all of these options are for the first question we will need to increment our question number so let's do that maybe here question number plus equals one that is much better before iterating the question number we will ask the user for a guess equals input enter a b c d in case the user types in something that's lowercase I will follow this input with the upper method to make the user input uppercase we will take our list of guesses use the append method add our guess to that list if our guess is equal to the answers Tuple at index of question number that means the user gets the right answer let's increase the user score score plus equals one then print the word correct correct else we will print incorrect I'll use an F string our answers at index of question number is the correct answer all right let's answer some of these questions see correct which animal lays the largest eggs um definitely the whale because the whale's the largest creature right incorrect D is the correct answer what is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere nitrogen correct how many bones are in the human body D that is incorrect A is the right answer which planet in the solar system is the hottest Mercury because it's closest to the Sun right wrong incorrect B is the correct answer we're keeping track of our answers successfully once we complete all the questions let's print the results I'm going to add some decorative text not necessary but I think it would look cool I will display the results we will iterate over all of the answers and the guesses print answers I'm going to set the ending character to be an empty string for every answer in answers print each answer I will set the ending character to be a space to separate each answer then I'll add a new print line let's do this with guesses change answers to guesses for every guess in guesses print each guess okay I'm gonna run this again I'm just gonna make up some answers a b c d a Q are the correct answers here are the guesses I guess none of them right then we will print a score equals take our score divided by I'm going to use the length function then pass in our questions how many elements are within our questions tubble then I will multiply all of this by 100 to give us a percentage then Typecast this whole formula as an integer so we're basically just reassigning our score variable then let's print using an F string your score is our score variable then add percent I'm going to intentionally get all the answers right c d a a B here are the answers here are your guesses your score is 100 this time I'll try and get a few incorrect intentionally c c c c c c your score is 20 percent all right everybody well that is a quiz game feel free to add more or less questions or come up with your own questions and that is a quiz game written in Python
