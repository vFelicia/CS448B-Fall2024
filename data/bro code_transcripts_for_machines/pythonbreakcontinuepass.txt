hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain loop control statements in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right ladies and gentlemen let's talk about loop control statements these are used to change a loop's execution from its normal sequence and there are three we're going to discuss break continue and pass let's begin with break break is used to terminate the loop entirely now here's a good example of where a break would be useful let's say while true we're going to continually ask for somebody's name if they don't type in anything then we'll continue the while loop over and over again so let's say name equals input enter your name now if name does not equal a set of quotes that means they don't type in anything then we will break and break out of this while loop and let's test it enter your name nah i don't think so i'm too lazy to enter my name all right i can see that i'm not going to escape this while loop so i'm going to type in my name because i give up and hit enter therefore i will break and exit out of this while loop so a break is used to terminate the loop entirely when it's encountered next we have continue continue skips to the next iteration of the loop now let's say we have a phone number phone underscore number and i will set the sequel to let's say a random phone number including dashes 1234567890 what i would like to do is to display this number within the console window without these dashes this is how to do that using a continue control statement for i in phone number so for each character within our string of phone number what we'll do is check to see if we encounter a dash character if i i is our index is equal to a dash then we want to continue and skip over this iteration of the loop so continue then i would like to print whatever our indexes whatever character we're working on so if i were to run this as it is it's going to print each digit on a new line so with print statements they will add a new line character to the end of your string and you can actually change that by adding to the end comma end equals and then a set of quotes so this will print my phone number without any dashes one two three four five six seven eight nine zero so that's a use of the continue control statement it skips to the next iteration of the loop last but not least we have pass pass does nothing it acts as a placeholder let's say that i would like to print the numbers 1 through 20 using a for loop for i in range 1 through 21 and remember that the second digit is exclusive so this will iterate once through the digits of 1 through 20. let's pretend that i'm highly superstitious and i don't want to print the number 13 because 13 is considered an unlucky number if i is equal to 13 what we'll do is pass and pass acts as a placeholder and it won't do anything else print i that's one i there we go this will print the numbers 1 through 20 and skip 13 because we used the past control statement which does nothing it acts as a placeholder so everybody those are loop control statements they change a loop's execution from its normal sequence we have break continue and pass so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah those are a few loop control statements in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
