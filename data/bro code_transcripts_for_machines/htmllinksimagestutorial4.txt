hey how's it going everybody it's you bro here and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how we can include links and images on our web pages using HTML let's get into it so before we begin this lesson you'll want to be sure to download a couple images I would say for for good measure and place them within the same folder that has your HTML file that you're going to be working with so feel free to pause the video now and to go and download a few images to include links and images on our webpages we first need to discuss attributes all elements in HTML have attributes attributes provide additional information about an element that contains an attribute they are used in the opening tags of an element and come in name value pairs so attributes are useful because we can provide links to webpages we can include images and even specify the styling of an element but we'll save that part for CSS so let's begin by creating an HTML link so HTML links are defined with the ate tag and then you also need a closing tag for this as well the next step is that we'll need some text to function as the link so for example let's say that we want to create a link that will take us to Google's homepage well let's write some text that will actually take us there if we click on it so we can say something such as if you would click on this you will go to Google's homepage let's save this and refresh the page all right so currently this doesn't do anything if you click on it so we need to give an attribute to the a tag that surrounds what's going to be our link what the atech does is that any text surrounded with a pair of a tags will function as a hyperlink that can link this text to another webpage that you specify but we need to specify what webpage we want to link this to and we can do that with the href attribute so within the a opening tag or we're going to do is type in H ref and that's an acronym for hypertext reference and we set this equal to whatever website we want to link this hyperlink to and make sure to put this within double quotes and within the double quotes type in the address of the webpage that you want this hyperlink to take you to so it usually begins with HTTP or HTTPS make sure you get it right then colon two forward slashes wwa and then whatever the URL is for the web page they want to link this to so if you want to link this to Google's home page we're going to type google.com let's save this no I don't want to purchase sublime text refresh the page and then you can see that our hyperlink is now blue and underlined and if we click on this it will now bring us to Google when we click on it let's say that you want to change this hyperlink so that it opens a new window for you or a new tab instead of just going to the web page directly on the tab that you're currently on well there's an attribute for that and it's the target attribute so within the a tag the opening a tag we're going to type target equals underscore blank let's save it refresh the page then we'll click on this and this will open in a new tab then or a new window it really depends on the web browser that you're using all right so up next I'm going to teach you guys how we can create a download link so it's going to be the same process as before but there's one more thing we need to add so let me add a few line breaks just to give us some room all right so we'll need some sort of text to act as the link so I will say download a meme let's download a meme and then we need to surround this with a tags so we need an opening tag and a closing tag and then within the opening tag we're going to say H ref equals then double quotes okay so you can either put the address of whatever you want to download within double quotes if it's a file on your computer you can put the file path here or if it's a like file or a picture within the same folder of the HTML file you can just put the file name here well I have a picture that's within the same folder as my HTML file so I'll just put the name of the file here so feel free to pause the video want to download your own picture so the file that I have named was meme dot jpg so make sure that's within the a tag href equals whatever the name or the location of your file is within doublequotes and the next important step is to write the word download right after all right so let's save this refresh the page so it says download a meme then if we click on this it's going to download the picture that I had so this word download within the a tag is another attribute so this is the name and you can give the value and make sure to write this within double quotes as well so this is the name of the file when it's downloaded and you can name this whatever you want so when somebody downloads your file it's going to have this file name whatever is within double quotes all right so that's enough for links in HTML let's move on to including images so I'm going to add a few line breaks just to give us some room alright so there's a tag that we need to use to add a picture to our web page it is the IMG tag and this is a self closing tag so you don't need to add a closing tag to this so within the IMG tag you're going to type in SRC which is a short for source then equals then within double quotes wherever this file is located this can be a web address this could be a file path on your computer or if it's simply within the same folder of your HTML file you can just write the name of the file here so since the picture that I want to include is within the same folder as this HTML file I'm just going to put the file name here so I think this was named meme to jpg let's save this refresh the page alright here's the picture but it's fairly massive so there's actually a height and width attribute that we can include within the IMG tag to adjust the height and the width so we'll adjust the height first so we could say height equals how about 250 and width equals 250 and these are within pixels so let's save this refresh the page and you can see that it's a lot smaller that now fits on the page so one thing you've might have noticed with this image is that it's fairly stretched and there's one way we can actually avoid that with the height and the width attributes instead of placing pixels as the values we can actually place a percentage here for example we could say height equals 50% or some other number and we'll do the same thing with width so let's save this and refresh the page and our image is no longer stretched so there's one other attribute that we can add to our image tag it is the alt attribute it's short for alternate for some reason if we can't display this image we can display some alternate text for example if we can't display this image the text this is a meme what appear or whatever text we place within here so for example let's say I get this file extension wrong and we'll save like XYZ which doesn't exist here so we'll save this refresh the page and it says with this alternate text this is a meme but if we go back and save this this is a meme doesn't display or whatever else we put for our alternate text so this is useful if for some reason somebody can't display an image there'll be some alternate text that lets the user know what normally should be here so just an important note with this height and width attribute for our image it will actually resize depending on the size of the window it's currently in so that's one advantage to using percentages for the height and width attributes alright guys so up next I'm going to show you guys how we can include an image that's somewhere else on your computer and not necessarily within the same folder as your HTML file so what I'll do is actually copy this and paste it right underneath and this is meme 3 and it's located on my desktop so we're going to put meme 3 here and what I'll need to do is find the file path for this like just rightclick this go to properties and copy this location this file path alright then we'll put that within the source so this is the file path for this then I just need to add a backslash save this and then let's refresh the page there there's the image that I was looking for let's include another image but this time it's going to be a website URL so we're going to make a image tag and the source is going to be this or find a picture online that you want to place here you don't necessarily need to copy this and then I'll set the height to perhaps 50% as well to match the others same with the width and I'll set an alt you don't necessarily need to this is another meme alright let's save this let's refresh the page and here is our last image all right so to finish up this video I'll show you guys a cool trick of how we can have an image also function as a hyperlink when we click on it so it's going to combine both things that we learned about in this video so the first thing that we'll need to do is to include an image so we'll use the image tag and we need to set a source equals then within double quotes wherever this file or image is located so for me this last image that I want to use is within the same folder as my HTML file and it simply named meme for dot jpg and I will also set a height and width attribute so we'll set this to 50% just to match the others and we don't need to add an alt but we can and this is actually a picture of Gandalf from Lord of the Rings but I misspelled it alright we're good alright so let's save this refresh the page and here's our last image all right now if we want to make this a hyperlink we have to surround this with an a take a pair of eight tags like we did for our links at the top of the page so we're going to put this around our image so we'll put the opening tag before the image and the closing tag after the image and we need to use the H F attribute within the opening a tag and we will set a destination for our hyperlink to bring us to and you can set this for it wherever you want but I think I want this to bring us to the Wikipedia page for the Lord of the Rings so let's save this refresh the page and if I were to click on this image you can see that the cursor is now a pointer finger when we hover over the image and if we click on this it will bring us to the Wikipedia page for the Lord of the Rings and remember if you want this hyperlink to open in a new window or tab within the a tag you just use the target attribute set it equal to underscore blank and this will open in a new tab or window well that will conclude the end of this lesson
