hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain while loops in csharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right while loops a while loop will repeat some code while some condition remains true we'll write a small program where we will ask a user to enter in their name if they do not enter in anything we will keep on prompting them to enter their name they have to enter something in order to escape the loop so this is what we'll do to begin with let's create a prompt to ask a user for their name i'll use a write statement instead of a writeline statement and let's say enter your name and then we will declare a string variable named name console.readaline and then store that within variable name and then at the end of our program we'll say hello plus name okay so after running this what if a user doesn't type in anything like they just had enter hello and then there's nothing here so what if we try and force the user to enter in something we can write this code within a while loop so after we accept user input for the first time let's check that user input and we'll use a while loop our condition will be while name is equal to an empty string we will prompt the user again to enter in something for their name and we do not need to declare name twice name equals console.readline so let's try this again our condition is we will continue this while loop this section of code as long as name equals an empty string if they just hit enter so let's try it okay enter your name i'm going to hit enter enter your name no enter your name no and to your name no okay i'll type in something hello bro so with a while loop you'll need some way to eventually exit the while loop otherwise that is known as an infinite loop and here's an example of an infinite loop i'm going to say while one is equal to one and then let's display something else such as help i'm stuck in an infinite loop so basically we have no way to change this condition so it's always going to be true and we will repeat this code forever so let's try it again okay enter your name help i'm stuck in an infinite loop so with a while loop you'll eventually want some way to eventually exit the while loop now to optimize this code we don't technically need this right statement here because we will ask that within the while loop and i'm going to declare string name and assign this an empty string so this would work the same as before as well so enter your name i do not type in anything and we are prompted again to type in our name and i'll type in something well okay then everybody those are while loops they will repeat some code while some condition remains true and it will do so infinitely until this condition becomes false if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well those are wild loops in c sharp
