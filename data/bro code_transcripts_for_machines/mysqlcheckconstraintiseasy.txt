hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the check constraint the check constraint is used to limit what values can be placed in a column for example I live in the United States depending on which state you live in there is a minimum hourly wage that employers have to pay in this example let's set an hourly pay to our employees table every employee needs to be paid at least the minimum wage in that region and we can do that with the check constraint we have our table of employees if I were to recreate this table it would look like this foreign I think that was pretty close to add a check to a column at the end of our table this is what we would write check then within parentheses what sort of condition do we want let's check to see if our hourly pay column is greater than or equal to maybe ten dollars per hour that will be the minimum wage in this region this would work if we were to create this table however it's typically a good idea to give your check a name just in case you need to drop it later you can easily identify it so precede check with constraint then a constraint name what about chk meaning check underscore hourly pay this check will be known as check hourly pay so we can identify it then we can drop it or make any changes to it if we need to I do already have an employees table so I'm not going to execute this statement but to add a check constraint to a table you would just add a row like this to the bottom if you instead need to add a check constraint to a table that already exists this would be the syntax alter table the name of the table add constraint then we need a unique name for this constraint check hourly pay that's fine then the check within parentheses hourly pay is greater than or equal to 10. ten dollars per hour okay let's run this yeah that appears to have worked I'm going to select all from employees let's take a look at our table then we will attempt to add a new employee insert into employees values we need an employee ID first name last name hourly pay then a higher date employee ID will be six first name Sheldon plankton for hourly pay let's attempt to pay Plankton maybe five dollars per hour then a higher date 20230107 let's see if that check constraint kicks in we're paying Plankton under ten dollars per hour yeah it doesn't appear that we can do so check constraint check hourly pay is violated now let's pay Plankton ten dollars per hour yeah that worked just fine if you need to delete a check you would type alter table the name of the table drop check then the name that you gave that check in my case it was check hourly pay and that check has been dropped yeah everybody that is the check constraint it's used to limit what values can be placed in a column it's another useful method for checking input and that is the check constraint in MySQL
