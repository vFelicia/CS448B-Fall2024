hey it see bro I hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing the span and div tags in HTML let's get into it I promised that this will not be a long video it's going to be super quick so the span and div tags defined a section or division on an HTML page typically we use a pair of these tags as a container for HTML elements so that we can style something specific with CSS or perform some sort of procedure using javascript with anything marked with these tags so I'm going to create some sample text I'll create a header for our span tag and I'll just call this span for a title so span tag let's close this and let's do the same thing for our div tag so let's use an h1 header it doesn't really matter and we'll type in div tag and close this let's also create some sample text if you're using sublime text you can just type in lorem and hit tab let's surround this with a pair of paragraph tags and then we're just simply going to copy and paste this for the div tag example so then I can show you the similarities and differences of each of these tags then so let's save this reload the page and this will work for our demonstration let's begin by discussing span tags we can target an element or portion of our webpage that we want to style it depends on where we place our span tags within our text or our HTML document let's say that we want to change the color of a single sentence within our paragraph well we can just add a span tag around whatever we want to target and add some attributes or changes within the opening span tag so let's say that we want to change this sentence right here let's just add an opening span tag and a closing span tag where we want these changes to end all right so let's save this refresh the page no apparent changes right well let's add the style attribute to the opening span tag and let's just say that the color is going to be red we want the color to be red so let's save this reload now and now just this specific sentence is red it depends on where you place the span tags if we were to move the closing span tag to let's say I don't know right here I'm just placing in somewhere ran while everything between these two spam tags is going to be changed with whatever attributes you placed within the opening span tag but you want to make sure that you have a closing span tag because if you forget to close it it's going to change everything after the opening span tag now I'm going to place that closing span tag where this was previously I'll just reload the page now the div tag is almost identical to the span tag however anything within a pair of div tags is considered a block level element so it will begin on a new line and take up the full width available on your web page let's place a pair of div tags in the same place that we had previously in the other example so we'll have an opening div tag there and here as well and we're going to take our style that we had in the previous example and place it within our div tag let's save reload the page now the main difference between a DIF tag and a span tag is that with this dictate you can see that when we reach the div tag it begins on a new line and anything within the div tag takes up the entire width of your web browser and anything after that we'll also begin on a new line so that's the main difference between a span tag and a div tag so that's your super quick lesson on the difference between span tags and div tags and I'll post all the code that we have in the comments down below and in the next lesson we're going to be moving on to CSS heyyou if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
