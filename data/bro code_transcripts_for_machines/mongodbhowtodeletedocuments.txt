hello again friends it's me again today I will be explaining how we can delete documents in mongodb before we do begin this lesson I recommend exporting your collection we'll be deleting documents adding them back in is kind of a pain in the ass unless we're importing them so let's export our collection export query with filters that's fine select output you can export as a Json file or as a CSV file let's export our collection as a Json file you can also select a destination I'll place this file on my desktop just for convenience and Export we'll be importing this Json file at the end of this lesson and close within Compass to delete a document all you do is press the trash can icon then delete it's really easy in compass in the Shell it's a little different in the Shell to delete a document type DB dot the name of the collection students then there's delete one or delete many we'll begin with delete one we have one parameter a filter parameter it's very similar to The Finder method we list some criteria to search for let's delete anybody with the name of Larry that was acknowledged the delete account is one let's find our students DB Dot students.find and Larry is no longer at the bottom we have Patrick Sandy and Gary remaining we can use delete many to delete more than one document DB dot students dot delete many pass in our criteria anybody that has a fulltime field set to false will delete so we have deleted one person that matches this criteria DB dot students dot find we have deleted Patrick we can delete any documents that are missing a field or if a field does exist we can delete that let's delete any document that is missing a registration date DB dot students dot delete many we are checking if there is a registration date field does this field not exist if it doesn't then delete that document we will use the exists operator colon false if this field doesn't exist delete that document so we have deleted two documents if we take a look at our students now db.students.find we no longer have any students so that's how to delete one or many documents with the mongodb shell now if we head back to compass then refresh we have no more students let's import our collection that we exported because we do need some data for this series add data import Json or CSV file we are looking for our students Json file select and import and we're done so that is how to delete documents in mongodb
