let's go bros okay it looks like we're talking about method overloading now methods they can actually share the same name but you need a different set of parameters a method's name plus its parameters equals a methods signature and methods must have a unique method signature let's take this method for example called multiply so this returns a times b so what if i would like to multiply more than two numbers like three numbers well this method is only set up for two arguments so one thing that we could do is method overload so we can use the same name like we can reuse it but we need different parameters so to solve this problem i'm going to create a second multiply method and this will have a different set of parameters giving it a different method signature so let's create a method that has three parameters a b and c return a times b times c and you can see that that problem went away and this should work so 2 times 3 times 4 equals 24 and i can just keep on creating more methods so basically that's method overloading methods can share the same name but they need different parameters if they do share the same name a method's name plus its parameters equals the method signature and methods must have a unique signature so yeah that's method overloading if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below if you can smash that like button drop a random comment down below and well yeah that's method overloading in c sharp
