like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm gonna tell you why you should learn html html is an acronym for hypertext markup language it's the most basic building block of the web it allows you to add change and remove website content and that's a good thing to know it's mandatory to know for web developers if you would like to enter that career field it's useful for software developers marketing and sales professionals if you need to edit a listing for your company business owners you could make your own website and freelancers people would pay good money for a good website heck you might as well add html to your resume can't hurt and learning html is super easy this full course is only going to be about an hour anybody can learn html even you yes whoever's watching this video learn html it's super easy what do you have to lose building a website is a lot like building a house first we need a solid foundation and we need to build a skeletal structure that's where html comes in it's the most basic building block of the web then after that we can add css css is cascading style sheets with css we can style color and change the appearance of a webpage and lastly there's javascript javascript adds functionality to a webpage so in a house this could be like plumbing heating and air conditioning and electricity so it adds functionality and when you combine these three levels you have a good functioning webpage but you need to start somewhere so that's why you're gonna learn html first what will you need you'll need a web browser use whatever web browser that you like just please do not use internet explorer and we'll also need a text editor to write html code you can use vs code sublime text heck you can even use notepad but i prefer vs code so i'll show you where to download that head to code.visualstudio.com and download the correct version for your operating system i'm running windows so i'm going to install the windows version then i will open when done except the agreement yes i actually did read it that fast i would recommend creating a desktop icon and make sure add to path is selected next and install and then you might as well launch this bad boy so finish we are now within vs code the first thing i recommend is to download the live server extension so that after saving an html document we can immediately refresh a webpage so underneath the search box for extensions we are looking for live server and install this version then after downloading the live server extension we will create a new folder under the explorer tab open folder wherever you want create a new folder i'll create this on my desktop just for convenience i'm going to create a new folder i'll name this website or whatever you want doesn't matter then select folder and within our website folder we're going to create a new file name this index.html whatever file you would like to be the home page of your website you'll want to name that as index.html when a connection is made to a website without a specific file in the url most servers by default will return the index.html file as a landing page so this index.html file will be the home page the landing page of our website at the top of our document we're going to type this within angle brackets exclamation point doc type html html documents should start with this declaration to be compliant with basic html standards it lets a visitor's web browser know that this is an html5 document and following this text will create a pair of html tags tags are the keywords within angle brackets that a web page uses to define how your web browser will format and display content and usually these come in pairs so we'll need an opening html tag and a closing html tag all of our html code will be within these html tags so the html element represents the root of an html document and there's two major sections head and body so let's create a pair of head tags head represents information about a web page and there is also body as well so create a pair of body tags the body is what you would like to display to a user the head is information about the web page one thing that we can add to the head of our document is a title so we'll need a pair of title tags and let's create a title for our website my first website and then let's save let's open this document so i'm going to right click open with live server so the title of this web page is my first website and you may have noticed that this web browser was opened with edge so you can actually change that to a different web browser and here's how go to file preferences settings underneath extensions head to live server config custom browser and select a web browser of your choosing so right click open with live server and we are now using a different web browser so i'm just going to put my web browser and vs code side by side now let's add some text to the body of our webpage type whatever you want i like pizza then i'm going to save there we go we added some text to the body of our html document and we can also use a pair of header tags so surround some text with h1 this is the largest header tag and then make sure to close it afterwards okay so then we have h2 which is smaller we have h3 h4 h5 and the last one is h6 so if you need some sort of title for your web page you can always play some text within a pair of h1 header tags before i discuss p tags we should discuss what elements are elements embody the opening tag any content within and the closing tag so for example this is a opening title tag and a closing title tag and all of these together including any content within is known as the title element so that's the difference between tags and elements tags make up a portion of elements and with that out of the way we can move on to paragraph elements paragraph elements are made up of p tags we need an opening p tag and a closing piece egg and we can type some text within these paragraph tags this is some sample text browsers automatically add a blank line of before and after any paragraph elements also if you need some longer sample text there is a shortcut type lorem then tab and that will create some sample text for you and let's create another paragraph element so we need an opening p tag and a closing p tag i would like some more sample text i will type lorem then tab and we now have two paragraph elements if you need a paragraph of information to display with blank lines before and after you can always surround some text within a pair of p tags now there's also a br element and these do not need closing tags it's only an opening tag wherever you would like to add a line break just add a br element so let's say i would like to space out these header tags well i can add a line break between each of these if you ever need a line break just use a vr element and like i said there's no closing tag with these elements there's also an hr element and i do not mean human resources i mean horizontal rule if you ever need to divide your page section by section you can always add a horizontal rule let's say that we have a title to this webpage i'll create an h1 header tag this is my website and then i'm just going to close this what if i would like to divide this webpage section by section i can always add a horizontal rule by using an hr element and there is no closing tag with this element you just type hr with an angle brackets and this will divide a section of your web page and add a horizontal rule which looks pretty nice so that is the hr element and the last thing we're going to discuss for this topic is comments comments will not be displayed within the body of your document it's more or less a note for yourself or other developers to create a comment we need an angle bracket exclamation point then two dashes and this will create the ending of your comment which is an arrow pointing to the right so anything between these two arrows will be a comment i'll leave a comment for i don't know myself this is the best website ever so as you can see this will not be displayed within my web page it's basically used as a note for yourself or for other people looking over this html document so yeah those are comments well everybody that is the basics of html in the next video we will discuss how we can include images within our webpage so yeah if you liked this video please give this video a thumbs up leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
