hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain what a set is in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm a set is a collection which is unordered as well as being unindexed they do not allow any duplicate values for example let's create a set of silverware so in order to create a set we need a name for this set let's call it utensils equals and in order to create a set we need to surround all values with a set of curly braces now let's add a few utensils to the set called utensils let's add a fork a spoon and maybe a knife and that should be good and let's display all of the values for x in utensils print x now with sets they're different from lists because they're unordered as well as being unindexed if i were to print all of the elements in utensils they might not necessarily be in the same order in which we placed them for example when we printed all of the elements found within utensils first we had a knife a fork and then a spoon if i were to run this again they might be in a different order kind of like that so a set is actually faster than a list if you need to check to see if something is within a set compared to a list and they do not allow any duplicate values let me add a bunch of knives and let's see what happens so i'll have a total of three knives but when we print all of the elements of the set only one knife appears so here's a few useful methods of sets the first method is that we can add an item to our set so type in the name of the set in this case it's utensils dot and here's a bunch of methods that you can use i am looking for add and we can add an element to the set i would like to add a napkin and then if we were to print the set we do have a napkin within the set we can also remove an element utensils dot remove and i would like to remove the fork and now our fork is gone we can also clear utensils dot clear and all the elements within our set should be gone so let me turn these lines into a comment all right for this next example we'll need a second set let's create a second set called dishes and then we need a set of curly braces and let's add a bowl a plate and a cup our next method is that we're going to add one set to another by using the update method let's say we would like to add our dishes set to our utensil set so let's type utensils dot and use the update method and within this method we will pass in the set that we would like to add so utensils update dishes this will add all of the elements found within dishes to our utensil set and you can see that when we print our utensils we have a bowl a plate and a cup in here as well and then if i were to switch these around let's say dishes update utensils and then i will print everything found within dishes now there's a fork a spoon and a knife in here as well we can also join two sets together and create a new set entirely so let's create a set called dinner table like we're setting up a dinner table and we need a fork a spoon a knife a bowl a plate and a cup so we have a dinner table set we're going to set the sequel to either utensils dot union dishes or we could do dishes union utensils either way would work and let's display all the elements found within dinner table and we should now have elements from both sets utensils and dishes as well there are also some methods in which we can compare the similarities as well as the differences between the elements found within two sets let's say i would like to check to see what utensils has that dishes doesn't and for this example i think i'll add a knife to my dishes set just so that they have at least one thing in common so i would like to see what utensils has that dishes doesn't so we can do so using the difference method and i will print the results with a print statement so i'm going to compare utensils against dishes utensils dot difference dishes and this will print what utensils has that dishes doesn't which is a fork as well as a spoon and we can reverse the rolls too we could say dishes difference utensils what do dishes have that utensils doesn't and dishes has a cup a bowl and a plate they both have knives so that's why knife isn't appearing we can also check to see if there's anything that they have in common using the intersection method so i'll turn this line into a comment we'll print utensils dot intersection dishes and this will return whatever element that they have in common which is a knife all right everybody in conclusion a set is a collection which is unordered as well as being unindexed they do not allow any duplicate values and you can do things like compare two sets see if there's anything that they have in common any differences and we can add or remove elements to a set if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down
