hey everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can accept some user input then I have a few exercises for us to work on we'll work on Mad Libs a program to calculate the area of a square and a shopping cart program how do we accept user input well we do so within our console window down here the same that we use for output to accept some user input we can use the input function within the set of parentheses we can type a prompt to be displayed to the console window let's ask for somebody's name enter your name when I run this program our program is paused in the console window until we type in something and hit enter I'll enter my name you can enter in your own name hit enter but nothing appears to happen we've accepted user input but we should probably store the input somewhere how about inside of a variable I'll assign my variable name equal to the input that we receive our input will be stored within this variable and then we can use it for something so let's print whatever our name is within a message I'll use an F string hello our variable name let's try this again enter your name I'll type in my first name hit enter hello Pro let's ask for somebody's age this time we'll create variable age set this equal to input then we'll need a prompt enter your age then we will print using an F string you are our variable age years old and to your name I'll type in my first name and your age I'll make up an age hello bro you are 21 years old when we accept user input the input is always of the string data type what if I were to increase my variable age by one H equals h plus one this is what would happen bro 21 uh we have a type error can only concatenate strings not integers two strings if I accept user input and I need to use it for any sort of math I would want to type cast that input as either an integer or a float based on the previous lesson on typecasting we could write age equals I'll type cast my age which is a string into an integer so type in your first name and age and that appears to work uh however I like to do this involving one line of code in place of adding an additional line where we're typecasting I'll take the user input and place this function within a Typecast I'll type int then surround the input function with the set of parentheses then that only takes one line of code So Pro 21 there we go that also works if we were to type cast our input as a float well then my input would be a floating Point number it has that decimal portion so when you accept user input it's always of the string data type if you're going to use your input with any sort of math you'll probably want to Typecast it as either a float or an integer and that's how to accept user input let's go over a few exercises the first we'll create a Mad Libs game all right everybody for our first practice program we're going to create a Mad Libs game Mad Libs is where you have a story but the user gets to submit nouns verbs and adjectives within your story so let's think of a story feel free to come up with your own I'll use fstrings today I went to a we'll insert an adjective here an adjective is a quality of a thing Zoo so what kind of zoo an expensive Zoo a cheap Zoo a dirty Zoo a clean Zoo that's an adjective it's a quality of a noun our second line let's say is in an exhibit I saw then a noun a noun is a person Placer thing our noun was then an adjective and a verb a verb is an action I would like two different adjectives let's rename this first adjective as adjective one the second adjective will be adjective two after our verb I'll add ing that means that this verb is current tense it's currently happening print this will be an upstring I was then let's add a third adjective adjective three we just need to declare and assign these variables we have adjective one our noun adjective two our verb then adjective three we'll accept user input input will ask the user to enter an adjective let's copy this line add that to adjective two and adjective three for noun will input enter a noun our verb will be enter a verb all right we're ready to run our Mad Libs game an adjective describes a quality of a person place or thing like Fast slow uh what about suspicious or I'll just say sus for short enter a noun mark Zuckerberg a noun is a person Placer thing enter an adjective berserk enter a verb a verb is an action how about Screech enter an adjective amazed all right here's our story today I went to a sus zoo in an exhibit I saw Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg was berserk and screeching I was amazed all right that is our first exercise I'd like to see what you wrote post your results in the comment section down below because I would like to read it all right let's move on to the second exercise for this next exercise we will calculate the area of a rectangle we'll need two variables length and width we'll take length equal to accept some user input enter the length of a rectangle then we'll need the width width enter the width of a rectangle we will take our area variable set this equal to length times width then let's display whatever the area is the area is colon space I'll insert our area variable depending on the unit of measurement you can set this two inches centimeters or something else I'll just say centimeters I believe that centimeters squared technically okay let's try it the length will be 9 the width is 15. we have a problem type error can't multiply sequence by nonintegers of type string what we're missing here is we need to Typecast our user input as either a floating Point number or an integer we're using these variables in arithmetic equations so let's Typecast our length and our width as a floating Point number foreign enter the length of a rectangle 9 15 . the area is 135 centimeters squared hey If This Were a 3D rectangle we could add height equals I'm going to copy all this enter the height of a rectangle volume equals length times width times height the volume is our volume centimeters cubed technically nine fifteen seven I'm just making up numbers here the volume is 945.0 centimeters cubed all right so that is the second exercise we have calculated well I guess both the area of a rectangle and the volume of a threedimensional rectangle okay we have one more exercise a shopping cart program we have three variables item a price of the item then a quantity we'll ask the user what item they're buying input what item would you like to buy then a price input what is the price then a quantity input how many would you like if we're working with a string we don't need to do any type casting a price with a price that could include a decibel we should type cast our input as a floating Point number I'll surround our input with a type cast to a float and with a quantity those are typically integers they're whole numbers I'll type cast our input as an integer so surround our input with an intercast then we can do some calculations total equals our price multiplied by our quantity then we'll display a message to the user print we'll use an F string you have bought our quantity variable times whatever the item is that we're trying to buy then I'll add slash S because they might buy more than one item then we'll display the total your total is colon space then our total I should probably precede the total with some currency maybe a dollar sign okay let's run this program what item would you like to buy I would like to buy a pizza what is the price maybe a pizza is 4.99 how many would you like to buy I would like to buy nine pizzas all right here's the total 44.91 we can truncate everything up to two decimal places and here's how there is a builtin round function I'm going to surround our total within a round function then after our variable I'll add comma then the amount of decimal places to round two let's try this again what item would you like to buy a pizza the price is 4.99 how many would you like to buy I'd like nine pizzas your total is 44.91 like I said to truncate everything after two decimal places you could use the builtin round function then set the amount of decimal places you would like to round to alright everybody that is the third exercise we have made a small shopping cart program
