hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about panels in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people let's discuss jpanels it's a gui component that functions as a container to hold other components and you can add a jpanel to a frame and it will sort of section off areas of your frame so let's create a frame so i'm just going to paste this just to save a little bit of time so jframe frame equals new frame be sure to include any necessary imports frame dot set default close operation j frame exit on close we're going to be using no layout manager at least until we get to the video discussing layout managers so frame dot set layout no because we're manually going to place all of the components that we have frame dot set size 750 by 750 and frame dot set visible true now to create a jpanel it's very similar to creating a jframe so we say j panel let's call this panel equals new j panel and let's change the background color and be sure to include any necessary imports so we'll say panel dot set background and let's pass in a color so color let's make this red actually uh since we're going to be creating a few different panels let's instead call this maybe red panel then we'll have a maybe blue panel and a green panel so be sure to change that here as well then we're going to set the bounce since we're using no layout manager we have to manually place the coordinates and the width and the height of this panel so red panel dot set bounce so we need x and y for where this panel is going to be placed as well as the width and the height so for the x position let's put this where x is zero where y is zero so this is going to be in the top left corner of the frame and for the width let's make this 250 by 250 so it's a square and then lastly this is very easy to forget about we need to add this panel to the frame so let's do that at the end frame dot add what are we adding we're adding a component our jpanel is a component let's add that red panel and let's run this so this is our frame and this is our panel we can add components to the panel just like what we can do with our frame so let's create a few other panels to create different sections for this frame like this is one section we can create a different section to hold other components and then we can add components kind of like what we did with our frame so let's create maybe a blue panel this time so i'm going to copy this change red to blue and make sure to change it here as well so blue panel and blue panel and we'll change the color to blue and let's place this where x is 250 y is zero and we'll keep the dimensions the same and we need to add this panel to the frame so frame dot add blue panel so now we should have a blue panel next to our red panel which we do and let's create one more panel maybe a larger one that's green that will take up this section of our frame so let's call this green panel so let's change blue to green so green green green and here as well so we'll place this where x is zero y is 250 and let's make this 500 by 250 and then we need to add this to the frame so frame dot add green panel and then this should give us a nice square that's made up of separate jpanels cool yeah so those are jpanels let's add a component so let's make a label so let's do this at the top j label label equals new j label and i'll set some text as well so label dot set text hi and you can add an icon too if you want i'll do that just for this demonstration uh we'll need to create an image icon so image icon icon equals new image icon and this file that i have is thumbsup.png and it looks like this so this is thumbs up dot p n g and include this import uh but i misspelled image all right then label dot set icon all right now with this label we can add this to either the frame or we can add this to a panel so let's add this to one of the panels let's say the red panel so let's add that here so instead of saying frame dot add label we're going to say the panel that we want to add this to because these panels function like containers so let's add this to the red panel so red panel dot add label and this should appear in our red panel which it does let's instead add this to a different panel like the blue panel and now this label is contained within the blue panel and let's try it for the green panel and now this label appears in the green panel and you can also move this label around within the container too however these panels they use something called a flow layout manager and in the last video on labels the frames that we use have a border layout all you really need to know about flow layouts right now is that with components that you add to a container that's using a flow layout manager it will take all these components stick them to the top and center them and it will add components until this first row is filled once that row is filled it's going to add components to the second row but for now we don't really know how that works that's a video for a different day let's just set the layout for our panel to a border layout just because we're comfortable with that and then later i'll demonstrate using no layout manager and how we can place this label so let's set the layout for our green panel and we're kind of comfortable with border layouts now and moving labels within a frame that's using a border layout so green panel dot set layout and then we can pass in a new border layout so this is the same layout that our jframe uses and if we're using the border layout it's going to place any components to the center vertically and to the left horizontally and then we can use set vertical and set horizontal alignment for this label to move this label around within the container and then later we'll set no layout manager so we can place coordinates if you prefer to do it that way so let's set the vertical and horizontal alignment for this label so we'll do that at the top label dot set vertical alignment and this takes a constant j label and let's move this to the top so then our label will move as far as it can to the top vertically and it gets stuck at the top of this container because well it's a container it doesn't like to allow components outside of the container and if we were to set this to bottom take a wild guess it's going to move to the bottom of the container and then let's also set the horizontal alignment because we can so label dot set horizontal alignment and we can pick left center or right let's pick the right this time so j label dot right and our label will stick to the bottom and to the right of the container that it's in now what if we switch this label to a different panel like the red panel uh first we'll just want to change the layout that we're using so let's change the red panel layout to a new border layout and then we're going to add our label to the red panel this time so let's take a guess as to where this label is going to move to it's going to move to the bottom right corner of the red panel and if we switch this to blue and i'm just going to copy this because we'll want to set this to a border layout so blue panel and blue panel dot add label now this is within the bottom right of the blue panel so what if you don't want to use a layout manager well this is what we can do we're going to set null for the layout for each of these panels so let's change this to no for all three panels and let's take a look to see what changes were made all right so we need to set the bounds for this label now so let's do that here label dot set bounds we're going to place x coordinate a y coordinate a width and a height so let's say we want this in the top left corner that is where x is zero and y is zero let's say for the width this will be 75 and for the height 75 as well now we added our label to the blue panel so it's going to be in the top left corner of the blue panel and not necessarily the top left corner of our frame because with set bounds it's going to place your component at these coordinates relative to the container that it's in since this label is within the blue panel the blue panel is acting as the container and not necessarily the frame so if we were to move this label to a different panel it's going to be within a new container so let's say we want to add this label to the green panel so now this label is going to be in the top left of our green panel and you can do the same thing with red too and then if we were to move the x position and y position of this label let's say 100 and 100 and now this label is moved down on the yaxis by 100 pixels and on the xaxis to the right by 100 pixels relative to the corner of the container that it's within this green panel and not necessarily the frame itself so we don't really need this set vertical alignment and set horizontal alignment if you're using no layout manager this is something you'll want to use if you're using a border layout all right everybody so that's the basics of panels it's basically a gui component that functions as a container to hold other components so you can add components to a panel and then you can add the panel to a frame so that's the basics of panels if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of panels in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a
