hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be copying files in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running welcome back to another video regarding doing stuff with files using python and in this video we're going to be copying some files and in order to do so i recommend importing the shuttle module there's other ways of doing this too but i tend to like using the shuttle module now with this module there are three basic functions to copy a file starting at the top they are copy file copy and copy too so copy file is what we'll be working with this will copy the contents of a file copy will do everything that copy file does plus copy the permissions mode and the destination can be a directory and lastly copy 2 this will do everything that copy does plus it copies the metadata of that file including the files creation and modification times so depending on the project or the program you're working with you may need to use copy or copy too but in this video we're going to be using copy file just to copy the contents of a file now after you import the shuttle module this is all you need to do to copy a file shuttle dot then use the appropriate function that you need to copy your file we're going to be using copy file copy file and within this function there are two arguments a source and a destination so within my project folder i have a plain text file called test test.txt all this says is yo this is some text see ya what i would like to do is copy this file because it's cool now since this file is within my project folder i only have to list the file name otherwise if this is someplace else i would list the file path here so this file is test.txt this is the source file and now i need a destination so the second argument will be separated with the comma i'm going to list a destination so you can actually rename this to i would like to name this as copy.txt so the destination is my project folder so when i create a copy of this file test.txt this copy will appear in my project folder and say the same thing so after running this we now have a file named copy.txt that says the same thing as my test file and remember what i said you can copy this file to a different location on your computer so you could list the file path so this file path would go to my desktop and then when i run this this will copy my original file my source and then copy it to wherever my destination is oh and i almost forgot so if you need to use copy or copy 2 the arguments are exactly the same so if you needed to use copy this would be a shuttle dot copy instead of copy file then copy two is shuttle dot copy two the arguments are exactly the same but each of these functions will copy it different things depending on what you need for your own program or project all right everybody so that's the basics of copying files and python i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that is how to copy files using python
