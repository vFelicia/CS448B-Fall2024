hey everybody so today we're going to create a number guessing game using python this is a project meant for beginners by completing this project it will help us reinforce our understanding of previous topics let's begin we will import the random module we'll need to pick a random number the random module is going to handle that for us what is the arrange of random numbers for our number guessing game we'll store those as variables we will have one variable named lowest number number I'll set that to be one as well as a variable for highest number which I will set to be 100 feel free to pick a different range if you would like I'll set the range to be 1 through 100 a random number will be selected between this range which will be stored within a variable named answer what is the correct answer so to choose a random number between these two values we will access the random module called the Rand int method we will choose a random integer between these two values the two arguments will be lowest num comma highest num for the second argument let's perform a test run I will print my answer the number is going to be between 1 and 100 okay we know that that works here's a few more variables we need to keep track of the number of wrong guesses which I will store as a variable named guesses we want the user to keep guessing as long as our application is running we will create a Boolean variable of is running which we will set to be true once the user wins the game we will set is running to be false we will print a welcome message let's say python number guessing game we will prompt the user I'll use an FST string select a number between I'll add two placeholders select a number between our lowest number and our highest number python number guessing game select a number between 1 and 100 now if I was to change the range of these variables that should be reflected temporarily I changed the lowest number to be 10 and the highest number to be 1,000 but let's set that back between 1 and 100 is good we'll need a while loop to continue the game each round we will say y while is running since is running is a Boolean we don't need to say while is running equals true we can just say while is running while this value remains true continue playing the game we will ask the user for some input we will create a local variable of guess guess equals use the input function then enter a prompt enter your guess there's one thing we want to check python number guessing game select a number between one and 100 and to your guess what if somebody doesn't type in a number like they type in the word Pizza we should let the user know that that's an invalid guess we'll write the following if statement if our guess use the is digit method if our guess is a digit a number then we will execute any code underneath this if statement for the time being I'll right pass we'll get back to that later else we will do something else let's print the following print invalid guess let's copy this print statement because I'm lazy and I don't feel like typing it out please select a number between our lowest number and our highest number let's try that again I will guess Pizza which isn't a number and we get the message invalid guess please select a number between 1 and 100 all right that works underneath our if statement we'll write the following once we get a guess that is a digit we need to convert it to a number because when you accept user input it's a string we will re assign our guess equal to typ cast our guess as an integer then increase the number of guesses by one guesses plus equals 1 because we have already made one guess here's another scenario what if somebody guesses a number outside of this range like one kajillion well we should give a warning that that guess is invalid if our guess is lower than the lowest number or our guess is greater than the highest number we will print the following that number is out of range and I will reprompt the user please select a number between the lowest number and the highest number let's perform a test run I will guess one kajillion that number is out of range please select a number between 1 and 100 We'll add an else if statement else if our guess is less than our answer we will print the following to low try again else if our guess is greater than our answer we will print to high try again if our guess isn't less than our answer and our guess isn't greater than our answer that means we must have the correct answer within an lse statement we will print I'll use an F string correct the answer was insert our answer our answer variable then print the number of guesses it took number of guesses add a placeholder place in our guesses within the placeholder now to escape the while loop we will take our Boolean variable of is running which is normally true and and set that to be false to escape and that should be all we need let's run this one last time python number guessing game select a number between 1 and 100 let's select a number right in the middle 50 too low try again so the number is between 50 and 100 75 too high it's between 50 and 75 then 62 too high 56 53 55 correct the answer was 55 number of guesses it took me six all right everybody that is a python number guessing game you yourself can create as a mini project
