hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running buttons you click them and then they do stuff that's pretty much it so this is how to create a button in python we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop let's call our button just button and in order to create this we'll follow this with equals button and within the constructor for this button we're going to list what we want to add this button to what is the master the master is the window and in order to display this button we're going to follow this with button dot pack and we should have a small rectangular button within our window but it doesn't display any text nor does it do anything so let's add some text and there is an option to do that within the constructor we're going to list the option for text and set this to whatever text you want to display let's say click me and then when we run this our button now says the text that we set and it says click me however it currently doesn't do anything though we need to set a command that is another option command equals and we list a function name this is what's known as a callback so let's create a function called click and then outside of the window let's define what our click function does def click and let's print a message you clicked the button now with the command we're going to list the function name without the parentheses so make sure you're writing it as this and not that this is what's known as a callback so when we click on this button it's going to perform our callback and perform whatever is within our function click just like that let's customize the appearance of this button i'm going to change the font that is another option font equals and let's pick a professional font such as comic sans it's very professional and i'll set a size of 30 and now you can actually read what's on this button it's large enough let's set the foreground color that is the font color fg you can place a color name or a hex value here i'll pick green that is 0 0 ff00 and our text should now be green which it is let's also change the background color that is bg i will pick the color name of black and now we have green text on a black background notice that when i click on this button or hold my mouse button down the color scheme has changed that's because there is a different active foreground and active background and we can change those too so that this won't flash every time you click on the button so let's change the active foreground and active background those are other options active foreground and i'll set this to the same color as my foreground which is green so the text color is going to stay the same and i'll also change the active background and i will also set this to black to match my background and then this should no longer flash when we click on our button if you need to disable somebody from clicking on this button there is an option to do so and that option is the state option and normally this is active but you can set this to disabled and we can no longer click on this button and you can see that the color scheme has changed too it's all grayed out and whatnot so i'm going to replace this back with active because we still have a few more things to do now how do we add an image to a button there is an image option and we set this equal to a photo image but first we need to create a photo image i have this photo of a like button a thumbs up that i want to use i need to create a photo image from this image file so within the window let's call this photo image just photo photo equals photo image then i'm going to list the file path or the file name since this image is within my same project folder i only have to list the file name and this is called like.png but if you use your own image it's probably going to be named something else then i need to set the image equal to my photo image which i named photo but the photo replaces the text on this button but it still works the same so we would like to display some text as well as our image we need to use the compound option and we list a direction we can list top bottom left right we want this image to be on the perhaps bottom so let's list the bottom and now when we run this we have our text as well as our image and if we changed compound to a different direction like top then the image is going to be displayed on the top relative to the text what if we wanted to count the amount of times that we clicked this button we could create a variable called count and we'll set this equal to zero but in order for us to access this count variable within the function of click we're going to list count as global so that this is a global variable every time we click this button let's increment our variable count by one by saying count plus equals one and then we will print whatever the value of count is so within a print statement we'll just say count now when we click on this button we have access to our count variable that's outside of this function and every time we click on this button it's going to increase our count variable by one well everybody that's the basics of creating buttons in python if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of buttons in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a
