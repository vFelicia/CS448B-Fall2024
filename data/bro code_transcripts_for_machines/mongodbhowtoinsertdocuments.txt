all right we're moving on everybody now I'm gonna show you how we can insert documents into a mongodb database let's be sure that we're using our current database in the last topic we were using the database of school let's clear our screen to insert a document within the database we're working with type DB then the name of a collection if a collection is found within this database we have created a collection of students if this collection doesn't exist one will be created for you db.students.we will use the insert one method within the set of parentheses we will place a document which is enclosed within a set of curly braces within the set of curly braces we can list as many field value pairs as we would like let's create a name field with the value of SpongeBob each field value pair is comma separated let's add another field value pair maybe an age age will be 30. then a GPA grade point average SpongeBob has a solid 3.2 GPA let's enter this command that was acknowledged to return all documents within a collection type DB the name of the collection in this case students dot we can use the find method here are the current documents within my collection we only have one here's the object ID that's created automatically the name is SpongeBob age 30 GPA 3.2 now you can insert more than one document at a time by using the insert many function DB type the name of the collection students in this case we will insert many documents we will place all documents to be inserted within an array add a set of straight brackets this is the exact same kind of array from different programming languages however in Python I think that would be a list technically maybe we need to insert three documents we would need three sets of curly braces each comma separated within each set of curly braces we would list all of the different field value pairs so let's begin with the first we have name Patrick separate each field value pair with a comma then we have age of let's make Patrick 38 then GPA Patrick is at 1.5 that's enough for our first document let's go to the second document move over to the second set of curly braces for the name this will be Sandy Sandy's age is I don't know 27 sounds good GPA Sandy smart she has a solid 4.0 then let's go to the last document name maybe Gary 's age is 18. GPA 2.5 that's good enough for now this array contains several documents each document is enclosed within a set of curly braces within each document you can have as many field value pairs as you like they all don't need to be consistent let's insert all of these documents they were all acknowledged we have three new object IDs let's use the find method again to display all of them DB dot students dot find here are the four objects found within our database SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Gary that's how to insert documents using the Shell next we'll do the same thing but use Compass instead if you're using Compass here's how to insert documents into a collection here are the four documents we created previously I'm just going to go ahead and delete these to add a new document to make sure you're within the current database you're working with go to the current collection RS students we will add data you can import a Json or CSV file or you can type them manually by inserting document a document is pregenerated for you I'm just going to go ahead and delete that we'll Begin by inserting SpongeBob you need a set of curly braces then list all of the name value pairs name SpongeBob separate each field value pair with a comma age 30 GPA 3.2 if you have this warning you will need to probably hit the format button that should go away then insert and that is how to insert one document to insert many it's the same process as before but you're going to enclose all of your documents within an array a set of straight brackets so if we need three documents add three sets of curly braces all comma separated we had Patrick age I think he was 38. GPA 1.5 name Sandy age 27 I'm going to move this down a little bit so you can see GPA 4.0 then name Gary age 18. GPA 2.5 let's reformat insert and here are the three documents we have inserted all right and that is how to insert documents into a mongodb database using Compass
