hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a random event generator using random numbers and a switch this might be useful maybe if you're writing a game you need some random event to occur like random monsters show up or the weather changes anything like that we'll be working with random numbers you may need to include this header file include c time because we need access to the time function to work with random numbers we'll need to generate a seed srand function pass in time pass in zero this function will use the current time as a seed to generate random numbers we'll create a local variable to store our random number int rand num equals use the rand function modulus then what's the range of numbers you would like i would like the numbers one through five but this will give us zero through four so i'm going to add one to the end my integer randomnum will be a random number between one and five i'm going to create a switch to examine this random number against many matching cases so we have case one through five if the random number is one what would you like to do exactly so in this program i think we're going to give away prizes like it's a random prize generator depending on the random number we'll give a participant a random prize standard output you win how about a bumper sticker a bumper sticker that will be the lowest tier prize then we should probably add a break to break out of the switch okay let's think of some others i should probably break after these prize two will be a tshirt prize three how about a free lunch prize for maybe a gift card case five concert tickets that sounds good so when i run this program we'll generate a random number between one and five depending on what that number is we'll execute the code found within one of these cases let's see what i won i want a free lunch if i try this again there's a good chance it'll be a different prize this time i want a bumper sticker i want a bumper sticker again come on i want those concert tickets i'll take a gift card that's not bad now if you don't add these break statements you'll just fall through the switch you want a gift card you want concert tickets so if you only want somebody to win one prize you'll want to exit out of the switch by including this break statement so yeah everybody i thought that might be an interesting program you can generate some random event maybe it's for a game or something i thought maybe a random prize giveaway would kind of be interesting this program is more or less for practice your assignment is to write a switch with some random events then post it in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a random event generator using c plus plus
