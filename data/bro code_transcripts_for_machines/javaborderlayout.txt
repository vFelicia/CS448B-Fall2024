hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how border layout managers work in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running let's discuss border layouts a border layout is used within a container to place components in one of five major areas they are north south west east and center so here's some code that i've written for an example you don't need to copy this we'll get to this later i have created five separate panels and i gave them all a unique color i have attached one of these panels to one of the borders so panel one is attached to the north then panel two to the west east south and then center let's see what this looks like so lo and behold this is a border layout the center panel will expand in size proportionately to the size of the frame the top and bottom borders they will expand horizontally but not vertically when you resize this frame and with the west and the east borders they will expand vertically but not horizontally when you expand this frame here's some uses of a border layout you can use the north border for some sort of title you can use the west or the east border for some sort of sidebar or navigation bar you can use the south border for some sort of footer for your program and the center border you can use this for the i would say main part or main body of your program so let's recreate what we witnessed step by step so first we'll need a jframe so jframe frame equals new j frame frame dot set default close operation j frame dot exit on close let's set a size so frame dot set size i'll make this 500 by 500 and frame dot set visible and set this to true let's create some panels so jpanel we'll call this panel one equals new j panel and we'll create the other panels as well so two three four five let's give them all a color so let's begin with panel one panel one dot set background and this was red so color dot red let's do the same for the others so we have panel two three four five the second panel this was green but you can pick whatever colors you want doesn't matter 3 was yellow 4 was magenta and 5 was blue and before we add these panels to our frame we need to set up the frame with a border layout so this is normally the default layout manager but you'll need to do this for other layout managers though so to change the layout manager you type in the name of the container in this case it's our frame dot set layout and then you pass in a new layout manager so if we want to set up a container with a border layout we type in new border layout so for our frame this isn't going to do anything but if you're doing this with a panel or other container you would need to set this up with a new border layout and lastly we just need to add these panels to our frame so frame dot add what are we adding we're adding a component our panel so let's add panel one and then to set a component to one of the borders when you add this component you add a comma and then type in border layout dot and then the direction so we can set this to north if we want this attached to the top so now at the top of this program we have a red bar our red panel this will expand uh horizontally but not vertically and we can actually change the dimensions on this so this is panel one uh changing the width won't do anything but we can change the height though for this so if we set this to 50 you can see it has half the height now but the width still expands to accommodate the size of the frame let's add the other panels so it's the same process as before frame dot add let's add panel 2 and panel 2 we'll put on the west so border layout dot west and then we have the screen sidebar that you saw previously so this will expand vertically but not horizontally and we can even change the dimensions for this so this time i'm going to change the width to 50 and the height will stay the same because it doesn't really matter so now the width of this panel is cut in half because we changed this from 100 to 50 and let's finish by adding the others so panel three this will be on the east so borderlayout.east here's our east panel and then we have south so this will be panel four border layout dot south and then of course center so panel five border layout dot center just like this so one option available to you is that you can add margins between these components this is how we can do that so when we set a container our frame with a new border layout when we pass in a new border layout we can actually send in some margins for the width and margins for the height so let's say that we want 10 pixels of margin for the width and 0 for the height this is what this might look like so with the west and the east panels they have 10 pixels worth of margin now let's do that with the height this time so now we'll have 10 pixels of margin for the width and the height between all these panels so now all these components are now separated by 10 pixels worth of margin so if you need to add margin between components you can just pass them in when you create a new border layout here's an advanced trick that you can do with these panels they can also act as a container with their own layout manager and they use something called a flow layout manager by default so let's say that we want to add some panels within our center panel kind of like sub panels this is how we can do that so i'm just going to copy everything we have just to save time beginning when we create these instances of our panels to when we set the size for the panels so i'm just going to add a comment that these are sub panels so it's the same process as before really but let's call these panels six seven eight nine and ten and we're going to change the colors for these as well so make sure to change the name okay so with panel six let's say that this is black panel 7 will be dark gray panel 8 will just be gray panel 9 will be light gray and panel 10 will just be white so we need to set panel 5 with a new border layout uh with our frame we added a new border layout to this but now panel 5 is also acting as our container so we can set this with its own unique layout manager so with panel 5 set this to a new border layout then we need to set a preferred size for each of these panels so that's six seven eight nine and ten and let's say that these are all going to be fifty by fifty i'm just going to copy this a bunch of times to save time 7 8 9 10. all right now we can add these sub panels to panel 5 which is the center panel so it's the same process that we did with our frame so instead of saying frame panel 5 is going to act as the container so panel five dot add let's add panel six so panel six comma then if we want to add this to the north border we type in border layout dot north and this is what this currently looks like so we have a panel within another panel and let's add the others so panel five dot add panel seven uh but make sure you change this to a different border so let's change that to the south there we go so panel five dot add panel eight let's add this to the west here it is panel five dot add panel nine this will go on the east and then lastly we have the center panel so that's panel five dot add panel ten border layout dot center and there it is i don't really see the point of this but i just wanted to let you know that you can do stuff like this so that's the basics of using border layouts in java if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how border layouts work in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
