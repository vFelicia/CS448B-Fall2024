hey everybody so today I'm going to explain string slicing in JavaScript string slicing is the process of creating a substring from a portion of another string this won't alter the original string just to demonstrate let's create a constant for our full name go ahead and type in your full name or you can copy me I'm going to extract the first name from my full name and create a new string out of it so I'll declare this let first first name equals Now to create a substring we can follow this formula we take our string in this case our full name dot then use the builtin slice method slice then we can list a starting and ending index where would we like to begin so the first character has an index of zero we'll start at the beginning index0 comma where are we going to end 0 1 2 this isn't necessarily going to work and let me demonstrate so let's console.log our first name so my first name is BR so the ending index is actually exclusive in my full name we're ending at o but we don't include it within our substring because the ending index is exclusive I'll increase the ending index to three that should include one more character which it does now let's get the last name let last name equals again following this formula take our original string use the builtin slice method State the beginning index 0 1 2 3 4 mine will be four yours may be different depending on what your name is and the ending index 4 5 6 7 and remember that the last index is exclusive so I'm going to increase that to be eight then we'll display our last name console.log last name and there's my last name so the reason that I set the beginning index to be four and not three is because we'll include that space within the result as you can see here if you're going to be creating a substring from some position all the way to the end you don't necessarily need an ending index I'm going to remove the ending index and this should work the same all right what if I need the first character in the string let first Char meaning character equals take our string we will use the slice method for the first character you can use 0 comma 1 then let's display our first character and in my example mine is B for the last character let last character full name do slice we can use a negative index even if you're using a negative index you'll begin at the end then by decreasing the number you'll work your way towards the beginning so the last character in my name is e 2 would be de three is OD four is c for code negative indices work as well with these specific numbers that I've listed they're only going to work if my name is exact this what if I were to change my first name to be instead of bro broseph like Joseph then let's display our first name then our last name first name bro last name f which is not correct to make this program more Dynamic we can combine string slicing with the index of method we'll search the string for the first instance of a space then depending on where that space is we'll take the first part of our full name and create a substring for the first name anything after the space will be our last name so let's turn these lines into comments we don't need them anymore let first name equals again take our full name do slice we'll begin at the beginning index zero now where do we end we're not going to count the number of character this time we're going to calculate it the ending index will be take our full name dot then use the index of method where's the first index of a space so that is the ending position wherever there's a space then we'll display our first name uh let me get rid of our last name there brosive now for the last name let last name equals let's copy this line of code paste it the beginning index will be full name. index of space you can list an ending index but we don't need to we would like to extract every character that comes after this position so we don't need an ending index all right let's see if this works broi space code we're including that space so to remedy this I can add plus one find the first index of a space then start in the position after that's why we're adding plus one then give me every letter that comes after and that works just fine broi code all right let's go over an exercise this time we will list an email const email equals why don't you go ahead and type in your email I'll make one up for me bro 1@gmail.com I'll extract the first part of my email to be stored as a username let username equals again we're going to take our string email do use the slice method where are we going to begin we'll begin at index zero that's the beginning of a string where will we end we'll end wherever the at symbol is but we need to search for it we'll use the builtin index of method of a string email. index of what are we searching for we are searching for the at symbol and let's see if this works console.log our username yep bro one then let's get the extension let extension equals we can copy this line of code paste it make a few changes this substring will begin where the last one ended then again console.log the extension at gmail.com again like I said before I would like to begin after this index I will add plus one my username is B1 my extension is gmail.com all right everybody so that's string slicing it's the process of creating a substring from a portion of another string when you create a substring you won't alter the original and I've proven that by setting this string to be a constant you can't change a constant to create a substring you take the string use the builtin slice method then you can list starting or ending indices and well everybody that is string slicing in JavaScript
