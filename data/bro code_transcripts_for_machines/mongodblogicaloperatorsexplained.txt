hey everybody today I need to explain logical operators logical operators return data based on Expressions that evaluate to be true or false there's four and or nor and not let's begin with and using the and logical operator we can check to see if two expressions are true let's begin with DB dot students that's the name of the collection we'll use the find method pass in a document object we will use the and logical operator it's preceded with the dollar sign it's an operator then a colon whatever Expressions you would like to check you will place within an array list as many Expressions as you would like let's return any document where the student is a fulltime student and their 22 years or younger usually most students when they start college they're between the ages of 18 and 22. so let's find all those students we'll have two conditions we need two document bodies our first condition is full time true give me any student that's a fulltime student and our other condition is give me any student that's age is less than or equal to 22 we'll use the less than equals comparison operator colon 22 and that's it we have one student Gary he's 22 and under and a fulltime student so with the andological operator you can have more than one condition this condition needs to be true and that condition needs to be true we were given the results of Gary He's the only student that passes these two filters they both evaluated to be true let's copy this method we'll reuse it let's discuss or change and to or with the orological operator at least one of these conditions need to be true give me anybody that's a fulltime student or anybody that's 22 or younger that will give me two documents Sandy she's older than 22 but she's a fulltime student Gary is 22 and under and a fulltime student so with the or logical operator at least one condition needs to be true so again let's copy this method we'll reuse it then we will talk about nor so with the neurological operator nor we will return any document where these conditions are false this needs to be false as well as this needs to be false it's kind of like and but instead of both conditions being true it's the opposite they both need to be false so that would give me three results SpongeBob he's above 22 he's a parttime student Patrick is 38 he's a parttime student Larry he's 32 he's a parttime student with the neurological operator we need both of these conditions to be false that gave us these three documents for SpongeBob Patrick and Larry lastly we have not suppose I have this query DB dot students dot find find any student that is not above 30. I could write something like this age colon we'll use the less than comparison operator colon 30. find any student under 30. normally this would give me Sandy and Gary you know this does work but what if somebody doesn't have some information for their age like let's change Gary's age to null because in SpongeBob lore Gary is a pet snail his age is in cat years just to make this easy and Compass I'm going to edit Gary's age to be null let's write that query again give me any student whose age is less than 30. well that only gives me Sandy Gary's age is null so another way in which we could return all students that are not 30 or above we can use the not logical operator the not logical operator reverses what you're looking for so let's enclose this document body within another document body then we will use the dollar sign not logical operator but we will change the comparison operator to be greater than equals give me any student that is not greater than or equal to 30. so that should give me both Sandy and Gary even though Gary's age is null in many circumstances you could use less than but a benefit of the not logical operator is that it would give you null values return any document that doesn't fit this condition basically speaking not just does the opposite alright everybody so those are logical operators they return data based on Expressions that evaluate to be true or false and those are logical operators in mongodb
