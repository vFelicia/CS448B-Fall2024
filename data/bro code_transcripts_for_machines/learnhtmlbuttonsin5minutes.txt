hello again everybody today I'm going to show you how we can create a button using HTML and a little CSS to create a button we need a pair of button tags and here's our button it's really small and it doesn't do anything let's add some text between the button tags let's add some text like click me so here's our button but it's fairly small we can change the size of this button by changing the font size we will need to access the style attribute then set the font size property to a larger font size so font Dash size 25 pixels is good the size of our button will adjust accordingly let's change the background color separate each of these CSS properties with a semicolon let's change the background Dash color to be Gray so that's how to change the background color to change the font color type color colon then some color like light blue you can round the corners by setting a border radius so that's another CSS property border Dash radius colon let's begin with five that will Round the Corner slightly you can increase the amount of pixels for a more rounded border let's try 25. that's not too bad so this button currently doesn't do anything what I'm going to do is turn this button into a hyperlink when we click on the button it will take us to maybe Google we need to surround our button with a pair of a tags I will set the href attribute equal to some URL like Google so when I click on the button it takes me to Google or if we had another HTML file we can go there too I'll create a new HTML file named maybe page two page2.html let's generate some HTML in vs code to do that type an exclamation point then tab all I'm going to add to page 2 is an H1 header tag with the title of this is page number two I'll set the href attribute to B the name of that HTML file page2.html page two dot HTML when I click on the button it brings me to my second page I haven't discussed JavaScript yet but we can have a button execute some JavaScript code this part of the lesson is outside the scope of what I would normally teach at this point in time but if you're interested here's a little bit of JavaScript again it's not necessary to learn this at this level if you would like to execute some JavaScript code using a button we need a pair of script tags for JavaScript together within this pair of script Tags I'm going to define a function function you can come up with some function name this function will do something then you need a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces buttons have an on click attribute we can have the button do something if it's interacted with the on click attribute is going to be the name of my function do something when we click on the button execute this function what do we want to do I'll change some text on the screen but we'll need some sample text to work with I'll create a pair of paragraph tags let's say hello within our JavaScript function we'll change the text of whatever's between these two paragraph tags but we need an ID there's an ID attribute I'll name this text maybe greeting so when we click on this function I would like to change the text of my greeting within the function we can do that with document dot get element by ID within the set of parentheses the ID is greeting follow this with DOT inner HTML then we can set the SQL to some new value let's set the new value to be good bye now when I click on the button it changes our text so that's a button everybody you need a pair of button tags you can apply some CSS styling I haven't really discussed CSS yet so we did inline CSS but if you have these many properties I would recommend a style sheet which we'll cover later to make your button bigger you can change the font size you could have your button bring you to another HTML page or even execute some JavaScript code and well everybody that's how to create a button using HTML
