hey it's you bro hope you're doing well in this video we're going to be discussing the two string method in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running welcome back guys and gals in this video i'm gonna be teaching you guys all about the tostring method this is a special method that all objects inherit it returns a string that textually represents an object so let me give you an example i have another class called car and a few variables related to cars such as a make a model a color and a year and i took the liberty of assigning these values already so it's a ford mustang that's red and the year is 20 21. now we have four variables here right what if we wanted to display all of these values so first we need to create an instance of this class we're going to create a car object we can do that by stating car let's call this car equals new car alright and in order to display all of these values within our car class we would need a bunch of print line statements luckily i just copied and pasted what i had before so within a print line we would print the cars make the car's model the car's color and the car's ear so if we were to run this this will display all of the values the textual representation of this object now what if we displayed with a print line statement car instead of one of the attributes so within a print line statement i'm going to instead just type in car and what the heck is this all right so let me explain this is the address of this car object in memory it's like the street address like one two three fake street so this is the address where you can find this car object in your computer's memory so normally we're using the tostring method and all objects will actually inherit a tostring method so if we were to type in the name of our car dot we actually have access to a tostring method and by default we actually call the tostring method behind the scenes implicitly when we use a print or print line statement so if i were to type car dot to string it's going to do the exact same thing which we have here so it's going to return the address of where this car object is in memory but what many people do is that they will override and change the tostring method to instead print a textual representation of this object and that's what we're going to be doing in today's video now within our car class we're going to be overriding the to string method method overriding is a different video so if you'd like to learn more about it feel free to check out that video so let's override the two string method and have it do something else so this is a public method it's going to be returning a string so instead of saying void we're going to be returning a string and the name of this method is the to string method make sure you spell it exactly like this now it's asking for us to add a return type so we're going to return a string back to the tostring method when we call it so let's make up a string let's call it my string it really doesn't matter what you call it for the most part and let's declare what my string is my string equals now we can actually return all of these values in string representation so my string is going to equal let's say make and we can format this however we want make plus maybe a new line plus model maybe let's add another new line the color plus a new line and the ear and that should be it all right another way in which you can write this that only has one line of code instead of declaring the string my string we take all of this copy it delete the first line and return everything like that so that's another way of writing what we had before done in only one line of code so this is going to return a string representation of all of these attributes of our car it's going to return the make the model the color and the ear so now if we were to run this we're going to be using our car's two string method and instead of getting an address of this car we're going to get a textual representation of this object all of the attributes that this car has the make the model the color and the ear so this is an explicit use of the two string method and not only can we use the tostring method explicitly but we can use it implicitly so let's write another print line statement but this time we're going to only print the name of our car and the result is no different it's exactly the same so we're implicitly using the tostring method of our car when we use a print or print line statement so you can use either one you can either call this tostring method explicitly or implicitly but the point being is that you can override the tostring method to return a string representation of all of the attributes of an object so that's how the tostring method works in java if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how the tostring method works in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that
