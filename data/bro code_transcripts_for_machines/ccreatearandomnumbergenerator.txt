hey everybody in this video i'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers just so you know these are pseudorandom numbers they're not truly random but they're close maybe if you need to roll a sixsided dice for a game well then this would work perfect to generate some random numbers we'll need to initialize the random number generator by typing s rand add a set of parentheses semicolon within the s rand function we'll need a seed what programmers typically do is that they'll use the current calendar time as a seed within the parentheses type time parentheses again then pass in null i'll store the first random number within a variable int num equals to generate a random number we invoke the rand function then i'll display this let's take a look to see what we have standard output number okay the random number that we have is 3231. using the rand function this will generate a random number between 0 and 32 767 but we don't necessarily need a number that large i just need to roll a six sided dice well what we're gonna do is follow this with modulus then the range of numbers we would like if i'm rolling a six sided dice i'll type modulus six modulus gives you the remainder of any division so take whatever number we roll divide it by six take the remainder and that's our number but there's one issue with this we have five two and zero technically the range of numbers is currently zero through five if we need one through six what we can do is add one plus one this should give us a random number between one and six there it is six so i tend to play a lot of dungeons and dragons there's polyhedral dice one die that we commonly roll is a twenty sided dice so if i would need a random number between 1 and 20 i would say rand function modulus 20. my random number is 1. wow that's surprisingly low then i have a 14. maybe you need a random number between 1 and 100 rand function modulus 100 my random number between 1 and 100 is 67. now i need to roll three six sided dice i'm going to create three variables let's name this num1 rand function modulus 6 plus 1. then let's copy this paste it twice we have num1 num2 num3 let's display num1 i'll add a new line then do this two more times for num two and num three so our three dice that we're rolling are five two two then again three one four yeah everybody that's how to generate some pseudo random numbers they're not truly random but they're close if you have a simple game you're working on this would work perfect if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to generate some random numbers in c plus
