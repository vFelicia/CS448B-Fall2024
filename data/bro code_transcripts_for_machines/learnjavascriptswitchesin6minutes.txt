hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain switches a switch can be an efficient replacement to using many else if statements here's an example of a program I wrote without using a switch we have a day day will normally be the number 1 through 7even if day equals 1 will console.log it is Monday which you can see here if day was two well then it's Tuesday all the way up to 7 which is Sunday I do have an else statement that states our day variable is not a day for example if I set day to be I don't know like a string of pizza well then Pizza is not a day but it really should be if you find yourself using a lot of else if statements I would instead recommend creating a switch here's how to create one we'll keep our day variable I'll set that to be one to create a switch we will type switch parentheses curly braces within the parenthesis of the switch we will place a variable or a value what are we examining let's examine our day variable we examine a value against matching cases to create a case type case then a value or a condition we will see if day equals one so day case one are these two values equal if they are then we can do something we can execute some code so add a colon then any code underneath this case will be ex executed if there's a match between our value or variable day and this value so let's console.log it is Monday then be sure to add a break I'll demonstrate why you need break later so day is one it is Monday let's add another case for case 2 in case day equals 2 so let's copy and paste what we have case two it is Tuesday let's change day to B2 it is Tuesday all right let's do this all the way up to case seven all right we have cases 1 through 7 if I change day to be S well then it is Sunday you can also add a default case in case there are no matches now what if we set day to be Pizza which doesn't make sense well there are no matching cases once we review all of the cases and there's no matches we exit the switch you also have the the capability to add a default case in case there are no matches what's the default behavior of the switch if there's no matching cases let's console.log I should probably use a template literal for this if we're inserting a variable our day variable is not a day so now we should execute this default case Pizza is not a day all right now the reason that we have these break statements is to break out of the switch once we have a matching case I'll demonstrate what happens if we remove these all right let's set day to be two as in Tuesday it is Tuesday it is Wednesday it is Thursday it is Friday it is Saturday it is Sunday two is not a day so the reason that we have these breakes is to break out of the switch if we don't have them once we have a matching case we will execute the code found within that space then Cascade down and execute any code that follows after including code within different cases so that's why you want these break statements after each case to break out of the switch let's go over a more complex example let's say we have a test score variable between 0 and 100 my score will be 92 92% I will also create a letter grade variable which we will declare but not aign I'm going to examine our test score so another way in which you can write a switch is something like this I'm going to examine the value of true against matching cases which contain a condition so case then I'll write a condition is test score greater than or equal to 90 as in 90% this condition will evaluate to be true or false if true is equal to true we will do some code if this is false we skip over it if our test score is greater than or equal to 90 let's assign our letter grade variable to equal an a then be sure to break then I'm going to test this with console.log we will display our letter grade we have an A let's do this for anything greater than 80 the user will receive a B test score greater than or equal to 80 letter grade will equal B let's change our test score to be 85 the user receives a b let's follow this pattern 70 will be a c yep C 60 will be a d 60 is D then for the default case I will set letter grade to be F letter grade equals F if I set my test score to be 33% so with the test score of 33 the letter grade is f all right everybody so that's a switch if if you find you're using a lot of L if statements I would recommend using a switch instead it's not bad if you have a few but if you have many I would use a switch instead and well everybody those are switches in JavaScript
