hey how's it going everybody it's you bro here and in this video I'm gonna teach you guys how we can include audio on our web pages using HTML let's get into it now before we begin if you want to follow along you can download an mp3 audio file or you can find one on your computer and use that and place it in the same folder that contains the HTML document that you plan on working with just so you're aware html5 only supports these audio files mp3 wav and OGG and wave and OGG don't work on all different web browsers but mp3 does so you really can't go wrong with using mp3 audio files if you need an mp3 audio file YouTube does have a free audio library that contains music as well as sound effects you can use whatever you want for your projects websites videos whatever you need so you know you can browse through here and pick something that you like I just so happen to find this song called bro time I like it mostly because of the title and if you want to download it just go to the right and click download I'll include a link for this audio library in the description down below here's that audio file I downloaded it's within the same folder that contains the HTML document that I plan on using if you want to place this somewhere else feel free to do so I'll show you how you can include the file path when we start to link our audio files to our webpages if you're all set let's begin the first step is that we need a pair of audio tags and make sure to put this within the body of your HTML document we're going to type audio we need an opening tag as well as a closing tag let's save this and refresh the page nothing appears to have been quite yet the next step is that within the opening audio tag let's put the word controls and see what this does so let's save reload and we now have this little control bar for our audio it doesn't appear to do anything quite yet everything's disabled there's a play button some time stamps and a volume bar we need to list an audio file as a source for this so between the audio tags we're going to use the source tag and within the source tag we're going to type this s our C double quotes and within the double quotes type in the name of the audio file that you want to link to this for me I was using that title bro time dot mp3 let's save this reload and look at that everything's filled in and no longer disabled so let's play this and give it a listen so there's also a volume bar to the sound and you can see that it's still playing not all versions of web browser support audio so it's good to write a message within your audio tag that displays a message such as your browser doesn't support audio in case somebody's browser doesn't support audio it's not going to display the audio controls or play the audio it's just going to display this message that lets the user know that's viewing your web page that basically their browser doesn't support audio here's a scenario let's say that the audio file you want to use is someplace else on your computer or in a different location besides the same folder that contains your HTML document for example I moved that audio file to my desktop since we moved that audio file it's no longer within that same folder that contains this HTML document and it can no longer link this as a source so we need to list the file path for where the audio file is located before the file name so for me it's currently on my desktop so what I'm gonna have to do since this is in a different folder I need to list the file path before this audio file name so let's save this and see if it works now here's a few tricks you can do with audio in HTML now if we were to fastforward to the very end of the song you will notice that it actually stops once the song is complete right in the opening audio tag if we use the keyword loop within it save this and then reload this song this audio file is going to loop through continuously let's try it out so I'm just gonna fast forward bear with me another option for our audio is that we can begin audio automatically being muted so we can use the muted keyword within the opening audio tag if we were to reload this page the volume is already muted by default and even if we were to hit the play button it's still going to be muted lastly for this topic I'm going to teach you guys about autoplay now I would actually not recommend using autoplay because if somebody visits your webpage and they're in a quiet or private location and then all of a sudden the webpage that they're on just starts blasting audio or music they're going to become fairly irritated but I'm gonna teach you guys how to do so anyways now within the opening audio tag just write the word autoplay within here now the audio will play regardless if the user wants it to or not autoplay doesn't work for some web browsers as well as mobile devices if I were to save this and reload I'm actually using Google Chrome it doesn't appear to work on Google Chrome so results may vary with autoplay so what I'm going to do is open this HTML document with our old friend Internet Explorer and I do have to allow blocked content so you can see that this model played as soon as we got to this web page I'm going to refresh this and it just keeps on autoplay and if you want to be really annoying just take out the controls for the audio then you end up with some nice background music that the user cannot stop allow blocked content that's user cannot stop this normally well that's the basics of using audio in HTML if you're looking for practice or a project to work on I have an idea let's create perhaps some sort of music website like iTunes but it's going to be the poor man's version of iTunes in fact I'm going to call it me tunes if you want to follow along with this download or locate a few audio files and put them in the same folder as your HTML document or someplace else but remember what the file path to get there was and if you need some mp3 files to download you can always go to YouTube's audio library and here you have free music and sound effects that you can use here are the names of the audio files that I'm using they're all mp3 city nightlights bro time block party and beat your competition if you have a few audio files picked out you're ready to start then so you can either clear out the document you're currently working on or start a new project let's create a title for this webpage and this will be called me Tunes it's the generic brand of iTunes so I'm just going to type in me tunes and use an h1 heading for this alright that's decent enough I'm going to use a brake line tag just so we can move down the line now what I think I'll do is that I will include the song title before the actual controls for the audio player so this first song that I'm going to be using is bro time alright and then I want the controls for the audio player to come right after this so after my text I'm going to use a pair of audio tags so I want an opening audio tag and a closing audio tag and I'm going to write the word controls within the opening audio tag yeah I think I'll move down a line after the title ok I like that better alright now we need to use the source tag between the audio tags and we need to list the source so we'll say SRC equals double quotes and then we need to place the name of the audio file that we want to use here so for me I was using bro underscore time dot mp3 and then just in case somebody somebody's web browser doesn't support audio we should probably leave a message that says your browser doesn't support audio let's see if this first one works all right so I'm going to organize this a little bit and let's repeat the same process for each of these songs so what I'm going to do is copy this and paste it and then make a few changes but I should probably add a break line after this just to give us some room alright so the next song that I plan on using is block party so I'll create a title block party and this was block underscore party dot mp3 it's basically the same thing is what we did up here alright so here's our second song good enough alright same process as what we did before so I'm going to copy this paste it and the next song was called City night lights and the source is City night lights dot mp3 except for me they were underscore between here here's the next song okay let's add just one more but you get the idea here and the last song was called beat your competition so I'm going to change the e title and we need to list that audio file as the source so beat underscore your underscore competition okay this is the last one then alright good enough but yeah that is the generic brand of iTunes that we just made called me Tunes it could use some work but we're on our way but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started working with audio files in HTML hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by
