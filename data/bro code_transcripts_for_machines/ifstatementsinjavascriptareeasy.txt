Hey so uh what's going on everybody today I gotta explain if statements so in JavaScript if a condition of our choosing is true we can execute some code if it's not true we can do something else that's how to put it simply for example let's say we have a user's age let age equals 25. to write a if statement we can type if a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces within the set of parentheses we can check a condition let's check to see if our age variable is greater than or equal to 18. if this condition is true we can execute whatever code is within the set of curly braces if this condition is true let's console.log a message you are old enough to enter this site my age is 25 this condition is true we will execute this code within the curly braces you are old enough to enter this site what if my age was 13. well if this condition is true we don't do this we don't execute it we skip over it if you would rather take a different course of action if you would rather do something else you can write an else clause if this is not true we will do whatever's within the else Clause let's display a different message you must be 18 plus 2 enter this site my age is 13. we will end up displaying you must be 18 plus to enter this site basically speaking if this condition is true do this else if not do this instead it's kind of like a fork in the road which path are we gonna take here's another example let's say we have variable time time will be in hours in military time if our time is 9 as in 9 am let's write a if statement if time is less than 12 as in noon then console DOT log good morning else if it's after 12 that means it's at least the afternoon console.log good afternoon the time is nine as in nine a.m good morning what if our time was 14 like 1400 in military time well then we will display good afternoon conditions also work very well with Boolean variables let's create a Boolean variable is student if you're a student say true if not then false now with the Boolean variable if you need to check the value with an if statement you can just place the Boolean variable within the condition itself the condition either evaluates to be true or false if is student is true then console.log Ura student else console.log you are not a student is student equals false we will execute the else Clause you are not a student If This Were true we'll execute the if Clause you are a student you can even create nested if statements this time we will have two variables let age equals some age and let has license as in a driver's license that's how to spell license has license will either be true or false so in the United States you need to be at least 16 years old to have your license we'll check that first if age is greater than or equal to 16 Plus console.log you are old enough to drive else console.log you must be 16 plus to have a license if I changed my age to 15 well I'm not old enough to have a license at least in the United States it might vary depending on your country let me know in the comments section how old you have to be to get a driver's license I'm kind of curious you can use another if statement within an if statement after we check to see if somebody is old enough to have a license let's check to see if they do have a license or not so I will add another if statement within our if statement pay attention to the indentation if has license since we're checking a Boolean variable that is going to be the condition itself it evaluates to be true or false if has license console.log you have your license else again pay attention to the indentation console.log you do not have your license yet my age is 15 I don't have a license this is the result you must be 16 plus to have your license since this condition is false we skip over everything within curly braces entirely if I set my age to be 18 you are old enough to drive but I don't have a license that's set to false you do not have your license yet so we execute this condition so we enter anything within this set of curly braces we display this message then check the sift statement my condition is false then we will execute the else clause if I set has license to be true well then you are old enough to drive you have your license all right now I need to discuss else if statements we will keep our age variable we have our if statement if age is greater than or equal to 18 then we will console.log you are old enough to enter this site else console.log you must be 18 plus to enter this site my age is 18 I can enter the site if my age was 12 I can't enter the site if there's any other conditions you want to check before reaching your else statement you can add an else if clause then you can check another condition let's check to see if somebody's age is less than zero your age can't be below zero let's let the user know console.log your age can't be below zero I will set my age to be negative one that's not possible your age can't be below zero since this condition is false we skip over this Clause then move on to the next condition else if this condition is true execute this clause which it was then it's not necessary to go to the else statement because we already executed one of these Clauses you can add as many else if statements as you would like let's add another else if let's check to see if somebody is over 100 years old age is greater than or equal to 100. console.log you are too old to enter this site okay now pay attention to this it's really important my age will be 101. you are old enough to enter this site so why didn't we execute this Clause our age is greater than or equal to 100 the order of our Clauses does matter we start at the top and work our way down and check all the conditions on the way down so with our first statement this if statement age is greater than or equal to 18 101 is greater than or equal to 18. we will execute this clause and skip over everything else that comes after even though this response is more appropriate for what we're looking for we still skip over it even though this is true because we executed this one first so I would recommend that we move this Clause to the beginning and change it to an if statement first let's check to see if age is greater than or equal to 100 else if age is greater than or equal to 18 so this should work as intended our age is 101 you are too old to enter the site let's add another else if Clause so to check to see if two values are equal you gotta use the comparison operator which is two equal signs let me give you a demonstration else if let's check to see if somebody's age is directly equal to zero so be sure you're using two equal signs for a comparison not one one equal sign is the assignment operator you want two equal signs to see if two values are equal if somebody's age is exactly zero will display a custom message you can't enter you were just born if somebody's age is zero they're a baby or an infant so let's set our age to be zero you can't enter you were just born this condition is false we skip this Clause this condition was true we execute this clause and Skip everything else that comes after using all this code let's work on an exercise we're going to create a text box and a button so somebody can submit their age then depending on what they enter we will display a message so within our HTML file we'll create a few things let's create a label the text on the label will be enter your age let's add a break after then a text box the label will be input the type will be text the ID will be my text I'll add a break we'll create a submit button button type equals submit the ID will be my submit the text on the button will be submit I will also create a paragraph element the ID let's say is result element to display a result all right that is everything we'll need so we can't see the paragraph element quite yet the text content of the result element will be one of these lines of text so let's go back to our index file we'll create our elements I will set them to be constants const my text equals document dot get element by ID the ID is going to be my text and const my submit that's the submit button document.getelementbyid the ID is going to be my submit then lastly result element const result element equals document.getelementbyid the ID is result element let's scoot these if statements down when I click on the button we will execute a function the button is named my submit my submit dot on click attribute equals a function when we click on the button what are we going to do let's take all of our if else if and else clauses cut them then paste them within the function for the button when we click on the button then we will check our age let's set this variable to be undefined then we will get our age from the text box H equals my text Dot value get the value from the text box and assign it to age but remember when we get text from a text box it's a string data type we need to Typecast it to a number so we will set age to equal then use the number function to convert it to a number then we can check our age we'll replace console.log with the text content of the result element result element dot text content equals our message I'll use a template literal so I'll use backticks let's copy our text paste it within the template literal then I will delete the console.log message so we'll just follow this pattern result element dot text content equals our message all right let's see if this works so we will type in our age let's say I'm 25 press submit and we have one problem let's see what's going on oops okay so I forgot to add a set of parentheses after the function let's add that let's say I'm 25 press submit you are old enough to enter this site let's say I'm 12 you must be 18 plus to enter the site what if I'm 101 you are too old to enter the site what if I'm zero you can't enter you were just born I'm negative one your age can't be below zero all right everybody so that is everything you need to know to get started working with if statements in JavaScript
