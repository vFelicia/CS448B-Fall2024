all right welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you all how we can add a video to a web page you'll need a video of one of these file types when i was in tokyo some number of years ago i saw a reallife mario kart racing down the street so what i'm going to do is place this mp4 file next to my index.html file and then within vs code we need a video element and we will list the src attribute equal to the name of our file that we're working with and in my case it's racing.mp4 now this video is massive so let's change the width of this using the width attribute width equals what about 500 that's a lot better but we'll need some controls to actually play this video i'm clicking on this and nothing's happening controls is a boolean attribute we only have to list the attribute name to add controls there we go we now have some controls now if you want this to play maybe in the background and you do not want controls you can always set this to autoplay but we have no way to stop this so i'm going to add the controls back if you need this muted just add the muted boolean attribute so it's playing but we can't hear anything and if you need this to loop just add the loop boolean attribute and this should loop yeah there it is here's another thing that we can try let's get rid of our source attribute and we're going to create a video closing tag and we will create nested sources within our video element source src equals our video file so just in case your browser doesn't support an mp4 video file you can always create another source let's say that we have a web m file as a backup just in case that this browser doesn't support an mp4 file and if for some reason that no other sources work you can always add a note this browser does not support html5 audio so you can write it either way but if you have multiple sources you can always have backups just in case this primary source doesn't work so yeah everybody that's how to add a video to a webpage if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
