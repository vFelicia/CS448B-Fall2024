hello again friends it's me again today I will show you how we can create both a header and a footer for your web page header and footer elements are both semantic tags they describe their meaning to both the web browser and the developer they help organize your content and CSS properties can easily be applied to anything within these containers headers are used for introductory content at the top of your page such as a title a subtitle a logo a navigation bar but we haven't really discussed navigation bars yet Footers act as a container for holding concluding content at the bottom of your page such as an author a copyright or some contact information like a phone number or email alright so let's begin to create a header within our body we need a pair of header tags then for a footer you need a pair of footer tags personally what I like to do between the header and footer tags I'll create a pair of main tags for all of the main content within our web page it helps with organization we'll begin with the header though the header element is a container for holding introductory content at the top of our page this is where you may see a title like an H1 header element for our H1 header I think welcome to pick your name or your business or organization I'll just use my YouTube channel name a header is a good container to hold the title for your web page you could include a logo or a navigation bar navigation bars are a little tricky we do need to know a little bit more CSS for navigation bars but let's include some hyperlinks and make like a really basic navigation bar okay href equals I won't set a location it's not really necessary for this example we'll just have a hyperlink that goes nowhere so we have home let's create three more hyperlinks home about us products and contact us the header of your document it also tends to be a good place to hold navigation links to then to make this a little more fancy I'm going to add a horizontal rule with a selfclosing HR tag okay that's not bad another use of header and footer elements is that it makes CSS styling a little bit easier I haven't yet shown how we can apply CSS style sheets we're going to use a little bit of inline CSS all I'll do is change the background Dash color to be whatever color you want I'll pick medium purple anything within the header I would like to change the background color to purple or you could change the font or the font size anything else it's very helpful to put your content within a container So within my main section I'll include an image I do have one ready feel free to follow along if you want within my main element let's begin with the title for the main content I'm going to use a smaller heading like H4 what would be a good title for the main content check out these cool moves maybe I'll use a colon I'll include an image we need a selfclosing image tag The Source will equal the name of my file including the extension and it is good practice to add some alternative text profile pic is good so there's my image then I'll add some text within a paragraph we need a pair of P tags I'll generate some sample text in vs code you can type lorem then tab and here are some sample text so that is the main content of my page lastly let's work on the footer the footer is a container for holding concluding content at the bottom of your page I'll begin with a horizontal rule because I think that looks good let's include some information about the author author colon type in your name I'll add a line break after so we have author then a copyright symbol using HTML to include the copyright symbol you can Type ampersand copy semicolon so we have a copyright symbol I'll add the text copy right reserved then add a break then I'll add an email this will be a link we need an anchor tag set the href attribute to be mail to colon then an email address I'll make one up bro code at fake.com close the anchor tag then I need some text bro code at fake.com feel free to use your own email I'll make my email a little bit smaller by using a pair of small tags so I enclose our hyperlink with small there we are and I'll change the background color to with the style attribute within the opening footer tag I will paste that style attribute I'll pick the same color of medium purple alright everybody so those are headers and Footers they help organize your content as well as make applying CSS a little bit easier because you can Target everything within the header or footer elements and those are headers and Footers in HTML
