how's it going everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how we can swap two variables using Java let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright well here we got two variables we got variable X which contains water and variable Y which I'm gonna put koolaid in more specifically black cherry koolaid so let's just put this in good enough and let's mix it perfect so we're going to create two variables and these are going to be of the string datatype so we'll have string x equals the word water and string y equals the word koolaid and then let's display these with a simple print line statement and within here I'll just type in X colon space plus the variable X and then let's do the same thing for y so we'll change X to Y and let's display these so X currently has water and Y currently has koolaid so what happens if we set X to equal Y well we get koolaid for both x and y okay we're gonna assign variable Y to variable X shit so yeah it looks like we have koolaid in both variable X and variable Y let's try again maybe we can set Y to equal X no we just got water everywhere let's try this again we're gonna assign variable X to variable Y this time okay that doesn't seem to work guys my floor is getting really sticky so it appears that we're going to have to store one of these values within another variable in order to switch these so one thing though we can do is introduce another variable and let's call this temp and temp is empty let's create another string so we'll create string temp and we can either set this to null or can assign no value at all where we simply just declared temp a variable so what we're gonna do is actually take X and store X whatever value isn't here within temp so we're gonna type temp equals x so now X can be filled with something so we're going to fill it with variable Y so on our next line we're going to set X to equal Y then we're going to take our temp variable and store this within Y and lastly y equals temp breaking news ladies and gentlemen we have switched the contents of X and white with the help of our variable temp now back to you bro thank you for the live update news anchor bro it appears on our end that we have also switched the contents of X and y as well so in conclusion if the programming language you're using doesn't have any direct function to switch to variables you could do this manually and you can create another variable such as temp and temp is a temporary value to temporarily store one of these values you can set temp to equal X or you can do this with Y and then set X to equal Y and then Y to equal temp so your assignment for today is to post two variables in the comments down below and the code that you used to swap them and that ladies and gentlemen is how you can swap two variables hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
