hey again everybody it's me and in today's topic I'm going to explain the get and post variables in PHP get and post are both special variables technically they're super Global variables but that's a topic for another day just think of them as special variables for now these variables are used to collect data from an HTML form if you have an opening form tag in HTML you can use the action attribute then send some data to some PHP file whatever you list here there's two different methods get and post they each have their own advantages and disadvantages which we'll discuss later for the time being before our PHP script let's create an HTML document in vs code to do that you would type exclamation point then hit tab then be sure to follow our HTML document with a PHP script then I'm going to open up a web browser in our HTML document we're going to create a form a user is going to type in a username a password then to log in they're going to a login button let's create that we'll need a label to begin with we'll need to close the label I'll add a line break the label will say user name then we'll add a text box use the input tag it's a selfclosing tag add a line break within the input tag we will set the type to equal text because it's a text box then we will set the name to be user name let's copy our label and our text box paste these two lines again but change username to password this time the type will be password the name will be password so you can type something into your username if you were to type within the password box it should be hidden which is good then lastly We'll add a button we'll use a selfclosing input tag the type will be submit it's a submit button the value is the text on the button let's set that to be a log in so we have a button but it currently doesn't do anything we will enclose all of our elements within a form tag be sure to open it then close it I will indent all of this within my opening form tag I will set the action attribute to be a file in which I want to send this data to I will send this data to the PHP script of the same file so my file is index.php I will list that here index.php if you had a separate PHP file you would just change the file name to reflect that or the file path then we will set the method attribute to be either get or post we'll begin with get so let's type in a username make up a password and this still doesn't do anything within our PHP script we're going to utilize the get variable because we're using the get method let's Echo then type dollar sign underscore the word get so get is a special type of variable it can hold more than one value if you're familiar with arrays it's technically an array within get we have both a username and a password I would like just the username to get just the username after the get variable add a set of square brackets then within a set of quotes type in the name of the information you're getting I would like the username let's see what happens I'm going to save type in a username make up a password log in and there's my username now let's do this with the password as well Echo get password so let's refresh everything I'll make up a username type in a password there's my username there's my password I'm going to put my password on a new line I need a line break there's a couple different ways in which we can do this you can use some string concatenation one way to do that is to type dot followed by a line break within quotes I'll do that for the second line as well so that would work my preferred method is to do something like this I'm going to surround my get variable with quotes then add a set of curly braces around our get variable then add a line break bro make up a password log in there we are if using the get variable and you need to add a line break this is my preferred way although there's more than one way use whatever suits you now with get we have one problem if we were to take a look at the URL of this document when using the get method of a form any data sent over to a PHP form is appended to the URL username equals bro and password equals pizza123 there's no security because we're appending some sensitive information such as a password to the URL that's where post comes in I will change the method to post let's see what happens I'll type in my first name make up a password and login so we have an undefined array key if you're using the post method let's change get to be post make up a username type in a password log in there's my username there's my password and if I were to take a look at the URL my sensitive data isn't appended to the URL the post method is more secure than get but they each have their own advantages and disadvantages with the get method data is appended to the URL it's not secure I wouldn't pass any like usernames or passwords using a get method there's a character limit however with the get method bookmarking a page with values as possible get requests can be cached get tends to be better for a search page now with post data is packaged inside the body of the HTTP request it's more secure than get there's no data limit Pages involving a post request can't be bookmarked and the requests are not cached post tends to be better for submitting credentials like a username and a password any sensitive information so if security matters use post if it doesn't get might be better now let's cover an exercise let's clear our PHP form then within the body of our document we will create an order page for a restaurant we will Begin by creating a form we'll need a pair of form tags then be sure to close it within my opening form tag I will set the action attribute to be a file or a file location I will send this data to my index.php file for the method let's use post for my order form let's create a text box for a quantity I'll create a label I'll close it right away let's change the text to quantity then I'll add a line break we'll add a text box input the type is text the name will be quantity we'll use the input tag set the type attribute to B submit then value equals how about total we're calculating a total now within my PHP script let's say we have a food item I'll create a variable item equals make up some food like pizza we'll need a price price equals make up a price 5.99 sounds good then a quantity whatever the user is going to type in that is found within the post variable dollar sign underscore post add a set of square brackets semicolon within the square brackets I would like the quantity now this is a personal choice what I like to do is that if I'm accessing the get or post super variable I like to store the result within a local variable so I'm going to create a quantity variable quantity equals whatever our quantity is from our HTML form I find caching one of these values within a local variable more convenient to work with so let's Echo a message like an order total you have ordered let's use our quantity to T X what's our item pizzas item I'll add s because it may be plural then we'll calculate a total Echo you know what let's create a total variable as well total I'll set that to be null because we'll assign a value later total equals quantity times variable price then we'll Echo your total is add a placeholder our variable total then I will precede our placeholder with the dollar sign but we need to use that escape sequence all right let's save everything enter in a quantity I want three pizzas oh we need a line break as well you have ordered three x pizzas your total is 17.97 and if I were to look at the URL we're using the post method so our quantity is not going to be appended to the URL if I were to use get let's replace post with get do that here as well I'm going to type in three pizzas again hit total I can change the url to reflect a different quantity like maybe I want 30 pizzas then resubmit you have ordered 30 pizzas the grand total is 179.70 that's one of the reasons why post is more secure than get you can change the url to reflect a different value alright everybody so that is both the get and post variables in PHP if you're enjoying my Series
