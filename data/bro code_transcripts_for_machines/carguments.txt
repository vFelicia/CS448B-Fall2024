hey yeah what's going on people so let's talk about arguments and parameters i have a function named birthday which we discussed in the previous video this will print two lines of text happy birthday dear x you are y years old what i would like to do is replace x with a user's name and y with a user's age so here's how we can write a program like that so let's begin by within the main function declaring two variables a character array named name and assign this your first name and an age and this will be of the int data type and let's say that this will be age and make up some age i like to think that i'm still 21 years old okay so if i try and display a name and age you think this would work right so i'm going to use a format specifier then s to display a string and then i will display our name variable and with y let's display our age so let's use d for our format specifier to display an integer and we will display age now here's the problem you can see that we have some red underlines name is undeclared as well as age here's the deal functions can't see inside of other functions our birthday function is unaware of our name and age variables one way in which we can make our birthday function aware of these is to pass them as arguments when we invoke the birthday function so based on the last topic on functions i mentioned that when we call a function we type the function's name followed by a set of parentheses i like to imagine the set of parentheses as a pair of telephones and these two functions are talking to each other our main function needs to make our birthday function aware of our name and edge variables so what we can do is pass these variables as arguments so between the parentheses we can add our variables separated with a comma so let's pass name and age so anything that you're passing to a function are known as arguments but we need a matching set of parameters within the function declaration so between this set of parentheses we will list our name and age variables but precede each with the data type that we're working with so we have name and age so age is an integer so precede the variable name with int and name is a character array so we're going to precede name with char and then add a set of straight brackets after so these are parameters parameters are what this function needs in order to be executed so this does work happy birthday dear bro you are 21 years old so with parameter setup you can only call this function if you pass a character array as well as an integer if i were to remove these arguments we can no longer call this birthday function error too few arguments to function birthday so when you call a function you can pass some arguments but you need a matching set of parameters and the names of these parameters don't necessarily have to be the same what's important is the order of the arguments and the data type so let's say name is x and age is y so let's replace that here as well and that would work too so yeah those are arguments and parameters arguments are what you're sending a function parameters are what a function expects when it's invoked and the benefits of arguments and parameters is that these functions can talk to each other because functions can't see inside of one another so if you have some variables within a function you can pass them to another function as arguments so yeah those are arguments and parameters if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments section down below and well yeah those are arguments and parameters in c
