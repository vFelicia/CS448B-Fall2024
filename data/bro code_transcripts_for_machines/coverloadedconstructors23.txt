hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing overloaded constructors in C++ and at the end of this video we're going to be creating a project where we're going to be ordering some pizzas so let's get into it before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm everyone so this video is dedicated to overloaded constructors and just as a quick reminder a constructor is defined as a special function that is automatically called when an object is instantiated and this is useful for assigning arguments to variables right away when we create an object of some sort so a good example of this would be pizza objects pizzas have varying amounts of ingredients so I have for example for different pizza constructors here and this is legal you can reuse the same constructor name as long as there are different sets of parameter setup so for the first constructor I have four string parameters set up a bread a sauce a cheese and a topping the third just has three a bread a sauce and a cheese then two a bread and a sauce and lastly just a bread so we can create pizza objects and we will use a matching constructor when we instantiate an object depending on how many ingredients we send our constructor so let's actually work on a program where we're going to construct some pizzas and order them so to begin let's create a pizza class so class pizza but make sure you spell it right because I didn't and then we'll want to make these members public so we can access them from our main method so we'll create the first pizza constructor honestly I shouldn't have deleted everything but too late I already did so we'll pass in a string bread string sauce string cheese and string topping and then what we'll do is just assign these values right away so this bread equals whatever bread we receive and we'll do the same thing for sauce cheese and topping all right now we'll actually want to declare these variables so we're going to do that before our constructors so string bread but we're not going to assign them string sauce string cheese and string topping all right so this is our first constructor but I misspelled sauce there so this is our first constructor we can actually create another constructor with different parameters so I'm just going to copy this and paste it we're going to get rid of our topping and then we'll get rid of this line too we'll copy this and make another constructor so this one's just going to be bread and sauce and the last one is just bread okay we have our constructors made up so let's create an order function maybe we'll call this order pizza and this doesn't return anything so we'll put void here all right let me think of something okay I thought of an idea we're going to display a message that says here is your then list all of the ingredients that are not empty and then just add the word pizza at the end kind of like somebody's delivering it to us or we're delivering it to somebody so within our order pizza function here we will just see out here is your and then the next step is we're going to check to see if our bread is not empty so if bread dot empty function but we're going to put the not logical operator here so if our bread is not empty what we'll do is see out whatever our bread variable is and then maybe we'll just add a dash after it now we're going to do the same thing for sauce then cheese and then what was it topping at the end yeah so if sauce is not empty well display whatever the sauce is same thing for cheese and lastly topping all right and then we'll just add the word pizza at the end so see out pizza but maybe I should turn this last one into his space then end of line okay we're good to go then let's construct some pizza objects now to instantiate an object we first need to list the class as the data type so this is going to be a pizza object and you can see that we have it right here for the class name so next we need a name for this pizza let's call this maybe first underscore pizza and then we can pass in some ingredients as arguments so let's pass in a type of bread so maybe thick crust and let's pass in a sauce I'm not sure what the standard sauce Pizza uses it's some sort of red sauce it's a mystery to many and then what about mozzarella I'm probably misspelling that I always do and then you know what that's it let's just stick with these three ingredients and then we'll call the order pizza function so we'll type in the name of our pizza first underscore pizza and then we will order pizza and let's run this okay here is your thick crust red sauce mozzarella pizza now let's create a second pizza with different ingredients now so pizza I'll call this second pizza and I want flat bread and I don't know Alfredo and that's it and then we will order our second pizza so ii underscore pizza order pizza function here is your flatbread alfredo pizza now that's one of the benefits of using overloaded constructors is that they allow us to instantiate different objects with varying arguments and this works great for constructing pizza objects because pizzas can have varying different types or amounts of ingredients depending on the pizza so for the first pizza this has three arguments and the second one has two now if we were to take these out and we only had this one constructor that needed four ingredients well this actually wouldn't work anymore because if we were to construct a pizza we need at least four ingredients but if we put these back in we can have between one to four ingredients but you know you can have more than this two you can have a pizza constructor with five ingredients six ingredients so on and so forth well that's the basics of overloaded constructors so if you would like a copy of all the code here I'll post this in the comments down below if you're looking for additional practice then your assignment is to create a set of overloaded constructors and then post it in the comments but yeah that is the basics of overloaded constructors in C++ hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if
