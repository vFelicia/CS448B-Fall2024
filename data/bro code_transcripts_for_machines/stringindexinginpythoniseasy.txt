hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain string indexing indexing allows us to access the elements of a sequence using a set of square brackets also known as the indexing operator using this set of square brackets following a string there are up to three fields that we can fill in we can access a starting point in the string and ending point add a step here's an example suppose we have a credit card number credit number equals and I'll just make up some number one two three four dash 567890123456 good enough if I need the first character within the string I can type the name of my string variable followed by the indexing operator which is a set of square brackets the first position has an index of zero computers always start with zero so that's why the first index is zero then I'm going to go ahead and print this print credit card number at index of zero that would be one if I were to change the index to B1 0 1 that should be two index two would technically be three then four is the dash within our string as you can see here with the indexing operator there's up to three fields that we can fill in a start and a step if you have just one field listed without any colons it's assumed you're filling in the starting position so now what if you would like the first four digits of the string well we would type the name of our string variable indexing operator we'll need a starting index colon then an ending index the first four digits would be zero colon 4. then I will print this and I'm just going to turn this first line into a comment yeah there we go we have the first four digits of our credit card number one two three four just so you know with the ending Index this index is exclusive this first number would be zero one two three four so we did not include that Dash within the number the starting index is inclusive the ending index is exclusive so you can omit the zero in the beginning you could just say colon 4 python assumes the starting position will be the beginning of the string so that would work too let's get the next set of digits five six seven eight credit number indexing operator let's find where the starting index would be zero one two three four five colon six seven eight nine then we will print whatever is here the next set of digits is five six seven eight maybe we need the last 12 digits well what we could do in that case we will take our string variable credit number set the starting index to be let's see zero one two three four five colon if you need everything up to the end of the string you don't need to list an ending index just be sure to add that colon python then assumes you need everything up to the end of the string so I will print whatever we have then we should have everything besides the first four digits yep five six seven eight nine zero one two three four five six you could also use a negative index credit number if you need the last character in a string you would set the index to be negative one then I will print this print credit number at index of negative one that would be six negative two is five negative 3 is 4. negative four is three and then negative five would be that Dash right here yeah you can use negative indexes too let's talk about step using the step field we can access the characters in a string by a given step we can count by twos or we can count by threes so here's an example so let's take our credit number if we're not filling in the starting or ending Fields but we need a step we would need two colons then python is assuming everything from the beginning of the string to the end then our step will be two this will print every second character within our string yeah here we are we have one three dash six eight nine one so on and so forth if I were to change the step to three we would count every third character beginning with one four six dash one three six all right here's a practical example let's create a program to get the last four digits of a credit card number I'm going to assign this to a new variable last digits equals our credit number indexing operator so we need the last four digits where would the starting index begin well we could use negative indexing this last digit is negative one negative two negative 3 negative four we will begin at negative four colon we can omit the ending index python assumes we need the rest of the string then really that's all we need so let's print I'll use an F string uh maybe some x's maybe we're hiding somebody's credit card number except the last four digits okay then variable last digits all right and here's our credit card number where only the last four digits are visible hey you know what let's add one more exercise let's reverse the characters in The String I'm going to reassign credit number equals credit number if we need the entire string we don't necessarily need a starting index or an ending index but for the step this will be negative negative one will reverse a string then let's print whatever our new credit card number is print credit number and yeah there is our credit number backwards to reverse a string you set the step to be negative one so yeah everybody that is string indexing in Python we can access elements of a sequence using the indexing operator which is a set of straight brackets you can list a starting position ending position and even a step if you need to skip over characters but yeah that is string indexing in Python
