hey uh what's going on everybody i thought in this video we could create a simple calculator program in c for practice let's begin by declaring all of the different variables that we'll need we'll need a character to store an operator so are we going to add subtract multiply or divide we'll need double num1 double num2 and double result let's ask the user what type of operation they would like to use enter an operator so we can use addition subtraction multiplication or division and we will use scanf to accept some user input if we're accepting a character the format specifier is c and we will use the address of operator the name of our variable we would like to store some user input into then let's accept num1 enter number one then scanf the format specifier for a double is lf num1 okay do the same thing with number two replace one with two then to examine our operator let's use a switch switch and we will examine our operator for any matching cases let's add a default case because i might forget to add this later so if a user does not enter in anything that has a matching case one of these four symbols let's print a message let's say that our operator is not valid our first case will be edition so case addition result equals num1 plus num2 and let's display our result result and the format specifier for a double is lf and then at the end of your case you should break to break out of the switch then we can copy this paste it and then change any plus to minus then do the same thing with multiplication and lastly division and that is it so let's try this enter an operator i would like to add enter number one four point two zero plus 3.14 that is 7.34 and you can limit the amount of digits after the decimal that is displayed if you would like to adjust that with the format specifier with result type dot then the amount of digits you would like to display so i'm just going to go ahead and change that real quick okay so by adding 0.2 to our format specifier this will only display it two digits after the decimal but you can keep it the original way if you'd like okay let's subtract so minus 4.20 minus 3.14 is 1.06 okay multiplication 3.14 times 4.20 is 13.19 and lastly division 3.14 divided by 4.20 is 0.75 and we do have a default case if there are no matching cases let's type in a character besides one of these four symbols how about i don't know a dollar sign unfortunately we still need to enter into numbers and then this states our operator is not valid so yeah everybody that is a very simple calculator program in c if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post a copy in the comments section down below so this calculator can add subtract multiply and divide there are four cases but you can expand upon this if you'd like so yeah everybody that was a very simple calculator program in c
