hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to show you how we can handle basic file detection using python this topic is the first of many involving a minseries on file handling using python first we'll need to cover file detection before we read and write files to work with files using python we will import the OS module OS means operating system this module provides a way for python programs to interact with the operating system be sure to import the OS module at the top for my demonstration within my project folder I'm going to create a new file new file I will name this file test and this will be a plain text file it will have the file extension of txt this file really doesn't need to say anything I'm just going to type I like pizza because I do the context doesn't matter we're not going to be reading files in this video for convenience I'm going to assign a variable of file path this will be a string for file detection we can either use a relative file path or an absolute file path we'll cover relative file paths first these two files are right next to each other my main python file and my test file if we're using a relative file path I only need the file name including the extension test.txt we'll be passing in this string of file path as an argument to check to see if this file exists exists I will use an if statement if access the OS module access the path there is a builtin method of exists we'll pass in our file path as the argument this method returns a Boolean value of true or false if this file exists so if this file does exist test.txt let's print the following I'll use an F string the location I'll add a placeholder exists I will place my file path within that placeholder and I'll surround it with single quotes to make it look nice if this method returns true do this else we'll do something else I will print that location doesn't exist all right let's see what happens the location test.txt exists now what if I get the extension wrong let's say that I'm looking for a PDF but it's really a txt file well that location doesn't exist you do have to be sure to get the file extension correct what if this file was in a folder within my python project I will create a new directory I will name this directory stuff then I will place my test file within the stuff folder py charm wants me to refactor my code because the location changed I'm not going to do that I'm going to be sure that this box is unchecked and press refactor we're using a relative file path that test file is no longer next to my main python file here's what happens that location doesn't exist with our relative file path we'll have to navigate to our stuff folder then find the test file so preceding this file name I will access the stuff folder stuff SL the name of the file test.txt and now we can locate that file the location stuff SL test exists when working with relative file paths you may need to open up a folder then find your file you also could work with absolute file paths so for this demonstration on my desktop I'm going to create a new file new text document test if I were to look at the properties this is a txt file a text document I'm going to copy the location within my file path I will paste it then list the name of the file test. TX T this is an absolute file path one problem we're running into when working with strings a backs slash does serve as an escape sequence python thinks we're trying to print a tab character we can solve this with double back slashes or we could use a forward slash either one works all right let's see if that file exists that does the location of that absolute file path does exist if I were to get the extension wrong let's say this is a PDF well that location doesn't exist there is a builtin method of is file to check to see if that file is in fact a file and not a directory let's add the following after we detect this file we'll write a nested if statement if os. paath do is file then pass in our file path as an argument if this file is in fact a file and not a directory I will print that is a file the location of that absolute file path does exist that is a file what if it was a directory a folder I'm going to delete this go to new folder I will name this folder test to check to see if a location is a directory let's add an elseif statement else if os. paath do is D meaning is directory this is a method we'll pass in our file path if this is a directory a folder I will print that is a directory let's run this again that location doesn't exist oh we have to get rid of the file extension it is not a plain text file the location of that absolute file path exists that is a directory a folder all right everybody that's basic file detection in the next few videos we're going to be reading and writing files and well everybody that is basic file detection using python
