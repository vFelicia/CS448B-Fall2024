yeah what's going on everybody so today I need to explain arithmetic operators because well programming can sometimes involve a lot of math operands are values variables Etc in this equation 11 x and 5 are all operands operators they can include but are not limited to addition subtraction multiplication and division in this equation the addition sign would be the operator so there's a few things you should know regarding arithmetic operators in JavaScript so let's begin let's pretend that in the scenario we are a teacher we have a group of students let students equals what's a good class size maybe 30 students then I will console DOT log my students variable and it should be 30. let's say that a new student joins the class and I need to change this variable to increase students by one I can say students equals this will reassign my variable equals the current value of students plus one now we have 31 students now for subtraction that is the minus sign to subtract a student we can reassign our variable students equals students minus one now we have 29 then we have multiplication which is represented by an asterisk we will double the number of students we have students equal students asterisk 2 to multiply by 2. we have 60 students division is a forward slash we will split our class of students into two students divided by two we now have 15. all right then we have exponents exponents is represented by double asterisks what is students to the power of two 900 students that is a very large class maybe it's a lecture or something in a college so students to the power of three that would be students to the power of three would be twenty seven thousand double asterisks is the exponent operator here's another helpful one it is the modulus operator it gives you the remainder of any division so let's say we are going to divide our class into two so modulus which is represented as a percent sign two well 30 divides by 2 evenly so the remainder is zero if we had a class of 31 students well there's one remainder one student students modulus 3 would divide my class of 31 students into three we would still have one student remaining since we're reassigning students we would be replacing 31 students with the value of one if you're using the modulus operator I would recommend creating a separate variable entirely let extra students equal our students modulus 3. we have one extra student just one okay that is the modulus operator there is a shortcut for writing these Expressions because it can be kind of tedious to write the variable name twice so let's set students back to 30. I will console.log students we'll use what is known as augmented assignment operators to increase students by a number if we're reassigning it we can say students plus equals one or some other number students is now 31 if I were to change 1 to B2 it's now 32 and 33. let's do the same thing with subtraction students minus equals one we now have 29 students multiplication students times equals to that would give us 60 students students divided by equals to we have 15 students all right then exponents students to the power of equals two 900 students then modulus students modulus equals two we have no remaining students 30 divides by two evenly so another place where modulus could be helpful is if you're determining if a number is even a odd 30 is an even number divided by 2 the remainder is 0. 31 is odd the remainder is 1. there's also the increment and decrement operator there's a couple different ways to add one to a variable but you should be aware of all of them to increase a variable by only one you can take the name of the variable then add plus plus plus plus is the increment operator 30 incremented by one is ThirtyOne then there is the decrement operator which is minus minus 30 decremented by 1 is 29. all right then lastly we're going to cover operator precedence this is pretty important given a very complex equation such as this example in which order do you solve each part of this equation so with operator precedence beginning with the left working our way to the right you would solve anything with parentheses then exponents multiplication and division and modulo otherwise known as modulus then lastly addition and subtraction let's go through this step by step let's see what the results variable is I will console.log result so the result is 23. so if we were to walk through this step by step let's solve anything with parentheses starting from the left and then working our way to the right there are no parentheses we can skip this step next is exponents there is one exponent here so we would solve 4 to the power of 2 which is 16. then we will solve multiplication and division and modulus that's addition we skip that we have multiplication two times three is six there is no more multiplication division or modulus then lastly addition and subtraction one plus six is seven seven plus sixteen is our result of 23. all right I'll give you a few more exercises how about this equation the result is going to be six so there's no parentheses no exponents we do have a modulus operator here so we solve that first 12 modulus 5 gives us a remainder of two we have some division we would solve that next eight divided by 2 is 4 then addition and subtraction the result is six all right here's a challenge round the result is going to be .0468 we solve anything with parentheses first two plus five that is seven then exponents 2 to the power of seven I might need a calculator two times two three four five six seven that's 128. then we have 6 divided by 128 then we have six divided by 128 which is point zero four six eight seven five and that is our result all right everybody so that is everything you need to know about arithmetic operators you have operands which are values and variables in arithmetic expression and operators there's also augmented assignment operators which is a shortcut to writing these equations if you're going to reassign a variable then you have increment and decrement operators to increase a variable by one or decrease it by one then with operator precedence if you're solving a complex equation you solve each part of the equation following this order and well that is everything you need to know regarding arithmetic operators and JavaScript
