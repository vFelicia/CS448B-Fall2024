hey friends it's me again today I'm going to explain keyword arguments a keyword argument is an argument preceded by an identifier it has a few benefits it helps with readability and the Order of the arguments doesn't matter if they're keywords keyword arguments are one of four basic styles of arguments we discuss positional default then next we'll discuss arbitrary but today we'll be focusing on keyword suppose I have a function to display a message like a greeting I will name this function the hello function we will need a greeting a title Mr Mrs doctor a first name then a last name all I'm going to do within this function is print an upstring I will print my greeting the user's title first name last name then to invoke the hello function I will need to pass in four arguments a greeting a title a first name and a last name so for my greeting let's say hello the title will be Mr the first name will be SpongeBob last name SquarePants so you know this does work we're currently using positional arguments the position of these arguments does matter so what if I were to switch these around we have hello SpongeBob SquarePants followed by Mr hello SpongeBob SquarePants mister an optional feature when sending arguments to a function is that we could turn these into keyword arguments prefix any arguments with the name of the parameter followed by equals title equals Mr first equal SpongeBob last equal SquarePants then with these keyword arguments the order really doesn't matter maybe we move the first name to the end and the Stillwood printout is the same thing we have title first name last name if you're mixing and matching positional arguments and keyword arguments you want to be sure that the positional arguments are first so if I was to move the string our greeting to the end well this technically wouldn't work we have a syntax error positional arguments follow keyword arguments so make sure any positional arguments are first before using any keyword arguments two helpful benefits of using keyword arguments is that it helps with readability and the Order of the arguments doesn't matter we know what this argument is as well as these two title last name first name let's say we have a first name and a last name John James these two names kind of sound like first names is our first name John or is it James we could use keyword arguments to clarify which is which you thought John was the first name but it's actually the last name and the first name is James then our title is still the same hello Mr James John let's cover another example I'm going to print the numbers 1 through 10 using a for Loop 4 x in range 1 comma 11 because the second argument is exclusive then I will print X after each print statement we print a new line do you remember in previous topics how we would follow our print statement with comma and then a new character such as a space while end is a keyword argument found within the builtin print statement in place of ending each print statement with a new line we are using this keyword argument of end and sending it to be a space another one is separate that's found within the print statement maybe we have some numbers they're all separate strings the numbers one through five I can use the separate keyword argument then separate each of these strings with a given character or characters I will separate each of these strings with a dash a lot of builtin functions such as the print function they have some keyword arguments you can use let's go over an exercise now we're going to create a function to generate a phone number but we'll need to pass in a country code area code the first three digits in the last four digits let's define this function as Define get phone to get a phone number we have a country code area code first meeting first few digits then last meaning last few digits we will return an F string we will place our country code first Dash then our area code Dash the first few digits Dash the last few digits my phone number phone num equals I will invoke the get phone number function we just created but we'll need a country code an area code first few digits then last few digits and remember the order doesn't necessarily matter usually I try and be consistent with the order of the parameters make up a phone number I'm in the United States my country code is one area code one two three the next few digits will be four five six the last few will be seven eight nine zero then let's print this phone number print phone num and here's my phone number although you can change it up based on how you do phone numbers in your country this is typically how you would see a phone number in the United States alright everybody so those are keyword arguments they are just arguments preceded by an identifier that matches the name of a function's parameters it does help with readability and the Order of the arguments doesn't matter when invoking a function it could be helpful to identify some of these arguments and well everybody those are keyword arguments in Python
