hey everybody today we will be creating a program to mimic a concession stand much like what you would see at a movie theater we will be utilizing a dictionary to keep track of a menu item and an Associated price more or less this is just a program to help us get used to working with dictionaries let's begin we'll create a dictionary named menu what items are on the menu we'll need an item and a price I'll think of some I'm going to speed up this video feel free to pause if you need more time and here's my menu everybody I thought of a few food items you might find at a movie theater concession stand pizza nachos popcorn fries chips soft pretzels soda lemonade movie theater popcorn is really expensive for some reason okay we have our menu a user is going to select specific keys from this menu depending on what the key is we can get the associated value to calculate a total to keep track of the user selected items I will create an empty list named cart I will also declare a variable named to Total to keep track of the total we need to lay this dictionary down flat to display it to a user well we do have the items method of a dictionary which we covered in the last video for every key value in our dictionary menu dot items method the items method of our dictionary will return a key and a value during each iteration I'm simply going to print every key and value I'll use an F string I will print every key colon space then a value let's take a look so far here's our menu I'll make a few changes the price will be in dollars and cents but feel free to pick your own unit of currency I'll precede my value with the dollar sign then using a format specifier I will display two decimal places 0.2 f that's better I will line up all the keys after the key I will add a format specifier then allocate 10 spaces yeah look at that it's all lined up now before and after displaying our menu with this for loop I will add some decorative text let's say menu then outside of the for Loop I'll display a bunch of dashes yeah look at that let's move on to the next step we will ask a user for some input what item would they like to buy from the menu while our condition will be true if our condition is set to True we'll need to break out of this Loop one way or another we will ask for some user input food equals input select an item Q2 quit if food is equal to a lowercase Q then we will break Let's test it select an item Pizza nachos soda Q to quit yeah it works okay what if the user types in capital Q well we can't escape the while loop if a user types in capital Q we're assuming that they would like to quit when we accept our user input I'm going to add dot lower method this will take our user input and make it all lowercase so we should be able to acknowledge any uppercase letters yeah it works cool let's add an elseif statement what if a user types in an item that's not on our menu well there is a get method of dictionaries if menu dot get pass in our food which is user input if the user selection is not within our menu as a key it will return none so we can use that else if menu dot get food is not none then we would like to append that food item to our cart cart dot append our food item so outside of the while loop I'm going to print our cart temporarily just to test it okay select an item Pizza soda pretzel how about a potato cuticquit we have our pizza soda and pretzel but not our potato we don't want that in our cart because that's not on the menu yeah you can just add that line else if menu item dot get food is not none that will complete our while loop let's calculate a total for every food in our cart let's take our total variable set this equal to total plus then we need a value associated with a key Plus menu dot get method get the food item found within our cart but I'm going to shorten this to Total plus equals menu dot get the value associated with this food in our cart I will also display that food item print food I'm going to avoid printing our food item on every line I will set the ending character in our print statement just to be a space okay let's see what we have so far I would like popcorn soda pretzel cue to quit popcorn soda pretzel then we will display the total I will print a new line print I'll use an upstring total is add a unit of currency total I'll add a format specifier 0.2 F to display two decimal places I'm going to add one line of decorative text let's copy maybe this all right let's test it out select an item popcorn pretzel soda potato quit all right here's our cart popcorn pretzel soda we did not include the potato that was not found within our dictionary the total is twelve dollars and fifty cents well there you have it everybody that is a concession stand program the point of this program was to help us get used to working with dictionaries a dictionary is a collection of key value pairs such as an item and a price and yeah that's a concession standard program in Python
