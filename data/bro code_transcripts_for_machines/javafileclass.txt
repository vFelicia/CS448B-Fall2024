hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the file class in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm welcome back guys and gals in this video we're going to be discussing the file class now a file is an abstract representation of file and directory path names what we'll be doing in this video is detecting to see if we have a certain file someplace within our computer so here's an example here's my desktop please excuse the mess i'm going to create a new text file on my desktop so i'm going to go to file new text document i'll call this secret underscore message and i'm going to copy and paste this text document within my project folder so i'm going to click on my project folder and paste it so now within my project folder i have a txt file called secret message what i'm going to do is just detect to see if i have a file called secretmessage.txt within my project folder to begin with so we need to create a file object using the file class but we'll need this import at the top too so let's create a file object file file equals new file and within the constructor of this file object we're going to list the file that we're going to associate with this file object so i'm going to list the name of this file so within quotes this title is secret underscore message dot txt be sure to include the file extension if it has one so in order to check to see if a file exists or not there is a method to do so so within an if statement we're going to write file dot exists so if our file exists if there is a match we will execute this if statement and let's just write a message that file exists surprise space else that file won't exist so within an else statement we'll display that file doesn't exist frowny face all right let's try this and it states that file exists so what if i don't have the file extension right now we're just looking for a plain file that says secret message and it states that file doesn't exist so be sure to include the file extension if it has one so what if i removed this file so i'm going to delete it and let's run this again and it states that that file doesn't exist so with the file constructor of our file object when we list a file name we're going to begin looking within our project folder as the initial directory but what if a file is located someplace else within our computer and not necessarily within the same project folder what we're instead going to do is list the full file path within the constructor plus the file name too well here we are again back in my desktop so i would like to see or detect if my secret message is on my desktop but i need to get the full file path so i'm going to right click on my file go to properties and then copy this location so this is the file path within the file constructor i'm going to paste my file location plus the name of the file that i'm looking for so if you have backslashes make sure to include double backslashes because that's an escape sequence on the other hand forward slashes would work too so just to demonstrate let's switch these to one forward slash each kind of like that alright so let's run this again if i have this file name at this file location it's going to state that file exists or it doesn't exist if it's not there and it states that file exists so remember if your file is within your project folder you only need the file name if it's anyplace else you'll want to list the file path so let's cover a few other useful methods of file class but for now i'm going to move my secret message back into my project folder and with the file path i'm just going to list the file name so it states that this file exists let's cover the get path method so i'm going to write this within a print line statement file dot get path so the path is whatever you have listed within the constructor of the file class so this is just going to display that secretmessage.txt now if you want the location of where this file is within your computer that is the absolute path and there is a separate function for that file dot get absolute path and this file of mine here is at this location within my computer this is the full file path the is file method will return true or false depending if your file is in fact a file so let's use the file dot is file method so if this file is a file it's going to return true which it is if you select a folder well this is going to be false then so that's one way in which you can verify if a file is in fact a file and not a folder we can also delete a file too file dot delete so this is actually going to delete my file within my project folder or i can set a file path if i would like to delete a file that's someplace else within my computer so this is going to delete this file after running it so i'm going to run this program well what the heck it appears that this file is still within my project folder even though i called the delete function well that's because we need to refresh this so i'm going to right click and click refresh or you can type f5 so you can see that that file is no longer there and if we were to run this program one more time well our file no longer exists and it states that file doesn't exist so those are just a few relevant methods there's still way more methods out there you can always take a look through a few of these too but i thought those are some of the more useful and pertinent ones to you so that's everything you need to know to get started using files in java if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how the file class works in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and
