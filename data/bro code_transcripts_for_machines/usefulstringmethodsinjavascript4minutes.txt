hey welcome back everybody so let's talk about some useful string properties and methods i have a variable user name and assign this whatever your first and last name is if we type this variable and add a dot we have access to a bunch of different properties and methods of this string one of which is the length property this will give us the length of a string how many characters are within the string we could assign this to a variable name length equal username dot length or we could display it i'm going to display this with a console.log statement console.log username.length the length of my name is 8 characters but yours will likely be something different let's cover a few more we can get the character of a string at a given index type the name of the string variable dot char at add a set of parentheses whatever character you would like to return you will add the index of that character computers always start with zero so the first character in the string would have an index of zero so maybe i would like to assign this to a variable let first letter equal username dot char at index zero or you know i could display it with console.log and then just add this variable and method within the parentheses the character at index zero of my string is b then index 1 would be r 2 would be o that is the char at method you can find the index of the first occurrence of a letter type the variable name user name dot index of then pass in a character you would like to find the first index of how about o and then i will display this with console.log the index of the first occurrence of the character o is at index 2 0 1 2. there's also last index of last index of and we'll keep that as o the last occurrence of o has an index of five zero one two three four five we can also trim spaces before and after a string so i'm going to display this as it is and i'll turn these into comments okay console.log username and we have all the space that we would like to get rid of so to do that we will reassign username with username.trim this gets rid of any empty spaces before and after any other characters we could make our string all uppercase username equals username.2 uppercase and my name is all uppercase there is also lowercase to lowercase and all the characters are now lowercase okay here's another replace all but this time let's create a phone number let phone number equal then within a set of quotes make up some phone number with dashes 1234567890 okay using the replace all method i can replace all given characters with another one so phone number equals phone number dot replace all so this has two arguments the character we would like to replace add a comma the second character is what we'll be replacing all of these dashes with how about a forward slash and we will display phone number so here's my phone number if you would like to eliminate these dashes then just don't type in anything and those dashes are gone so yeah those are a few useful string properties and methods if you have a string variable add a dot and you have access to a bunch of different properties and methods a lot of which we didn't cover but these are just a few of the basics so yeah those are some useful string properties and methods if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
