hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm gonna show you all some useful string methods in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody here's a few useful string methods that you may be interested in so to begin we'll need a string to work with or a variable containing a string so why don't we create a variable named full name to store your own full name now to access some methods available to strings we'll need to type a string or a variable containing a string then follow this with a dot and there should be a prompt for a whole bunch of methods that we have access to i'll show you some of the more useful ones like two upper full name dot to upper then to invoke this add a set of parentheses then a semicolon to finish this statement but then we'll need to reassign this full name equals full name to upper then we can display our full name and when i run this my name should all be uppercase just like that okay now alternatively there's two lower it's the same process as before but change the method to lower and my name should all be lowercase okay so that's two upper and two lower let's move on for this next example we'll need a phone number so let's create a string named phone number equals and make up some phone number and be sure to include some dashes one two three four five six seven eight nine zero okay what i'm going to do is replace these dashes with a different character so to do that we'll need to use the replace method so phone number dot replace so within the set of parentheses we'll need the character we're going to replace and another character we're going to replace the old character with so i would like to replace all dashes with a forward slash so separate each of these characters with a comma so this will replace my phone number the dash is within the phone number with forward slashes phone number equals phone number dot replace and let's display our phone number with a writeline statement so all of these dashes have been replaced with forward slashes now if you replace these with no characters just an empty set of quotes that will effectively remove those dashes within the phone number which could have some uses too so that is the replace method available to strings next we have the insert method we can insert a character or a string at a given index within a preexisting string let's say i would like to take my full name and turn it into some sort of username by preceding my first name with the at sign so to do that i can use the insert method i'll create a new variable for this example let's say string username equals full name dot insert and with the insert method we will list an index and what we would like to insert so computers they always start at zero the beginning would be zero that would be the first index so at the beginning index zero i would like to insert an at sign and this will create a new variable called username so i will display that within a rightline statement console.writeline username and my username is now at whatever my full name was now this doesn't necessarily have to be a single character we could say like mr dot and precede my full name with mr and my username is now mr bro code okay so that is the insert method what i'm about to show you next technically isn't a method it's a property but it's found within the same place as methods for strings so to access the length property of a string type a string dot link and you do not add a set of parentheses afterwards that is done with methods so the length property will return the given amount of characters within a string so i'm going to display this within a rightline statement if you need this you can always like assign this to a variable or something but that might be overkill for this lesson so console.writeline the length of my full name and my full name has eight characters in it one potential use of the length property of strings is that let's say that somebody's creating a username and there's a max 12 characters well you can get the length of whatever they type in and check to see if it's more than 12 characters this next method is the substring method and it can be a little complex basically speaking we can take a section from an original string and create an entirely new string but we have to specify a position and how many characters you would like to extract from that given position so we'll create two new strings from full name first name and last name using the substring method so let's declare string first name equals full name dot substring okay so within the substring we're going to list an index and the amount of characters afterwards we would like to include within our substring so i would like to take the first three characters from my full name so the index computers always start with zero of the beginning of my string would be zero and i'm going to take three characters after this index so if i was to display my first name now it's going to be bro the first three characters of my full name now let's do the same thing with last name so let's copy what we have change first name to last name but now we have a different index so i would like my substring to begin where the c is so let's count what the index is going to be this would be zero one two three four so let's change zero to four and how many characters would we like to include within our substring one two three four so four comma four and that is my last name so i will display that within a right line statement first name and last name so that is the substring method we can take a section or a slice from an original string and create an entirely new string from it alright everybody those are a few useful string methods but not all of them so if you would like a complete list you can always type a string dot and there should be a popup for all of the different string methods you can access and if you highlight one of these there's a description of what they do exactly i only showed you a few of the more useful ones for beginners so if you can give this video a big fat thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well those are some useful string methods in c sharp
