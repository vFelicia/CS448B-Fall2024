oh yeah typecasting typecasting is the ability to convert a value to a different data type it's useful when we accept user input because when the user types in something it's going to be a string and strings can only do so many things and different data types can perform different things so it may be necessary to convert from one data type to another like for example we can't use strings for any sort of math we would need to convert a string to an integer or double to be able to use a string representation of a number so let's begin let's say we would like to convert a double to an integer let's create a double variable named a and i'll assign this a value of 3.14 the first few digits of pi so what we could do if we wanted to convert this number to an end we could store this within a separate variable let's say int b equals now to convert this value to an integer we can use the convert classes 2 and 32 method so convert dot 2 into 32 parentheses semicolon and within the parentheses i'm going to place what i want to convert i'm going to convert the value stored with an a and then assign it to variable b and then let's display this variable with a rightline statement so console.writeline and then i will display whatever b is then let's try it and the value stored within a b is three so if we convert a double to an integer it's going to truncate any decimal portion if there is any so since we wrote this program this way it's not going to get rid of the value within a so if i were to display a it's going to be 3.14 all we did is that we took the value stored with an a and created a copy of it then converted it to an integer and stored it within b it's also possible to display the data type of whatever variable that we're working with so after a within our rightline method type dot get type then add a set of parenthesis this is the get type method so this will display instead of the value stored within a it's going to display the data type of whatever a is so the data type of a is currently a double now let's change this to b b dot get type and our variable b is an integer into 32. so if you need the data type of a variable follow that variable with dot get type then a set of parenthesis this is a builtin method of variables let's convert an into double this time let's create int c equals what about one two three and we'll create double d equals convert dot 2 double then parenthesis semicolon within the parentheses we will convert c so place that within there and within a rightline statement we will display whatever d is console.writeline d so if your double doesn't contain like a decimal portion it's not going to display like point zero but if i were to add like 0.1 to the end of this then it will display a decimal portion so 123.1 and the data type of d let's follow this with the get type method so the data type of d is in fact a double okay now let's convert an integer to a string we'll need int what about e e equals three two one and i'll create string f equals convert dot to string are you beginning to see a pattern here then parentheses semicolon then pass in e so place that within the parentheses and we will display whatever f is console.writeline the value stored within f and that will be three two one so a string we can't use for any arithmetic but with ins and doubles we can so if we convert an integer to a string we can no longer use this for any math but if we converted a string to an integer then we can use it for any sort of math so let's follow this with get type method f dot get type and the data type of f is in fact a string okay exercise number three let's convert a string to a char hr is just a single character string g equals so a string is always within double quotes what about the dollar sign and a char is always within single quotes we treat strings and chars differently you can store a single character within a string however strings are different from chars there's different things that we can do so let's say char what comes after g e f g h char h equals convert dot 2 char then of course parenthesis semicolon within the parentheses we will place g and then display whatever h is so console.writeline h so h will still be a dollar sign but we treat it different because it's a character there's different things that we can do then let's get the type of whatever h is and h is hr a single character okay last but not least let's convert a string to a boolean string i equals true within double quotes so this is different from true without double quotes because this is a boolean and right now we're getting an error so represents a boolean true or false a string is always within double quotes so we would treat this string different from this boolean even though they say the same thing okay then let's convert this string to a boolean type bool not cool bool j equals convert dot to boolean parenthesis semicolon pass in i then we will display whatever j is console.writeline j and this will display true then let's get the type of this variable so j dot get type method and the data type of j is a boolean now all right everybody so that's how to typecast we can convert a value to a different data type and it's really useful when we accept user input because it's always going to be a string and there's different things that we can do with different data types so it may be necessary to convert from one data type to another so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well that's typecasting in c sharp
