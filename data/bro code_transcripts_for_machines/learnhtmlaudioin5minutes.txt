hey how's it going everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can include audio in a web page using HTML you'll need some audio files to work with one place you can download some MP3 files is the YouTube audio library find some songs that you like and then you can download them let's download three for this lesson once you have your three songs let's move them to our website folder alright we are ready to begin so to include some audio we need a pair of audio tags then between the audio tags let's include a source element with the source element there is a source attribute we will set the source attribute to equal the name of an MP3 file or other audio file so let me copy the name be sure to get the file extension and then I will paste that file the file name nothing appears to happen because we don't have any controls and the song doesn't play right away too so to add some controls within the opening audio tag type controls and that's it so we can now play our song or you can mute it fast forward it rewind it set the playback speed whatever you can set your audio file to auto play but people find that annoying so you should probably not do that if we do want our song to autoplay we should at least mute it using the muted attribute so our song is playing but it's muted until we unmute it we can even have our song Loop by using the loop attribute so let me play this turn up the volume a little bit fast forward to near the end and let's see if it loops and it does cool now in case your web browser doesn't support a certain audio type you can add fallbacks so let's say that we also have a wave version of our audio file I can include that as a fallback right underneath but we should also specify the type just to let the web browser know that this is an MP3 file and that this is a WAV file I'll include the type attribute I will type audio slash MPEG I will also let the web browser know that this is a WAV file audio slash wave so just in case a web browser doesn't support MP3 files I'm pretty sure that they all do nowadays we will resort to our WAV file if we have a backup of the same audio file in wave format let's include our two other audio files so again we need a pair of audio tags within the pair of audio tags we will need a source tag a source element and I will set the source to equal the name of an audio file so let's copy the name of our second audio file including the extension add some controls and there's our second song let me pause the first one let's add the last one so here's the name of my last song be sure to get the file extension we have our controls and here's my third song I feel like I'm losing my mind hey for fun let's add the name of each of these songs right before the controls I'll use a pair of paragraph tags then I will copy the name of the song and sandwich the name between the paragraph tags so that's the name of my first song let's do this again with the second song and the third so here are my three songs just to make everything a little more organized I'm going to create a music folder within my website folder to hold all of my audio files I will create a new folder I will name this music I'll place all of my audio files within the music folder so we no longer know where the location of those audio files are because we're using a relative file path I'm going to set the source attribute to be music slash the name of the file we can locate those files now so that's our first song our second song and our third song that's how to include audio files in a web page using HTML if you're enjoying the series let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
