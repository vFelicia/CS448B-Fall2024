hey well it looks like we're on exceptions today an exception is an error that occurs during execution so here's an example i have a small program where we will ask a user to type in two numbers divide those numbers then display the result so what if i type in something that's not a number i would like to divide the number 5 by the word pizza we'll encounter an exception and this interrupts our program we encountered a format exception input string was not in a correct format so any code that is considered dangerous where it might cause an exception we can surround with a try block so i would consider this code to be dangerous so type try then a set of curly braces surround any code that is considered dangerous with the set of curly braces now if we have a try block we also need a catch block so after the try block add catch and the catch block catches and handles exceptions when they occur but we need to specify what kinds of exceptions we would like to catch and handle so catch parentheses curly braces and this is kind of like a parameter so i would like to catch and handle any format exceptions then add e so if we encounter that same exception again instead of our program being interrupted we can do something else instead so let's write a message and let the user know to type in only numbers enter only numbers please and let's try that again enter number one five enter number two pizza enter only numbers please and this did not interrupt our program that's the important thing now these try and catch blocks they will only catch and handle format exceptions what if somebody accidentally divides by zero or intentionally does so so we do not have a catch block set up for that we can add multiple catch blocks so let's catch any divide by zero exceptions so catch parentheses curly braces and the exception we would like to catch is divide by zero exception then add e so if somebody attempts to divide by zero let's display a message you can't divide by zero idiot but this only occurs with integer division so let's turn our doubles x and y into integers and we'll have to change this cast as well so change two double two and thirty two so if we attempt to divide a number by zero which we can't mathematically do this is what happens enter number one five enter number two zero you can't divide by zero idiot and this will not interrupt our program now you can add a catch block that just catches everything but it's not considered good practice to add by itself so sometimes i'll add a like catch all block just in case if there's any exceptions i do not anticipate so at the end we can add exception e but it's difficult to let the user know what went wrong exactly because it'll just print when any exception occurs something went wrong so this will catch everything let's remove the first two catch blocks so let's take five divided by the word pizza something went wrong now catch exception e does catch everything but it's considered poor practice to have this by itself because basically you're shrugging when something goes wrong you should let the user know exactly what went wrong so it's better practice to catch specific exceptions first then at the end you can add you know exception e in case there's anything you don't anticipate by the way i changed x and y back to doubles now the last thing we need to talk about is the finally block the finally block is optional it always executes regardless if an exception is caught or not so at the end let's create a finally block type finally curly braces if there's anything you'd like to do after you're trying catch block regardless if an exception occurs or not you can place that here what people typically use the finally block for is to close any open files if they need to reset anything but for this example let's just print something so let's display a thank you message thanks for visiting if we do not encounter any exceptions this finally block will still execute five divided by one is five thanks for visiting now if we do encounter and catch an exception well that finally block is still going to execute as well thanks for visiting so yeah those are exceptions they are errors that occur during execution they interrupt the normal flow of our program any code that is considered dangerous we should surround with a try block and catch any exceptions when they occur and finally can be added and it will execute regardless if an exception is caught or not so yeah those are exceptions i will post this code in the comment section down below if you can smash that like button drop a random comment down below and well yeah those are exceptions in c sharp
