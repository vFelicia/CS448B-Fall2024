hey everybody in this topic i'm going to show you how we can sort an array first i'll explain the logic behind it then we'll write a c plus program to actually handle it we'll use a standard bubble sort it's an easy sorting algorithm to write although there are more efficient sorting algorithms we're still learning so let's stick with a bubble sort so with the bubble sort we begin at index 0 the beginning of our array we'll examine the element directly to the right if the element on the left is larger than the element on the right we need to swap these two elements i will take this element move it within some temporary storage like a temporary variable take the element on the right move it to the left take whatever's within temp place it within that opening again we take our value examine the element to the right if it's larger we swap them then we would just repeat this until we reach the end so that would be one element we would repeat this process with the rest of the elements now for the next iteration one is not greater than nine so we leave it alone then we check the next element nine is greater than two we would swap these two values i'll speed up the footage so that is a quick demonstration of a bubble sort so let's actually write this in code now okay let's create an array this will be an array of integers make up some numbers make sure they're not in order let's calculate the size of the array and size equals size of our array divided by the size of one of the elements at the end of our program we will iterate over our array i'll use a for each loop int element in array i will display using standard output every element then i think i'll separate each with a space okay and here's our array obviously unsorted so let's change that i'll create a sort function void sort there will be two parameters an integer array int size let's add a function declaration at the top of our program before we print our array let's invoke the sort function that we just created pass in our array as well as the size there we go okay so let's head to our sort function what we'll need to do is iterate over our array once for every element that's within the array we'll need the help of a temporary variable to swap some values then we'll need nested loops four and i equals zero we'll continue this as long as i is less than the size of our array minus one the reason that the condition is size minus one is because we don't need to compare the last element to anything the larger values will naturally gravitate towards the end of the array increment i by one then we'll need a nested for loop let's use index j because i is already taken now our condition is going to be size minus i minus one once we place the larger elements all the way to the right they should already be in order we don't need to sort any elements that are already sorted then what we have to do is use an if statement to check to see if the current element that we're on array at index of j is greater than the element on the right array at index of j plus one if the element on the left is larger than the element on the right we just have to swap those two values we'll take temp which we declared up here equals array at index of j array at index of j equals array at index of j plus one then lastly array at index of j plus one equals whatever's within temp and that should be it let's run this yeah and our array is now sorted in ascending order so if you need descending order within this if statement use less than and now this array is in descending order well okay then everybody that's one way in which you can sort an array we used what's known as a bubble sort it's easy to write but it's not as efficient as some other algorithms that are out there this is a good one for beginners if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to sort an array using c plus plus
