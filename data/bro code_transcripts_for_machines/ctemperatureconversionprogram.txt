okay guys in this video we're going to create a temperature conversion program to convert from fahrenheit to celsius or celsius to fahrenheit at the top of our program let's declare our variables double temp temp is short for temperature then char unit will the user select celsius or fahrenheit now with my programs i like to add a title at the beginning standard output temperature conversion it's totally not necessary but it's something that i like to do then i'll add another line of output at the end of my program to show the user that the program is over i'll just add a bunch of asterisks like i said totally not necessary but it's something i'd just like to do i will display a couple lines of output f equals fahrenheit i can never spell fahrenheit right i think that's okay i'll add a new line standard output c equals celsius add a new line standard output what unit would you like to convert to standard input unit the user will hopefully type in f or c depending on what they want to convert to let's check to see if the user types in f first if unit is equal to the character f that's a capital f but you know maybe the user types in lowercase f i'll add an or conditional operator or unit is equal to a lowercase f that's also a valid response if the user would like to convert a temperature to fahrenheit these are the steps we can do standard output enter the temperature in celsius standard input temp to store the temperature to convert our temperature from celsius to fahrenheit we can assign temp equal to now here's the formula 1.8 times our temp plus 32 then we will display the temperature standard output temperature is temp degrees fahrenheit then i'll add a new line if the user would like to convert to celsius i'll add an else if statement else if unit is equal to the character capital c or unit is equal to the character lowercase c we can copy these two lines of code and reuse them we'll just repurpose them enter the temperature in fahrenheit here's the formula to convert from fahrenheit to celsius temp equals our current temperature minus 32 divided by 1.8 then let's display our temperature i'll copy this line of code paste it change fahrenheit to celsius now what if the user doesn't type in a valid response else standard output please enter in only c or f add a new line and that should be everything let's try this temperature conversion program what unit would you like to convert to i would like to convert to fahrenheit enter the temperature in celsius so what's zero degrees celsius converted to fahrenheit that is 32 degrees fahrenheit let's go again let's convert to celsius enter the temperature in fahrenheit what's 100 degrees in celsius 37.7 degrees celsius let's type in a response that's not valid uh i would like to convert to pizza please enter in only c or f all right everybody that is a program to convert from fahrenheit to celsius or vice versa i thought we could use some practice using conditional operators as well as if statements if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's a temperature conversion program in c plus
