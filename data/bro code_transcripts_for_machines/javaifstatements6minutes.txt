hey how's it going everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about if statements in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right guys and gals in this video we're going to talk about if statements and if statement is a very basic form of decision making when an if statement evaluates to be true it will perform a block of code and that is it here's an example let's say we have a variable called maybe h into age equals let's set this to 18 we can perform a block of code if some condition that we state evaluates to true so this is how to create an if statement we type in the word if a set of parentheses and then a set of curly braces so within the parentheses of the if statement this is the condition we can check to see if somebody is perhaps 18 or older so what we can do is write a condition such as age is greater than or equal to 18. within our program when we reach this if statement we're going to check to see if this evaluates to be true or false currently our age is set to 18 so this will evaluate to be true and we will perform whatever is within the set of curly braces so let's print a message such as u are an adult and let's test this so our age is 18 our if statement evaluates to be true and therefore we will perform this block of code associated with this if statement and we will display the message you are an adult what if we change this to maybe 12 and then with our if statement when we reach this condition this will evaluate to be false therefore we will skip this block of code as if it never even happened we could perform a different action instead we could write an else statement there is no condition we just need the word else followed by a set of curly braces now we are forced to take one of two actions we will check to see if our condition is true if it is true we will perform this block of code if it's false we will instead perform this block of code so let's print a different message you are not an adult so we are forced to perform one of two actions if our condition is true we will perform our if statement if it's false we will perform our else statement and this states that you are not an adult now it is entirely possible to check more than one condition before reaching an else statement and that is by using what is called an else if statement so we type else if a set of parenthesis and then a set of curly braces so we can check an additional condition before reaching our else statement so let's check to see if our age is greater than or equal to 75 all right and then we will print a message such as okay boomer so pay attention to this let's change our edge to 75 and run this all right well it displays you are an adult that's because our if condition evaluates to true because 75 is greater than or equal to 18 so it's going to skip everything else and ignore these blocks of code and continue on with the rest of the program so if we want to first check to see if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 75 what we can do is move this to our if statement and i'll just switch these around and change our else if statement to 18. so we'll first check to see if somebody is greater than or equal to 75 if they are we will first print okay boomer else if if their age is greater than or equal to 18 we will display you are an adult and let's try this again and it displays okay boomer so you can see that we got an entirely different result with these if statements if the condition evaluates to be true it's going to perform its own block of code and skip everything else you can check more than one condition by adding else if statements we could check one more thing perhaps else if age is greater than or equal to 13 then we can display another message such as you are a teenager and if we changed our integer variable age to 13 this will display you are a teenager there is one thing that you should know these symbols the less than sign equal sign the greater than sign these are known as comparison operators so they work normally as what you would imagine however if you want to compare if something or some value is equal you don't use one equal sign that's using the assignment operator so we're attempting to assign our variable age equal to 75 if we need to compare if something is equal we use two equal signs so that's just one thing that is specific for programming so we can check to see if our age is equal to 75 and this time it will print ok boomer so that's all what an if statement is it's a basic form of decision making for your program if a condition evaluates to be true then it will perform a block of code if its condition is false it will perform its else statement unless you have else if statements then it's one by one going to check to see if these conditions are true before reaching the else statement well ladies and gentlemen that's the basics of if statements if you would like a copy of all of this code i will post this in the comments down below and if i could ask a favor of you i would greatly
