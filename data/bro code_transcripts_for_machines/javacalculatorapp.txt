how's it going everybody it's Ebro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how we can make a simple calculator program using Java so let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running a read everybody so let's get started so we're going to create a new Java project I'm going to call this calculator and then click finish then if it prompts you to create a module I'm going to click and don't create and then within the source folder let's create a new class so file new class and I will also call this calculator or you can call this main call it whatever you want really so calc you later and then I'm going to check public static void main so I don't have to type in this line and then click finish so before we forget let's import a few things so there's three imports that we're going to need import everything related to Java X dot swing as well as everything related to Java dot AWT and then lastly import Java dot aw t dot event and that is all the imports that we need so let's create a constructor for this class so I'm going to do this maybe right before the main method so we type in the name of the class to create a constructor so calc you later and then we're going to have this class implement and action listener so implements action listener and then there is a method that we have to implement that is the action performed method so within this main class let's create an instance of our calculator class so we can just type in calculator let's call this calc equals new calculator all right and then before the constructor let's declare a few things and then let me just add some spaces all right so let's declare everything that we'll need so first we'll need a jframe and we'll call this frame and then we'll need a text field AJ text field and we'll call it text field now let's create an array of J buttons so J button then straight braces for an array and this will hold all of our numbered buttons equals nu J button and then straight braces and we'll want ten buttons for ten numbers one through nine and well zero I guess two and we'll create an array of J buttons to hold all of our function buttons so that's things like add subtract divide equals decimal so J button straight braces for an array and we'll call these function buttons equals nu J button this will hold eight buttons let's name all of the function buttons the number buttons will make anonymous so for the function buttons J button will have a Add button a sub button a multiply button we'll just call it mu L button MD well short for multiply and then div for divide button and let's do this again but on the next line just so everything is organized so J button and this next row will be for decimal button equals but we'll just say equ button de L button for delete and CLR for clear button and then we'll create a J panel to hold all of the separate buttons so this will be J panel and we will call this panel so we just have a few things left are declared so I'm going to be reusing one font for all of my buttons so I think it's actually best if we declare a font that we can reuse easily so what I'm going to type is font my font you equals new font then within parenthesis I can specify a font style and I like the font ink free so I'm going to use that one but use whatever font that you want and then I want this to be bold so in the next field I'm going to type font dot bold and then a size and I will pick 30 because that's a decent size for my buttons and then lastly we just have a few double values to declare so double num1 this will be our first number and let's set this to zero number to equal zero as well and our result that will also equal zero and then a char value called operator and this will hold the either the multiply character subtract addition and then division so it's gonna hold one of those okay that is everything that we need to declare so let's move on to our constructor and begin here so let's finish initializing the frame so at the top I'm going to type frame equals new J frame and then we can give this frame a title so I'm going to type in calc you later and then there's a few other things we need to do such as frame dot set default close operation then the operation is jframe dot exit on close so this allows us to close out of the program and then a size frame dot set size I usually pick for 20 by 420 but we're going to need a slightly bigger height so 550 was a good height for this and then we're going to use no layout manager at least for the frame so set layout know for all the buttons though we're going to use a grid layout but we'll take care of that later and then we'll want to set the visibility so at the end frame dot set visible true and then we're actually going to put a few things between frames set layout and frame dot set visible so anytime you make a significant change to your program it's a good idea to test it out just to be sure that everything is working just fine so since we added a frame we should probably just run this once just to be sure that everything is okay so here's our calculator it is 420 by 550 the title says calculator and then when you hit the X button it will close out of this program so now let's work on the text field the text field is what's going to hold all the numbers that we type in as well as the result so let's finish instantiating this jtextfield first so we're going to add this after all of these methods related to the frame but before we set the visibility to true so let's finish instantiating this so text field equals new J text field and then since we're using no layout manager we'll set the bounds for this text field as in where it's located and the width and the height so text field dot set bounds and there are four fields to fill in the xposition yposition width and height so for the x position 50 is decent for y 25 for the width 300 is good and for the height 50 now let's set the font for this text field so text field dot set font and since we already declared a font we can actually reuse this so I'm going to take the name of our font and place it within the parentheses of this set font method and then we'll need to add this text field to the frame so frame dot add text field and let's run this to test it so here's our jtextfield at the top and right now a user could actually type in a number even letters so we may want to limit that so what we can do is actually use the set editable method and set it to false so at the end I'm going to type in text field dot set editable and then false and when we run this again we can know longer update this text box however this will still be editable if we were to click on a button if we want to type in a number so that's fine all right let's work on adding our buttons next so we'll do this after the text field methods but before we add everything to the frame so let's add our Add button first so add button equals new J button and then we can add some text to this button so I'm just going to add a plus sign and then we're going to do this a few times so I'm just going to copy and paste this a bunch of times so we have eight different function buttons so I'm going to copy and paste this seven more times I think that's about it we'll find out so we'll want a subtraction button and we'll change the symbol here as well multiply so mu well and we'll place an asterisk here divide so div and then a forward slash what else do we got decimal equals delete and clear so let's add those decimal Dec and then we'll just place a dot here a decimal then we have already forgot what it was equals equ equal sign de L for delete and we will type in delete here and then a Clear button and that is CLR I think yep CLR and we will type in clear now we have all of these different buttons related to functions and I actually made an array of J buttons called function buttons so what we'll do is add all of these buttons to our array called function buttons so I'm just going to copy this title and if we want to add the first button to the first position of this array I'm going to add a set of straight braces and type in index zero and I'm going to set this equal to maybe our add button and let's do the same thing for the other buttons so I'm going to copy this and paste it seven more times and then this will be one two three four five six and I missed one seven so we have ad first then sub multiply divide decimal equals delete and clear now let's say that we want to add an action listener change the font and do a few other things to each of these buttons well since we have eight different buttons that's a lot of work what we can actually do is use a for loop to iterate through this array of J buttons so let's create a for loop that's going to loop eight times so for and I and we'll set this equal to zero pi is less than it and then we will increment I by one after each iteration so what we're going to do during each iteration of this for loop is that for each of these buttons one we're going to change function buttons from whatever index is here to I so this will change after each iteration and let's add an action listener since this is implementing the action listener interface so add action listener this alright then let's also set the font so I'm going to copy this paste it function buttons at index I set font to my custom font which is called my font and then we'll want to set focusable to false so sometimes when you click on a button there's this annoying like outline around the button that's focus ability we can just set it to false so you can't see that all right so let's do some things similar for our numbered buttons but these are going to be anonymous so this is done in less steps so let's do this after our for loop and we're going to create another for loop that will iterate ten times so I'm going to copy this paste it and then change eight to ten and we'll change a few things within here and the first step is that we need to finish instantiating these numbered buttons we did that with function buttons but not with our numbered buttons so let's do that first so the first thing that we're going to type in is number buttons at index I equals new J button and then we can add some text to this button but what we'll do is type in string dot value of I don't know why it does that though value of I okay then on the next line let's add an action listener set the font and set the focus ability to false so I'm going to copy this from the previous for loop and paste it and then we're going to change function buttons to number buttons and that is it for this for loop now with the delete button and the Clear button this is not going to be on our J panel that has a great layout what we'll do is set the bounds for these separately so let's work on the delete button first so delete button dot set bounds so there's four fields to fill in let's place this where X is 50 where Y is for 30 then this will be a hundred and forty five pixels long and fifty pixels for the height I pre measured this so I'm not just making up random numbers and then let's do this fourth and Clear button so I'm going to copy this paste it and this will be the Clear button and we will place this where X is 205 we'll keep this at four thirty for the Y position this is good for the width 145 and the height 58 then let's add these two buttons to our frame so frame dot add de El button as well as our Clear button so frame dot add CLR button and let's run this just to be sure that everything is working so far so we still need to add the number buttons and the function buttons but we should see at least our delete button and our Clear button and they are right here at the bottom so that's pretty sweet so we're going to create a J panel to hold all of the different buttons so let's work on that next now let's work on the J panel that we have so we need to finish instantiating this we already declared it at the top here it's called panel so we'll add that before we add everything to our frame so panel equals new J panel and then let's set the bounds for this panel so panel dot set bounds will place this where X is 50 where Y is 100 and this will be 300 by 300 so it's a square now let's set view layout we're going to use a grid layout so panel dot set layout new grid layout so we can specify rows and columns so we'll want 4 by 4 but we can also add how much space we want between the buttons so we'll add 10 spaces or 10 pixels worth of space on each side and let's also color the background it just temporarily just so we can see this panel so panel dots set background and let's just set this to maybe gray so color dot gray I'm gonna get rid of this line right after though and then we need to add this panel to the frame so frame dot add panel ok let's take a look so here is our jpanel we're going to add a grid of buttons to this J panel however I don't like this gray background color so I'm just going to get rid of it I just wanted to demonstrate where this grid was exactly now we're going to add the function buttons and the number buttons to art panel and we're going to do this in order so let's begin by adding the button for number 1 so I'm going to type panel dot add then our array number buttons at index 1 which contains the number 1 actually and let's add 2 and 3 next so these are in order so number buttons 2 and then number buttons 3 then next I think we should add the Add button so panel dot add add button let's do the same thing for a few other things so this is the second row so I'm going to change this number to 4 5 6 and we'll add the sub button okay then let's do this 4 7 8 9 and the next row so 7 8 9 and we will add the multiply button mu L button then I think we'll add the decimal button next Dec and then the number 0 button which is in number buttons 0 and then we will add our equals button so that's equ and lastly our divide button so that's div button ok let's take a look at this now and here are all of the buttons in the order that we place them so it starts at the top and works its way to the right when it reaches the end it goes down to the next row now let's add some functionality to these buttons so we'll do that within the actionperformed method for our primary stuff within the actionperformed method let's check to see if somebody clicks on one of these numbered buttons so what I think we'll do is put this within a four loop so will iterate this four loop ten times so int I is equal to zero will continue this as long as I is less than 10 and then we will increment I by one each time so what we're going to do within this for loop is we're going to use an if statement if e dot get source is equal to the number button at the current index of I well its number buttons my bad okay so what we'll do is that we will take our text field this is somewhat verbose so set text and then within the parentheses of this method text field dot get text and we will use the come cat function to concatenate a string and it's going to be string dot value of int I sorry this is kind of a long line of code here but let's try it so when we click on a number it's going to update our text field looks like everything is working let's add functionality to the decimal button so let's write this outside at the for loop right after it so we'll use an if statement if a dot get source method is equal to our decimal button and within the if statement we're going to type text field dot set text and we're going to actually I'm just going to copy most of this text field dot get text and then we're going to concatenate just a dot within here okay let's try this so 3.14 looks like that is good then okay let's work on the Add button so I think I'm just gonna copy this do to save some time so we're going to change Dec to our add button what we'll do here is that we want to retrieve number one so num 1 equals we're going to use the double wrapper parse double and within the method of parse double text field dot get text and then we are going to assign our operator which is a character so operator equals the plus sign and let's clear the text field too so text field dot set text then just an empty set of quotes then I'm going to copy this and do something similar for the subtract button so we're going to change add to sub so this can stay the same operator is going to change to minus and then we will keep this text the same as well and let's do this again for multiply so mu well for multiply button and change the operator and then the same thing for divide so div and forward slash okay so then let's work on the equals button so there's a few things we need to fill in with in here so if e dot get source method is equal to our equals button so what we'll do is take num2 equals double dot parse double and then text field dot get text then we're going to use a switch statement for the operator depends on which symbol they're using that will determine what mathematical operation we're going to perform so we'll do this within the if statement we're going to create a switch and then within the parentheses we're going to use the operator and compare it so for the first case this will be our plus sign we're going to take our result equals num1 plus num2 and then break and we'll have three other cases so case for subtraction equals num1 num2 same thing for multiply num 1 multiplied by num2 and then divide num1 divided by num2 alright then outside of the switch let's just be sure we're getting the right parenthesis so it's this one after this one we're going to update the text field so text field dot set text string dot value of our result and then we'll assign num1 to be our result so then we can continue if we want to reuse the same number okay let's try this so let's take maybe ninety nine divided by three equals thirty three times two that's sixty six minus five plus one point two three all right looks like everything's working now let's work on the Clear button and this one's pretty easy and I'm just gonna copy one of these paste it and then change a few things so if II died get source equals the Clear button what we'll do is that we will take our text field set text to just a empty set of quotes and let's try it so one two three let's hit the Clear button and it clears out everything and lastly the delete button so if a dot get source is equal to our delete button there is a few extra steps so let's create a string variable let's just call this string equals text field dot get text method and we're going to store it within our string named string or whatever else you called this then let's clear the text field for now so text field dot set text and this is only temporarily then we're going to create a for loop that's going to iterate through the length of the string minus one so int I equals zero and we'll continue this as long as I is less than our string length minus one then increment I by one each time so during each iteration of this for loop we'll take our text field and use the set text method and within the parentheses text field dot get text plus the string the character at our index which is I and that should be it for our delete button so if we were to type in a number let's say 3.1415 and we click on the delete button it's going to delete the last item or character that's in here and then if we were to hit the Clear button it's going to just clear everything guys I forgot about something what if we have to input a negative number we don't have any way to enter that and my bad let's go ahead and fix that real quick so let's just add a negative button it won't take too long and we'll change this array to nine buttons then we are going to add this button to our array so let's increase this to eight and add our negative button and we'll probably want to create a symbol for this as well neg button equals nu J button and I will add a negative sign within parentheses that'll work and it let's increase this for loop to nine and let's set the bounds so neg button dot set bounds I'll just put this next to our delete button and clear button but I'll make these a little bit smaller for the would so we'll make these all I think 100 pixels appears for the width so we'll place this where X is 50 or Y is for 30 this will be 100 pixels along for the width and 50 for the hyatt and let's also do this for our delete button so that's 150 for 30 150 the Clear button will be 250 for 30 100 and and that's fine and now we will want to add the negative button to the frame so we'll do that here frame dot ad neg button and let's just make sure that it's on here okay that's not too bad you can still tell that these are the delete buttons and the clear buttons appropriately okay let's add functionality to this negative button so let's go down to the bottom copy one of these and paste it and we'll change delete button to negative button and we will get rid of everything within here the first step within here is that we'll want to retrieve whatever text is within the text field and let's store this as a double value within a variable which we'll call temp because we're only using this variable temporarily so double temp equals double dot parse double method and within the parentheses of this method will pass in text field dot get text and that's it for this first line so it's going to take whatever value is within text field and assign it to this variable temp now we'll want to flip the sign on our temp variable and one easy way to do that is just to multiply this variable by negative one so temp multiplication sign equals negative one and then lastly we want to set the text to whatever our temporary value is now currently so text field dot set text method then we're going to pass in string dot value of our temp variable and that's it so let's try it so five negative times six negative equals 30 positive times one negative equals negative 30 okay so that's working then so the fact that we added a negative button later on in this program is a great example and a reminder of why you should keep your code clean concise and organized because if you have to make changes or somebody else has to make changes to your program it's actually fairly easy to do so whether you need to delete something you need to update something or maybe there's a new feature that's released it's actually fairly easy to go back and make those changes so honestly this was really just a test I didn't actually forget to add a negative button this was really just a very simple calculator you can always make improvements upon this if you would like a copy of all this code I'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to make a very simple calculator using Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
