hey everyone let's discuss function templates a function template describes what a function looks like they can be used to generate as many overloaded functions as needed each using different data types how is this useful suppose we have a max function that will accept and return an integer int max the parameters will be int x and y will return i'll use the ternary operator here is x greater than y if so return x if not return y this function is compatible with integers as arguments let's display standard output max then pass in two integers like one and two so this would return the number two but what if i would like to use this function with doubles such as 1.1 and 2.1 while we're truncating that decimal portion we're returning to not 2.1 if i want this function to be compatible with doubles normally i would have to create an overloaded function that accepts doubles and returns a double replace int with double and i guess this would work technically the value returned is 2.1 what about characters how about the character one and the character two technically we could use the max version that accepts integers because there's an associated ascii value with each of these characters but i would like an overloaded function that accepts and returns characters char char char so this would return the character 2. this is a lot of work creating three overloaded functions that each do the same thing the only difference is that they accept and return different data types what if we could write one function that will accept any data type well that's what function templates are to create a function template take your function replace any data type with t we're returning an integer let's instead return t the data type of x will be t same thing with y using t as a common naming convention i like to think of it as thing like we're not sure what the data type is we're returning a thing that's just how i think of it however our compiler doesn't know what t is exactly we'll need to add a template parameter declaration before this function template definition we'll add a declaration of what t is so type template angle brackets type name t and that's it this function template will work with many data types characters doubles integers you name it so yeah just replace the data type with t then be sure to add a template parameter declaration now here's a scenario what if you need to mix and match the data types i'll find what the max is between the integer 1 and the double 2.1 well we have a problem no matching function for call to max int double with this function template it's only set up to receive arguments of the same data type now we're passing in two different data types what we could do within our template parameter declaration is add another template name i'm going to add type name u because u comes after t and the alphabet then if you needed more you could add v w x so on and so forth i'll change one of these t's to a u this function template is set up to receive up to two different data types as arguments but there's one more change we need to make so we don't have that error anymore but the decimal portion of our double is truncated it's returning two that's because we're still returning t and t we set to be an integer in this case do we set the return type to be t or u actually better yet we can set this to auto using the auto keyword the compiler will deduce what the return type should be this should return 2.1 all right everybody that is a function template it describes what a function looks like they can be used to generate as many overloaded functions as needed each using different data types i like to think of it like a cookie cutter where determining what the shape is but the arguments the dough that we use for our cookies can be different but the cookies will end up having the same shape one of the main benefits of using function templates is that we only have to write a function once and then it's compatible with different data types so you don't need multiple versions of the same function we'll generate functions using this template as needed so yeah those are function templates everybody your assignment if you choose to do so is to write a function template in the comments section down below and well yeah those are function templates in c plus
