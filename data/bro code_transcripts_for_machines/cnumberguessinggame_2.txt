hey y'all what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a number guessing game in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey everybody so now that we know how to generate some pseudorandom numbers in c i thought this would be a good opportunity for us to create a number guessing game if we're working with pseudorandom numbers be sure to include at least these three header files at the top of your program so let's generate two constants min and max const int and a naming convention for constants is to make all of the letters uppercase so minimum will be the minimum number that we will generate when we generate a random number so let's pick a number between maybe 1 and 100 so min will be 1 and max will be 100 but feel free to take the liberty to choose some other numbers and we'll need int guess to store a user's guess int guesses to keep track of the guesses and int answer okay now if we're working with random numbers we'll want to create a seed and to do that we can actually use the current time so use the s rand function and pass in time pass in zero so this uses the current time as a seed to generate some random numbers and if we need a random number between these two constants min and max this is what we can do so we will assign answer set this equal to call the rand function and use the modulus operator and set this to max and then we will add min as an offset so this will generate a random number between these two constants 1 and 100 or some other numbers if you have something different so this line of code will generate a random number between min and max now before we actually move on let's test this just to be sure that everything's working so let's print whatever the answer is so we're displaying an integer we are displaying answer and let's see what this is so my answer this round is 73 if i run this again it is 93. now if i change these values we will adjust the range in which some random numbers will generate so if i set min to 100 and max to 1000 that should change the range of numbers and this time i have 334 but i'll change this back to 1 and 100 okay so we know that we're generating a random number so let's move on let's create a do while loop so it's going to take at least one guess in order for somebody to guess the correct answer so do curly braces we'll add a while and check a condition at the end and the condition is guess does not equal answer so let's create a prompt and ask the user to enter a guess enter a guess and we will use scanf to accept some user input so this is an integer and we are storing this within guess so address of operator guess now that we have our user's guess let's compare it to our answer so we'll use an if statement and check to see if guess is greater than answer so that means a user guessed a number that was a little too high so let's print a message to let the user know to hi and then we can use an else if statement else if guess is less than answer well then their guess was too low print to low so if our guess is not greater than the answer or less than the answer that means they must have got it right so within an else block let's print correct so then after our if else statements let's increase guesses by one guesses plus plus the very best possible score a user can get is one if they guess it on the first try so before we finish a while loop we will increment guesses by one so then once we escape our while loop let's print the user's final score so we will print the answer this is an integer and we are displaying answer and we will display the guesses it took so guesses and display the value found within guesses and this part isn't necessary but i like to add some text decorations so maybe i'll add a bunch of asterisks to make it look nice let's run it enter a guess i'll guess something right in the middle between so maybe 50. so that guess was too low so maybe 75 okay that was too high so our numbers between 50 and 75 how about 62 that's too low so it's between 62 and 75 how about 69 that's still too low so between 69 and 75 maybe 72 that's still too low so it's between 72 and 75 73 all right that was the right answer i'm just gonna fix one thing real quick uh let's add a new line here okay let's try this again okay until i guess i'll try 50 again that's too high maybe 25 that's still too high what about 12 2 low maybe 18 2 low 21 that's still too low 23 too low 24 and 24 was the correct answer all right everybody so i thought that would be a fun guessing game we could create for practice if you would like a copy of all this i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that is a simple number guessing game in c
