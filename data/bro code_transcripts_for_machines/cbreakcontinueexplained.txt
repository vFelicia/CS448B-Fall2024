hey everybody so in this video i'm going to explain the break and the continue keywords the break keyword will break out of a loop another place where you see this is a switch within a switch statement continue will skip the current iteration here's an example let's create a for loop that will count up to the number 20. i'll set i equal to b1 i will continue this as long as i is less than or equal to 20 then increment i by one standard output i'll display whatever i is then i'll add a new line new line then let's take a look so we have the numbers 1 through 20. i would like to skip the number 13 because 13 is considered an unlucky number i know it's a weird example what i'll do is use an if statement within my for loop if i is equal to 13 first we'll break then see what happens if we break where i equals 13 then we have the numbers 1 through 12. once we hit 13 we break out of the loop we do not finish the rest of the iterations if we replace break with continue this is instead what happens we have the numbers 1 through 20 but the number 13 isn't there so using the continue keyword we skip the current iteration so yeah that's the break and the continue keywords these keywords are available if you need them but where you'll use them it really depends but just so you know they exist and that is the break and the continue keywords in c plus
