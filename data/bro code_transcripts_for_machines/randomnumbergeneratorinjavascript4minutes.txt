hey everybody just so you know that this topic is completely optional if you're ever interested in making any sort of games with javascript then this video is a must let's begin to create a random number let's declare a variable and we will set the sequel to math dot and there is a random method then let's display whatever x is console.log x the random method of math will generate a random decimal number between 0 and 1. but we can actually use that maybe we're rolling a dice how do i generate a random number between 1 and 6. so to do this i'm going to take math.random and multiply this by 6. this gives us a random decimal number between 0 and 5 technically to truncate the decimal portion we can round down i will surround this with a set of parentheses and we will use math.floor and this will round down this generates a random number between zero and five because computers always start with zero if i need one through six i can add an offset i'll just add plus one this generates a random number between one and six as if we were rolling a dice now i like to play a lot of dungeons and dragons and there's different sized dice there's eightsided dice 10sided dice 20sided dice etc if i'm simulating rolling a 20sided dice i would multiply math.random method times 20 plus 1. so this generates a random number between one and twenty maybe i need to roll a couple dice i'll copy this line of code we'll create variables y and z then display them console.log x y and z this would be as if we're rolling three dice we get three random numbers between one and six just for fun let's create some labels and generate some random numbers within our dom so within the body of my html document i'll create a couple labels label id this will be x label then close this label add a line break i'll add two more y label and z label then i'll create a button close the tag type equals button id equals roll button then i will add some text to the button roll make sure to save heading back to our javascript file when we click on this button we will execute a function so we need to select our button document dot get element by id the name of our button is roll button dot on click equals set the sql to a function parentheses curly braces let's copy these lines of code we don't need to declare these again let's get rid of this text we'll declare the variables at the top so after rolling three random numbers between one and six i will update our labels x label y label and z label we need to select each of these labels document dot get element by id xlabel dot inner html set the sequel to x then do the same thing with y and z make sure to change the labels to y label equals y z label equals z so make sure to save both of your files oh i'm forgetting z there okay so now when i press this button we will roll three dice and we end up with three random numbers between one and six so yeah that's how to generate some random numbers in javascript if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
