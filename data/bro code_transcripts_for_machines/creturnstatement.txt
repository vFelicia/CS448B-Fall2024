hey what's going on people so the return statement the return statement returns a value back to a calling function here's an example i have a function named square square is going to accept one argument a double it's going to square that double and return the result back to the calling function so here's an example let's say we have double x and i'm going to call the square function and then pass in some value let's say 3.14 so when we call a function we can also return a value back to the spot in which we call the function so within our square function let's set double result equal to x times x effectively squaring it so to return a value back to the calling function we will use this return keyword followed by some value or variable i would like to return result however we need to list the data type of what we're returning within the function declaration right now it's void so if we're returning a double we will list double here if this was an integer we would return int if it was a character we would return char you kind of get the idea so result is a double so we need to change this from void to double and we will return this result back to the calling function so we're effectively stating that double x equals 3.14 squared and then let's print the result so printf the format specifier for a double is lf and we will print x and 3.14 squared is 9.859 now you could shorten this too we could just say return x times x instead of declaring a local variable return x times x and that would work the same so yeah that's basically the return statement you can place it within a function and return a value or variable back to the calling function and the spot in which you invoked that function but if you're going to return a value or variable within the function declaration you need to change void to the data type of what you're returning so yeah that is the return statement and you may have noticed within our main function we're returning 0 0 is the exit status if this program runs successfully so instead of void with our main function declaration we have int because 0 is technically an integer so yeah that's the return statement if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below well yeah that's the return statement in c
