hello again people today I'm going to be explaining Wild Card characters there are two the percent and the underscore each of these is used to substitute one or more characters in a string here's an example I have a table of employees what if I need to find any employees whose first name begins with an S well you would think you could write something like this where first name is equal to s now this technically doesn't work here what we're doing is telling MySQL to find any first names that are equal to the character s if I instead need to find any first names that begin with the character S I can type S then the percent wildcard operator the percent wildcard operator represents any number of random characters but there's one more change we need to make still replace the equals operator with the like operator like when used with an aware Clause searches any patterns we will return any first names that begin with the letter s so the results are Squidward SpongeBob Sandy Sheldon their first names all begin with the letter s we could do this with dates too let's find any higher dates in the year 2023 technically that would return everything in my example because all the higher dates are in 2023. we can even find if something ends with a character let's find any last names that end with the character r that would return Patrick star star with an r at the end you could add more than one character let's find any first names that start with SP then change last name to first name that would return one result SpongeBob SP on the other hand we have the underscore wildcard character the underscore wildcard character represents one random letter let's find any jobs that have one random character followed by oh okay that would return any Cooks the underscore kind of reminds me of that game Wheel of Fortune MySQL is going to attempt to fill in any blanks with a matching character if we had two underscores well there technically wouldn't be any matches MySQL would technically be looking for a fiveletter word where the middle three characters are oh okay but there's no matches here's another example find any higher dates in January higher date is like the year is going to be random we have four digits one two three four a dash character zero one Dash then a day of the month so two underscores again that would return pretty much all of our employees they were all hired in January maybe we don't care about the year or the month but we care about the day of the month so let's replace the month with underscores zero two that would return Mr Krabs zero three that would be Squidward now you could combine these two different wild cards together too let's take a look at our jobs let's find any jobs where the second character is an a I know it's kind of a weird example but hopefully it'll make sense select all from employees where job is like now we're going to combine these two wild characters the second character has to be an a we could use the underscore for the first character a then any amount of random characters afterwards that would return a manager cashier or janitor so yeah those are wild card characters you can use these to substitute one or more characters in a string it's pretty helpful if you need to find if a string starts with some value or ends with some value and those are wild card characters and MySQL
