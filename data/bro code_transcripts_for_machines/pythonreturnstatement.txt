hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the return statement in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright people let's begin the return statement is used within functions to send python values or objects back to the caller these values or objects are known as the function's return value so do you know how with functions we can pass arguments to a function and then our function can do something with those arguments well not only that but our function can pass some value or object back to the caller so what we'll do for this example is create a function that will simply multiply two numbers together and return the result back to the caller so let's define a function called multiply and we'll set up two parameters for this function let's say number one and number two and what we'll do is say result equals number one times number two and then at the end we can return something what do we want to return let's return whatever the result is now when we call this function we will pass in two values as arguments let's say we would like to multiply six times eight so when we run this while we can't actually see anything when we return the result after multiplying numbers one and two it's going to return the result back to the caller in order to see the value that is returned back to the caller one way in which we can do this is to print the value that is returned within a print statement so what we'll do is print the value that is returned after calling the multiply function so 6 times 8 is really great 6 times 8 is 48 now one other thing that we can do is store the returned value within a variable so let's say x equals multiply 6 times 8 and then we will print whatever x is so the result is still the same of 48 now with the return value there is another way in which we could write this that uses less lines of code so we'll delete this first line and instead of returning a variable called result what we'll do is just return number one times number two and this would work the same as it does before but it's written in less lines of code so that's another way in which you could write this all right everybody so that is the return statement functions can send python values or objects back to the caller these values or objects are known as the function's return value you can either print this value directly to the console window or you can store it within a variable or some other location and well ladies and gentlemen that is how the return statement works in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
