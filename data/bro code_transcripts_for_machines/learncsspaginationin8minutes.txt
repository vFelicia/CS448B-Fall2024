hey everybody today I need to explain pagination in HTML and CSS pagination is the method by which a document is separated into pages and numbers are given using pagination on a website we can move between Pages easily it's kind of like you're reading a book each page has a number pagination might also be useful on your web page if you need to limit the results maybe you only want so many results per page then you can easily navigate between the pages there's many different uses so let's begin we'll start with our index file I will create an H1 element with the title of this is page number one then we'll create some sample text within a paragraph element I'll type lorem then hit tab to generate some text usually with pagination it's found at the bottom of a web page so that's a good place for it right here there's many different ways in which we can create pagination but using only what we know so far that I've covered in this series here's one way we'll create a development with a class of pagination then be sure to close it within this development we'll create several hyperlinks we'll need an a tag I'll set the href attribute just to be empty for now and then we'll close it for this example let's create a total of seven links we have one two three four five six seven beginning with the second link that will be one then two three four five for my first link I'll use a left angle bracket this is so we can navigate backwards depending on what page we're on and with the last link I'll use a right angle bracket so we can navigate forwards we'll revisit this page let's head to our style sheet the first thing I'm going to do is Center all of these links within my div element I'm selecting my class of pagination I will use the text align property set it to Center then I would like to style all of these links these hyperlinks we're starting with our pagination class then I would like any a elements found within the pagination class let's change the color I will set the color to be black let's eliminate the text decoration that is the underlining text decoration none I'll add a little bit of padding eight pixels by 15 pixels I will display these elements as an inline block basically by setting these elements to have a display property of inline block we can adjust the width and height of these elements but what we have is good already alright so far so good going back to our HTML file I'm going to make one change we're beginning with page one that's our index file with this anchor tag I will set the class to be active within our CSS file we're taking our pagination class find all a elements within our pagination class then find any active classes so it's going to look a little strange within the pagination class within any anchor tags find the class that's active so in this case it would be page one I will change the background color of that element background color let's pick a greenish color but feel free to pick any color you like that's pretty good let's try and make the font weight bold I want to see what that looks like okay not bad this part's optional but I'll add a border radius around this element the one that's currently highlighted border radius 5 pixel seems fine yeah that looks pretty good all right now if any element is not active we can style them this part's going to look a little strange select the pagination class with any a elements we will use the hover pseudo class if these elements are hovered over but they're not active then I'd like to highlight them we'll use the not pseudo class find any elements that are not within the active class I will change the background color to something maybe Gray like that then I'll add a border radius of 5 pixels when we hover over these inactive links they should change in color let me make that a little bit lighter though that looks pretty good now we need some functionality for these pages if we click on one that should take us to our first file which is named index.html or it could be named something else for you the second link will bring us to a page named page two which we still need to create then page 3.html page4.html page five dot HTML now with these back and forwards buttons we can easily navigate through pages using JavaScript but unfortunately we really don't know JavaScript at this point at this point in time the easiest way for us to move forwards or backwards using these arrows is to list a specific file if we're on page one and we need to move forwards that will bring us to page two for the last hyperlink I will set that to be page 2. if we're on page one then we hit the backwards button while we're really not going to go anywhere we can either leave this link empty or we can refresh the page just by listing the page that we're currently on now we need to create these pages what I'm going to do is go to our website folder I will copy this index file paste it then rename this copy as page2.html let's copy page two paste it change page to copy to page three we're going to do this all the way until we reach page five now if we go to page two let's change the title to be page two the back button will bring us to our index file also known as page 1 in this case let's set the class of active to be within the anchor tag page two then if we move forwards we want to go to page three so then if we go to page three if we move backwards we're going to page two set the class that's currently active to be on page three then if we go forwards we're on page four oh be sure to change the title too I forgot one two three we're good then on page four this is Page four if we move backwards we're going to go to page three change the class to reflect page four if we move forwards we'll go to page five then lastly on page five this is page five if we move backwards we're going to page four move the class over to page five then we can't really go forwards so I'm just going to set the forward button to be page five again just to refresh it or you can eliminate it either way all right let's see if this works be sure to save everything so we should be able to move between the pages by clicking on these buttons or the arrows we're on page one we can go to page two three four five we can also use the arrows two three four five four three two one all right everybody so that's pagination it's a method by which a document is separated into pages and that is simple pagination in CSS
