hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can accept some user input in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right here's how we can accept some user input now when we do accept user input it's of the string data type so let's create a variable to hold and store our input let's create a variable named name and we will ask the user for what their name is now to read some user input type console dot read line then parentheses semicolon so when the user types in something then hits enter we will take that user input and store it within this variable name which we can then use for something so within a writeline statement let's use the user's name for something hello plus name and let's take a look okay now to enter in some user input we'll have to type this into the console directly however it is good practice to let the user know what we want them to type in exactly because how's the views are supposed to know that they're supposed to type in their name right here so what we'll do is preceding our readline statement let's create a prompt to tell the user what we want them to type in so within a writeline statement let's say what's your name and then try this again okay what's your name now the user knows that they have to type in their name so type in your first name hit enter hello whatever your first name is okay this time let's accept a user's age and then we'll typecast the user's age into an integer variable so let's copy what we have paste it console.writeline what's your edge and we'll create a new variable of the int data type named age now we'll need to cast this user input into an integer so to do that we would type convert dot 2 and 32 parentheses semicolon now take this statement without the semicolon cut it and then paste it within the parentheses so what we're doing is accepting some user input then converting it to an integer that we're storing within this variable edge and then we will display the user's age console.writeline u r plus age plus years old then let's run this again so our program is actually going to wait at each prompt until the user types something in so what's your name bro let's say that i'm 21 i'll hit enter hello bro you are 21 years old now one issue that you may run into is if the user types in something that's nonnumeric and we try and convert it so let's try this again what's your name bro and instead of an age what if i type in a word like pizza this will cause an exception an exception will interrupt our program and this specific exception is a format exception input string was not in a correct format so there will be a future video on handling exceptions which will prevent the program from pausing and being interrupted but that's a future video in the meantime we'll just have to be sure that we're entering in the correct user input well okay then everybody that's how to accept some user input in csharp i will post this code to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to accept user input in c sharp
