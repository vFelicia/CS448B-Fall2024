we have a big topic today i need to discuss arrays an array is a data structure that can hold multiple values values are accessed by an index number think of an array as kind of like a variable that holds multiple values it's a little more complicated than that but that's a good way of thinking about them perhaps we have the name of a car this will be a standard string i will name this car assign this a value of whatever card that you like one card that i like is a corvette then i will display whatever our car is standard output car so of course this car is a corvette we can transform this variable into an array by making the following changes after the variable name add a set of square brackets then enclose your values with a set of curly braces there we now have an array my variable car is now an array now this variable can hold multiple values multiple cars kind of like it's a parking garage separate each value with a comma this time i'll add a mustang then a camry now take a look at this i will display car now what the heck is this so this is a memory address of where our array is located like one two three fake street if i need one of these elements one of these values that's found within the array in order to access it i have to do so by an index number after the array name i will add a set of square brackets then an index number the first element in an array has an index of zero because computers always start with zero and we have our corvette it's kind of like a parking spot number that's why i went with this example of cars if i need the next element within my array i would access element number one then i should probably add a new line just to separate these new line we have our corvette and our mustang then we have our third element which would have an index of two so we have our three elements our corvette our mustang and our camry you can reassign values too i'm going to change the first element within this array take the array name select an index number i'll set the sequel to a camaro a chevy camaro now at parking spot number 0 we have our camaro then our mustang then our camry i'm going to rename car as cars just so people know that it's plural although it's not necessary one thing with arrays is that they can only contain values of the same data type like i'll try and stick a number within here number one so our compiler doesn't like it that there's a number in here with all these strings so arrays should all be of the same data type now if you don't know what you want to place within an array you can simply declare an array then assign values later i'm going to declare an array of cars and then later assign some values cars at index one will have our mustang cars at index two will be our camry see we still have an error though array size missing and cars you can declare an array then assign values later we need to set a size to this array it's a static data structure if i'm only going to place three cars within this array i'll set the size to be three so within the square brackets you can set an array size and this would work the same you can declare an array be sure to set the size and then assign values later let's try one last example i'm going to create an array of prices these will be of the double data type prices add a set of square brackets i'll go ahead and assign these values right away so i don't need to declare a size explicitly make up some prices five dollars seven dollars and fifty cents nine dollars and ninety nine cents then fifteen dollars i'll display these prices standard output prices i'll list an index number of what element i'm trying to access the first would be zero then i'll add a new line let's copy this line of code and paste it a couple more times we have prices at index zero that is the first element then one two and three and here are the prices so yeah that's an array think of it as a variable that can hold multiple values it's a little more complicated than that it's a type of data structure but that's a good way of thinking about them to change a variable into an array after the variable name add a set of square brackets place your values within a set of curly braces that's if you're assigning values right away or otherwise you can set a size and then assign values later that's another option so yeah those are arrays your assignment is to post an array in the comments section down below and well yeah those are arrays in c plus plus
