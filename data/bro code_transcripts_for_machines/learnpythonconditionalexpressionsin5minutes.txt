hey everybody so today I got to explain conditional expressions in Python a conditional expression is a oneline shortcut for using an IFL statement if you're familiar with other programming languages this is also known as the tary operator it behaves similarly using conditional Expressions we can print or assign one of two values based on a condition here's the formula return X if our condition is true else return y here's a basic example we will create a variable for number just num let's say our number is five I'm going to print then within our print statement I will write a conditional expression following this formula I'll just copy and paste it let's check to see if our number is positive let's print the text positive if our condition what are we checking let's check to see if num is greater than zero that means it's positive if this condition is false we will instead print whatever comes after else else negative number is five that will print positive if our number was Nega five well this condition would be false we would instead print negative let's go over another let's check to see if our number is even or odd let's set numb to be six this time I will assign the result to a variable our result equals take our formula let's assign even if our num modulus 2 is our number divisible by two does that equal zero else return odd then let's print our result result number six that is even if it's five then it's odd assign even if our number is divisible by two else return odd let's create variables A and B A will equal 6 B will equal 7 let's create a variable of Max num equals follow our formula again return variable a if a is greater than b else return B between A and B which is the maximum number that would be B of seven let's find the minimum this time Min num a if a is less than b else return B the minimum number between six and seven is six this time we'll take an age age equals 25 we will create a variable of status equals use our formula again return a string of adult if our age is greater than or equal to 18 else return a string of child then we will print our status our age is 25 that's greater than or equal to 18 we will print adult if our age was 13 then we are a child we will instead return child let's work with the temperature temperature equals 30Â° C so that's hot let's create a variable of weather assign a string of hot if our temperature is greater than 20 else we will return a string of cold what's the weather outside today based on the temperature it is hot if our temperature was 20 then the weather is cold okay last example we will work with a user role I will set this to be admin we will Define a variable of access level equals again follow our formula return the text of full access if our condition of user role is equal to a string of admin else we will return limited access our user role is an admin let's print our access level and we have full access but what if we were a guest well then we have limited access all right everybody those are conditional Expressions they're a oneline shortcut for the if else statement it's similar to the tary operator and other programming languages using conditional Expressions we can print or assign one of two values based on a condition you follow the formula of return X if our condition is true else return y if it's false and well everybody those are a few examples of condition expressions in Python
