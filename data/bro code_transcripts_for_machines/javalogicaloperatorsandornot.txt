hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to discuss the three logical operators the and the or and the not logical operators so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's discuss logical operators these can be used to connect two or more expressions and there are currently three that i'm going to discuss the and logical operator which is two ampersands the or logical operator which is two straight bars and lastly the not logical operator which is an exclamation point let's begin with the and logical operator we can check to see if two or more conditions are true if both conditions are true an entire statement will evaluate to be true here's an example let's say we have an integer called temperature temp for short and we'll set this to 25 degrees celsius let's write an ifelse if statement to check to see what the temperature is and display a message based on the result so let's check to see if our temp is greater than 35 actually let's make that 30. if temp is greater than 30 then we will display it is hot outside so how can we check to see if our temperature is within a certain range well we could use the and logical operator to do so next let's write an else if statement and this time we're going to have two conditions not just one so first we'll check to see if our temp is greater than or equal to let's say 20. and we would like to check to see if our temp is less than or equal to 30. so in order for this statement to be true both conditions must be true that's why we're using the and logical operator this side as well as this side both of these conditions need to be true for this entire statement to evaluate as true so if our temperature falls within this range let's display a message it is warm outside and then else it's cold outside system that outside print line it is cold outside and let's try it so currently our temperature is 25 and when we run this it displays it's warm outside if our temperature was 35 then it's going to display it is hot outside if it's less than 20 well then this portion is going to evaluate to be false but this portion will evaluate to be true so therefore this entire statement will be false then since both conditions must be true so if our temperature is 15 which is cold it's going to display it is cold outside that is the and logical operator for a statement to be true both conditions must be true next up to bet we have the or logical operator this will check to see if one or more conditions is true if at least one of the conditions is true then the entire statement is true then so do you remember those old computer games like oregon trail where you usually had to type q to quit the game well let's replicate something like that via a scanner so let's accept some user input scanner scanner equals new scanner within the parenthesis system.in and we will need an import import java.util.scanner so we will ask the user if they want to quit the game and in order to do so you have to press either lowercase q or uppercase q but we'll need a prompt first you are playing a game press lowercase q or uppercase q to quit and we will store our answer within a variable let's call this response string response equals scanner dot next next we'll store the next key that you press within a variable a string variable so let's check to see if our response is equal to lowercase q or uppercase q if then within the condition of the if statement our response and with strings to check to see if two strings are equal you need to use the equals method it's a little bit different with strings if our response is equal to lowercase q we're going to use the or logical operator if our response is equal to uppercase q then that means the user wants to quit the game you quit the game else they still want to play the game so we'll print a different message you are still playing the game puke you and let's test this you are playing a game press q or q to quit so i'm just going to type no and it says you are still playing the game but you know what this game is kind of lame so i'm going to press lowercase q to quit it states you quit the game on the other hand i could have pressed uppercase q to quit the game so let's try that uppercase q you quit the game so with the orological operator as long as one of these conditions is true then this entire statement will evaluate to be true and last but not least we have the not logical operator which is represented by an exclamation point this will reverse the boolean value of a condition so using the not logical operator we could make some changes to how our program is written so if we precede these conditions with the not logical operator this will reverse the boolean value that these evaluate too so we're checking to see if our response is not equal to q or our response is not equal to uppercase q and then we should probably change this middle logical operator to be and so if our response does not equal lowercase q and our response does not equal uppercase q then that means this person this user still wants to play the game else they are going to quit the game so this will work much the same you are playing a game press q or q to quit no because this is a fun game on second thought this game is in fact kind of lame so i'm going to press q to quit the game you quit the game so that is what the not logical operator is if you precede something with the not logical operator it's going to reverse the boolean value based on what it's going to resolve to so in this case we check to see if our response does not equal lowercase q and our response does not equal uppercase q then this person still wants to play the game else they're going to quit the game so those are the three logical operators the and logical operator the or logical operator as well as the not logical operator if you would like a copy of all this code i will post everything in the comments down below please be sure to do me a favor and smash that like
