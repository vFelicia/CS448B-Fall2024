hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here and in this video what I think we're gonna do is cover text formatting in HTML let's get into it so change of plans I said in the last video we will be covering fonts but I'm thinking we will save that for later when we get closer to CSS what I'll be doing for this video is teaching you guys from basic text formatting techniques this will include formatting elements such as bold italic underline and even marked which can highlight text which is pretty cool I would say so this will be a shorter lesson and I will showcase many of the formatting elements that are actually available to you in HTML so let's begin by adding some normal text to the screen here so we'll say this is normal text so do you know when you're conducting a science experiment you usually have some sort of control which you don't actually perform any tests on or changes this is kind of like our controls this will be just some normal text that's not formatted so let's save this refresh the page and it just says this is some normal text here but we'll probably also want to add a line break afterwards just so we can move down to the next line as if we were hitting Enter so just type in be are within angle brackets and based on the last lesson that is the tag for a line break so let's go down to the next line we have the bold tag so we'll say this is bold text now you put the letter B with an angle brackets and surround whatever you want to be bold so make sure you have an opening tag and a closing tag so it says this is bold text and then let's add a line break just because we want to go down to the next line so let's save this refresh the page and it says this is bold text and whatever we surrounded with the bold tag this text is now bold compared to the rest of the text and you can compare that to the normal text that we have at the top here whatever we have surrounded with the bold tags is now bold and it's going to be the same process with italic tags too so we'll say this is italic text and then add a line break all right so then we will put I within angle brackets and then we need to close this save it refresh the page this is italic text so are you guys starting to see a pattern here I promise I'll cover some more interesting text formatting elements too I have maybe about ten or so to cover so let's cover subscripts so this is sub script text so whatever you want to be a subscript just type in su be with an angle brackets and on this line the text is slightly smaller and it's moved down there's also superscript think of it like an exponent this is super script text and you're gonna type in sup like you're saying sup Tier one your friends so this is super script text so it's slightly smaller and it's like moved upwards all right then there is small text this is small text this one's fairly simple you just type in small within angle brackets and then close it this is small text guess what there's also big big elements so big this is big text and then line break yep and the word big is slightly bigger than the rest of the text we also have inserted text this is inserted I can't spell inserted text then you type i ns within angle brackets so this will give it the appearance of being underlined all right there's also deleted text so this is deleted text then you type in de L within angle brackets and this will put a align through the text that is deleted okay and lastly this one's my favorite this is marked text this is a marked text so we're going to put the word mark with an angle brackets and then a closing tag so what this will do is that this will highlight something as if you're using a highlighter which i think is pretty cool so you just use the mark tag for that so with these text formatting elements you'll want to be sure that you're also including a closing tag wherever you want the formatting to end because look what happens if I forget to close the bold formatting tag so I'm going to take that out save it and refresh this page you can now see that everything where this tag started is now bold so you want to be sure to put a closing tag wherever you want the effect of this tag to end for example we wanted to end after this bold tag but you can place this wherever you want but I'm saying that if you forget to close it the rest of the text that comes after this opening tag is going to be affected by it so make sure to close these tags when appropriate actually I'm curious as to what this looks like what if I move the opening tag for the mark text formatting element to the very beginning and the closing at the very end I wonder what this looks like oh yeah that's kind of cool everything's highlighted it's kind of like in school or college if there is an entire paragraph that you have to highlight this is kind of what that reminds me of so that could have some uses that's kind of cool all right well that's some of the basics of text formatting elements in HTML I'll post the code that I have in the comments down below but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started with text formatting in HTML hey you if you enjoyed
