hey what's going on everybody so in today's video I'm going to show you how we can calculate execution time in Python say there's some code we would like to measure I wrote a little comment that says your code goes here what we're going to do is measure the time before and after The Code by finding the difference between these two points that will give us the elapse time so in this example we're going to need the help of the time module we will import time preceding the code we would like to measure we're going to create a variable named start time equals we will access the time modules performance counter method this method will return an arbitrary point in time following our code we need to get the end time I will assign that to a variable again we're going to access the time modules performance counter method we will create an elapse time variable elapse time equals the end time minus the start time how much time has passed then we will print I'll use an F string the elapsed time is I'll add a placeholder I will display our elapse time then the word seconds all right currently I don't have any code that we're measuring our elapse time is going to be an extremely small number I don't even know what number that is it's 5.2 e to the 6th power all right now we need some code to measure in this example for our code let's create a for Loop for I in range we will iterate this Loop 1 million times all we'll do is pass we won't do anything in this program how long does 1 million iterations of a loop take 06 seconds how about 10 million 7 Seconds 100 million this might take a little bit 6.8 seconds just to clean up the output I'm going to add a format specifier we're going to display one digit after the decimal I'll add. 1f 6.7 seconds all right everybody so that's how you can calculate execution time in Python before the code you would like to measure use the performance counter method to give you a start time after your code use that method again to give you an end time subtract the start time from the end time to give you the elapse time and well everybody that's how to calculate execution time in Python
