all right welcome back we're talking about the conditional operator which is represented by a question mark so the conditional operator is used in conditional assignment if a condition is true or false and we follow this formula we have some sort of condition or expression then we add a question mark kind of like we're asking a question is this true if it is do x if not do y so we'll write a simple program to check the temperature outside so we'll write this using an ifelse statement first and then later on we'll use the conditional operator and take a look at the differences so let's say we have a double named temperature and i'll set this equal to 20 degrees celsius as well as a string message i will declare this but not yet assign it so what if we would like to assign our variable message a custom message based on the temperature well if we're using if else statements that would look like this so we need a condition if temperature is greater than or equal to let's say 15 degrees celsius then we will assign message a string message equals it's warm outside else message equals it's cold outside and then at the end i would like to display my message within a writeline statement console that write line message and this will work just fine no issues so my temperature is currently 20 and this will print the message it's warm outside now there is a way to shorten this and that's by using a conditional operator so if we were to take that approach we would have to follow this formula so let me just copy this we need our condition our condition is temperature is greater than or equal to 15. question mark like we're asking a question if it's true then do this so we will take its form outside in place of x if not then we'd do this it's cold outside but these are returning values so we need to assign them to something so we will say message equals this is our condition temperature greater than or equal to 15 question mark if that's true assign this if not assign that and that's all there is to it and we don't really need all of this anymore and then i will display my message within a redline statement and this will do the same thing it's warm outside you could even take this a step further too you could place just this within a writeline statement and get rid of the message completely we don't even really need that message variable so yeah that's the conditional operator you can use this in conditional assignment if you need to assign some variable if some condition that you set is true or false it's kind of like a shortcut so yeah that's the conditional operator in c sharp
