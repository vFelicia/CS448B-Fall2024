all right we're back at it again so let's talk about while loops a while loop will repeat a section of code possibly unlimited times we will continue some section of code while some condition remains true and it's possible that a while loop might not execute at all depending on what our condition is so here's an example let's create a program that will ask a user for their name if they attempt to skip that prompt then we will keep on asking them for their name indefinitely so here's how we can write a program like that using a while loop we'll need to begin with a character array let's say name and this will be 25 bytes and we will create a prompt using printf what's your name we can use scanf for user input but with names that may contain spaces i'm going to use fgets instead refer to the video on user input to learn more about fgets so i would like to assign my variable name set the size of the user input 25 to match what we have then type stdn for standard input then we just need to get rid of the newline character at the end of our user input so we can write something like this set our character array of name and within the straight brackets we will use the string length function pass in name 1 and we will set this equal to a null character and then at the end we will display the user's name printf let's say hello and then use a format specifier for strings which is s and we will display a user's name okay this is what this looks like currently what's your name i'll type my name hit enter and it says hello bro now what if i don't type in anything like i just hit enter what's your name i'm going to hit enter hello and then there is no name here how can i force a user to type in something well i could use a while loop and that will prompt a user to enter their name indefinitely so here's how to create a while loop type while parentheses curly braces and we need a condition what are we going to check we will continue this while loop while some condition remains true our condition to check to see if we have an empty string we could use the string length function pass in name and check to see if this is equal to zero if it is zero that means that somebody just hit enter without typing in anything so let's print a message to yell at them you did not enter your name and then let's copy this section of code and paste it to reprompt the user to type in their name and that's all there is to it so while this condition remains true we will execute this code forever so let's try it again okay what's your name i'm going to hit enter you did not enter your name what's your name no no no no okay i give up hello whatever your name is so yeah that's basically a while loop it repeats a section of code possibly unlimited times there's a lot of overlap where you could use either a for loop or a while loop and we execute some body of code while some condition remains true however a while loop might not execute at all if this condition is false to begin with so if the user actually does type in something well this condition is false and we do not execute this body of code so yeah that's a while loop it repeats a section of code possibly unlimited times if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are while loops in c
