what is going on everybody so today I got to talk about inheritance in Python inheritance allows a class to inherit the attributes and methods from another class much like how a child in real life can inherit traits from A parent by having a class inherit attributes and methods from another class this helps with code reusability and extensibility in this example we're going to create an animal class the dog cat and mouse class will inherit attributes and methods from the animal class we will create a class of animal then I will Define the Constructor when we construct an animal object let's pass in a name it's not required but it might be good for this example we will assign the attribute of name equal to the name we receive let's also add an attribute of is alive whenever we create an animal we will set there is a live attribute to be true and that is a capital T all animals can eat Define eat we will print using an F string at a placeholder self. name the name of this animal is eating all animals should be able to sleep Define sleep print I'll use an FST string insert self. name is sleeping and that is all we need for the animal class let's define class dog for a child class to inherit the attributes and methods from another class after the class name that's going to inherit we need to add an inheritance list with the set of parentheses then list the name of the class we're inheriting from the parent the dog class is going to inherit all of the attributes and methods of its parent animal for the time being as a placeholder I'll add pass just to demonstrate this class cat is also going to inherit from animal and class Mouse will also inherit from animal okay I will collapse this for now we'll create a dog object dog equals dog then pass it a name for this dog because we have one parameter set up of name this dog will be named Scooby as in ScoobyDoo cat equals call the cat Constructor this cat will be named Garfield and mouse mouse equals Mouse our Mouse will have a name of Mickey even though there's nothing within this dog cat or Mouse class we should still have these attributes and these methods if you inherit the animal class you should have a name attribute and is alive attribute set to true you can eat and you can sleep let's print our dog's name dog. name Scooby Print Dog dot is alive our dog is alive that is true let's have our dog object use the eat method Scooby is eating and sleep dog dos sleep scoy is sleeping let's replace dog with cat the name of the cat is Garfield Garfield is alive Garfield is eating Garfield is sleeping and mouse replace any instance of cat with mouse our mouse's name is Mickey Mickey is alive Mickey is eating Mickey is sleeping even though these children classes are empty we're still inheriting these attributes and methods from its parent of animal this is convenient because you don't need to copy and paste these attributes and methods for every single class for example if I were to copy these attributes and methods and paste them well we have a lot more code to write and as a a consequence if I need to make a change to one of these methods I would have to do that to every single instance of this method for example let's replace is sleeping with is asleep well now I need to find every single Sleep Method and change it manually it's not too bad if you only have a few classes but imagine if you have hundreds of classes that's going to take a lot of work it's a lot easier to write the code once and then reuse it and I only need to make that change in one place rather than make that change many times so let's change is sleeping to is asleep and see if that works again Mickey is asleep let's replace Mouse with dog Scooby is asleep not only that but with children classes they can have their own attributes and methods that are different from one another so dogs have all these attributes and methods and they can speak let's create a speak method and I will print a unique message for dogs woof cats will also have a speak method but it's going to be different cats will meow then for our Mouse class they will squeak let's have our dog speak woof let's have our cat speak meow and our Mouse squeak all right everybody so that's an introduction to inheritance inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class much like in real life a child can inherit traits from A parent these are also known as sub and super classes which is a topic for another day inheritance helps with code reusability and extensibility if all of these children classes inherit these attributes and methods from another class we only need to write that code once and not copy it for every single class that needs it we can write and change the code in one place for better reusability and extensibility and well everybody that is an introduction to inheritance in Python
