hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to discuss classes in csharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right classes a class is really just a bundle of related code that you would like to organize together it can be used as a blueprint to create objects with objectoriented programming but we'll discuss that in the next video so my main method is located within a class named program the point of this class is well to group my program together but there are classes too that have certain functions for example the math class the purpose of the math class is to contain a bunch of useful methods related to mathematics and let's take a look at this so this class is named math and all that's in here is a bunch of methods related to mathematics so that's kind of the point of this class but we can create our own classes too now to create a class we can either do so outside of our class program or create a class within a separate csharp file i'll show you both ways so to create a class make sure that we're not writing this within our class program so that ends here type class and let's create a class to group a bunch of useful messages together like message methods class messages curly braces and let's create a few methods related to messages so this is going to be more of like a utility class void hello and when we use this method let's display a message like hello welcome to the program and let's create maybe two more void hello void what about waiting like we're waiting for something i am waiting for something and what about goodbye void bye bye thanks for visiting if you would like to create a class within a separate csharp file i would recommend opening your solution explorer if you don't have that open you can find it here go to view solution explorer right click on your namespace add class class and then i will name this messages add okay then i'm going to take my code from within this class cut it delete my class and then paste it within this class messages so you can either write your class within the same c file or a different one if i would like to use some of these methods found within the messages class there's one of two things that i need to do i either need to create an object from this class or i need to precede my class definition with the word static followed by everything within my messages class so we'll talk about creating objects in the next video so for now we'll just have to use the static keyword and i'll create a separate video on this too and we should now be able to use these methods found within my messages class so if i need to display a hello message i would type the name of the class that would be messages then dot to access the members however these are not visible so we need to make them public and that'll be a separate video on axis modifiers so i would like this to be a public method so precede static with public and we should now be able to see those methods so type messages again dot and here are those methods i would like to use the hello method and that will display my message hello welcome to the program i also have that waiting message messages dot and that was waiting as well as goodbye messages dot bye so hello welcome to the program i am waiting for something bye thanks for visiting so basically a class is just a bundle of related code and it can be used as a blueprint to create objects otherwise you can use a class more or less as a utility class but when you define your class you'll have to precede the class definition with the word static and to make this public and accessible you would have to precede each method with public and static so yeah those are classes they're really just a bundle of related code you can use them as a utility class or use them as a blueprint to create objects which we'll discuss in another video if you found this video helpful please help me by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and well yeah those are classes in c sharp
