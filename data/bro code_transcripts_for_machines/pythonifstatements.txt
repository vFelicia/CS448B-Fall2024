hey what's going on people it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain if statements else if statements and else statements in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people let's talk about if statements an if statement is a block of code that will execute only if its condition is true it's a very basic form of decision making with programming for this example let's create a prompt where we will ask a user for their age and depending on what their age is we will print a response so let's say age equals input and then we will add a prompt how old are you now this will return a string so we should probably cast this as an integer data type so we now have a variable called age where we will accept some user input let's check somebody's age with a variety of if statements so let's check to see if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 18 so to create an if statement type if and then some sort of condition if age is greater than or equal to 18 to finish this if statement add a colon at the end now pay attention to this if i move down to the next line you'll notice that my cursor is now indented any indented code underneath an if statement is the block of code for that if statement so if this condition is true we will execute some block of code if it's false we'll skip over it so if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 18 let's print you are an adult and let's try this program how old are you let's say i'm 21. so my condition when we get to the if statement is going to check to see if this condition is true if it is true we're going to execute this block of code if it's not we skip over it so how old are you let's say i'm 21 i'm going to hit enter and my if statement is true so we execute this block of code which prints you are an adult so what if this condition is false let's say i'm 12 well then we're just going to skip over this block of code and continue on with the rest of the program if you would like your program to take some other course of action if this condition is false we can add an else statement so after the if statement add else make sure you get the indentation right you don't want this within the block of code for the if statement so if this condition is false we can take some other course of action so if somebody's age is less than 18 let's print you are a child so let's try this again i'm going to enter that i am 12 years old not really but let's just pretend i am so this will now print you are a child if this condition is false perform this block of code for the else statement so with if statements we can check more than one condition before reaching the else statement by using an else if statement and we add that after an if statement so it's shortened to e l i f for else if so let's check to see if somebody's age is less than zero for some reason so let's print you haven't been born yet so with if statements we start at the top we first check the if statement if this is false we move down to the next statement to check then we check our else if statement if this is also false then we resort to the else statement the else statement is sort of like a last resort if all conditions evaluate to be false then we execute the else statement so let's try this how old are you let's say i'm negative 1 years old you haven't been born yet so with if statements we always begin with an if statement and we check that condition if that condition evaluates to be false then we will skip this block of code and move down to the else if statement if there is one it's optional if this condition is also false then we will use our else statement as a last resort if there is one if there is no else statement then we just skip over all of this then and continue on with the rest of the program so you can add more than one else if statement so let's check something else let's check to see else if age is equal to 100 so if you need to check to see if a value is equal to a particular value make sure you use double equal signs this is the comparison operator for equality if you use just one equal sign that's the assignment operator and python thinks you're attempting to set age equal to 100 so if you want to check to see if age is equal to 100 then use double equals so let's check to see if somebody's age is equal to 100 so let's print you are a century old now pay attention to this if i were to run this program how old are you let's say i'm 100. so this is printing you are an adult that's because we first check our if statement and well we're 100 years old and 100 is greater than or equal to 18. so we print this block of code we execute this block of code and then we skip everything else even though age is equal to 100 within our else if statement so the order of your if statements does matter so let's change this around let's add this to the very beginning and this will be our if statement and we will set age is greater than or equal to 18 to be an else if statement so we're first going to check to see if age is equal to 100 if not we will check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18. and we just follow that order so let's try this again how old are you i am 100 years old you are a century old so we first check our if statement if this condition is true we will execute this block of code if it's false we just go down the order till we reach our else statement well everybody that is the basics of if statements we have if statements else if statements and else statements so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that is how if statements work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if
