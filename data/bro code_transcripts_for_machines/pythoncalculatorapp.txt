what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create a basic calculator using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm let's create a calculator after importing tkinter we'll need to define three separate functions our first function will be named button press and there is one parameter which we will call num we're not going to fill this in quite yet we'll get back to it later we'll use pass as a placeholder we'll also need an equals function to calculate our expression and a function to clear our calculator okay that's it for our three functions let's create a window window equals tk and at the end of our program we'll write window.midloop let's set a title window dot title calculator programs good but make sure you spell title right and let's set a geometry of 500 by 500 should be decent now we're going to create a string named equation text equals a set of quotes this will effectively be empty for the time being and we'll need to create a string var and i will call this equation label equals string var let's create a label label equals label we're adding our label to our window i will set our text variable equal to our equation label you can pick a font if you wish i'll set the background color equal to white a width of 24 and a height of two and we need to finish this by using label dot pack and we should have a blank label within our calculator this will display our numbers that we're entering in or our expression okay this is the tedious part we have to create all of the buttons and i think we should place these all within a frame frame equals frame we're adding our frame to our window frame dot pack now let's create button one we'll do some copying and pasting later so it's not as tedious so button one equals button we're adding our button to our frame i'll set the text equal to one the height equal to four and the width equal to nine and a font size of 35 okay we'll need a command command equals i'll write a lambda function here lambda we will call button press actually i think i'm going to put this on the next line just so it's easier to read button press and we will pass in the number one and we need to add our button to our frame button one dot grid and i'm going to set a row equal to zero and a column equal to zero and let's just test it okay let's add the other buttons i'm going to copy and paste everything that we have for button one and change button one to button two set the text equal to two pass into two button press and for the row and column i'm going to set the column equal to one but keep row the same okay button three it's gonna be the same process really so text equals three button press three row zero column two and button four text equals four button press four column actually let's set this to row one column zero and i need to change that too okay let's just double check this okay button five so button five text equals five button press five and let's set column equal to one okay number six i told you all this is going to be tedious okay so row one column two seven okay so row two column two actually let's change that to column zero much better okay button eight eight eight eight eight row two column one number nine row two column two and lastly zero so button zero text equals zero button press pass in zero and this will be row three column zero okay not too bad now let's fill in some of the symbols so we need plus i'm just going to rename this as plus the text will equal the plus sign put that within quotes and button press will be plus on we should probably put this in a row and column so let's say row zero column three so it should be on the right hand side here okay we need minus let's change plus to minus and place this at row one column three we need multiply that is an asterisk row two column three and divide that is a forward slash row three column three i promise we're near the end of creating these buttons we'll need an equal sign let's say equal equal text is the equal sign and our command is going to be equals the function and this will be row 3 column 2. we need a decimal let's change the text to a decimal row three column one okay and lastly we just need a clear button let's put this at the bottom so clear clear let's set the text equal to the word clear and the command will be our clear function and i think i'm going to pack this at the end but let's change frame to window okay let's check out all these buttons okay not too bad i think i'm going to change the width on our clear button so it's a little bit wider let's change the width to 12. that's a little bit better okay let's fill in some of these functions let's start with button press we're going to state global equation text then our equation text is equal to equation text plus we're converting whatever number or symbol that we receive to a string and our equation label which is a string var will be set to our equation text and let's test this so we can type in any combination of numbers or symbols okay let's work on our equals function next so let's say global equation text total equals eval now eval will parse the expression that we pass in equation text and our equation label will be set to whatever our total is and if we want to reuse our total let's set our equation text equal to total two plus two equals four minus three equals one times five equals five divided by two equals two point five now what if we divide by zero well we'll run into that ugly zero division error so let's write our code within a try and accept block so i'm going to indent some of this and let's write try all of this code and we will catch a zero division error exception so accept zero division error and i will set our equation label set let's say arithmetic error text equals a set of quotes okay so we should be able to catch this exception now five divided by zero equals arithmetic error now what if we have a syntax here like we type in just a bunch of symbols and hit equals we'll probably want to catch the syntax error as well so let's write an additional accept block before zero division error or after i guess it doesn't matter accept syntax error let's change arithmetic to syntax and we can keep equation text the same so now our program won't crash if we type in a bunch of symbols syntax error now let's work on the clear button so that is within the clear function so we will set global equation text equation label dot set to a set of quotes to effectively clear it and our equation text equal to a set of quotes as well and that should be it for this program let's run this one last time let's say three point one four times two point one equals six point five nine four divided by 2.1 equals 3.14 minus 1. i'm just making up numbers here plus 10 equals 12.14 and let's clear this and start again one plus two plus three plus 4 equals 10. i think that's good enough all right everybody so that's how to create a basic calculator in python i will post all of my code in the comments section down below if you would like a copy for yourself but yeah that's how to create a basic calculator using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
