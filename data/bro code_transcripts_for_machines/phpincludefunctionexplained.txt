well well well look who it is in today's topic I'm going to explain the include function the include function copies the content of a file and includes it in your PHP file a few of the benefits is that sections of your website can become reusable any changes only need to be made in one place for example we could create an HTML document for a header and a footer within each page of our website we can include that same header and footer that header and footer file become reusable here's an example we will create a few files our index file will be our home page let's create one for an about us page about dot PHP and now there are four locations to list our locations for our imaginary business then we'll create an HTML file named header header.html then another named footer footer.html here are the files we'll be working with let's fill in our header file we'll create a standard header for a website for our header let's create a pair of header tags I'll add a title the title will be within a pair of H2 header tags this is my website then we'll create a few links for a navigation bar let's set the first link to have an href attribute equal to our home page which we named index.php be sure to close it the text will be home let's copy this link paste it two times the second link will be for our about page change the text to about then locations locations.php then change the text to locations I'll add a horizontal rule as well that is good enough for our header let's head back to our index file to use the include function within your PHP script let me write that PHP all we have to do is type include it's a function then list the file name or the file path these two files are in the same website folder I only need to include the file name header dot HTML then when I save and reload everything we have our header then I could add some HTML afterwards so let's generate some html text within the body of my HTML I'll add a few sentences this is the home page I'll add a break stuff about your home page and go here then let's add a footer let's go to our footer HTML file I will use a pair of footer tags to create a footer I'll add a horizontal rule let's say author colon space type in your first and last name then I'll add a link for an email at href equals mail to come up with some email I'll add some text then close the anchor tag that's good enough for our footer our footer and our header are now complete let me close out of those we have our index page our about page and our locations page after we display everything that we would like for the home page let's display the footer the footer belongs at the bottom of our web page so let's copy our PHP script after our HTML markup let's include our footer footer.html there it is our header and our footer are reusable we only need to write these once and we can reuse them for every web page with our about page let's generate some HTML I'm going to copy these two lines of our body this is the about page stuff about your about page can go here I'm going to click on the link for our about page but we don't have that header or footer so let's add a PHP script before and after to include those PHP we will use the include function we will include list the file name and or the file path header.html and there is our header do the same thing with the footer PHP we will use the include function we are including our footer footer.html and there is the footer of our web page so now we can navigate between our home page and our about page they're both two completely different pages they have different text but we're reusing the same header and footer okay let's finish this with our locations page I'm just going to copy all of this just to expedite everything this is the locations page stuff about your location page can go here okay let's click on our locations page and we are now within the locations page again we're reusing the same header and the same footer parts of our website are functioning as components they're reusable we don't need to create an individual header for every file for every PHP file we can write them once then simply reuse them the cool thing is too if we need to make any changes they'll be reflected across every web page let me change my email to at gmail.com see my email just changed and that is reflected on every web page it helps with code reusability then let's change our title let's go to our header this is the type in your name bro code website and that change has been reflected across all of our web pages that is the include function you can include the contents of a file inside of your web page it helps with reusability and if you need to make any changes you can do so in just one place and that is the include function in PHP
