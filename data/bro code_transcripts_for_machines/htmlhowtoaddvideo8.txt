hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here and in this video I'm gonna teach you guys how you can add videos to your web pages using HTML let's get into it before we begin you're going to want to download a video or you could find one on your computer that you want to use and place it within the same folder that contains the HTML document that you plan on working with before I forget here are the file types that html5 currently supports mp4 WebM and OGG if you don't have a video to use I would recommend looking on your Facebook your Twitter your Instagram you've probably posted a video at some point in your lifetime and you can always download those too so if you have a video picked out place it within the same folder that contains your HTML document that you plan on working with the video that I'm gonna be using is that I was in Tokyo Japan some time ago and there were some people gokarting on the streets and they were dressed as characters from Mario Kart 64 so this is the video I'll be using I'll be honest I was geeking out when I saw that because I'm a huge Nintendo nerd if you have a video picked out then we're ready to begin now we need to create a pair of audio tags between the body tags of our HTML document so we're going to say a video and then we need a closing video tag if you watched the last video on audio it's going to be a very similar process so what we're going to do in the opening video tag is type in the word controls let's see what we have so far I'm going to save and reload now we have the controls for a video but this isn't linked to any video so we'll need to do that so between the video tags we need to create a source tag and within the source tag we're going to type SRC equals double quotes and within the double quotes we're going to type the video file that we want to add to the video controls and the video that I picked was called go underscore carts dot mp4 so let's save this and reload all right here's that video however it's messy and we know it's working we can actually go to the opening video tag and we can use the height and the width attribute to change the dimensions of this video and I'm just going to make up something we'll say height equals let's say 250 and width equals 250 let's save this reload the page all right here's the video it's a lot smaller however we have all this blank space underneath the video so the dimensions aren't exact with how we currently have the height and width attribute set up these are measured in pixels and if we were to change one of these attributes let's say that we change width to 650 let's save this in reload now we have all this white space on the left hand side as well as the right hand side of our video and if we want to get rid of that white space we need to make sure that we're increasing our height by a proportionate amount depending on what our ratio is for this video but you can see that this be somewhat annoying so another option instead of using pixels for our width we can also give a percentage let's say that we want to have the width of our video take up the entire screen while we can say 100% so let's save this and reload that's a little bit better but let's eliminate the height now so we'll just say with 100 these dimensions seem a lot better there's no white space within that video player and the ratio is exactly what it needs to be for the best quality and with this width attribute since we gave a percentage this actually makes our video dynamic in case we resize our web browser here's an example and you can also change the percentage if we were to place 50 here instead of 100% this video will take up 50% of the width available to it within the web browser and like I said before that's also dynamic so feel free to adjust the height and the width attributes of your video depending on what you need for your website at this point I'll be covering a few keywords that you might be interested in adding to the opening video tag so if you add the loop attribute this video will loop continuously so I'm just gonna mute it because it can get kind of annoying after a while you can see that it just keeps on restarting over you can also have a video be muted by default just add the muted keyword and let's reload this alright so when we hit play you can see that the volume is off it is muted and we can turn this back lastly we will be discussing the autoplay attribute so to add autoplay to a video type in autoplay within the opening video tag and just so you're aware this might not work on all web browsers and it doesn't work on mobile devices from what I've read now just make sure this autoplay attribute is added to the opening video tag if you want this video to start automatically when somebody visits your page and you can see that every time i refresh this page the video just starts over again and one thing to make sure of is that if you have a video with autoplay just as a common courtesy you'll want to be sure to make this video muted because if somebody visits your website and you have the video play automatically you'll want to be sure that it's playing without sound because the user might be in a place that's private or quiet and you don't want this video blasting sound as soon as they visit your webpage so if you use the autoplay attribute just make sure you also make it muted as a common courtesy oh and one cool thing you can do if you want some sort of background video that the user can't interact with one thing you can do is take out the controls so let's see what this does so we'll save refresh and we can no longer interact with this video so this might have some uses too well that will conclude this topic I will post the code that I have in the comments down below and pin it to the top if you would like a copy for yourself but yeah that is how to include a video on a webpage using HTML heyyou if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me
