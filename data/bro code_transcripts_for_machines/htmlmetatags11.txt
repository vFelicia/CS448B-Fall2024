hey it's you bro I hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be discussing meta tags and HTML let's get into it meta tags are used for metadata which is information about data think of it as data about data that's why it's called meta data we place meta tags within the head of our HTML document so if you're following along make sure you place these meta tags within the head of your document and not the body so meta data has some uses for search engines and web browsers and a few other benefits metadata lets these entities and your web browser know what your web page is about and what kind of content it contains there's other uses of meta tags too that allow us to control the viewport which is the visible area of a web page when you switch devices such as if you're viewing a page on a mobile device or a tablet meta tags will give the browser instructions on the dimensions of your page when it's displayed on a mobile device or if it's displayed on a laptop or a desktop so let's cover a few of the basic meta tags and we're going to be placing these within the head of our document we're going to type in a set of angle brackets and we're just going to type in meta with an angle brackets and this is a self closing tag so you don't need a closing tag after this the first thing that we're going to cover is an attribute called charge set so we're going to set char set equal to something and what this char set does is that this will let the web browser know which character set we are using these would be character sets such as ASCII ANSI and Unicode if we would like to use Unicode which covers most characters and symbols that exist in pretty much every written language we can use the charset attribute and set this to Unicode which is utf8 and this covers things such as kanji characters different symbols pretty much you can't go wrong even if you have like a document in plain English you can't go wrong with just throwing in a meta tag that has char sets at Unicode let's move on from character sets and make another meta tag another meta tag attribute is the name attribute and if we set name to keywords we can define some keywords about web page for search engines like Google or Bing to identify so let's set some keywords we'll use the content attribute so we'll say content and then let's just describe what our webpage is about using a few words so if this for example the video you're watching right now is an HTML tutorial on the YouTube page called bro code perhaps we'll put some keywords in here such as HTML we can separate these with a comma maybe a tutorial bro code then maybe YouTube I guess that works so these are like keyword search terms think of it like that and depending on what you place in here that might help with your rankings for search engines but they basically describe what your web page is about in just a few words let's create another meta tag and this is going to be similar to what we had previously we're going to use the name attribute but this time we're going to set this to description alright and then we will use the content attribute and now we can add a full description about this web page and you can type in perhaps like a whole sentence so for my example I'll type in bro code HTML tutorial for beginners that should be good enough so you can give a description about your webpage too and search engines can actually pick up this stuff and learn what your webpage is about then let's create another meta tag and this time we're going to use the name attribute but this time we're going to set this to off there so we can list an author for this webpage so we'll use the content attribute for this and I'll just make up a name so bro then I'll make up a last name washing tin so you can set an author for this webpage it's a fairly simple meta tag and a fairly simple attribute this next one is going to be a little complex we can set the viewport which is the visible area of a web page depending on which device is being used to view the page if you're using a mobile device such as a tablet or a phone you want to be sure that the dimensions will fit on your device so that the dimensions and the scaling will adjust to accommodate that specific device so follow me this is what we're going to type so within a meta tag we're going to set the name equal to view port all right then we'll use the content attribute and then within here this is what we're going to type with equals device wit comma initial scale equals 1 or 1.0 all right so what this does is that these are instructions for the web browser to change the scaling and dimensions to appear to match the device you are using to view that webpage and the initial scale is set to 1 or 1.0 that will set the zoom level when the page is first loaded so if you would like your web page to be more easily readable on mobile devices you'll want to be sure to include this meta tag all right I have one more for you guys you can also set a meta tag that will refresh your web page automatically after so many seconds this is what we're going to do to do that we'll use a meta tag and within here we're going to type HTTP e q u hi V alright and we're going to set this equal to refresh next we're going to set the content equal to how many seconds that we want our web page to refresh I'm going to pick something ridiculous like three like I want this web page to refresh every three seconds I wouldn't normally recommend this but it's going to work for our demonstration so I'm going to save this and reload the page but you know we're not seeing anything currently you might see like a blip every once in a while so I'm just going to start adding some text here maybe some headings just to prove that this is refreshing so perhaps I'll just write tests and I'll put this within a h1 tag and I'll save this you can see that it just popped I don't even have to refresh the page and I'm just copying and pasting this and saving it and you know it's refreshing every three seconds or so so yeah that's what you can do to have a webpage refresh you just use this attribute set it to refresh and then set the amount of seconds that you want this webpage to refresh after these many seconds please do not put three here pick a higher number because that's going to be really annoying if your web page refreshes every three seconds but it works just for this demonstration so that's the basics of metadata it's information about data there's still way more meta tag attributes that are out there but these are a few of the basics just enough to get you started and that is how meta tags work in HTML hey you if you enjoyed this lesson then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a
