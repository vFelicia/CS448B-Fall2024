hey what's going on everybody two bro here hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be creating our very first graphical user interface in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running welcome one and all today we'll be creating our very first graphical user interface in python also known as a gui for short we're going to be using the tk enter gui which is a module that is included with python our first step in order to use tk enter is to import this module so that we can begin using it our first line of code will be from tk enter import asterisk this will import everything related to the tk enter module and with this import we can now use all of the gui features that this module has to offer now there is one important distinction that we need to make we need to discuss the differences between windows and widgets here's a few quick definitions that i definitely did not copy from the internet widgets are gui elements such as buttons text boxes labels images you name it and windows they serve as a container to hold or contain these widgets for this topic we'll be creating and customizing our own window and in future topics we'll be exploring different widgets that are available to us so let's begin by creating a simple window and we should give our window a unique name such as window that's pretty creative and in order to instantiate this window we're going to follow this window name with equals tk make sure you get the capitalization right this is a uppercase t and a set of parentheses to serve as the constructor what this will do and i'm just going to add a comment is instantiate an instance of a window for us and when we compile and run this nothing appears to happen that's because we only instantiated our window and we're not actually displaying it in order to display our window we're going to follow this with the name of the window dot main loop and this will display our window and this is our first graphical user interface and we'll be adding widgets to this window so i'm going to add a comment that this will place window on computer screen and it will also listen for events but we'll get to that in future videos now what we'll be doing is customizing the appearance of this window let's begin by changing the size and we can do that with the geometry function so we're going to first begin by typing the name of our window which is window follow this by using the geometry function and we pass in a width and height but make sure this is within quotes and set this to whatever width and height that you want so if i want 420 by 420 that would be 420 x 420 and the size of our window is now the size that we set with the geometry function now take a look at the top left of this window we have this feather icon as well as a title of tk that's kind of lame so let's change that let's first change the window title and there is a function to do that so we type in the name of our window window dot title function and we can pass in a new title that we want to set and i will set the title to be maybe pro code first gui program that'll work and we now changed the title of this window and it says bro code first gui program the next thing that we can do although not necessary is that we can change the icon of our window bar at the top i would like to replace this feather icon with an image of my choosing here's my desktop don't mind all of the clutter and i would like to use this image of the logo for my channel and set this as the icon for my window so what i'm going to do is copy this and then go to my project folder and then paste it click ok and i now have this image within my project folder but it's in a format that we cannot use currently we need to convert this to what's called a photo image that is a format that tk enter can use so we'll need to convert our image to a photo image so do that anywhere within the window between window equals tk and window.mainloop right here is good i suppose we're going to create a photo image from this image and this is a png file but yours might be something different so let's give our photo image a unique name like maybe icon and in order to create a photo image we'll follow this with equals photo image and within the constructor of our photo image there is an option for file we can either list the file name or the file path if it's somewhere else on your computer since this image is within my same project folder i only have to list the file name and this is called logo.png and this is probably going to be named something else for you though so we now have this photo image called icon that we can use and i need to set the icon of my window to this icon and luckily there is a function to take care of that for us type in the name of the window which is window dot and we're going to use the icon photo function there are two arguments the first we're going to set to true and the second is the photo image that we want to use and this photo image is called icon so we're going to pass this photo image as an argument to this function of icon photo and now when we compile and run this the image that we wanted to use is now set for the top left icon of this window bar however it loses a lot of the quality since the dimensions are so small but you can still tell that it's my logo though so that's how to replace the icon of your window bar in the top left corner now let's change the background color of this window and one way in which we can do that is to use the config function you can use the config function anytime that you want to make any changes to this window so let's change the background color here and there is an option called background and we can set this equal to either a color name or a hexadecimal value let's begin with just some color names let's say that i want the background color to be black i'll just type in the word black here and this will change the background color of my window to black alternatively you can set a hex value as the color so if you were to look up or google hex color picker you can select whatever color you want let's say that i want a sky blue color like this well this is the hex value i'm going to copy this value and then paste it within the option for my background make sure you have this hashtag as well because that represents that this is a hex value so now the background color is that sky blue color that i picked well everybody that's the basics of creating a window in python and in future videos we're going to be exploring different widgets that we can add to this window that have some functionality so if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to create your very first gui in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
