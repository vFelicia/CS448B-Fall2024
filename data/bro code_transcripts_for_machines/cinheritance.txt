all right what's going on people inheritance so inheritance is this programming concept of one or more child classes receiving fields methods etc from a common parent kind of like how people inherit genes from their parents well with programming we can kind of do something similar parent classes can have children classes and anything that the parent class has the child classes now have so here's an example let's create a parent class named vehicle not any kind of specific vehicle just a generic vehicle class class vehicle and there will be one field let's say public and speed and i'll set this equal to maybe zero and let's create a method public void go all vehicles can go somewhere and all we'll display is this vehicle is moving we can inherit this speed field and this go method from the vehicle class so this vehicle class is going to have children so let's create a car class a bike class and a boat class so type class car then to inherit from another class type after the class name colon and then the parent in which you would like to inherit from so car is going to be the child class vehicle will be the parent class so car will have access to its own speed and go method and then you can add anything additional within the car class like number of wheels public and wheels and i'll set this to 4 for all car objects now let's create a bicycle class it's the same process as before class bicycle and this will inherit from the vehicle class as well but let's change wheels to two and then let's create a book class class boat and here it's from vehicle wheels zero because well it's a boat okay so let's instantiate a car bicycle and boat object so let's do that here car car equals new car bicycle bicycle keep on spilling bicycle wrong bicycle equals new bicycle and boat boat equals new vote so if we take a look at this car object car dot there is a speed field as well as a go method even though there's nothing within this car class besides wheels so since car is the child class and vehicle is the parent class car has access to a go method and a speed field even though there's nothing within here except a wheels field and of course car objects do have a wheels field as well which we stand within the car class so let's just test these i'm going to display car dot speed car dot speed followed by car dot wheels and i will have this car use its go method car dot go all right so our car speed is zero that's because we set it to be zero within the vehicle class this car has four wheels which we stated within the car class and this car class has a go method that states this vehicle is moving so i bet the same thing applies to our bicycle and boat object so let's copy these three lines of code change car to bicycle bicycle.speed bicycle.wheels and bicycle.go and the same thing applies to both boat.speed boat.wheels boat.go so all three of these different types of vehicles each have a speedfield a wheels field and a go method so the point of inheritance is that we can reuse code i mean we could just copy these fields and methods and then paste them within each of these classes but imagine that you have hundreds of different classes and we need to change like go to start well it's a lot easier just to make that change in one place than having to manually go through all of our classes so yeah that's kind of the benefit of inheritance we can keep anything that these classes have in common within a common parent class and these classes can simply just inherit these fields and methods so yeah that's inheritance if you liked this video be sure to smash that like button drop a random comment down below and well yeah that's inheritance in c sharp
