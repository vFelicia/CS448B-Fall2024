yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well in today's video i'm going to explain lambda functions in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right ladies and gentlemen let's talk about lambda functions these are functions that are written in one line and use this lambda keyword they accept any number of arguments but they only have one expression think of it as a shortcut they're useful if you need a function for only one use or a short period of time and then you're just planning on throwing away that function afterwards here's the syntax for a lambda function you type lambda you add the parameters followed by a colon and then your expression let's say we have this function named double double accepts one argument that we will name x we're returning x times two effectively doubling it so if i need to call this function i would type double and then pass in a number as an argument so the result if i pass in 5 would be 10. now let's write the same function but instead write it as a lambda function so let me turn these lines into comments now the first step is to type lambda then our parameters we only have one parameter and that is x colon and then our expression we would like to return x times two now this lambda function is going to return a function object and we can assign that much like what we do with variables let's say double equals lambda x colon x times two and in order to call this lambda function we're going to type double then a set of parentheses to call this function and then pass in our arguments so let's say that x equals 5 and then we're going to double it and the result is 10. so that's the syntax for a lambda function you type lambda your parameters colon and then your expression this time let's say that we have two parameters we have two numbers that we want to multiply by each other so let's say that this function will be called multiply multiply equals lambda x comma y because we have two parameters colon followed by our expression we would like to multiply x times y and that is it now in order to call multiply we need to pass in two arguments if i were to pass in just one well we'll have a type error so let's pass in five and maybe six and the result is 30. now let's try three parameters let's say we would like to add three numbers together let's say add lambda x comma y comma z so we have all of our parameters we have our colon here and then we need our expression x plus y plus z and let's add 5 six and seven together the result is 18. now let's try something a little more complex let's pass in some strings this time i'll create a function named full name full name equals lambda first name comma last name the expression is going to be first name plus perhaps a space plus last name now i need to pass in a first name and a last name full name and you can use your own name for this example if you want let's say bro comma code yep this will print your first name and your last name to the console window now let's take it a step further let's say we would like to check somebody's age once using a lambda function we would like to check to see if they're 18 or older because they're signing up for something perhaps let's say a credit card so let's create a function object age check equals lambda we have one parameter somebody's age colon and then our expression let's type true if age is greater than or equal to 18 else false to call this age track function we need to pass in an age let's say the user is 12 and they're trying to sign up for a credit card while this will return false let's say they're 18 now and this will return true so that's a lambda function it's a function that is written in one line using this lambda keyword they accept any number of arguments but they only have one expression think of it like a shortcut and they're useful if you need to use a function only once and then you're just planning on throwing it away afterwards so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comments section down below but yeah those are lambda functions in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
