hey everybody in this topic i'm going to explain multidimensional arrays more specifically 2d arrays it's an array made up of separate arrays they're useful because they can represent a grid or matrix of data with rows and columns here's an example i'll create a twodimensional array of cars car names the data type will be string i will name this array cars with arrays they have one set of square brackets but if you're creating a twodimensional array you need two sets of square brackets the first set of square brackets is for the number of rows let's say three in this example the second set of square brackets corresponds to the number of columns if we have 3 rows and 4 columns 3 times 4 is 12 so that would give us 12 elements if you're initializing your 2d array right away you don't necessarily need to set a row size but you do need a column size i'll just set the amount of columns to be three to something small okay so let's fill in the first array this first row will be cars manufactured by ford i'll add a mustang then a ford escape then maybe a ford f150 okay this is our first array i'm going to create a second array after the first array i'll add a comma what i like to do i like to organize my 2d array kind of like it's a grid so now we have a second array this next array will be cars manufactured by chevrolet i'll pick a corvette then an equinox and a silverado let's add one last array these will be cars manufactured by dodge challenger durango ram 1500 all right now to finish this twodimensional array we will enclose all of these inner arrays with another set of curly braces then add a semicolon to the end that is our twodimensional array you can see that there's rows and columns in this example each row corresponds to a manufacturer so it's kind of like a grid a matrix then if you were to access one of these elements you need two indices just to demonstrate let's display all of them standard output cars i need to select the row number then the column number row 0 column 0 let's see what car that is i'm just gonna add a space between these elements okay row zero column zero that's my mustang row zero column zero that's mustang let's print the next element that would be row zero column one that is my forward escape row zero column one i'm just gonna zoom out there then we have row zero column two that's the ford f150 i'm going to display a new line character now we are on row one so let's copy these paste them row one column zero row one column one row one column two so this next row is our cars manufactured by chevrolet we have our corvette our equinox then our silverado then we will display row 2 row 2 column 0 row 2 column 1 row 2 column 2. and these are the cars manufactured by dodge we have our challenger durango ram 1500 so yeah you can see that a two dimensional array is kind of like a grid made up of rows and columns now if we need to iterate over a twodimensional array and display the elements here's one way in which we can do that we can use nested loops but just to make it easy i'm going to calculate the amount of rows and columns that we have let's begin with the rows int rows equals size of my array cars divided by the size of one of the elements cars at index 0 is good then to calculate the amount of columns that we have we could do something like this and columns equals the size of cars at index of zero divided by the size of one of the elements so remember there's two indices this time zero zero is good in this example we should have three rows as well as three columns now let's create a for loop to iterate over the rows and i equals zero i will continue this as long as i is less than the number of rows that we have then increment i by one i'm going to display cars at index of i just for the time being then for now i'm just going to add a new line between each so if i was to display cars at index i that should give us three memory addresses one address for every inner array this memory address is for the first array then the second array then the third array what i need to do now to get the elements within each array is to create an inner loop let's use an inner for loop to iterate over each element within each array int j because i is already taken set this equal to zero we will continue this for loop as long as j is less than the number of columns that we have increment j by one now i'm going to display cars and there's two indices i then j i'm going to display a space between each of these okay now we have one long line of text so once we escape the inner for loop i would just like to print a new line i'll add standard output new line character okay and here's our twodimensional array the first row are for cars manufactured by ford then chevrolet then dodge that's how to iterate over a twodimensional array you have the outer loop that's in charge of the rows the inner loop which is in charge of the columns so that's a twodimensional array everybody it's just an array where each element is its own separate array you have two indices the first for the rows the second for the columns to access one of the elements you have to specify the row then the column that element is found so those are twodimensional arrays your assignment is to post a twodimensional array in the comments section down below and well yeah those are twodimensional arrays in c plus plus
