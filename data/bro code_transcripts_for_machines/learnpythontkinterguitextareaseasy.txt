hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a text area in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right my fellow bros let's discuss the text widget this functions like a text area you can enter multiple lines of text i'm not sure why it's called a text widget instead of a text area widget text area would make more sense but idk though so let's begin by creating a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop so to create a text widget also known as a text area let's call this text text equals text and we're going to add this text to our window and then we need to pack this text text dot pack so we should have a text area and you can enter in stuff like this all right but what good is a text area if you can't actually submit some text so let's create a button to do that for us so button equals button we're going to add this button to the window and button.pack so we need a command for this button and a function as well so let's create a function called submit it's going to be a submit button and let's change the text too because we can text equals submit cool now let's create a function called submit and we'll do this at the top d e f submit and what is this going to do well it's going to get the text from the text area and let's assign this to a variable and we can call this maybe input or whatever you want so to get the text from the text area let's say text that's the name of this text area dot get but we need a starting index as well as an ending index so we're going to place 1.0 here for the beginning index this is the first line we want to get everything so for the second index we can just put end then we can do anything we want with this input so let's just print this to the console window so print input and this should work hey you drink plenty of water love you and click submit and then you can do whatever you want with this input well that's how a text area functions but now let's customize the appearance of this text area and i have a few ideas that you might be interested in so let's change the background color of this text area so bg equals and i will pick light yellow and you will see why in just a second so now this text area kind of resembles maybe a piece of paper a notebook a postit note however this font is really small so let's change the font styling and the font size so font equals and i will pick the font ink free this somewhat resembles handwriting so i kind of like this and it kind of fits our notebook theme and then a size maybe 25. one thing you should know the text area size corresponds directly with the font size so 25 is a fairly large font so if we were to compile this and run this the size of our text area is now massive because it corresponds directly with the font size so we might want to limit the width and the height so the height is the amount of characters that this is tall so let's say 8 and the width is the amount of characters that this is long and let's say 20 and now this should be much smaller and it kind of resembles a postit note which is kind of cool let's also change the amount of padding that we have we can do that with pad x and pad y so pad x let's say 20 and pad y also 20. so the text shouldn't actually touch any of the borders this is some sample text cool let's finish this by changing the font color so that is fg for foreground foreground equals and i'll pick purple because purple is a pretty color and let's run this one last time roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rockin everywhere well that's the basics of the text widget in python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the text widget in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro you
