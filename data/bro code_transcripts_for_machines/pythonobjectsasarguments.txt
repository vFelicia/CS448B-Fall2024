hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can pass objects as arguments so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running ladies and gentlemen in today's video i'm going to be demonstrating how we can pass objects as arguments for this example let's say we have a class car and there is one class variable called color color equals none what we'll be doing is calling a function that accepts an object as an argument as well as a color so let's create a function named change color now make sure when you define this function it's not within the cart class then technically this would be a method of the car class what we would like is a separate function outside of the car class now we need to set up some parameters we would like to accept a car object as well as a color so for the first parameter let's say a car and make sure this is in uppercase or capital because python doesn't like that argument names should be lowercase so when we pass in a car we will give it a nickname of car and we would also like to pass in a color so let's set up a parameter called color now when we pass in a car we will assign that car's color with whatever color that we receive so car dot color equals color and now let's create some car objects so let's say car one equals car car two equals car and car three equals car currently if i were to print their colors this is what we'll see print car one dot color and repeat the steps for two and three and we're not calling this function yet so all of these colors should be set to none they are basically cars with no color they're i don't know iron or something whatever cars are made out of aluminum plastic stuff like that okay so now let's call this function change color perhaps right here so in order to call this function we need to pass in a car object as well as a color so let's pass in car one and a color perhaps red and we'll repeat the steps for two and three so let's say car two will be white and car three will be blue now after calling this function we have a car object and a color and we're assigning the color of our car to whatever color that we receive now these cars in order car 1 2 and 3 are red white and blue now one thing that you should know is that the name of this parameter that accepts our object doesn't necessarily need the same name as the class name that created the object that we're passing in we could name this something else entirely perhaps vehicle you'll just want to be sure that this is at least descriptive of the kind of object that you would like to pass in and we're not limited to just passing in car objects we can pass in all sorts of objects but we need to pass in an object as well as a color so this time let's create a class called motorcycle class motorcycle and this class will also have a color set to none so what we're doing is actually reusing this function for all sorts of different kinds of vehicles now let's create a vehicle i'll just name this bike one for short bike one equals motorcycle now let's call the change color function and we can pass in an object as well as color this time we will pass in our bike object as well as a color i think black counts as a color and let's print bike ones color and this should work we have red white blue and black in conclusion we can pass objects as arguments to a function much like what we've been doing with variables however the type of objects that we pass in may be limited based on the required attributes and methods that that given class or object might have and we'll get more into this on the next video on duct typing so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to pass objects as arguments using python
