hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and i'm going to explain the purpose of if name equals main in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show during your programming journey you may have encountered this strange statement of if name equals main now what the heck does that mean so with python files also referred to as modules by including this statement it gives our modules some flexibility one a module that has the statement can be run as a standalone program or two this module can be imported and used by other modules if there's some sort of useful functions or other resources within this module to be imported by including the statement of if name equals main we're checking to see if a user is running this module as either a standalone program or they're importing it from another module behind the scenes the python interpreter will set special variables one of which is double underscore name it's a variable and python will assign the name variable a value of main if it's the initial module being run and we can actually test that by printing double underscore name so since this is the initial module being run module 1 for my example name is going to be assigned a value a string of main now check this out i have two modules what if i were to import module 2 and check the name variable of module 2. let's try it import module two in order to access a variable from another module i need to type the name of the module module two dot and i would like to check the special name variable of module 2 and print it so when you import a module this name variable is going to be assigned the name of the module in this case module 2. this time what if we change the roles around i'm going to copy all of this text and paste it within module 2. we're going to import from module 1 we will print that special name variable of this module module 2 and then print the name variable of module 1 which is being imported now when i run this program i'm going to instead run from module 2. now this time that special name variable of module 2 is main and the special name variable of module 1 is module 1 the name of the module so by including a statement such as if name equals main we're checking to see if this module is being run directly or indirectly so let's test it within this statement of if name equals main let's print running this module directly else that must mean that we're running this module indirectly so let's print running other module indirectly okay so i'm going to go to module 1 and run from here running this module directly now let's do the same thing with module 2 but we need to import module one and let's run for module two running other module indirectly for the time being i'm just going to write pass within our if name equals main as a placeholder and get rid of our if statement so let's say within module 1 there's a useful function or resource we would like to access from module 2. so let's say we have a function named hello and all this will do is print the word hello let's just pretend that it's a useful function not really but let's pretend so in order to use this function from module 2 i need to import module 1 then type module 1 dot and then the name of the function so i'm going to run from module 2 and this will print hello but what if i run this program from module one so right now module one cannot be run directly as a standalone program so i cannot print the word hello so what i could do is within if name equals main i can call that hello function directly so let's run from module 1. hello one other thing that you might see too within the if statement if name equals main there might be a call for a main function and you can write the main body of your program within a main function so everybody in conclusion the reason that people may include the statement if name equals main is that it allows our modules to have some flexibility they can be run as a standalone program or they can be imported and used by other modules and this is because the python interpreter sets that special variable of name with a value of main if it's the initial module being run if you would like a copy of my code and my notes i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that's the purpose of if name equals main in python
