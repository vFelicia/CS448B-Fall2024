how's it going to everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys how we can turn our Java programs into an executable application so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright everybody so I'm going to be splitting up this video into different sections because it seems like you guys for the most part are either using the Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA so I'm going to teach you guys how to create executable jar files using each of these so I'll be splitting up this video into sections and I'll include some timestamps in the description I also have all of these steps written out if you like a physical copy of these I'll copy and paste this and post this in the comments down below if you'd like to follow along stepbystep so let's begin by creating an executable jar file with the Eclipse IDE so here I am within the Eclipse IDE now within your package Explorer select a project they want to create an executable of so select one that has a GUI component so you can actually see it so let's say that I want to create an executable of the stopwatch program so what I'm going to do is rightclick this project folder go to export go to the Java folder let's pretend that that wasn't open and then you can either make it jar file or a runnable jar file so I'm going to select runnable jar file and click Next and then for the launch configuration make sure that this is set to the main class of your project so one mistake that I made I actually have two stopwatch programs I have one that's spelt slightly differently so that was given me some problems so make sure you select the right project it also doesn't help that I have like a billion projects within here now for the export destination you can choose where you want this to be exported to so I'm just going to save this to my desktop so this is going to be named stopwatch and it's a jar file click Save and then we are going to click finish and then it's okay if we have some warnings so I'm just going to click OK let's go to my desktop and here is the executable jar file so let's take a look at it it's an executable jar file the file extension is dot jar and when you click on this it runs my stopwatch program so now let's do this with IntelliJ IDEA so here I am within IntelliJ IDEA so if you're using this IDE this is how to make an executable jar file so I have this very same stopwatch program from the demonstration using the Eclipse IDE so I want to create an executable of this project so what I'm going to do is go to file project structure and then I'm going to go to artifacts click this plus button jar and then from modules with dependencies so make sure this module is selected for your project then we need to find the class that contains the main method and this is usually main and then click OK extract to the target jar that's fine and then click OK now within this project structure window if you want you can change the output directory so I'm actually going to change this to my desktop for convenience so let's click on my desktop and click OK then apply and then ok and the last step go to the top of this window for your IDE go to build build artifacts and then build so this jar file is going to be sent to my desktop momentarily there it is and let's run this and here is my stopwatch program now one question that you might be wondering is how can we change the icon for this executable jar well we normally can't change the icons for a jar file it's more of an operating system sort of deal so one thing that we can do is use an executable wrapper with the help of some thirdparty software but the first thing that we're going to need is an ICO file so you can actually take any image well most images and we can actually use some thirdparty software to convert this to an ICO file so let's say that I want to use this stopwatch image that I made here well it's really just an emoji that I expanded but it's a PNG so I'm going to want to convert this to an ICO file so one website I recommend that's been pretty good to me is I co convert comm so let's head there or you can just do a Google search I don't care do whatever you want so I'm just going to click this first link and this is ICO convert comm all right so we're going to choose a file I'm going to select this stopwatch and here it is so I'm going to open this and upload so this website has a few limitations it has to be PNG jpg or BMP and then there's some other things you can do if you want to format this all we need to do is click convert ICO at the bottom and download your icons alright so I moved that file from my downloads folder to my desktop and I just got rid of the old PNG file so let's rightclick on this just to be sure it's an ICO file for icon so that's everything that we need now there's another thirdparty software that's pretty helpful we're going to use launch for J to create an exe with this custom icon so this is the URL I'll also post this in the description so here's the website launch for J dot sourceforge.net and then if you need to download this there's a download tab on the left hand side and you can select the appropriate download for your operating system so once that's downloaded open it up so here's the launch for J program so there's a few things that we need to do first we need to select the output destination for this exe file so we can browse for a location here I'm just going to set this to my desktop and I am going to name this stopwatch dot exe the dot exe is important click Save and next we need to select the appropriate jar file so this is also on my desktop so I'm going to select this and it is stopwatch dot jar and open and then if you have an icon that you want to use remember this has to be an ICO file and that is this one and click open and lastly we need to set the bundled JRE path so we need to place the path of where our JDK is located so we can actually find that within our seed drive so my JDK is located within the C Drive Program Files the Java folder and then select the most recent JDK that you're using and then I'm just going to copy this address by right clicking copy address and then I'm going to paste this within bundled JRE path and lastly we just need to click on this gear icon and this is to build wrapper and then this is going to create a launch Forge a config file you can name this whatever you want we're just going to delete this right away afterwards and click Save all right here is our stopwatch executable program and it has the icon that we used so we actually no longer need these three things this is the jar file the ICO file and that test config file that we just made so I'm just going to get rid of these and here is the file that we wanted so this is an exe file it's an application and if we were to click on this it's going to run our designated Java program so hopefully this walkthrough works for you I'll post all of the steps that I have written here in the comments and in the description down below but yeah that's how you can turn your Java program into an executable application hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing
