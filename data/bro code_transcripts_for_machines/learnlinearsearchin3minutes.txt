all right everybody linear searches we need to talk about linear searches because this wouldn't be a complete course without them with a linear search we iterate through a collection one element at a time the runtime complexity of a linear search is big o of n the larger the data set the number of steps to complete that search will increase proportionately the disadvantages of a linear search is that they are slow for large data sets but with the advantages they are fast for searches of small to medium sized data sets and they don't need to be sorted that's a huge benefit over binary searches and interpolation searches and they are useful for data structures that do not have random access such as linked lists so let's begin let's create a basic array of integers int array and to make up some numbers they don't necessarily need to be in order all right then let's find an index int index equals and we will invoke a linear search function which we still need to declare we will pass in our array and some value we would like to search for uh let's search for the number one okay so then let's declare this function create method linear search private static and linear search so we have two parameters an integer array and an integer i'm going to rename i as value so it's more descriptive okay with a linear search all we need to do is loop through our array one element at a time so we can do that with the for loop so let's set into i our index equal to zero we will continue this as long as i is less than our arrays length then increment i by one what we're checking with an if statement is to see if our array at index of i is equal to the value that we're searching for this parameter if it is then let's return whatever our index is i if we do not find it after iterating through our entire array let's return negative 1 as a sentinel value and that's all there is to it to our linear search function so back within our main function let's check to see if the value returned does not equal negative one that means that we found our value so with an if else statement let's check to see if index does not equal negative one that means that we have found our element so let's print element found at index plus index else let's print element not found system.out.printline element not found so if we're searching for the number one we would find that at index one zero one if we search for five that is found at index eight zero one two three four five six seven eight if there's some number that's not in here like 10 then this will print element not found so yeah that's the idea behind a linear search we iterate through some collection one element at a time it's slow for large data sets but it's fast for small to medium data sets this would be a small data set and they do not need to be sorted that's a huge advantage so yeah everybody that is a linear search if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that is a basic linear search in computer science i guess
