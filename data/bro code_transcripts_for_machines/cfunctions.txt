hey yeah what's going on let's talk about functions a function is a small section of code that is executed whenever we call it also known as invoking a function when we compile and run a c program we begin with invoking the main function so here's our task we need to sing three verses of happy birthday for some reason if we are only using the main function we could write it like this this will be the first verse of happy birthday and if i need to sing three verses i could just copy and paste this one section and then paste it two additional times then i'm just going to add a new line character at the end technically this would work but it's considered poor practice to repeat code more than once if you don't have to wouldn't it be better if we write this code once and then simply reuse it while we can by using a function so let's delete two of these verses and we will create a new function so outside of the main function let's declare a new function so for now we're going to type void and then a unique name for this function let's say that it's the birthday function followed by a set of parentheses and then a set of curly braces so i'm going to take any code i would like to repeat and place it within this new birthday function and if i need to invoke this function all i have to do is type the name of the function followed by a set of parentheses i like to think of the parentheses as a pair of telephones talking to each other that's one trick i used to remember that's how to call a function so follow the function name with the set of parentheses and when i invoke this function once we will execute any code within this function once if i need to repeat this code three times i will just have to call this function three times we are calling our birthday function three times and there we go we have invoked this birthday function three times and we have accomplished our goal of singing three verses of happy birthday so basically that's all what a function is it's some subsection of code that is executed whenever you invoke it also known as calling a function a benefit to using functions is that if you think you're going to use some code more than once you can stick it within a function and then to repeat that code you just call the function as many times as you need so yeah those are functions if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below and in the next video we will discuss arguments and parameters so yeah that's the basics of functions in c
