hey what's going on everybody so in this video i'm going to explain some useful string methods that you might be interested in let's begin by creating a variable named name standard string name we'll accept some user input we'll need a prompt standard output enter your name a user's name may contain spaces we're better off using the getline function standard getline standard cn name the first useful method is the length method type your string name follow it with dot length parenthesis the length method will give you the length of a string let's write this within an if statement if name dot length method is greater than 12. we'll print a message such as your name can't be over 12 characters long standard output your name can't be over 12 characters else we'll print a different message standard output welcome the user's name enter your name type in your full name welcome whatever your name is okay now what if our name is over 12 characters type in your full name then just add a bunch of characters your name can't be over 12 characters that is the builtin length method of strings you type a string follow it with dot length parenthesis wherever you invoke this method in that spot you will return the length of that string in characters the empty method will return if a string is empty or not type your string name dot empty parenthesis this returns a boolean value if name is empty we'll display a message you didn't enter your name else hello whatever your name is okay i'm just going to hit enter you didn't enter your name but if i do enter my name it works normally hello whatever your name is that is the empty method of strings you'll check to see if a string is empty or not a useful case of this is to check to see if somebody enters in some user input another is clear name dot clear then let's display our name standard output hello name enter your name type in your first name and last name hello and we don't have a name anymore because that name has been cleared so that is the clear method we can append a string to another string after my name i will use append parentheses within the parentheses we can add a string to the end of another string i'll add at gmail.com standard output your username is now name enter your name your username is your name with at gmail.com appended to it that is the append method we can return a character at a given position within a string standard output type your string name dot at parentheses so the first character in a string has an index of zero i'll display whatever that character is enter your name so the first character in my string is a capital b the character at index 1 well that would be r we can insert a character at a given position type your string follow it with insert there will be two arguments we'll list within the parentheses an index so the beginning of our string would have an index of zero comma then what would we like to insert i'll insert the at sign at the beginning of my name then let's display our name okay so we now have the at sign inserted at the beginning of our string or you could pick a different position the index of one would be the second character technically so yeah pick a position then you can insert a string now we can find a certain character i would like to find if there's any spaces within my name name dot find then place a character i'll look for any white spaces this method will give me the position of the first space type in your first name and last name the index of the first white space within my name has an index of three the first character is always zero zero one two three okay then lastly erase name dot erase we can erase a portion of a string we'll need a beginning index and an ending index i'll eliminate the first three characters then we will display our name enter your name okay and that's what's left of my name i deleted the first three characters the first number is the beginning index the second is the ending index it's not inclusive though so yeah those are a few helpful string methods if you would like to know more head to the string class on the c plus dot com website and there's a fairly extensive list hey if you're enjoying the series let me know by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
