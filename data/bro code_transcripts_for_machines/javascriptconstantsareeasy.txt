why hello so today I need to explain const const short for constants are variables that can't be changed once you assign them in this example we're going to create a program to calculate the circumference of a circle given a radius let's define our variables first we have Pi we'll begin with using let then I'll show you the benefit of using const so let pi equals I'll use the first few digits of pi 3.14159 then we have let radius which we will assign later we'll ask for user input then let circumference I think I spelled that right I can never spell circumference all right now we need to ask the user what the radius is I will just use a window prompt radius equals window. prompt enter the radius of a circle then once we have our radius when we accept user input it's a string data type we need to convert our radius into a number by using the number function then once we have our radius we can calculate the circumference by setting circumference equal to and here's the Formula 2 * pi * our radius that the user enters in then once we have our circumference let's cons log R circumference let's see if this works enter the radius of a circle I'll enter 10 press okay their circumference is 62.8 so why might you want to use a const in this program you may accidentally or somebody else may maliciously change the value of a variable so that the program doesn't behave as intended for example somewhere within my program I will set pi to be a new number pi equal 420.69 let's run this program again enter the radius of a circle I'll enter 10 press okay and my circumference is 8,413 I may not realize that this is the incorrect answer just for an extra security measure I can turn any variables that shouldn't change to be a const a constant replace let with const and it is a good practice if you have any constants to make all of the letters in the variable name uppercase so Pi is now Capital Pi hey this is bro from the future there's one thing I needed to clarify that I forgot to mention capitalizing your constants is usually only done with primitive data types such as numbers and booleans reference data types such as strings don't normally follow this convention you'll see this in the next few upcoming videos Pi is a constant and we're assigning a number that's why I'm making it all uppercase but if this was a string normally we wouldn't that is all let's try and change that variable again pial 420.69 so we have an uncaught type error assignment to constant variable so JavaScript won't let us reassign constants once they are assigned once we can't make any changes to it once you declare a constant you can't change the value and that's pretty helpful in a lot of circumstance stances it's an extra security measure what we'll do this time is within our web page we will accept some user input via a text boox we'll rewrite the same program let's create an H1 element I will set the ID of the H1 element to be my H1 and the text will be enter the radius of a circle I'll create a text box input I'll set the type equal to text the ID equal to my text I'll create a label for this input text box let's say radius I'll add a button the button will say submit the ID will be my submit then I'll add two breaks right after the text box to make it look nice let's get rid of console.log when we click on the submit button we will execute a function we need to select the button let's take our document get element by ID the ID is is my submit follow this with DOT onclick equals a function parenthesis curly braces when we click on the button we'll execute any code within the curly braces we can eliminate our window prompt we need to get the value from the text box again we can use document. getet element by ID but the ID is going to be my text the text from the text box dot value get the value from the text box and we will assign that to radius then we will typ cast our input as a number then we will calculate the circumference but since Pi is a constant make sure that the letters are uppercase uppercase pi once we have our circumference let's change an H3 element so let's add that as well H3 the ID will be my H3 there will be no text content then again we will get element by ID the ID will be my H3 change the text content of this element to equal our circumference okay let's try this the radius is 10 press submit and here is our circumference maybe this will be in centimeters so let me change that I'll use string concatenation and just add plus CM so 10 submit 62.83 CM if I attempt to change the value of pi maybe I'll do that here pi = 420.69 rerun the program 10 submit there doesn't appear to be a result so if we go to Dev tools go to console we have that uncaught type error assignment to constant variable so again we can't change the value of a constant there are more graceful ways of handling this we'll learn about that when we get to exception handling however this is what we wanted we do not want to be able to change the value of a constant all right everybody so those are constants it's just a variable that can't be changed once you assign it a value and well those are constants in JavaScript
