all right everybody in this video we're going to create a very simple calculator program the reason that I'm making this program is just for us to get some practice using IF statements let's begin we will ask a user for an operator will this be addition subtraction multiplication or division operator equals input enter and operator addition subtraction multiplication or division then we will have a user type in two numbers num1 equals input enter the first number we will Typecast our input as a floating Point number then with num2 we can just copy this paste it change num1 to num2 enter the second number then we can use an if statement if our operator is equal to the plus symbol then we will add these two numbers together results equals num1 plus num2 else if our operator is equal to subtraction we will take our result equals num1 minus num2 else if the operator is multiplication we will multiply num1 times num2 else if our operator is equal to division then divide num1 by num2 else the user must not have typed in a valid operator let's display a message to them I'll use an upstring operator is not a valid operator so where should we display the result let's do so within each if statement print result but I'm going to round our result to maybe three decimal places we'll copy the print statement and paste it within each of these if and else if statements except the else statement because we don't want to perform any calculations if the operator is invalid okay let's try this enter an operator let's do plus what is 3 plus 3.14 that is 6.14 let's do subtraction 3 minus 3.14 is negative 0.14 multiplication 3 times 3.14 is 9.42 enter an operator division first number three divided by 3.14 that is 0.955 then let's pick an operator that's not valid uh like the word Pizza we still have to type in a number though unfortunately 3.14 Pizza is not a valid operator well okay then everybody that's just a simple calculator program more or less just for practice all we did is just perform an arithmetic operation on two numbers then display a result maybe later on in the series we'll make something more complex but yeah that is a simple calculator program in Python
