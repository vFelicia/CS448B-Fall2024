hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about different access modifiers in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everyone so axis modifiers add a layer of security to our programs and there are three axis modifiers i'm going to cover besides the default which is none they are public protected and private so to best demonstrate this we're going to need some packages this time so within your project folder we're going to create two packages i do have a separate video on packages somewhere within this playlist so let's call this first package package one and all a package is is a collection of classes whereas a class is a collection of code so we'll call this package one and click finish we'll create a second package called package2 file new package and this will be package 2 and click finish we're going to create two classes within each package so let's click on package 1 then go to file new class we will call this class a and check public static void main let's create a second class called b file new class and this is also going to be within package one name is b then within package two we're going to create a class called c file new class c and lastly file new class make sure that this is within package two and this is going to be a sub this is going to be a subclass of the a class so a sub extends a in order for us to inherit everything from the class a from package one we'll need to include an import so import package1.a but i'm just going to change this to an asterisk to import everything so we'll include some imports within each of these classes so let's begin with class a we're going to import everything from package 2 class b import everything from package 2 class c import everything from package one this time so with our a sub class we can now inherit everything from the a class within package one so let's begin with axis modifiers and we're first going to discuss the default access modifier so i'm going to create a string variable within my cclass let's say that this is a string variable called default message and this will display or hold this is the default so currently i'm using no access modifier and i would like to see who or which classes can see this default message that has no access modifier the default access modifier let's head back to our a class within package one and let's create an instance of our c class well i suppose we also could have made this a static variable but hey too late so let's create an instance of the c class c c equals new c and i'm going to attempt to print the default message variable of the c class so c dot default message and i'm just going to copy this paste it all right but we're going to have a problem though and this states that the field c dot default message is not visible that's because anything using the default axis modifier is only visible to anything within the same package so anything within package 2 is going to be able to access this default message variable but anything within a different package such as our a class and b class cannot so let's attempt to do this again but within our a subclass so i'm going to copy everything i have here including the main method and just paste it within our a subclass so we now actually have access to our default message variable within the c class because these are both within the same package all right well for now i'm going to move this main method back to our a class within package one so let's create another variable and this is going to be a public variable so let's use the public modifier public this is going to be a string and let's call this public message and this will hold a string of this is public all right now i'm going to attempt to access this variable public message from the a class which is in package one so c dot and you can see it right here public message and this will display this is public that's because anything that uses the public keyword is visible to any package within the project folder so even though this is in package two it's still visible to anything within package one and a lot of other classes use this such as class c this is public a sub is public b is public and a is public now check this out we have created an instance of our c class within class a but what would happen if we removed the public axis modifier from the class definition of c well now currently c is using the default access modifier so our class c is only visible to classes within the same package as class c if we go back to class a while now class a can no longer create an instance of class c because the visibility of c has changed class a is within package 1 and we can no longer access class c because class c is only available to classes within the same package so let's change the visibility of c back to public so that's all what the public access modifier is anything that is public is available or visible to other packages our next access modifier is the protected access modifier so let's create a protected variable let's call this string protected message and let's change the string to this is protected here's how the protected axis modifier works so something that is protected is accessible to a different class in a different package as long as that class is a subclass of whatever class contains this protected member so for this example let's copy this line of our protected message and paste it within the a class we're going to take our main method cut it and then copy this within our a subclass let's remove this instance of our c class and we're going to create an instance of our a subclass so a sub let's call this a sub lower case equals new a sub so a sub extends a even though a is in a different package we have access to this protected variable because something that is protected is accessible to a different class in a different package as long as that class is a subclass of whatever class contains that protected member so we have an instance of our a subclass and we should be able to access this protected message variable so system.out.printline a sub dot and here is our protected message and it just states this is protected and our last access modifier is private so let's create a private variable private let's copy what we have for our default message and change default to private so this will be private message and the string will be this is private all right now let's copy all of this and paste it within class beep so something that is private is only visible to the class that it contains itself so only class b has access to this private message so i'm going to revert everything that i changed for class a so let's put this main method back in remove the main method from a sub and let's create an instance of our b class so b b equals new b and i would like to access this private message found within class b so system.out.printline b dot but it doesn't appear that we can actually see that so let's attempt to actually print this b dot private message but this states the field b private message is not visible that's because something that is private is only visible to the class that it contains and nothing else even if it's within the same package well that's the basics of access modifiers we have public protected the default access modifier and private so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of access modifiers in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help
