hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well in today's video i'm going to show you all how we can switch scenes using scene builder so sit back relax and enjoy the show if i could have just a moment of your time please like comment and subscribe i would greatly appreciate it hey all you cool cats in this video i'm going to show you all how we can switch scenes using scene builder the first thing that we'll need are two fxml files one for each scene as well as a scene controller so let's create two fxml files go to your application package right click go to new other new fxml document i'm going to name this scene one but feel free to call it whatever you want and i'll create a second fxml file right click again then go to new other new fxml document next and i will call this scene to finish and now we need a controller class right click again new class and i will name this let's say scene controller and that is it and finish now before we move on to filling in the scene controller class let's make sure that we have a few things filled out within our main java file we should have at least these four lines within the start method parent root equals fxml loader blah blah blah blah blah and then pass in the file name of the scene that you initially want to be displayed i would like scene 1 to initially be displayed so i will pass in that file name scene1.fxml scene scene equals new scene pass in the root node as an argument stage.set scene pass in the scene as an argument and lastly stage thought show and that should be good let's fill in our scene controller class now within our scene controller class let's declare a few things private stage stage private scene scene and lastly private parent root and be sure to get these imports as well make sure you're importing from javafx and not anyplace else and now we'll create two methods one named switch to scene one and the other switch to scene two these will be public void switch to scene one there is one parameter action event and let's say event okay make sure to get this import too copy this paste it and rename the second method as switch to scene two now there's four lines of code we need within each of these methods the first line of code is actually this line from our start method parent root equals fxml loader then all that jazz let's copy this paste it within switch to scene one now the second line of code is a little more complex oh then add throws declaration or surround with the try and catch block be sure to do that too all right the second line of code stage equals then within a set of parentheses we're going to get the source of this event and cast it to a node so that would be event dot get source then we will cast the source to a node then at the end we'll do some method training dot get scene dot get window then we need to take all of this and cast it to a stage looks like you'll need an import for node as well so hover your cursor over node and import node from javafx dot scene now the second line of code will be scene equals new scene and pass in your root node as an argument and lastly i guess there's five lines of code i lied stage dot set scene and we will add our scene and lastly stage dot show and we are good now let's copy all this paste it within switch to scene two and make a few changes add thrills declaration or surround with a try and catch block okay so for this line parent root equals fxml loader make sure that you're getting the resource of scene two and not scene one because within this method we're switching to scene two so we don't wanna switch back to scene one right all right and that should be good for our scene controller class let's open up scene builder and build some of these scenes let's begin with scene one so i'm going to right click on my fxml file then open with scene builder all right within scene builder we're working on scene1.fxml i'm going to delete this anchor pane that was generated for us and create a new one i will click anchor pane drag and drop it let's create a label and a button for labels and buttons go to controls and these are all in alphabetical order let's go to label drag and drop it i'll change the text to perhaps this is scene one i'll increase the font size too so go to font and let's change this to something large 50 would be good and i'll recenter and we'll create a button because we'll need a button to switch scenes i'll change the text let's say switch to scene 2 and i'll increase the font as well 20 would be good and center this okay now we need to add our controller class so under controller class you should have the name your package dot scene controller and we need to add an event to this button so click on your button go to code on action switch to scene two and let's save this you can go to file save or save as and let's open scene two now file open scene two okay let's delete this anchor pane same process as before really let's create a label there it is for the text let's change this to this is scene two let's increase the font size i think last time it was 50. let's recenter this we'll create a button drag and drop it i'll place it in the center and the text will be switch to scene one i think last time the font was 20 recenter it add your controller class under controller class select the name your package dot scene controller click your button and then we need to add our action on action switch to scene one let's save this and close out of everything let's make sure that we update and save scene two fxml and scene one fxml because sometimes these don't like to update all right then we can run and test everything we are currently within scene one and if i were to click this button we'll switch to scene 2. boom boom boom boom boom all right people well that's how to switch scenes using scene builder if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how to switch scenes using scene builder hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment
