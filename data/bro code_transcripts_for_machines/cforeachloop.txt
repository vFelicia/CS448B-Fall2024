oh yeah all right everybody for each loops a for each loop is a simpler and more elegant way to iterate over an array however it's less flexible compared to a standard for loop i have an array of names of vehicles named cars we have a bmw mustang and corvette then we can use a standard for loop to iterate and display the elements of this array so this works fine however it's a lot of work to write all of this another approach although it's less flexible is to create a for each loop this will iterate once for each element within my array so type for each parenthesis curly braces and within the parenthesis we list the data type of each element then we need a name for each element that we're working with since we're working with cars let's call each element a car string car in the name of the array cars string car in cars then i will with the right line statement display whatever car is so this is kind of like a nickname for the element that we're currently working with so let's get rid of this for loop because we don't need it anymore and use our for each loop instead and this works the same as before one downside with a for each loop is that it's not flexible with a standard for loop we can iterate forwards backwards or even skip iterations so use whatever loop is more appropriate for your situation well everybody that is a for each loop it's a simpler and more elegant way to iterate over an array however it's not as flexible if you just need something simple to display the elements of an array you can easily use a for each loop alright everybody so that's a for each loop if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well those are four each loops in c sharp
