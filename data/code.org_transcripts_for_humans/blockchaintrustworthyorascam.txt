00:07 - powered decentralization has the
00:09 - potential to impact Society in a variety
00:11 - of ways including around how much power
00:13 - companies and governments have
00:16 - blockchains are immutable the record
00:18 - that's created cannot be changed by
00:21 - anyone so whatever is put onto a
00:23 - blockchain you can trust and rely its
00:25 - accuracy that's pretty powerful in a
00:27 - world of deep fakes in a world of the
00:29 - exposure of corruption and graft all
00:32 - over the world blockchains give us a
00:35 - financial infrastructure that we can
00:36 - deploy worldwide when certain crisis or
00:40 - things break out sometimes it takes a
00:42 - while to get that funding to people but
00:44 - with newer Technologies we can find
00:45 - entire regions and places more quickly
00:47 - and overnight oftentimes when we give
00:49 - our power away that power is actually
00:51 - used against us with blockchain
00:52 - technology it's all about giving the
00:54 - power back to the user giving the
00:56 - control back to the user when you go on
00:58 - Instagram you are beholden to the
01:01 - Instagrams algorithm of what they show
01:03 - you how you discover new content and how
01:06 - you engage with the platform itself and
01:08 - I think that works for many reasons
01:10 - moving forward however think
01:12 - decentralization has a role to play in
01:15 - creating systems where users can have
01:17 - more control over their data over their
01:20 - privacy and over how they interact with
01:22 - any platform online one of the most
01:25 - interesting things about
01:25 - cryptocurrencies is they're Universal
01:27 - there's no Bitcoin Central Authority and
01:30 - so everybody can use it without having
01:32 - to trust some particular government or
01:34 - some particular Central Authority
01:36 - there are good reasons for having
01:38 - centralized entities for one they can
01:41 - afford certain kinds of protections that
01:42 - a decentralized entity can if there's
01:45 - not the entity that's in control or the
01:47 - entity that is there to protect you from
01:49 - say frauds and scams like Banks can do
01:52 - then consumers for instance are
01:54 - vulnerable because there's no Central
01:57 - authority to appeal to if you lose your
02:00 - money it's final tax thefts are quite
02:04 - scary when you're holding Bitcoin and
02:06 - that's always going to be an issue it's
02:08 - actually an issue with with anything in
02:09 - life right with any physical property
02:14 - Bitcoin itself is a is a hyped up fraud
02:17 - so I think we're seeing lots of scams
02:18 - and frauds for a variety of Reason one
02:20 - is that it's really complex it's
02:24 - difficult to understand what's going on
02:26 - the government doesn't really have a
02:28 - great grip on what's going on so you
02:31 - have government confusion and therefore
02:33 - lack of oversight you have frankly some
02:35 - very intelligent people operating
02:37 - cryptocurrency companies and you have
02:40 - lots of people who want to make a lot of
02:41 - money and lots of gullible people who
02:43 - put all that into the mix you've got a
02:45 - recipe for disaster my biggest worry
02:47 - about the blockchain space is that we
02:51 - need to protect users and ensure that
02:54 - their security comes first I think it's
02:56 - very clear that we need government
02:58 - regulation we have seen the collapse of
03:02 - big crypto firms we have seen all kinds
03:05 - of problems people are going to get
03:07 - their money stolen at the end of the day
03:09 - you need the government to regulate to
03:13 - sort of control the direction of Us in
03:15 - January alone Bitcoin is heading to a
03:18 - roughly 4 percent gain he always
03:20 - volatile cryptocurrency Market took a
03:22 - dive this week the reason there's so
03:24 - much volatility in prices of crypto
03:27 - assets is
03:28 - we don't quite know what the future is
03:31 - we don't know what regulation is going
03:33 - to be we don't know all the uses it's
03:35 - very early days nothing is guaranteed to
03:38 - go up forever
03:39 - and nothing is guaranteed that is going
03:41 - to continue to go down Forever Until
03:43 - really Bitcoin succeeds the price won't
03:46 - start to stabilize it will still be very
03:49 - volatile they eventually become approve
03:51 - itself and the price will will become
03:54 - more stable I believe it's valuable on
03:55 - the condition that people value it it's
03:57 - valuable on the condition that there are
04:00 - enough people who will accept it as a
04:02 - means of trade if no one wants to accept
04:06 - it as a form of payment then no it
04:08 - doesn't have any value currency isn't
04:09 - the kind of thing that has value
04:11 - independently of what people think about
04:12 - it
