00:11 - as a 4-year-old had to live through a
00:14 - Islamic revolution totalitarian regime
00:17 - war with Iraq and bombings every night
00:19 - in our city so not a great childhood
00:22 - probably the most important thing that
00:23 - happened to me in my childhood was when
00:25 - my dad bought myself and my twin brother
00:27 - our first computer he didn't bring us
00:29 - any soft or any games and we were in
00:31 - Iran so he couldn't buy any of that
00:33 - stuff so I learned how to basically
00:35 - program the computer from the manual
00:37 - because I knew how to do computer
00:38 - programming I ended up getting the
00:40 - chance to build Internet Explorer which
00:42 - is used by billions of people had the
00:44 - chance to invest in Dropbox on Facebook
00:47 - these things made a major difference in
00:49 - my
00:52 - [Music]
00:56 - life the Delta between jobs and students
01:00 - is roughly 100,000 jobs a year more jobs
01:03 - than students studing computer science
01:05 - over 10 years that adds up to 1 million
01:07 - jobs and if you add up the salaries it's
01:10 - over half a trillion that basically our
01:12 - industry wants to pay to these graduates
01:14 - the graduates don't
01:16 - exist our population needs to be ready
01:18 - for the 21st century and the vast
01:20 - majority of our schools don't even teach
01:22 - this skill this is a field that leads to
01:24 - the best paying jobs in the country it
01:26 - is the degree that if you graduate with
01:28 - you have the highest chance of of
01:30 - graduating with a job and the highest
01:32 - salary
01:36 - possible code.org started out as a hobby
01:38 - for me I wanted to make a short movie
01:40 - that combines some of the smartest most
01:43 - famous Geeks of the world along with
01:45 - regular World celebrities talking about
01:47 - the importance of learning computer
01:49 - science and how it can change your life
01:50 - and how it's important for our world
01:52 - this video resonated with millions of
01:54 - people it struck a real cord and the
01:56 - response was so overwhelming that my
01:57 - hobbies now turned into a full-time job
01:59 - for code.org success is about two things
02:02 - every school in the United States
02:03 - teaches computer science and every
02:05 - single student gets some exposure to it
02:08 - we should be able to add trillions of
02:09 - dollars to the economy millions of jobs
02:12 - as well as helping reduce the inequality
02:14 - Gap by allowing the underprivileged kids
02:16 - to have a pathway to the best jobs in
02:19 - the country and it's not just about the
02:21 - jobs you can get or the salaries it's
02:23 - about learning that if you build
02:25 - something you have a dream you can
02:26 - spread that dream to other people and it
02:29 - changes the world oh
