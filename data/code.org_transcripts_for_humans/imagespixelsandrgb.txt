00:01 - A little BIT about Pixels
00:06 - (camera clicks) Good.
00:11 - I created Instagram with my co-founder, Mike.
00:14 - Initially we saw the mobile phone as
an opportunity to create something new.
00:19 - Because for the first time people were carrying around a computer in their pocket.
00:22 - And we decided that sharing imagery was probably the biggest opportunity
00:26 - for the next five years, and one that we held close to our hearts,
00:30 - something we wanted to spend our time on.
00:32 - It's great to say you have an app or an idea that does x, y, or z
00:35 - but unless that solves a real problem for people they're not going to use it.
00:39 - And the question is: What problem are you solving?
00:44 - (Piper - Photographer) When people first faced the problem of how to show a picture on a screen
00:47 - they had to come up with a way to break the image down into data.
00:51 - In 1957, an early computer engineer named Russell Kirsch took a picture of his infant son and scanned it.
00:57 - It was the first digital image,
00:58 - a grainy black and white baby picture.
01:00 - And that's how the pixel was born!
01:02 - Pixels are an interesting concept because you can't see them very easily.
01:07 - But actually, if you get a magnifying glass
and you go up to a screen
01:11 - you actually can see that your screen is made up of tiny dots of little light.
01:16 - What's more interesting is that those tiny dots of little light
01:19 - are actually multiple tiny dots of little light of different colors.
01:22 - There's red, green, and blue.
01:24 - Pixels together, from far away, create an image and upfront they are just little lights that are on and off.
01:30 - The combination of those create images
01:33 - and what you see on your screen every single day you use your computer.
01:36 - So you'll hear the term resolution a lot, both in computer science
01:40 - and manufacturers of devices will talk about it.
01:43 - Resolution is basically the dimensions by which you can measure how many pixels are on a screen.
01:49 - So back in the day when I was a high school student,
01:52 - it was 640 by 480 pixels.
01:54 - And today it's a lot bigger.
01:55 - And then there's the question not only of resolution, but also density.
01:59 - For instance, on modern smartphones they fit the same number of little lights called pixels,
02:03 - but in a denser space and that's what allows you to get sharper images.
02:07 - Now, how do you store those values
of the pixels in a file?
02:12 - What you do is you store red, green, and blue values in little triplets effectively,
02:17 - with different values that each make up a single pixel.
02:22 - The values range from 0 to 255.
02:26 - 0 would be very dark, 255 would be very bright.
02:31 - And triplets of these values together compose a single pixel.
02:37 - An image file, whether it's a jpeg, gif, png,
etc.
02:41 - contains millions of these RGB (red-green-blue) triplets.
02:43 - So how does a computer store all that data?
02:46 - All computing and digital data are represented by bits.
02:49 - A bit has two states: it's on or it's off.
02:52 - But instead of on or off, computers use 1 and 0 -- binary!
02:57 - So an image file is actually just a bunch of 1s and 0s.
03:00 - But why do RGB values go from 0 to 255?
03:04 - Turns out that each color channel, RGB, is represented by 8 bits,
03:09 - which together are called a byte.
03:12 - If you know the binary number system,
03:13 - you know that the maximum number 8 bits can represent is 255,
03:18 - which is equal to eight 1s in a row.
03:20 - And the lowest is 0 or eight 0s in a row.
03:23 - Therefore, 0 to 255 gives us 256 different intensities per color channel.
03:32 - We can represent a pixel of the color turquoise for example,
03:36 - in our traditional decimal based number system as 64 (for a little red),
03:41 - 224 (for a lot of green),
03:43 - and 208 (for some blue).
03:45 - But a computer would have stored it as
03:47 - Red: 01000000 // Green: 11100000 // Blue: 1101 0000
03:56 - We use 24 binary digits to represent this one pixel.
04:01 - So rather than binary, digital artists often use the hexadecimal number system to represent colors.
04:07 - So we can represent the same color turquoise using only six hexadecimal digits:
04:12 - 40 E0 D0. Which is a lot shorter.
04:16 - Let's say you want to modify the colors of
the image. How do you do that?
04:20 - Basically there are ways of mapping functions where you take the input value of the pixel.
04:25 - So you take an input of a red, green, and blue value which represents that color remember.
04:30 - Then you map it using a function to a new red, green, and blue value.
04:35 - Let's say you wanted to make an image darker.
04:39 - One way of doing that is by taking the red, green, and blue values that
04:42 - come in and let's just say subtracting a fixed constant from each of them,
04:47 - say subtract 50.
04:49 - Obviously you can't go below 0, but you just subtract 50 from each of them and that's the output.
04:54 - So the input is R, G, B and the output is R-50, G-50, B-50.
05:00 - What you'll see is you've taken an image with a certain brightness,
05:04 - and you get out an image with a much darker brightness.
05:07 - What a lot of people don't realize
about Instagram is that
05:10 - initially people thought what it was was a way of filtering images,
05:14 - making your images look cool in some way or retro.
05:17 - And what it grew into was actually
much more important,
05:20 - it was a way of people connecting.
05:22 - So it's not just about seeing photos of your friends and your family,
05:26 - but actually being able to discover things happening all around the world.
05:30 - Whether that's a riot overseas, a social movement,
05:34 - you're able to basically consume that information in a visual way.
05:38 - And that allowed us to grow very quickly and be a universal platform.

A little BIT about Pixels (camera clicks) Good. I created Instagram with my cofounder, Mike. Initially we saw the mobile phone as an opportunity to create something new.
