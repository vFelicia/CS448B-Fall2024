03:32 - perfect thank you so as I mentioned this
03:35 - is our first monthly hang out that we're
03:37 - planning to host for the exploring
03:38 - computer science community hopefully
03:40 - those of you who are joining us are a
03:42 - part of the exploring computer science
03:43 - program at code.org if you're not that's
03:47 - okay we hope you'll also get something
03:48 - out of the conversation this evening but
03:50 - our goal really is to connect folks who
03:53 - are teaching the ecs curriculum across
03:55 - the United States we have a powerful
03:57 - crew of hundreds of teachers across the
03:59 - country who are doing this work and we
04:00 - think if we work together and connect as
04:02 - a community we can really make a
04:04 - difference in computer science education
04:06 - and these monthly hangouts are one way
04:08 - we want to do that each month we're
04:10 - going to be talking about a hot topic
04:12 - related to that part of the school year
04:14 - this month we are focusing on how to get
04:16 - get get it set up for success so we're
04:19 - going to hear a little bit some tips and
04:20 - how you can kick off your classroom like
04:22 - this september's we're also going to
04:24 - take a tour of some new resources that
04:26 - we have a bit available for the
04:28 - exploring computer science classroom
04:29 - we're going to talk about tips and
04:31 - tricks and then finally the last part of
04:33 - the meeting will be questions concerns
04:35 - and feedback and that's where we're
04:36 - going to use Twitter and the Google+
04:38 - Hangouts event page to post your
04:40 - question so broke i think we think i'll
04:43 - head to slides and at this point i'm
04:46 - going to hand it over to Danny McAvoy is
04:48 - going to talk you through some important
04:49 - reminders for the month Danny alright

05:07 - that you probably like your nights free
05:09 - and
05:11 - we're booking you up but there is a very
05:14 - important webinar being run by cs10k on
05:18 - the SR I assessments for ecs so these
05:22 - are going to be unit tests they can be
05:25 - done with paper and pencil there a lot
05:28 - of short answer type questions but more
05:31 - of those details will be given out on
05:34 - the webinar tomorrow so you should take
05:38 - a look at that link and head over to
05:40 - that webinar to find out more the other
05:42 - thing to just remind you of is phase 3
05:45 - in person rpd for that will be starting
05:48 - in about two weeks depending on where
05:50 - you are it may be another week or two
05:52 - after that but take a look at that link
05:54 - that I've put their that updates you on
05:57 - where your PD is depending on your area
06:01 - of the country and when it is happening
06:03 - so make sure you take a look at both of
06:05 - those links before you leave us tonight
06:10 - alright brick next slide
06:14 - alright so i'm going to introduce our
06:17 - guest speaker flow flow was a co.org ecs
06:21 - teacher last year she started with us
06:23 - and she works in Oakland so she's going
06:27 - to tell us about her ecs experience and
06:30 - then give you some tips for the year hi
06:34 - I'm flow I teach in Oakland a very whom
06:40 - urban School District last year we had a
06:43 - great time with ecs I had a class that
06:46 - was probably eighty five percent female
06:49 - and in fact all of them are going on to
06:52 - continuance of computer science and
06:54 - engineering pathways and one thing I'm
06:56 - really excited about my last year's
06:57 - classes that we had a lot of them a lot
07:00 - of Muslim girls in in ninth graders too
07:04 - and they came in extremely shy extremely
07:07 - quiet um and when I see them in the
07:09 - hallways now I know that it was a part
07:11 - of that UCS curriculum um but we're
07:14 - going to get started with some top tips
07:16 - that you can use to make your ecs
07:18 - classroom successful i'm the first one
07:21 - that we have is confidence confidence is
07:24 - cute i looked up the word confidence and
07:27 - the dictionary is defined as a noun in
07:30 - the feeling that you can rely on someone
07:32 - or that someone can rely on you and what
07:36 - I like about confidence is that it is a
07:37 - thing right it is a noun so it is
07:40 - something that we can we can learn we
07:42 - can gain and then not just confidence in
07:44 - the subject of cs i'm i am a math
07:47 - teacher and so my CS confidence is not
07:50 - that great but i do have the confidence
07:53 - that I can help kids get to a further
07:55 - place and to help them learn something
07:58 - and so they trusted me and they rely on
08:00 - me um the next tip that we have is
08:03 - called established participation so like
08:08 - established as in it's a part of the
08:10 - class a normal part of the class every
08:12 - day students come in they expect to
08:14 - participate but that doesn't happen
08:16 - organically so we have to create
08:18 - structures that promote positive
08:20 - participation I'm keeping equity in mind
08:22 - so not just asking students to raise
08:25 - their hands but creating ways for them
08:28 - personally to participate we have to
08:31 - make participation not be an option in
08:33 - fact that my class participation is is
08:36 - woven into their grade points and
08:38 - finally rewarding participation efforts
08:40 - when you see students doing something
08:42 - that you like call that out teach them
08:45 - how to participate because often
08:46 - students don't know what works in a
08:49 - group and what doesn't work in a group
08:50 - it takes a lot of practice tip number
08:53 - three is building community so we often
08:58 - I think as teachers take this one for
09:00 - granted oh we don't want to spend all
09:03 - this time getting to know our students
09:05 - or we need to get started in the
09:07 - curriculum but I have found that if you
09:10 - take this time in the beginning is going
09:12 - to go much smoother you mean so create a
09:15 - safe learning environment let students
09:17 - know like your classroom is like Vegas
09:19 - what happens there stays there play some
09:22 - name games go and talk to elementary
09:24 - school teachers find out what you can do
09:26 - because we might think it's a little
09:28 - childish but it's the way that we get
09:30 - kids to trust us and finally integrate
09:32 - some positive classroom rituals I'm at
09:35 - the end of my class we take away time to
09:37 - give props to each other for the way we
09:40 - participated for the way that we spoke
09:43 - to our classmates I'm just reinforcing
09:45 - those positive things and then making it
09:47 - a ritual so it's something that we do
09:49 - every day the next tip that we have is
09:52 - make the material relevant right like
09:56 - sometimes we think Oh kids just want to
09:59 - do CS because it's awesome but I don't
10:01 - think that they realize how awesome it
10:03 - is most of our students are consumers
10:06 - and not creators so some things that you
10:09 - can do is conduct an interest are they
10:10 - just ask them what it is they like and
10:13 - then it's all new though to figure out
10:15 - how to connect those things I'm consider
10:17 - wide ranges of cs careers when you're
10:19 - talking about careers and also
10:21 - considered a history of cs and
10:23 - contributions of women and people of
10:26 - color students have a lot of ideas and
10:28 - they come from all over the place so we
10:30 - want to reach them where they are the
10:32 - next tip is to create outside
10:35 - relationships oh I cannot tell you how
10:37 - important this is I'm i remember when i
10:39 - started teaching the student actually
10:41 - I lived at the school um and then when
10:44 - they saw me at the football game on
10:46 - Friday night it was like I was a whole
10:48 - different person go to a sports activity
10:51 - sponsor a club I mean it can be
10:54 - something as simple as having your door
10:56 - open for students to come in and eat
10:57 - their lunch when they see you as
10:59 - somebody other than their teacher like
11:02 - they can trust you and that also boosts
11:04 - your own confidence the next tip that I
11:07 - have is to be intentional so everything
11:12 - that you do have to have a purpose from
11:15 - the warm-up question to the homework
11:18 - that you give to UM the way that you set
11:24 - up your chairs right so have clear plans
11:26 - be organized in practice good time
11:29 - management do this know when we're
11:31 - faking they know we don't have anything
11:33 - to do and we don't want to create that
11:35 - kind of environment the next tip that we
11:38 - have our partners partners partners so
11:44 - it is very important that we collaborate
11:47 - with other people in this area just like
11:49 - we expect our students to collaborate
11:51 - one of our first partners that we have
11:54 - to get on board or our parents and
11:55 - gardens you have to make the initial
11:57 - content you have to be the one to call
12:00 - them make some positive phone calls I'm
12:02 - get involved with their community see
12:04 - who is available to help in Oakland I'm
12:06 - a few miles away from Silicon Valley but
12:09 - I want to make sure that I get those
12:10 - partners involved um and also your staff
12:13 - and your faculty at your school let them
12:15 - know where you're doing let them come
12:16 - check out your classroom so you can
12:18 - expand your program um the next step
12:21 - that we have is number eight and that
12:25 - tip says that all of this stuff can be
12:27 - learned right um none of these skills
12:30 - are innate we are not born with any of
12:33 - them um if you have a trouble with
12:35 - confidence stand in the mirror in the
12:37 - morning and tell yourself how great you
12:39 - are if you're having trouble with
12:40 - classroom management make a plan in fact
12:43 - this year I made a poster just for
12:46 - myself and I put it on the wall and it
12:48 - says stay calm check for understanding
12:50 - and knowledge dollars like those are the
12:54 - three things that help my class
12:55 - I swim run I have to remind myself all
12:57 - the time and that's okay because I
12:59 - figure by the next week or so it's going
13:02 - to be something that I do all the time
13:04 - so you can learn these skills and then
13:07 - finally the very last tip is to have fun
13:11 - oh my we transfer our fun to the
13:17 - students and if we come in with awesome
13:18 - attitudes they will have awesome
13:20 - attitudes and we will learn a lot and
13:22 - they will really be hooked and they will
13:24 - really be engaged and so have a very
13:27 - successful year awesome thank you for
13:34 - that was so great it was great hearing
13:36 - about your experience and what help make
13:39 - your classroom a really positive
13:41 - environment we're going to have
13:43 - questions for flow at the end so are we
13:49 - doing them right now Brooke do you looks
13:53 - like we have to slide up for them now so
13:56 - we can take a couple questions for flow
13:59 - right now I think Melissa might have
14:01 - them if we have any that account so let
14:05 - me know so if you have a question for
14:07 - flow you can go ahead and tweet it with
14:08 - hashtag code or pd and we'll ask her for
14:11 - you or you can go to the event page on
14:13 - Google+ and enter it there so flow while
14:17 - we're waiting to get some questions from
14:18 - the audience at a question from you for
14:20 - you what the knowledge dollar oh okay so
14:24 - so knowledge dollars are these really
14:26 - cool like slips of paper they're worth
14:29 - one book but I give them out like when I
14:32 - ever I see students doing things that
14:34 - are great whenever they're doing things
14:35 - I want them to do whenever they are
14:37 - being great and okay please don't laugh
14:39 - at me but like I tell them like I try to
14:42 - make it rain knowledge dollars all the
14:43 - time um because then I have like I call
14:46 - it the knowledge dollar store and things
14:48 - are super expensive like a candy bar is
14:50 - like 25 knowledge dollars like you have
14:53 - to be on point all the time um but they
14:56 - love them it is so amazing how high
14:58 - school students like just jump on that
15:00 - kind of stuff I feel like everything
15:02 - that I've ever done I've got from a
15:03 - middle school teacher oradell an
15:05 - interesting teacher but it totally works
15:08 - and it's it's easy for me is cheap it's
15:10 - just paper I cut it up um and the things
15:13 - that I by don't cost me that much money
15:15 - so that it works another quick question
15:19 - related to that you know you're starting
15:22 - ecs again this year was what lesson are
15:25 - you starting with what are you going to
15:26 - kick off with what are you rollin so all
15:28 - last week we did um just a bunch of
15:32 - community building activities um we did
15:35 - tower building activities we did an
15:38 - activity called broken circles um we did
15:41 - a lot of stuff from building intentional
15:44 - communities so that's a website that's
15:46 - so that's all we did last week so now I
15:49 - have two sections of ecs with 30 kids in
15:52 - both of them I know all their names they
15:54 - know my name we all know each other
15:56 - things we know things that we like we
15:59 - actually watch some videos I mean so now
16:01 - when I talk about how important ecs is
16:03 - they understand and so today we did the
16:07 - lesson what is a computer I like had to
16:09 - shut that thing down like how intense
16:12 - and awesome the debate got between
16:14 - students and so but we were able to get
16:17 - that intense because they knew each
16:19 - other they knew how to respect each
16:20 - other there um I mean even things like
16:22 - giving them sentence starters how to
16:24 - respectfully disagree with somebody else
16:27 - those are all things that I do
16:29 - intentionally to make sure that the
16:31 - classroom flows well thanks it's super
16:35 - helpful to hear hey Brooke I'm not sure
16:38 - how to share the link for the plus page
16:40 - in case people want to post questions
16:43 - you have any suggestions there we could
16:47 - turn on showcase and share it there we
16:50 - could also post it over on the monthly
16:52 - meeting the monthly meeting page
16:55 - directly on the event page a good idea
16:58 - like I notice under me I don't know if
17:00 - of guests have this but under me there's
17:02 - a thing that says links if you click on
17:04 - that that it'll take you there as well
17:06 - so if you have a question you can go
17:08 - there and we're going to have a section
17:09 - of the call later where we'll have Q&A
17:12 - for Danny and Brooks so you'll
17:13 - definitely want to find that page to go
17:17 - there and post questions but so we want
17:19 - to thank you so much for your time it's
17:21 - so great to hear about your
17:22 - experience and I know that you're
17:24 - available right to help folks out if
17:26 - they have questions throughout the year
17:28 - oh yes absolutely wonderful great well
17:31 - thank you so much and I hand it back to
17:33 - dance you so much thank you Danny take
17:37 - it away alright guys so um one of the
17:43 - things we heard from a lot of our
17:44 - teachers last year and some of you guys
17:46 - at PD this summer is you would love some
17:48 - more support for the curriculum
17:50 - different things like hey does anybody
17:54 - have a really cool assessment idea that
17:56 - we could see or what is the structure of
17:59 - a semester course with ecs so ah we're
18:04 - going to show you the resource we have
18:06 - created it's called the code org ecs
18:08 - teacher resource folder and it's going
18:11 - to help us bring together resources that
18:14 - all of the teachers who've taught ecs or
18:16 - teaching ecs currently want to share and
18:20 - it'll also bring in some code.org
18:23 - created resources so i'm going to show
18:27 - my screen now so if you want if you had
18:30 - clicked on Brooke and you weren't
18:32 - actually watching me talk that's okay
18:36 - but you might want to click on my
18:37 - picture as I share my screen and show
18:39 - you how this folder works alrighty so
18:45 - I'm going to go into the resource folder
18:49 - as you would see it when you shop sign
18:52 - in I know that you don't have the link
18:54 - yet that's okay we're just going to
18:55 - follow along for now and we'll share the
18:57 - links with you very soon ah so this is
19:01 - the resource folder when you pop in here
19:02 - a couple things to notice um there are
19:05 - folders for each unit there's also a
19:09 - general course resource folder or
19:11 - recruiting resources and a teacher
19:13 - submitted resource folder and then these
19:16 - two lovely things down the bottom which
19:17 - probably some of the most important
19:20 - things for this resource folder first of
19:23 - all I'm going to click on this one as it
19:26 - loads I'll tell you it's the how to
19:27 - document so if you the label wasn't
19:32 - there if it was over here which is how
19:34 - it formats normally
19:35 - um you'll see that it says how to use
19:37 - the resource folder and this is going to
19:39 - be your guide so I'm going to show you a
19:41 - lot of things but if you don't catch
19:43 - everything I said are you like reading
19:45 - it or you just need some more help ah
19:47 - this will give you most of those details
19:50 - and then anything else you need help
19:51 - with feel free to send a forum post our
19:56 - way and we'll get you an answer okay so
19:59 - what's in this how to dock well it'll
20:02 - tell you generally what the resource
20:04 - folder is it'll tell you what's in the
20:07 - resource folder what different resources
20:08 - you can find in the general the units
20:11 - and the lessons I gives you the link
20:14 - there's also a breakdown of how to
20:17 - submit a resource so lots of different
20:19 - information here great resource to look
20:21 - through and check out before you start
20:24 - trying to dive in and figure out what is
20:25 - this resourceful they're actually doing
20:27 - alright second we're going to take a
20:31 - look in the general course resource
20:33 - folder so it's this first one over here
20:35 - i'm going to open it up alright so in
20:38 - here you'll see lots of different things
20:39 - this is just like hey if I want to get a
20:42 - big picture of how this course works I'm
20:44 - going to come to this folder and this
20:46 - folder contains things like the
20:48 - standards mapping so down here I can
20:51 - click there's the link to the SR I
20:53 - standard mapping all the different
20:55 - mappings that they've done great
20:57 - resource right here for you we also have
21:01 - the ecs calendar so we've heard from a
21:03 - lot of people like hey if I'm doing this
21:06 - and I want to get through all six units
21:07 - what should my pacing be so we've given
21:10 - you a general pacing for that we've also
21:12 - had a bunch of questions about what
21:14 - should i do if i have a semester course
21:16 - and here's a general outline of what
21:17 - that would look like as well so you can
21:21 - come in take a look if you have
21:23 - questions about that we'd love to hear
21:25 - them there's also other resources like
21:27 - this learning strategies doc so we've
21:30 - been working on this for our computer
21:31 - science principles curriculum but it's
21:33 - actually applicable to anything you've
21:35 - ever wanted to teach in your whole life
21:36 - it's just a bunch of strategies about
21:38 - how to teach stuff how to do group work
21:41 - how to do a share out how to do a
21:43 - wrap-up so lots of different ideas in
21:45 - here it's really long but there's lots
21:48 - of links and ways to navigate
21:49 - easily so you should be able to find
21:51 - what you're looking for and get
21:53 - different ideas as I'm sure you've all
21:55 - seen in pd there's gallery walk so lots
21:59 - of the ideas in here something to take a
22:00 - look at if you're lost for an idea on
22:02 - how to run a lesson all right throughout
22:05 - this you also see that there's the ecs
22:09 - resources so what we've done is that
22:11 - huge dock that we printed for you or if
22:13 - you're not a code or teacher the dock
22:15 - that you have on your computer right we
22:18 - taken that and we've broken it down so
22:20 - it's a lot easier to digest you don't
22:21 - have to digest it in one big thing it's
22:23 - broken apart so there's lots of
22:25 - different things here's the course
22:28 - overview that you'll find at the
22:29 - beginning you can take a look through
22:30 - that and read it if you want so all of
22:33 - those are scattered throughout where
22:35 - they make sense all right so now let's
22:38 - look at this spreadsheet this is one of
22:40 - the coolest pieces of this resource
22:42 - folder at least I think so it's going to
22:44 - be the way that you're going to share
22:46 - resources with other teachers and other
22:48 - teachers can share resources with you so
22:51 - this is what's going to give us that
22:52 - ability for everybody to share so here
22:56 - you'll see I've submitted a couple
22:58 - resources just to fill it in so we can
22:59 - take a look at how this works and right
23:02 - what you'll notice is I'm going to tab
23:05 - down the bottom here that says all
23:06 - responses but I could go to things that
23:08 - are general resources or say I wanted to
23:12 - look at the unit to resources I can
23:14 - click on those tabs and find out what
23:17 - resources exist for that hopefully this
23:19 - will grow and when it grows it maybe get
23:22 - come too big to deal with right I want
23:24 - unit to resource but there's just so
23:26 - many of them so how do I deal with that
23:28 - well let's take a look back let's go
23:30 - back to our folder here our original
23:34 - location sorry it's taking a second to
23:36 - load as I'm screen sharing all right and
23:41 - let's go to unit 2 so I'm click on the
23:43 - unit 2 folder
23:45 - and you'll notice that in here there's
23:49 - also a spreadsheet that says unit to
23:51 - resources and that is where it will pull
23:54 - out all the resources that are specific
23:56 - to unit 2 from that big spreadsheet and
23:59 - it's going to take a second to load when
24:01 - you do this because it has to pull from
24:03 - that spreadsheet but it will load and
24:06 - you'll be able to see that it's broken
24:08 - down by day so down the bottom here
24:10 - where we before had units we now can see
24:13 - a breakdown by day so I think there was
24:16 - a resource for one of these days I don't
24:18 - remember which one obviously it's not
24:23 - going to show me right now let's see
24:25 - let's go back to the original page all
24:29 - right it's taking a sec to load because
24:31 - I'm trying to present to you and do this
24:33 - at the same time so we're just going to
24:34 - let it go but it would load you could
24:37 - look at that specific day and see the
24:39 - resources for that day while we're in
24:42 - unit 2 let's take a look at what's in
24:44 - here um as I said before all the unit to
24:47 - specific things from ecs curriculum are
24:51 - in here there's also this nice code.org
24:53 - created resource so we heard from a
24:55 - bunch of teachers that they didn't
24:57 - exactly know what the homework was that
25:01 - they needed to give on certain days or
25:03 - what supplies they needed for class or
25:05 - when they needed computers so we've
25:07 - created this resource that breaks it
25:09 - down by day or lesson because lessons
25:12 - are multiple days sometimes and tells
25:14 - you if you need computers what supplies
25:16 - you might need and what homework you
25:19 - might need to assign this is just the
25:21 - minimum homework you need to decide to
25:23 - make the course function so you can take
25:25 - a look through those they're very
25:27 - helpful lastly within the unit 2 folder
25:30 - you'll see it broken down by day and
25:32 - within a day we can go in and click and
25:35 - we find out there's more resources so
25:37 - any resource you may need for that day
25:41 - is hopefully in there I'm going to jump
25:44 - out to the unit one for a sec and go
25:48 - into day one to show you some of the
25:49 - other things we're working on so as I
25:51 - said this is getting this is going to
25:53 - grow and one of the things is code.org
25:56 - wants to help grow it as well but we
25:58 - haven't got
25:59 - all of the resources for everything put
26:01 - in yet but for unit one right now there
26:03 - are exit tickets for the lesson so
26:08 - little assessment questions that you
26:09 - could ask students to see if they
26:11 - understood that lesson for the day in
26:14 - addition there's a list of links and
26:17 - extra resources that you can use also a
26:20 - link to the forum if you've been using
26:22 - that it's linked in here as well so
26:26 - those are inside a day and then within
26:30 - that day you'll also find another
26:32 - breakdown of that spreadsheet which is
26:34 - probably going to take too long to load
26:35 - again because I'm trying to share with
26:38 - you at the same time but within that
26:40 - you'll see that there's a breakdown of
26:42 - the so within that day um you can hold
26:48 - on let's see if it'll load because i
26:50 - want to show you it's pretty cool so
26:51 - within that day right i will show you in
26:54 - a sec oh there it goes so this doesn't
26:56 - have any resources that's why you see
26:58 - the na at the top cuz nobody submitted
27:00 - any if you want to submit one you'll be
27:02 - the first um but down the bottom where
27:05 - it used to say days now it has the types
27:07 - of resources so you can take a look and
27:09 - be like hey I want a video resource and
27:12 - you click that tab and show you all the
27:14 - video resources for this lesson alright
27:17 - so now the big thing how do i submit
27:20 - things right so we went through this
27:22 - whole process and we said well it'd be
27:25 - cool if we can share things but we don't
27:27 - know how so let's talk about how we do
27:28 - that so there's this teacher submitted
27:30 - resource odd folder and one of the
27:33 - things you'll notice about this folder
27:35 - is you can't touch any of the other
27:38 - folders or resource you can't mess with
27:40 - them and edit them you can however make
27:42 - a copy and if you're wondering how to
27:43 - make a copy and then be able to edit it
27:45 - that's in the house you doc I'm not
27:47 - going to go over it now but definitely
27:48 - take a look all right but if I want to
27:50 - submit a resource head into the teacher
27:52 - submitted folder you'll notice i put a
27:56 - resource in here before we're going to
28:01 - let's see i'm going to actually open
28:04 - this in my drive so that i can add
28:06 - resources to it you should be able to
28:10 - edit this
28:12 - folder so you'll have access to that so
28:14 - I'm gonna open and drive and I'm gonna
28:19 - go on that teacher submitted resource
28:21 - folder I'm actually going to remove this
28:23 - because it's going to be my demo sneaky
28:25 - sneaky alright so in here it's where I'm
28:29 - going to want to add that document so
28:31 - over here I'm going to find my document
28:33 - where did it go up there it is so I'm
28:40 - going to bring it i can drag it in
28:42 - that's one way or you can also go in
28:45 - here and click new and file upload you
28:48 - don't know how to do that if that's new
28:50 - to you feel free to look through the how
28:52 - to dock it goes over it step by step
28:56 - you'll notice down the bottom here it's
28:58 - loading telling me how long it has all
29:02 - right it's almost done and it'll show up
29:05 - in a spec unsec should come up there it
29:08 - is alright so I'm going to need a link
29:13 - to this resource to be able to share it
29:15 - with people if it's a website or a video
29:20 - write those all have links that makes
29:21 - sense this folder is meant to be for
29:24 - resources that are mostly documents that
29:28 - you can't have a link to easily if it's
29:31 - already up on the web you can just copy
29:33 - the link for that as it already exists
29:35 - you don't have to necessarily put it in
29:37 - here but for documents that you may have
29:38 - created yourself definitely going to
29:40 - want to put them up here so people can
29:41 - find them all right so I'm going to get
29:43 - the link to this resources I'm right
29:45 - clicking or control clicking on this and
29:48 - I can say get link and it gives me the
29:51 - link there I'm just going to copy it
29:53 - we're going to need it for later so
29:54 - right now it's copied can get at it
29:56 - later alright I'm going to head to our
30:05 - sharing of the
30:10 - oh boo i typed it wrong all right I'm
30:17 - going to go through it the back way
30:20 - you won't see that breakdown but you'll
30:23 - see this live form okay live form this
30:26 - is where you're going to submit the
30:27 - resources first two questions are name
30:29 - and email you do not have to answer
30:31 - those if you don't want to those are
30:33 - just there so that if someone likes your
30:35 - resource they could give you a shout out
30:36 - and be like hey i love this resource i
30:38 - use it all the time or maybe they want
30:40 - to ask you a question or maybe they edit
30:42 - the doc and they come up with a new cool
30:44 - idea and they want to share it with you
30:45 - and you get a better experience or maybe
30:49 - you learn something from their
30:50 - experience maybe they're like hey this
30:52 - happened in my classroom my classroom is
30:53 - different than yours so that's optional
30:56 - up to you whether or not you want to
30:57 - give those then you'll identify the type
31:00 - of resource so we have that document it
31:03 - was a reading on big data so it doesn't
31:06 - necessarily fit any one of these
31:11 - specifically so I'm just going to click
31:13 - resource other up to you how you
31:16 - identify it's just helpful for other
31:18 - teachers so it's based off data so I'm
31:21 - going to put it in unit 5 when I pick
31:25 - the unit and then here's where I put the
31:27 - link so I'm just going to hit paste and
31:29 - that long length that I had copied over
31:32 - gets put there we put that link it's
31:35 - really important that you get the link
31:36 - right because that's how other teachers
31:39 - are going to find it so when we listed
31:40 - in the spreadsheet that's how they're
31:42 - going to get to it then details of the
31:44 - resource you can click and type those
31:47 - out here so this is a big data reading
31:51 - something doesn't have to be very long
31:55 - probably shouldn't be very long but just
31:57 - something to give ideas for the teacher
31:59 - who might be looking at it and then why
32:01 - did you use or create this resource
32:03 - right so give them a reason for using it
32:05 - um and then if you click continue you'll
32:11 - get to a screen that asks you what day
32:13 - this is for if it's for a specific unit
32:15 - and so my resource isn't really for a
32:18 - specific day I didn't pick one that was
32:19 - for a specific day so I can just put
32:21 - other but you have options for any of
32:23 - the days for that lesson and your end of
32:26 - unit assessment if you don't know which
32:27 - day it is take a look back at the
32:29 - resource folder it has that breakdown so
32:33 - I'm going to click
32:33 - other and then submit and the coolest
32:36 - part of this is we're going to go find
32:38 - it so we're going to go see that it's
32:39 - populated live so it wasn't in there
32:41 - before but it will be now right so let's
32:45 - go and take a look here up so I still
32:48 - had it open and there it is you'll see
32:51 - that that gray line down the bottom here
32:54 - this is a big data reading that was
32:57 - exactly what i typed really exciting
32:59 - right and you'll see that you can click
33:02 - on that and go to that resource so if I
33:05 - click here
33:07 - it opens up that reading for me and I
33:09 - can take a look through it pretty
33:10 - awesome it also remember populates into
33:14 - unit 5 so let's just check that and see
33:17 - if we can see it in our unit 5 might
33:21 - take a sec to load so remember that this
33:24 - is pulling from another spreadsheet so
33:26 - you'll see that it says loading it's
33:28 - going to have this bar up in the corner
33:29 - that's going to take it a minute to load
33:31 - that's okay it just means that we're
33:34 - going to be able to constantly update so
33:37 - nobody from code.org has to go in and
33:39 - say like approved resource you can add
33:42 - this to this to the list we will check
33:45 - them if we find really good ones we're
33:47 - going to add them to the folder over
33:49 - time but for now this allows you to add
33:52 - and as soon as you add other teachers
33:54 - can see it and decide if they want to
33:57 - use it as well so the constant updating
33:58 - and there it is this line right here
34:01 - that resource that we submitted so
34:04 - pretty cool it'll keep updating as you
34:07 - go and if there's anything new it would
34:09 - show me that as well all right so that
34:13 - is the resource folder so I'm going to
34:17 - stop sharing my screen and we're going
34:22 - to take a look at what's next on our
34:25 - list I think it's QA about the resource
34:30 - folder that's right Danny and about any
34:34 - other questions that folks have as
34:36 - you're getting your year started so
34:38 - again you can go ahead and tweet any
34:40 - questions you have for Danny Brooke for
34:42 - myself or flow she's still here to code
34:45 - or PB on twitter I'll be monitoring that
34:48 - or Brooke will also explain to you how
34:50 - you can use the Q&A feature on google
34:51 - hangout yeah I'm actually going to
34:54 - switch my screen really quickly and show
34:57 - you a different a different window so
35:03 - this is the we're getting meta now this
35:07 - is showing you the live stream of of the
35:11 - hangout on air that we are currently in
35:13 - so if you have a question there's this
35:15 - questions menu over on the right just
35:17 - click a question type it in here click
35:19 - Submit and that will push through
35:20 - directly to us
35:21 - we will be able to access that I've also
35:23 - seen a couple people posting in the in
35:26 - the event itself so you can post their
35:29 - we're also monitoring that so feel free
35:31 - to post in either of those places and we
35:34 - will pull from there as well so to get
35:37 - things started while we're waiting for
35:38 - some questions to come in Oh first Danny
35:41 - did you want to share links with folks
35:45 - yeah we can share the links so if we
35:47 - just want to put the screen up will um
35:49 - so as I was going through I told you
35:53 - that we'd share the links later I've
35:54 - made nice bitly link so you don't have
35:57 - to remember those really long Google
35:59 - folder blah blah blah links I'll be pain
36:02 - in the butt so code ecs teacher
36:05 - resources is the folder and to submit a
36:08 - resource oh I said resources that's why
36:11 - I got it wrong so the submit resource is
36:14 - the other one so that'll take you to
36:16 - that live form to submit the resources
36:18 - also at the end we're going to post a
36:22 - link to the forum and it has these links
36:26 - in there as well as the links that i put
36:28 - up earlier about PD and the hangout
36:31 - tomorrow night to find out about the SR
36:33 - I ecs assessments so you miss the
36:38 - changes you'll be able to find them
36:40 - there yep we will make sure that we
36:42 - consolidate all these links for you in
36:44 - one place so you don't have to dig
36:46 - through the through the presentation to
36:48 - get that so while we're waiting on some
36:52 - questions to come in Danny and I will
36:53 - switch back my screen so folks can see
36:58 - how to how to submit those questions I'm
37:02 - curious since you've been spending so
37:04 - much time in this resource folder what
37:07 - you think is is most exciting or most
37:10 - useful as someone fresh out of the
37:13 - classroom what do you wish you had for
37:15 - your classes that you taught last year
37:18 - that we have in the resource folder well
37:21 - I really so I'm a very organized person
37:24 - and I've started to impose this on
37:27 - people at code.org I like organized
37:29 - folders that you know i can find stuff
37:31 - and I know where it is and it's easy so
37:34 - my
37:35 - favorite thing I use the resource folder
37:36 - as I'm trying to find ways to improve
37:38 - ecs or need to reference what the number
37:41 - of days are in a unit or whatever I go
37:44 - in and I look at the folders and so the
37:46 - folders are really nice because they
37:48 - have all those details and I don't have
37:50 - to go digging through the dock or
37:52 - flipping through a book right I just say
37:54 - okay I want something about unit 1 ahead
37:56 - into unit 1 and there's the daily break
37:58 - down right there for me of unit 1 so I
38:01 - find that really helpful I'm a very like
38:03 - tree structured organized person I like
38:06 - things in folders so I guess that's
38:08 - probably the best part of it for me but
38:12 - I know that as a teacher I also really
38:15 - like when people tell me all right what
38:17 - is the like minimum viable thing that I
38:19 - need to happen today to make this happen
38:21 - maybe like you know teaching your you're
38:24 - just like all right I have a couple
38:26 - different preps how do I make this
38:27 - lesson happen and it's really simple
38:29 - because it's broken down into like
38:31 - here's what you need to have for
38:33 - resources that list is there so here's
38:36 - the supplies I need for the lesson today
38:38 - do I need computers what should I assign
38:41 - for homework if I forget like all else
38:44 - what what do I need to assign for
38:46 - homework tonight that's all there for
38:48 - you and then you have the nice lesson
38:49 - plans that ecs created so they're there
38:52 - and all that's right in one place and
38:54 - that's so helpful I think yeah I really
38:58 - love that for every unit number one
39:01 - there's a really consistent and
39:02 - predictable structure like you're saying
39:05 - but also for every unit we've got all of
39:07 - these documents straight from straight
39:09 - from the curriculum organized already so
39:11 - in addition to the daily lesson plans if
39:13 - I want a reminder of what the daily
39:15 - chart looks like from the unit I can see
39:17 - that you also created this super handy
39:19 - calendar which is really nice to just be
39:21 - able to pop into for a reminder of how
39:24 - of how the days are structured i agree i
39:26 - think that's a really really cool thing
39:29 - I'm curious if for the teacher submitted
39:34 - resources as hopefully we get more and
39:35 - more of those in in the next couple of
39:37 - weeks I'm curious if we've thought about
39:40 - a way to to support the the use of those
39:43 - resources with the forum so you know
39:46 - maybe like as resources are coming in
39:49 - and people can post in the forums and
39:50 - talk about hey I found this great
39:52 - resource in the folder what do you guys
39:54 - think about it so do you have any
39:55 - suggestions for how people could share
39:57 - the resources that they were pulling out
39:59 - of the folder with other ecs teachers
40:01 - yeah so um just so you guys know this is
40:06 - the sneak peek we haven't even actually
40:08 - send an email announcing the resource
40:11 - folder so you guys are getting super
40:12 - inside information right now hence why
40:15 - there isn't a lot of teacher submitted
40:16 - resources um we are also trying to make
40:23 - the forum and the folder work together
40:25 - so the forum has been updated it's still
40:29 - in the process of getting some more
40:31 - updates but you'll find that there's a
40:33 - couple different topics under each day
40:38 - so within a unit you can find the
40:41 - different days broken down and then
40:43 - you'll find for each day there are
40:45 - lesson resources and that will connect
40:47 - to the folder so they'll be a link and
40:50 - you can find resources that would also
40:52 - be a great place to talk about them you
40:54 - can also there's a general question and
40:57 - answer section there'll be a PD
40:59 - discussion topic so you guys have
41:01 - already been discussing different
41:03 - questions from the online PD that will
41:05 - continue and those will be in their own
41:07 - thread and then we'll also have an
41:09 - assessment thread so that's another
41:11 - place where you can share resources that
41:12 - would be one that's specific to
41:14 - assessment so hey how do i read a unit 1
41:16 - assessment or how do i read an
41:18 - assessment just for this day like i want
41:20 - kids to create something what should
41:22 - they create at the end of the day so
41:24 - that's where you guys can have those
41:25 - conversations and that'll be um growing
41:28 - and changing right we're trying to
41:29 - update with you guys and take your
41:31 - feedback and so we're making sure that
41:34 - we integrate that you just got to bear
41:36 - with us as some things change a little
41:37 - bit along the way to make that
41:39 - experience better for you so you said
41:43 - that we're trying to respond to feedback
41:46 - and help people with the questions that
41:48 - they have and help support the ideas
41:49 - they have what's the best way for folks
41:51 - to give feedback on either the forums or
41:54 - on the the resource folders how would
41:56 - you like to get that feedback ah so you
42:00 - can post it on the
42:02 - forum um so if you have feedback for a
42:05 - specific day I would suggest posting it
42:07 - on that day I actually read all of the
42:10 - forum posts every single one of them so
42:13 - if you have a question like you just put
42:15 - it in that forum post I'll see it I'll
42:17 - get back to you so it it all populates
42:20 - to my email and I read them all and make
42:22 - sure that you guys are getting the
42:23 - feedback you need on any questions you
42:26 - have so if you just want to post it in
42:28 - the forum you can create a topic for it
42:31 - as well if we think it'd be helpful we
42:33 - can create a topic for feedback for a
42:35 - unit so up to you guys how you want to

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to our very first google + hangout on air for the 20152016 school year my name is melissa jones and i'm going to be one of your host for this evening we're going to get started in just a minute or two in the meantime we're going to be using the hashtag code or PVE on twitter so if you have any comments feedback or would like to join the conversation please tweet with us there just give us one minute to get started you okay I think we should be in good shape here everyone should have a link to the event page on Google+ which is a good place to go ahead and put questions if you have any or tweet them to code org PD Brooke is going to pull up some slides here and if you'd like to make Brooks slides which I'm going to go over the biggest part of your screen go ahead and click on the slide down below me there and they should come up and stay up for you so Brooke let's go ahead and go to the next slide so as I said welcome this is our exploring computer science monthly meeting this is our first meeting of the year we're really excited to have you with us my name is Melissa Joan of a community manager here at code.org and I'll let Brooke and Danni introduce themselves as well hi I'm Danny McEvoy I and the ecs program manager code org I also help out with other areas of high school curriculum and professional development and I am Brooke Osborn I am a high school program manager at code.org I focus on professional development and curriculum across all of our high school projects and in just a few minutes we're going to hear from a very special gas flow Vaughn who you'll see here on the screen as well and I'll let her introduce herself when we get to her segment let's go to the next five Brooke alright so really quickly some tips for using google hangouts on air you can see and hear us but we can't see or hear you so don't worry about it if you're in your pjs or if you're enjoying your evening adult beverage it's all good we don't have any idea what's going on on your end that you do on our end and as I mentioned before you can control what's in the biggest section of your screen by clicking so if you click on my face I'll come up in the biggest section if you click on the slides they'll come up in the biggest section that way you can tailor your view we are going to be interacting throughout this hangout so if you're joining us live please go to Twitter and use the hashtag code or PV to join the conversation that's where you're going to want to put any questions you have comments feedback or just say hello to the other folks who are online we're also going to be using the google plus page as the place to share your your questions for the speakers so make sure you go there and check that page out as well if you need the link we can share it with you finally don't stress the session is being recorded so if you miss anything or you need something repeated you can always go back and watch the recording later on so Brooke I think we do need to go back one more slide so I can talk about the goals for the evening perfect thank you so as I mentioned this is our first monthly hang out that we're planning to host for the exploring computer science community hopefully those of you who are joining us are a part of the exploring computer science program at code.org if you're not that's okay we hope you'll also get something out of the conversation this evening but our goal really is to connect folks who are teaching the ecs curriculum across the United States we have a powerful crew of hundreds of teachers across the country who are doing this work and we think if we work together and connect as a community we can really make a difference in computer science education and these monthly hangouts are one way we want to do that each month we're going to be talking about a hot topic related to that part of the school year this month we are focusing on how to get get get it set up for success so we're going to hear a little bit some tips and how you can kick off your classroom like this september's we're also going to take a tour of some new resources that we have a bit available for the exploring computer science classroom we're going to talk about tips and tricks and then finally the last part of the meeting will be questions concerns and feedback and that's where we're going to use Twitter and the Google+ Hangouts event page to post your question so broke i think we think i'll head to slides and at this point i'm going to hand it over to Danny McAvoy is going to talk you through some important reminders for the month Danny alright guys so we have two important reminders this month they have to do with our pd and a hot topic of assessments all right so first of all tomorrow night I know that you probably like your nights free and we're booking you up but there is a very important webinar being run by cs10k on the SR I assessments for ecs so these are going to be unit tests they can be done with paper and pencil there a lot of short answer type questions but more of those details will be given out on the webinar tomorrow so you should take a look at that link and head over to that webinar to find out more the other thing to just remind you of is phase 3 in person rpd for that will be starting in about two weeks depending on where you are it may be another week or two after that but take a look at that link that I've put their that updates you on where your PD is depending on your area of the country and when it is happening so make sure you take a look at both of those links before you leave us tonight alright brick next slide alright so i'm going to introduce our guest speaker flow flow was a co.org ecs teacher last year she started with us and she works in Oakland so she's going to tell us about her ecs experience and then give you some tips for the year hi I'm flow I teach in Oakland a very whom urban School District last year we had a great time with ecs I had a class that was probably eighty five percent female and in fact all of them are going on to continuance of computer science and engineering pathways and one thing I'm really excited about my last year's classes that we had a lot of them a lot of Muslim girls in in ninth graders too and they came in extremely shy extremely quiet um and when I see them in the hallways now I know that it was a part of that UCS curriculum um but we're going to get started with some top tips that you can use to make your ecs classroom successful i'm the first one that we have is confidence confidence is cute i looked up the word confidence and the dictionary is defined as a noun in the feeling that you can rely on someone or that someone can rely on you and what I like about confidence is that it is a thing right it is a noun so it is something that we can we can learn we can gain and then not just confidence in the subject of cs i'm i am a math teacher and so my CS confidence is not that great but i do have the confidence that I can help kids get to a further place and to help them learn something and so they trusted me and they rely on me um the next tip that we have is called established participation so like established as in it's a part of the class a normal part of the class every day students come in they expect to participate but that doesn't happen organically so we have to create structures that promote positive participation I'm keeping equity in mind so not just asking students to raise their hands but creating ways for them personally to participate we have to make participation not be an option in fact that my class participation is is woven into their grade points and finally rewarding participation efforts when you see students doing something that you like call that out teach them how to participate because often students don't know what works in a group and what doesn't work in a group it takes a lot of practice tip number three is building community so we often I think as teachers take this one for granted oh we don't want to spend all this time getting to know our students or we need to get started in the curriculum but I have found that if you take this time in the beginning is going to go much smoother you mean so create a safe learning environment let students know like your classroom is like Vegas what happens there stays there play some name games go and talk to elementary school teachers find out what you can do because we might think it's a little childish but it's the way that we get kids to trust us and finally integrate some positive classroom rituals I'm at the end of my class we take away time to give props to each other for the way we participated for the way that we spoke to our classmates I'm just reinforcing those positive things and then making it a ritual so it's something that we do every day the next tip that we have is make the material relevant right like sometimes we think Oh kids just want to do CS because it's awesome but I don't think that they realize how awesome it is most of our students are consumers and not creators so some things that you can do is conduct an interest are they just ask them what it is they like and then it's all new though to figure out how to connect those things I'm consider wide ranges of cs careers when you're talking about careers and also considered a history of cs and contributions of women and people of color students have a lot of ideas and they come from all over the place so we want to reach them where they are the next tip is to create outside relationships oh I cannot tell you how important this is I'm i remember when i started teaching the student actually I lived at the school um and then when they saw me at the football game on Friday night it was like I was a whole different person go to a sports activity sponsor a club I mean it can be something as simple as having your door open for students to come in and eat their lunch when they see you as somebody other than their teacher like they can trust you and that also boosts your own confidence the next tip that I have is to be intentional so everything that you do have to have a purpose from the warmup question to the homework that you give to UM the way that you set up your chairs right so have clear plans be organized in practice good time management do this know when we're faking they know we don't have anything to do and we don't want to create that kind of environment the next tip that we have our partners partners partners so it is very important that we collaborate with other people in this area just like we expect our students to collaborate one of our first partners that we have to get on board or our parents and gardens you have to make the initial content you have to be the one to call them make some positive phone calls I'm get involved with their community see who is available to help in Oakland I'm a few miles away from Silicon Valley but I want to make sure that I get those partners involved um and also your staff and your faculty at your school let them know where you're doing let them come check out your classroom so you can expand your program um the next step that we have is number eight and that tip says that all of this stuff can be learned right um none of these skills are innate we are not born with any of them um if you have a trouble with confidence stand in the mirror in the morning and tell yourself how great you are if you're having trouble with classroom management make a plan in fact this year I made a poster just for myself and I put it on the wall and it says stay calm check for understanding and knowledge dollars like those are the three things that help my class I swim run I have to remind myself all the time and that's okay because I figure by the next week or so it's going to be something that I do all the time so you can learn these skills and then finally the very last tip is to have fun oh my we transfer our fun to the students and if we come in with awesome attitudes they will have awesome attitudes and we will learn a lot and they will really be hooked and they will really be engaged and so have a very successful year awesome thank you for that was so great it was great hearing about your experience and what help make your classroom a really positive environment we're going to have questions for flow at the end so are we doing them right now Brooke do you looks like we have to slide up for them now so we can take a couple questions for flow right now I think Melissa might have them if we have any that account so let me know so if you have a question for flow you can go ahead and tweet it with hashtag code or pd and we'll ask her for you or you can go to the event page on Google+ and enter it there so flow while we're waiting to get some questions from the audience at a question from you for you what the knowledge dollar oh okay so so knowledge dollars are these really cool like slips of paper they're worth one book but I give them out like when I ever I see students doing things that are great whenever they're doing things I want them to do whenever they are being great and okay please don't laugh at me but like I tell them like I try to make it rain knowledge dollars all the time um because then I have like I call it the knowledge dollar store and things are super expensive like a candy bar is like 25 knowledge dollars like you have to be on point all the time um but they love them it is so amazing how high school students like just jump on that kind of stuff I feel like everything that I've ever done I've got from a middle school teacher oradell an interesting teacher but it totally works and it's it's easy for me is cheap it's just paper I cut it up um and the things that I by don't cost me that much money so that it works another quick question related to that you know you're starting ecs again this year was what lesson are you starting with what are you going to kick off with what are you rollin so all last week we did um just a bunch of community building activities um we did tower building activities we did an activity called broken circles um we did a lot of stuff from building intentional communities so that's a website that's so that's all we did last week so now I have two sections of ecs with 30 kids in both of them I know all their names they know my name we all know each other things we know things that we like we actually watch some videos I mean so now when I talk about how important ecs is they understand and so today we did the lesson what is a computer I like had to shut that thing down like how intense and awesome the debate got between students and so but we were able to get that intense because they knew each other they knew how to respect each other there um I mean even things like giving them sentence starters how to respectfully disagree with somebody else those are all things that I do intentionally to make sure that the classroom flows well thanks it's super helpful to hear hey Brooke I'm not sure how to share the link for the plus page in case people want to post questions you have any suggestions there we could turn on showcase and share it there we could also post it over on the monthly meeting the monthly meeting page directly on the event page a good idea like I notice under me I don't know if of guests have this but under me there's a thing that says links if you click on that that it'll take you there as well so if you have a question you can go there and we're going to have a section of the call later where we'll have Q&A for Danny and Brooks so you'll definitely want to find that page to go there and post questions but so we want to thank you so much for your time it's so great to hear about your experience and I know that you're available right to help folks out if they have questions throughout the year oh yes absolutely wonderful great well thank you so much and I hand it back to dance you so much thank you Danny take it away alright guys so um one of the things we heard from a lot of our teachers last year and some of you guys at PD this summer is you would love some more support for the curriculum different things like hey does anybody have a really cool assessment idea that we could see or what is the structure of a semester course with ecs so ah we're going to show you the resource we have created it's called the code org ecs teacher resource folder and it's going to help us bring together resources that all of the teachers who've taught ecs or teaching ecs currently want to share and it'll also bring in some code.org created resources so i'm going to show my screen now so if you want if you had clicked on Brooke and you weren't actually watching me talk that's okay but you might want to click on my picture as I share my screen and show you how this folder works alrighty so I'm going to go into the resource folder as you would see it when you shop sign in I know that you don't have the link yet that's okay we're just going to follow along for now and we'll share the links with you very soon ah so this is the resource folder when you pop in here a couple things to notice um there are folders for each unit there's also a general course resource folder or recruiting resources and a teacher submitted resource folder and then these two lovely things down the bottom which probably some of the most important things for this resource folder first of all I'm going to click on this one as it loads I'll tell you it's the how to document so if you the label wasn't there if it was over here which is how it formats normally um you'll see that it says how to use the resource folder and this is going to be your guide so I'm going to show you a lot of things but if you don't catch everything I said are you like reading it or you just need some more help ah this will give you most of those details and then anything else you need help with feel free to send a forum post our way and we'll get you an answer okay so what's in this how to dock well it'll tell you generally what the resource folder is it'll tell you what's in the resource folder what different resources you can find in the general the units and the lessons I gives you the link there's also a breakdown of how to submit a resource so lots of different information here great resource to look through and check out before you start trying to dive in and figure out what is this resourceful they're actually doing alright second we're going to take a look in the general course resource folder so it's this first one over here i'm going to open it up alright so in here you'll see lots of different things this is just like hey if I want to get a big picture of how this course works I'm going to come to this folder and this folder contains things like the standards mapping so down here I can click there's the link to the SR I standard mapping all the different mappings that they've done great resource right here for you we also have the ecs calendar so we've heard from a lot of people like hey if I'm doing this and I want to get through all six units what should my pacing be so we've given you a general pacing for that we've also had a bunch of questions about what should i do if i have a semester course and here's a general outline of what that would look like as well so you can come in take a look if you have questions about that we'd love to hear them there's also other resources like this learning strategies doc so we've been working on this for our computer science principles curriculum but it's actually applicable to anything you've ever wanted to teach in your whole life it's just a bunch of strategies about how to teach stuff how to do group work how to do a share out how to do a wrapup so lots of different ideas in here it's really long but there's lots of links and ways to navigate easily so you should be able to find what you're looking for and get different ideas as I'm sure you've all seen in pd there's gallery walk so lots of the ideas in here something to take a look at if you're lost for an idea on how to run a lesson all right throughout this you also see that there's the ecs resources so what we've done is that huge dock that we printed for you or if you're not a code or teacher the dock that you have on your computer right we taken that and we've broken it down so it's a lot easier to digest you don't have to digest it in one big thing it's broken apart so there's lots of different things here's the course overview that you'll find at the beginning you can take a look through that and read it if you want so all of those are scattered throughout where they make sense all right so now let's look at this spreadsheet this is one of the coolest pieces of this resource folder at least I think so it's going to be the way that you're going to share resources with other teachers and other teachers can share resources with you so this is what's going to give us that ability for everybody to share so here you'll see I've submitted a couple resources just to fill it in so we can take a look at how this works and right what you'll notice is I'm going to tab down the bottom here that says all responses but I could go to things that are general resources or say I wanted to look at the unit to resources I can click on those tabs and find out what resources exist for that hopefully this will grow and when it grows it maybe get come too big to deal with right I want unit to resource but there's just so many of them so how do I deal with that well let's take a look back let's go back to our folder here our original location sorry it's taking a second to load as I'm screen sharing all right and let's go to unit 2 so I'm click on the unit 2 folder and you'll notice that in here there's also a spreadsheet that says unit to resources and that is where it will pull out all the resources that are specific to unit 2 from that big spreadsheet and it's going to take a second to load when you do this because it has to pull from that spreadsheet but it will load and you'll be able to see that it's broken down by day so down the bottom here where we before had units we now can see a breakdown by day so I think there was a resource for one of these days I don't remember which one obviously it's not going to show me right now let's see let's go back to the original page all right it's taking a sec to load because I'm trying to present to you and do this at the same time so we're just going to let it go but it would load you could look at that specific day and see the resources for that day while we're in unit 2 let's take a look at what's in here um as I said before all the unit to specific things from ecs curriculum are in here there's also this nice code.org created resource so we heard from a bunch of teachers that they didn't exactly know what the homework was that they needed to give on certain days or what supplies they needed for class or when they needed computers so we've created this resource that breaks it down by day or lesson because lessons are multiple days sometimes and tells you if you need computers what supplies you might need and what homework you might need to assign this is just the minimum homework you need to decide to make the course function so you can take a look through those they're very helpful lastly within the unit 2 folder you'll see it broken down by day and within a day we can go in and click and we find out there's more resources so any resource you may need for that day is hopefully in there I'm going to jump out to the unit one for a sec and go into day one to show you some of the other things we're working on so as I said this is getting this is going to grow and one of the things is code.org wants to help grow it as well but we haven't got all of the resources for everything put in yet but for unit one right now there are exit tickets for the lesson so little assessment questions that you could ask students to see if they understood that lesson for the day in addition there's a list of links and extra resources that you can use also a link to the forum if you've been using that it's linked in here as well so those are inside a day and then within that day you'll also find another breakdown of that spreadsheet which is probably going to take too long to load again because I'm trying to share with you at the same time but within that you'll see that there's a breakdown of the so within that day um you can hold on let's see if it'll load because i want to show you it's pretty cool so within that day right i will show you in a sec oh there it goes so this doesn't have any resources that's why you see the na at the top cuz nobody submitted any if you want to submit one you'll be the first um but down the bottom where it used to say days now it has the types of resources so you can take a look and be like hey I want a video resource and you click that tab and show you all the video resources for this lesson alright so now the big thing how do i submit things right so we went through this whole process and we said well it'd be cool if we can share things but we don't know how so let's talk about how we do that so there's this teacher submitted resource odd folder and one of the things you'll notice about this folder is you can't touch any of the other folders or resource you can't mess with them and edit them you can however make a copy and if you're wondering how to make a copy and then be able to edit it that's in the house you doc I'm not going to go over it now but definitely take a look all right but if I want to submit a resource head into the teacher submitted folder you'll notice i put a resource in here before we're going to let's see i'm going to actually open this in my drive so that i can add resources to it you should be able to edit this folder so you'll have access to that so I'm gonna open and drive and I'm gonna go on that teacher submitted resource folder I'm actually going to remove this because it's going to be my demo sneaky sneaky alright so in here it's where I'm going to want to add that document so over here I'm going to find my document where did it go up there it is so I'm going to bring it i can drag it in that's one way or you can also go in here and click new and file upload you don't know how to do that if that's new to you feel free to look through the how to dock it goes over it step by step you'll notice down the bottom here it's loading telling me how long it has all right it's almost done and it'll show up in a spec unsec should come up there it is alright so I'm going to need a link to this resource to be able to share it with people if it's a website or a video write those all have links that makes sense this folder is meant to be for resources that are mostly documents that you can't have a link to easily if it's already up on the web you can just copy the link for that as it already exists you don't have to necessarily put it in here but for documents that you may have created yourself definitely going to want to put them up here so people can find them all right so I'm going to get the link to this resources I'm right clicking or control clicking on this and I can say get link and it gives me the link there I'm just going to copy it we're going to need it for later so right now it's copied can get at it later alright I'm going to head to our sharing of the oh boo i typed it wrong all right I'm going to go through it the back way you won't see that breakdown but you'll see this live form okay live form this is where you're going to submit the resources first two questions are name and email you do not have to answer those if you don't want to those are just there so that if someone likes your resource they could give you a shout out and be like hey i love this resource i use it all the time or maybe they want to ask you a question or maybe they edit the doc and they come up with a new cool idea and they want to share it with you and you get a better experience or maybe you learn something from their experience maybe they're like hey this happened in my classroom my classroom is different than yours so that's optional up to you whether or not you want to give those then you'll identify the type of resource so we have that document it was a reading on big data so it doesn't necessarily fit any one of these specifically so I'm just going to click resource other up to you how you identify it's just helpful for other teachers so it's based off data so I'm going to put it in unit 5 when I pick the unit and then here's where I put the link so I'm just going to hit paste and that long length that I had copied over gets put there we put that link it's really important that you get the link right because that's how other teachers are going to find it so when we listed in the spreadsheet that's how they're going to get to it then details of the resource you can click and type those out here so this is a big data reading something doesn't have to be very long probably shouldn't be very long but just something to give ideas for the teacher who might be looking at it and then why did you use or create this resource right so give them a reason for using it um and then if you click continue you'll get to a screen that asks you what day this is for if it's for a specific unit and so my resource isn't really for a specific day I didn't pick one that was for a specific day so I can just put other but you have options for any of the days for that lesson and your end of unit assessment if you don't know which day it is take a look back at the resource folder it has that breakdown so I'm going to click other and then submit and the coolest part of this is we're going to go find it so we're going to go see that it's populated live so it wasn't in there before but it will be now right so let's go and take a look here up so I still had it open and there it is you'll see that that gray line down the bottom here this is a big data reading that was exactly what i typed really exciting right and you'll see that you can click on that and go to that resource so if I click here it opens up that reading for me and I can take a look through it pretty awesome it also remember populates into unit 5 so let's just check that and see if we can see it in our unit 5 might take a sec to load so remember that this is pulling from another spreadsheet so you'll see that it says loading it's going to have this bar up in the corner that's going to take it a minute to load that's okay it just means that we're going to be able to constantly update so nobody from code.org has to go in and say like approved resource you can add this to this to the list we will check them if we find really good ones we're going to add them to the folder over time but for now this allows you to add and as soon as you add other teachers can see it and decide if they want to use it as well so the constant updating and there it is this line right here that resource that we submitted so pretty cool it'll keep updating as you go and if there's anything new it would show me that as well all right so that is the resource folder so I'm going to stop sharing my screen and we're going to take a look at what's next on our list I think it's QA about the resource folder that's right Danny and about any other questions that folks have as you're getting your year started so again you can go ahead and tweet any questions you have for Danny Brooke for myself or flow she's still here to code or PB on twitter I'll be monitoring that or Brooke will also explain to you how you can use the Q&A feature on google hangout yeah I'm actually going to switch my screen really quickly and show you a different a different window so this is the we're getting meta now this is showing you the live stream of of the hangout on air that we are currently in so if you have a question there's this questions menu over on the right just click a question type it in here click Submit and that will push through directly to us we will be able to access that I've also seen a couple people posting in the in the event itself so you can post their we're also monitoring that so feel free to post in either of those places and we will pull from there as well so to get things started while we're waiting for some questions to come in Oh first Danny did you want to share links with folks yeah we can share the links so if we just want to put the screen up will um so as I was going through I told you that we'd share the links later I've made nice bitly link so you don't have to remember those really long Google folder blah blah blah links I'll be pain in the butt so code ecs teacher resources is the folder and to submit a resource oh I said resources that's why I got it wrong so the submit resource is the other one so that'll take you to that live form to submit the resources also at the end we're going to post a link to the forum and it has these links in there as well as the links that i put up earlier about PD and the hangout tomorrow night to find out about the SR I ecs assessments so you miss the changes you'll be able to find them there yep we will make sure that we consolidate all these links for you in one place so you don't have to dig through the through the presentation to get that so while we're waiting on some questions to come in Danny and I will switch back my screen so folks can see how to how to submit those questions I'm curious since you've been spending so much time in this resource folder what you think is is most exciting or most useful as someone fresh out of the classroom what do you wish you had for your classes that you taught last year that we have in the resource folder well I really so I'm a very organized person and I've started to impose this on people at code.org I like organized folders that you know i can find stuff and I know where it is and it's easy so my favorite thing I use the resource folder as I'm trying to find ways to improve ecs or need to reference what the number of days are in a unit or whatever I go in and I look at the folders and so the folders are really nice because they have all those details and I don't have to go digging through the dock or flipping through a book right I just say okay I want something about unit 1 ahead into unit 1 and there's the daily break down right there for me of unit 1 so I find that really helpful I'm a very like tree structured organized person I like things in folders so I guess that's probably the best part of it for me but I know that as a teacher I also really like when people tell me all right what is the like minimum viable thing that I need to happen today to make this happen maybe like you know teaching your you're just like all right I have a couple different preps how do I make this lesson happen and it's really simple because it's broken down into like here's what you need to have for resources that list is there so here's the supplies I need for the lesson today do I need computers what should I assign for homework if I forget like all else what what do I need to assign for homework tonight that's all there for you and then you have the nice lesson plans that ecs created so they're there and all that's right in one place and that's so helpful I think yeah I really love that for every unit number one there's a really consistent and predictable structure like you're saying but also for every unit we've got all of these documents straight from straight from the curriculum organized already so in addition to the daily lesson plans if I want a reminder of what the daily chart looks like from the unit I can see that you also created this super handy calendar which is really nice to just be able to pop into for a reminder of how of how the days are structured i agree i think that's a really really cool thing I'm curious if for the teacher submitted resources as hopefully we get more and more of those in in the next couple of weeks I'm curious if we've thought about a way to to support the the use of those resources with the forum so you know maybe like as resources are coming in and people can post in the forums and talk about hey I found this great resource in the folder what do you guys think about it so do you have any suggestions for how people could share the resources that they were pulling out of the folder with other ecs teachers yeah so um just so you guys know this is the sneak peek we haven't even actually send an email announcing the resource folder so you guys are getting super inside information right now hence why there isn't a lot of teacher submitted resources um we are also trying to make the forum and the folder work together so the forum has been updated it's still in the process of getting some more updates but you'll find that there's a couple different topics under each day so within a unit you can find the different days broken down and then you'll find for each day there are lesson resources and that will connect to the folder so they'll be a link and you can find resources that would also be a great place to talk about them you can also there's a general question and answer section there'll be a PD discussion topic so you guys have already been discussing different questions from the online PD that will continue and those will be in their own thread and then we'll also have an assessment thread so that's another place where you can share resources that would be one that's specific to assessment so hey how do i read a unit 1 assessment or how do i read an assessment just for this day like i want kids to create something what should they create at the end of the day so that's where you guys can have those conversations and that'll be um growing and changing right we're trying to update with you guys and take your feedback and so we're making sure that we integrate that you just got to bear with us as some things change a little bit along the way to make that experience better for you so you said that we're trying to respond to feedback and help people with the questions that they have and help support the ideas they have what's the best way for folks to give feedback on either the forums or on the the resource folders how would you like to get that feedback ah so you can post it on the forum um so if you have feedback for a specific day I would suggest posting it on that day I actually read all of the forum posts every single one of them so if you have a question like you just put it in that forum post I'll see it I'll get back to you so it it all populates to my email and I read them all and make sure that you guys are getting the feedback you need on any questions you have so if you just want to post it in the forum you can create a topic for it as well if we think it'd be helpful we can create a topic for feedback for a unit so up to you guys how you want to post that but if you post anything to the forum I will see it and i'll get back to you great thank you so much Danny I think we're going to wrap up now I want to thank everyone for joining us and participating this evening don't forget that the session has been recorded so we'll be sharing the recording link with you or you can just go back to the YouTube page or the event page that you're on right now if you'd like to refer back to tonight's session let's head to the next slide their book so just wanted to mention that in addition to the resource folder and the forums and the inperson professional development and the online professional development you'll be part of this year we're also going to be hosting these live Google Hangouts on the first Tuesday of every so the next one will be on october six and be the first tuesday of the month thereafter if you're looking for these dates we'll send you a link or you can find the link in the forums also but um code org slash educated flash ecs meeting and i can share that with you at the end of the session but we're really glad that you're able to join us I know some folks have issues with YouTube tonight and we are looking at some other platforms on which to host this session so next month we'll probably use Google Hangouts again but look forward to us trying out some different platforms in the future you can always reach our team on twitter at teach code by tweeting at us or flat our hashtag code or pd and the last thing we wanted to ask you tonight is to just give us some feedback on the session i think the last slide has that link so there's a link here on your screen you'll have to type it in unfortunately but I would love you to go in and tell us what you thought of tonight's meeting how we can make it better than any other advice or ideas you have for us on how we can better support the ecs teacher community i'm gonna be on behalf of brooke danny and flow i'd
