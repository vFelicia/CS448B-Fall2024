00:10 - let's say we're building houses we'll
00:12 - use a blueprint that details the
00:14 - attributes of the house like how many
00:15 - rooms and what it's made of
00:18 - the blueprint also has instructions for
00:20 - how to assemble each part of the house
00:23 - in java we have classes
00:25 - each class contains a list of attributes
00:27 - and instructions for how to create an
00:29 - instance of itself
00:30 - an attribute is a characteristic of an
00:33 - object
00:34 - classes can also define the behaviors
00:36 - for an object
00:37 - a behavior is an action that an object
00:39 - can perform
00:41 - these classes are like blueprints for
00:42 - creating objects
00:44 - an object is an instance of the class it
00:47 - has specific values for its attributes
00:50 - each house we build from the blueprint
00:52 - is an instance of the architect's design
00:54 - so each object we create is an instance
00:56 - of the class as we build each house we
00:59 - are instantiating house objects
01:02 - to instantiate is to call the
01:04 - constructor to create an object
01:07 - the constructor is a block of code that
01:09 - has the same name as the class and tells
01:11 - the computer how to create a new object
01:15 - before we can build a house we have to
01:17 - designate land to build it on
01:19 - in java we don't have land we have
01:21 - memory space
01:23 - in this case we need to designate memory
01:25 - space and label it for a house object
01:27 - then we give a name for the object
01:29 - this name is called a reference variable
01:32 - a reference variable is a variable that
01:34 - points to an object
01:36 - think of the reference variable like a
01:38 - street address
01:40 - next we instantiate a house object for
01:42 - the reference variable to point to like
01:44 - building a house at an address
01:47 - we use the new keyword to indicate that
01:49 - we want to instantiate the new object
01:51 - then we indicate the type of object we
01:53 - want to create
01:54 - to get the instructions for creating our
01:56 - house object we call its constructor
01:58 - using empty parentheses
02:01 - i can make a house for my friend or one
02:03 - from my parents or as many other houses
02:05 - as i want
02:06 - each of these houses will have their own
02:08 - set of attributes based on the house
02:10 - class
02:11 - the values of these attributes represent
02:13 - the state of the house
02:15 - the state of an object refers to the
02:17 - attributes represented by the object's
02:19 - instance variables
02:21 - now we can instantiate all the objects
02:23 - we want from the classes we develop
