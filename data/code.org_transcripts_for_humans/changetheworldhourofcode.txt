00:01 - I think it's really important for girls to
study computer science. I think for a long
00:05 - time the world thought that some things were
for boys and some things were for girls, and
00:10 - everyone understands now that boys and girls
can have equal opportunity. If we could just
00:16 - support girls and give them that initial encouragement,
then we could start balancing the scales.
00:20 - And then we wouldn't even have to play with
the equation because it will just be a natural
00:23 - flow. To be able to code gives you the freedom
to build anything, and that is just so empowering.
00:35 - I like having that power in my own hands to
express what's in my imagination, using programming.
00:41 - Just the experience of programming gives you
access to a new method of thinking. Everything
00:46 - becomes the steps that you can take towards
a solution, and that is just extremely valuable.
00:51 - You know it's one thing to use software, it's
a totally different thing to get to change
00:56 - how the software you use actually works. Yeah,
all my favorite memories from computer science
01:02 - are actually programming together with teams.
I don't think computer science is a solo thing.
01:07 - If you want to build something amazing, you
usually have to do it in a team and computer
01:11 - science is no different. You all live in a
time where expressing yourself, learning about
01:16 - different people, making a business and a
real difference in your communities is all
01:20 - totally possible. With computers it's right
at your fingertips. It's not about being a
01:28 - girl or being a boy, it's about being talented.
Computer science needs more talented people,
01:34 - people who are not afraid of being creative
and making the world a better place. Jump
01:42 - into it! Learn! Just try and take one class.
Give it one hour. It's amazing what you can
01:48 - learn in one hour. And that's what is so exciting
about Hour of Code. All of you are able to
01:53 - participate, from all parts of the country
at all ages, from all different backgrounds.
01:58 - And that's what will create the right opportunities
for everyone. Every girl deserves to take
02:05 - part in creating the technology that will
change our world and change who runs it. I
02:11 - challenge girls in every single country to
learn one Hour of Code. Technology touches
02:18 - every part of our lives, so if you can change
technology you can change the world.
02:25 - Change the world. #HourOfCode
