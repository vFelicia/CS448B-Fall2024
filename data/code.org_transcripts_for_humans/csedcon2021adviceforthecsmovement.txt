00:52 - do
01:10 - [Music]
01:20 - [Music]
01:30 - uh

01:48 - [Music]
02:01 - bad
02:05 - [Music]
02:13 - [Music]
02:34 - foreign
02:39 - hmm
02:45 - [Music]
02:54 - so
03:05 - [Music]
03:12 - [Music]
03:16 - ladies and gentlemen the session will
03:18 - begin in five minutes thank you
03:37 - [Music]
04:20 - so
04:23 - [Music]
04:37 - [Music]
04:40 - hmm
04:53 - [Music]
05:06 - do
05:10 - [Music]
05:31 - [Music]
05:39 - [Music]
06:07 - [Music]
06:12 - so
06:20 - over the years i've come to realize how
06:23 - impactful and influential
06:25 - ai is as a technology and it's so
06:28 - important to understand the different
06:30 - ways in which
06:32 - that technology works to make it less
06:34 - intimidating to make it clear that it's
06:36 - a series of human decisions that we can
06:38 - control rather than um this
06:42 - futuristic sci-fi
06:44 - uncontrollable thing that is out of
06:46 - reach in terms of us being able to
06:48 - change
06:50 - where do you think you're going
06:51 - well i'm not going that way
06:55 - so i think that there's a lot of benefit
06:57 - there's a lot to gain from
06:59 - involving yourself and really
07:01 - understanding the details of how
07:04 - this technology works is something that
07:07 - will influence your life and the life of
07:09 - everyone that you love and the life of
07:11 - everyone around you and that's why i
07:13 - would encourage young people especially
07:16 - to even if they don't
07:18 - want to be an engineer and do it for the
07:20 - rest of their life
07:21 - uh to to really just properly engage in
07:24 - in getting an uh a sense or an
07:26 - understanding of the basics of what it
07:29 - means for
07:30 - uh the technology to work
07:33 - if you're someone that cares
07:35 - passionately about people
07:38 - and you have an interest in computer
07:39 - science the field definitely needs you
07:43 - there's so much that
07:45 - we can learn from you and learn from
07:47 - your empathy and learn from your
07:49 - attention to the experiences of other
07:51 - people
07:53 - we
07:54 - desperately need diverse perspectives in
07:57 - this field
07:58 - to shape a future
08:01 - vision for ai that is inclusive that is
08:05 - impactful in the right ways and is
08:07 - attentive to the concerns of those that
08:10 - are most vulnerable in our society
08:15 - [Music]
08:19 - i think that's it
08:24 - good morning everyone
08:26 - oh we can do better than that good
08:28 - morning
08:30 - i'm jackie smalls i'm the chief programs
08:32 - officer at code.org and i'm so excited
08:35 - to be here really it's kind of personal
08:38 - because when i joined code.org 18 months
08:40 - ago
08:41 - in march of 2020 it was announced that
08:44 - we were in a pandemic and the world shut
08:46 - down great time to start a new job right
08:50 - but there are many challenges but i just
08:52 - knew that there was challenges that i
08:54 - was facing was not like the challenges
08:56 - our teachers were facing so before we
08:58 - began today i really would like for
09:00 - everyone to join me if you could
09:02 - push away from your tables
09:05 - stand up i'm not going to make you do
09:07 - anything crazy i promise
09:10 - and let's really give the teachers and
09:12 - all the school systems a round of
09:14 - applause for all that they've done
09:18 - to make sure
09:25 - and keep standing
09:26 - because i also want to take this
09:28 - opportunity to thank everyone that made
09:31 - this happen for us this week hasn't it
09:33 - been great
09:40 - all right great great stretch break you
09:41 - may be seated
09:43 - thank you so much for that
09:46 - i'm also excited today because eight
09:48 - years ago i shared the stage with my
09:50 - friend and colleague steven pruitt
09:53 - i came on to the stage and it was my
09:55 - responsibility at the national teachers
09:58 - association conference
10:00 - to introduce steven as the keynote
10:02 - speaker
10:03 - and we were so excited when i looked out
10:05 - into the audience it was filled with
10:07 - teachers but not just filled with teach
10:08 - they were lined up on the walls they
10:10 - were in the aisles the room had reached
10:13 - capacity
10:14 - because that day stephen announced the
10:17 - release of the next generation science
10:18 - standards
10:20 - and so that was an amazing opportunity
10:22 - and here we are today
10:24 - to listen to the lessons learned
10:26 - from that process and how it might be
10:29 - applied to the cs movement so without
10:31 - further ado i'm going to ask stephen to
10:33 - introduce himself
10:35 - good morning
10:37 - oh very good it's so good so nor so i've
10:41 - been able to speak in public now a
10:43 - couple times since you know everything's
10:45 - shut down
10:47 - and normally i pretend i'm on mute for
10:49 - the first couple of sentences
10:51 - but since i'm having to wear the mask i
10:52 - couldn't do that because you wouldn't
10:53 - know what i was doing so
10:56 - yeah it's i think it's a protocol now so
11:00 - i'm stephen pruitt i am president of the
11:02 - southern regional education board um
11:06 - i guess it's sometimes i don't know that
11:07 - i need to say southern because as soon
11:09 - as you hear me talk you're kind of clear
11:10 - that um
11:12 - he's not from here um
11:15 - but uh we
11:16 - i'm president of the regional education
11:18 - board uh former commissioner of
11:20 - education for the commonwealth of
11:22 - kentucky
11:24 - uh i was the the lead for the
11:26 - development of the next generation
11:27 - science standards and most importantly i
11:29 - was a high school science teacher
11:31 - that was always my most important job
11:34 - but i've had a i've had a lot of luck
11:37 - and a lot of great opportunities in my
11:39 - life one of them was to work with this
11:41 - wonderful person to my right
11:43 - who
11:44 - she hates it when i bring this up but
11:46 - i'm going to anyway
11:49 - so
11:50 - jackie
11:51 - was in the army
11:53 - and chose
11:55 - to go work to teach elementary
11:58 - um and
12:00 - that's i mean and when i say she was in
12:02 - the army i mean she you know
12:05 - has a brilliant science and engineering
12:07 - mind
12:08 - and where most of us that have that kind
12:11 - of training go into high school she
12:13 - chose to go into elementary and i don't
12:15 - know about you
12:17 - but once they get under 14
12:20 - they got to be somebody else's
12:22 - um because i i i can't do that so i
12:26 - always loved to brag on the fact that
12:29 - jackie had a mission and she worked on
12:31 - that and a lot of kids got a lot of
12:33 - benefit
12:35 - thank you so much for that
12:40 - all right well let's get started how
12:42 - about that
12:43 - so
12:43 - i have a bunch of questions but we
12:45 - really want this to be interactive you
12:47 - can ease drop in this conversation or
12:49 - you can participate so we would love for
12:51 - you to come up to the mic at any time
12:52 - not just wait until the end you know
12:54 - that awkward pause does anyone have any
12:57 - questions
12:58 - please come to the mics and we'll make
12:59 - sure that we recognize you during our
13:01 - conversation
13:02 - so the first question i have stephen in
13:04 - terms of you just spoke of the next
13:06 - generation science standards what a
13:07 - small project we worked on together
13:09 - small project
13:11 - what can we learn in the cs movement
13:13 - from that journey like what are the
13:15 - lessons so the journey i know you can go
13:17 - on and on for days about the journey but
13:19 - what about the lessons what would you
13:21 - have done differently
13:23 - well
13:24 - you know the
13:26 - i would say that the first thing that
13:29 - comes to mind is
13:32 - you need to recognize that any type of
13:34 - movement in education is going to take
13:36 - time
13:38 - um
13:39 - you know
13:40 - no great education idea ever died in the
13:42 - vision phase
13:44 - uh you know it always it's it's about
13:46 - implementation
13:48 - um and so
13:50 - you know when you go into this you have
13:52 - to know that this is not going no matter
13:54 - how
13:57 - dedicated how committed you are to a
14:00 - particular
14:02 - issue
14:04 - it takes time because you have to
14:06 - make a case
14:09 - you know i like to say that education is
14:11 - not rocket science because rocket
14:12 - science is actually easier um
14:16 - now given i'm a chemist so maybe i'm not
14:18 - the best person to make that comment but
14:20 - you know the point is you're dealing
14:21 - with human beings
14:23 - so it takes time to build that that
14:26 - understanding
14:28 - another lesson i would say is ownership
14:32 - um we
14:34 - uh
14:34 - one thing i think that we did a very
14:37 - good job of in that room that you talked
14:39 - about
14:40 - you know we had people stand up if they
14:43 - were part of a writing team if they were
14:44 - part of a review team if they were
14:47 - and at the end i mean there were there
14:48 - were about 5 000 people in that room
14:51 - and at the end more than 95 of the
14:53 - people in the room were standing
14:56 - because i can tell you that states do
14:58 - not like to have things put on them
15:02 - they want to feel that ownership and so
15:05 - finding a way to help people become
15:08 - what i call shareholders instead of
15:10 - stakeholders you know stakeholders kind
15:13 - of comes from that time of
15:15 - ringling brothers
15:16 - when somebody held a large stake while
15:18 - somebody else swung a really big hammer
15:20 - near their head
15:22 - a shareholder somebody that now owns it
15:24 - and they invest in it
15:26 - um
15:27 - and then i guess you know the thing that
15:30 - that
15:32 - you know i'm not sure completely what i
15:34 - would do different but i think there
15:36 - would be some things that we would push
15:38 - harder and
15:40 - one of the biggest ones is
15:43 - clarity around what the initiative is
15:46 - and how it fits into an overall
15:48 - educational scheme
15:50 - i think we did a pretty good job with
15:51 - that
15:52 - but the connector we didn't necessarily
15:54 - make
15:55 - as well as i thought we could have was
15:57 - around workforce
15:59 - um we'll talk a little bit more about
16:00 - that in a little bit but
16:02 - you know
16:03 - in the world of science and in the world
16:05 - of computer science there are people who
16:08 - don't know what those things are
16:11 - so you have to find a way to talk their
16:12 - language
16:14 - and help them see what you see
16:16 - but how it's in the context
16:18 - as a former commissioner of education i
16:20 - can tell you every day there was
16:22 - somebody that had something that i
16:23 - needed to do
16:25 - every day it was like oh you got to do
16:27 - this oh you got to do that
16:29 - and it becomes really kind of white
16:31 - noise and you end up making decisions
16:33 - based on you know your advisors or
16:36 - whatever
16:37 - the people that got to me the most were
16:40 - how the ones that could show me how what
16:42 - they were pushing
16:44 - fit into the overall educational context
16:47 - and i think computer science is a
16:49 - particular one there that that would be
16:51 - a good focus
16:54 - no questions yet don't be shy
16:57 - all right i have another question for
16:58 - you many states have adopted cs
17:00 - standards and we've been working towards
17:02 - ensuring cs is accessible to all
17:04 - students which comes with many
17:06 - challenges as we all know
17:08 - what should we consider as we reach the
17:10 - milestone of 51 of high schools now
17:12 - offer cs
17:14 - and we applauded that this this week but
17:17 - we still have a long way to go so what
17:19 - should we consider in the next mile
17:22 - well
17:23 - so there's a couple of things i think
17:25 - obviously
17:26 - the push to continue to offer
17:29 - the opportunity to be a part of computer
17:31 - science
17:32 - but i think you're going to have to make
17:34 - that case of why that's going to be
17:36 - important for that student's future
17:38 - and not just
17:39 - that they take a computer science class
17:42 - you know we'll
17:43 - we're going to be living in a world
17:44 - where if you don't understand
17:48 - the thinking involved around this
17:50 - you're not going to be a viable member
17:52 - of the economy
17:54 - so
17:55 - that would be one part but the other
17:57 - part that i would push already even in
17:59 - those 51 percent
18:02 - is equity
18:03 - and the equity here is this there
18:08 - there are lots of things listed on a
18:11 - course of study in schools across our
18:13 - country
18:14 - that doesn't mean students actually get
18:16 - to take them
18:18 - so one of the things that that i've
18:20 - pushed even in accountability is that we
18:24 - lessen the amount that we rely on
18:27 - statewide assessment and look more at
18:29 - what we're providing opportunities to do
18:32 - so example here
18:34 - would be
18:35 - if you offer computer science fourth
18:37 - period of course everybody knows fourth
18:39 - period is the longest period because
18:40 - that's lunch period
18:43 - but that's also the same time that
18:45 - you're offering remediation courses for
18:47 - students that need to be caught up
18:48 - because it's the longest period
18:50 - and you're offering band that same
18:52 - period because it's the longest because
18:54 - it takes them a while to get out to
18:55 - practice
18:56 - and you're offering ap courses that
18:58 - period
18:59 - you don't actually have opportunity to
19:02 - take the class or what i would think
19:04 - opportunity
19:06 - so one of the things that i would push
19:07 - for in the next mile is
19:10 - how many students are actually getting
19:12 - to take those courses
19:15 - are we
19:16 - giving that access to
19:18 - each student and not just
19:21 - you know and i'm very particular about
19:22 - saying all because all is a way to mask
19:25 - things
19:26 - but are our students of color students
19:28 - of poverty
19:30 - uh are
19:31 - are females being able to to be actually
19:34 - in those courses or is our master
19:36 - schedule actually prohibiting it
19:39 - so you brought it up so i'm going to
19:40 - continue with what you said about access
19:43 - and actual participation because we know
19:45 - that there's a difference
19:47 - so what do we need to do to close the
19:50 - gap that we know that exists in cs for
19:53 - black students young women hispanic
19:55 - students native students
19:57 - what do we really need to focus on to
19:59 - really close that gap
20:01 - well i i think that part of it is
20:09 - the folks that are making decisions
20:11 - about education in at the school and
20:14 - district level
20:17 - there have to broaden their perspective
20:19 - beyond math and literacy
20:22 - and we
20:23 - we tend to get very caught up in the
20:25 - accountability aspect of this and it's
20:28 - one of the reasons why
20:29 - i've been proponent of actually making
20:31 - those changes to accountability systems
20:35 - so that people
20:36 - i'm not saying math and literacy aren't
20:38 - important they obviously are
20:40 - but
20:41 - if we really want to educate a whole
20:43 - child to let them have access to
20:47 - what eventually will be our workforce
20:51 - part of that focus has to be re the
20:53 - recognition that while i'm trying to
20:54 - catch kids up
20:55 - those kids also deserve opportunities
21:00 - but when it comes specific to
21:02 - our students of color
21:05 - you know we have a little bit of a
21:06 - chicken and an egg issue here in that
21:09 - they aren't seeing people in the
21:11 - industry that look like them
21:14 - so we
21:15 - got to have very specific strategies on
21:18 - how we're recruiting starting in middle
21:20 - school
21:21 - students of color students of poverty
21:24 - into career pathways that are central
21:27 - around computer science cyber security
21:29 - i.t all
21:31 - so that
21:32 - eventually students it becomes just more
21:35 - normal
21:36 - that that i i say okay
21:38 - because i mean i think there's some
21:40 - truth in the fact that
21:42 - if i don't see anybody that looks like
21:43 - me doing it then i'm not supposed to do
21:45 - it
21:46 - so i think we've got to work on both
21:48 - levels we've got to work on the
21:49 - recruitment
21:51 - at the workforce level
21:53 - but we've got to increase the pipeline
21:56 - it's not a leaky pipeline there's no
21:57 - pipeline or there it's a trickle i guess
22:00 - but
22:01 - we've got to really do a better job of
22:03 - identifying and recruiting students at
22:06 - that middle school level just to make
22:08 - them aware of what's there
22:10 - you know i mean um
22:15 - the opportunities that students are
22:17 - afforded in the workforce
22:19 - of actually especially in a post-covered
22:22 - world of being able to work remotely
22:25 - that's going to be something that this
22:26 - generation of kids are going to like so
22:28 - we should promote that
22:30 - so i'm going to push on that a little
22:32 - bit because i could say for myself i
22:34 - didn't get
22:36 - support or see
22:38 - myself
22:39 - in a stem field until it came to college
22:42 - and i went to historical black college
22:43 - south carolina state university i know
22:45 - there's somebody from south carolina in
22:47 - here
22:49 - however
22:51 - what you said middle school and high
22:53 - school what about the k-5 why don't we
22:56 - start at k-5 because many of us that's
22:58 - what we're doing and actually we're
22:59 - focused on because we can see if we get
23:00 - them
23:02 - early and can see themselves early maybe
23:04 - they might stay
23:06 - and continue beyond high school because
23:08 - they think it's an opportunity
23:10 - so i absolutely think k5 should be
23:12 - engaged in work around computer science
23:15 - my comments were more around the fact
23:16 - that about middle school is when you
23:18 - start
23:19 - or when you should start exposing
23:21 - students to potential careers
23:25 - but
23:25 - why would i do something in middle
23:27 - school
23:29 - for a career of something that i've
23:31 - never had experience with before that
23:33 - so
23:34 - having students engage in that in
23:36 - elementary school is i think is a really
23:38 - important thing
23:40 - i think that
23:42 - to do that there's got to be an
23:43 - investment in our teachers though
23:46 - because
23:47 - and frankly an investment in the
23:48 - understanding of our administrators
23:50 - because again if i'm more worried about
23:52 - math and literacy
23:54 - i'm not having time for computer science
23:57 - science social studies
23:59 - and all of those things are actually
24:00 - important for a student to be
24:03 - a whole student that becomes a member
24:06 - of
24:07 - a society by which they can pursue their
24:09 - version of the american dream
24:11 - so
24:13 - having a k-5 experience in
24:16 - uh
24:18 - in computer science that is
24:22 - able to be communicated to people who
24:24 - don't and again this kind of goes back
24:25 - to what i was saying earlier about
24:26 - communicating it to the general populace
24:30 - i think an unfortunate aspect at times
24:32 - in elementary school is parents look at
24:35 - what kids are doing with computer
24:36 - science as
24:38 - fun
24:40 - and not necessarily learning and i think
24:42 - we have to find a way to reposition that
24:44 - that they are yeah they're having fun
24:47 - but i mean let's face it in science i
24:48 - mean you know
24:50 - one of the reasons i decided to teach
24:52 - was because i could blow stuff up
24:53 - legally
24:56 - you know i mean you have fun
24:58 - but
24:59 - we've got to figure out how to
25:00 - communicate that to the parents there
25:03 - then when they get to middle school
25:04 - they're able to look back and go okay
25:06 - i've had a little experience with this
25:07 - coding thing and a little bit i
25:09 - understand about what this could be
25:11 - and then we can start to let them
25:12 - explore what careers are out there in
25:15 - middle school
25:16 - by the way you would have been a great
25:18 - elementary school teacher because the
25:20 - kids would have focused on your socks
25:21 - yeah i i you know my wife won't let me
25:24 - buy normal socks
25:26 - and it's partly because i'm colorblind
25:27 - so i really don't know what i have on
25:28 - right now
25:31 - and we could talk about why ngss are the
25:33 - colors yeah
25:35 - so we have victoria i think i don't have
25:37 - my glasses on but i think victoria has a
25:38 - question for us hi hi good morning thank
25:41 - you so much for being here
25:43 - you've mentioned really important
25:44 - shareholders in the education of our
25:47 - students you've mentioned teachers
25:48 - administrators parents
25:51 - how can we get school counselors on
25:53 - board especially in the middle and high
25:55 - school when a lot of times students have
25:58 - to go through them to figure out what
26:00 - classes should i take what can i take
26:03 - yeah that's that oh man that's a tough
26:05 - one
26:08 - yeah that's a tough one um
26:10 - you know
26:11 - the
26:15 - so i'll start with a more basic
26:18 - comment and then build it a little bit i
26:20 - hope
26:21 - one thing is we probably should start
26:22 - letting counselors be counselors and not
26:24 - test administrators
26:27 - [Applause]
26:31 - in fact i'll never forget i was walking
26:33 - into the
26:34 - kentucky department of education and
26:37 - i'm seeing all these tweets from
26:38 - counselors saying they're at the
26:40 - state assessment conference like why in
26:43 - the world are all the dang counselors at
26:45 - this test conference
26:47 - so i walked in the room and and
26:49 - i knew a lot of them and i said why are
26:52 - y'all all here and they're like well
26:53 - we're the the building assessment
26:55 - coordinator i'm like okay i want all of
26:57 - you right now get out your phones
26:59 - hit a
27:00 - hit two and put your principal's name in
27:03 - there and say commissioner pruitt said i
27:06 - should not be here
27:10 - you can imagine the emails i got later
27:11 - but um
27:14 - but i think that's you know one thing is
27:16 - we need to give counselors the room to
27:17 - be counselors
27:19 - and not
27:20 - duties as assigned that's one
27:23 - another one is and i
27:26 - i've always been a little bit of a
27:27 - proponent of having
27:30 - additional support in schools either
27:33 - through
27:34 - [Music]
27:35 - community partnerships or through an
27:37 - actual fte employee
27:41 - that whose
27:42 - real focus it is is to connect students
27:45 - to careers
27:47 - especially in the immediate area
27:49 - but that are in high need
27:52 - um
27:52 - i mean
27:54 - so i have a degree in chemistry i know
27:56 - in general
27:59 - well a little more in general i know
28:01 - what chemists do
28:04 - but your average high school counselor
28:06 - probably couldn't really communicate
28:08 - that very well because they never did it
28:11 - and even as a chemistry major and with a
28:14 - chemistry degree
28:15 - i couldn't necessarily tell you all the
28:17 - stuff that's out there for industry to
28:18 - do because i was a teacher i didn't go
28:22 - into industry and then come
28:24 - come back
28:26 - so i think that it's somewhat of an
28:28 - unrealistic
28:29 - expectation to have
28:31 - to think that our counselors
28:35 - can automatically make that connection
28:36 - to workforce and to computer science
28:40 - so that means that we've got to do some
28:41 - investment in either extra people
28:44 - or
28:46 - helping them understand in
28:49 - the area that their school's in or as a
28:51 - country what our highest high needs
28:53 - sectors are
28:54 - and certainly computer sciences is that
28:58 - it's a tough nut to crack because
29:02 - let's face it the other again i keep
29:03 - going back to accountability a lot of
29:05 - our counselors are focused on how do i
29:06 - make sure kids get into courses that are
29:08 - going to meet graduation requirements
29:10 - and that are going to help our
29:11 - accountability scores
29:13 - and the first one i can get
29:15 - the second one
29:17 - yeah i think we got to do a better job
29:21 - and we have another question um over
29:23 - here i believe our friends from code
29:24 - crew that's correct uh good morning
29:28 - former commissioner and um and my name
29:30 - is maker egg
29:31 - i'm the executive director one of the
29:33 - founders of code crew which is based in
29:34 - memphis which is in your region
29:36 - and i am
29:38 - i'm actually asking this question
29:39 - because we've been very active in
29:41 - tennessee around computer science
29:43 - education policy um and i wanted to ask
29:46 - based on your experience as a former
29:49 - commissioner in kentucky our neighbor to
29:50 - the north um what would have been the
29:53 - most effective way
29:55 - to lobby or persuade
29:58 - uh you as a commissioner of education to
30:01 - increase access to computer science
30:02 - education uh as the commission of
30:04 - education and such as like
30:07 - high every high school offering computer
30:09 - science classes and other important
30:11 - initiatives
30:13 - that's a great question so i um
30:16 - you wouldn't have to do a lot for me to
30:17 - convince me of it
30:20 - so
30:21 - i'll tell you i'll tell you a little bit
30:23 - about what um
30:25 - what i think helped my colleagues uh who
30:28 - may not have had that
30:30 - i think the first thing the first advice
30:32 - i would give you is
30:34 - recognize the amount of um
30:39 - people who are trying to convince you to
30:41 - do something
30:43 - okay so what's going to distinguish your
30:46 - position over those that everybody else
30:49 - has i mean
30:51 - uh you know my good friend kirsten's
30:52 - here she'll tell you here this too i
30:54 - mean on a daily basis
30:57 - i'd get i'd get anywhere from 100 to 300
31:00 - emails a day just to tell me hey
31:03 - you need to do x
31:07 - when i was doing the standards in
31:09 - georgia the science standards in georgia
31:11 - i had a lady i don't know what her name
31:12 - was to this day her name but i just
31:14 - called her the folic acid lady
31:16 - because
31:17 - she called me every friday morning at 10
31:20 - o'clock to tell me how important folic
31:22 - acid was
31:24 - you know and i'm like yeah i get that
31:26 - folic acid is very important but what do
31:27 - you want me to do with that well i want
31:28 - it in the standards like well what do
31:30 - you want in the standards to say i
31:33 - understand the importance of folic acid
31:38 - you know and and i mean i'm saying it's
31:40 - partly because it's a little bit funny
31:41 - but partly because that is also very
31:43 - typical of what a commissioner deals
31:45 - with
31:46 - you have people that are coming with
31:48 - these dis with something they are very
31:49 - passionate about and it's possibly very
31:52 - important
31:54 - but it's disjointed from the bigger
31:57 - picture that i'm trying to create as a
31:59 - commissioner
32:00 - so
32:01 - in doing this my first suggestion would
32:04 - be
32:05 - connect it to something that they see as
32:08 - value
32:11 - and give them a path forward so you know
32:14 - one of the things that that you know i
32:16 - give hottie
32:18 - big props for with code.org
32:21 - was you know
32:23 - there was a time when everybody's like
32:24 - we got to make this a
32:26 - a graduation requirement we've got to
32:28 - make our graduation program we all
32:30 - everybody wants to make everything a
32:31 - graduation requirement
32:33 - you know in most schools you got
32:35 - you know you got 24 options because
32:38 - there's four there's six periods a day
32:40 - four years right
32:42 - you can't make everything a graduation
32:44 - requirement
32:45 - so you have to figure out how to get
32:47 - there
32:47 - and what heidi did really well was he
32:49 - started saying look let's just get it in
32:51 - schools to start with because at that
32:53 - time we didn't even have it in schools
32:56 - so what he and then of course now we're
32:59 - seeing where states are making a high
33:01 - school graduation requirement
33:03 - but
33:04 - what i think he did well was gave people
33:06 - a path forward
33:08 - so when you're doing your work with
33:10 - the commissioner
33:12 - it's how do you help move this you know
33:15 - so this is where i want to be but this
33:17 - is a path that you could go to get there
33:19 - then the last thing i would just share
33:21 - is
33:23 - you've got to talk about it in a
33:24 - language they understand
33:27 - and
33:28 - it's um
33:30 - i mean for me in kentucky you know
33:33 - especially in appalachia
33:35 - you know you
33:37 - the familial bond was so strong in
33:40 - eastern kentucky
33:42 - that a kid was would not leave eastern
33:45 - kentucky
33:46 - because of their family even if they
33:48 - could have a better life
33:50 - so one of the reasons why computer
33:51 - science became a big part for us too
33:54 - was
33:55 - that
33:56 - we could see how students could still
33:58 - continue to live
34:00 - with their family unit
34:02 - but be able to get a degree that would
34:04 - actually be able to make for a better
34:05 - economy
34:07 - so when you're talking to legislators
34:08 - policy makers they understand workforce
34:12 - they understand
34:13 - what it means to have a workforce but
34:15 - you've got to sometimes help connect
34:17 - those dots
34:20 - we have another question
34:22 - hello
34:23 - my name is becky muller and i'm a
34:25 - code.org facilitator csf and csd but i
34:28 - work at a stem school
34:30 - and we have adopted the ngss standards
34:33 - um
34:35 - as soon as they came out
34:37 - but colorado
34:38 - did it later on
34:40 - and but what i'm asking is can you kind
34:43 - of go back and tell me
34:45 - how did you put how
34:47 - where
34:48 - where was your concept of being able to
34:50 - include those engineering standards
34:53 - within ngss
34:56 - and
34:57 - and is there some way that we could
34:59 - attach
35:00 - some kind of computer science standards
35:02 - in the same way or through those
35:05 - cross-cutting
35:07 - concepts as you introduce them to
35:09 - students
35:10 - yeah absolutely in fact
35:12 - i even said back when we were developing
35:14 - in gss if you don't do computer science
35:17 - within gss then you're actually not
35:19 - fully preparing students for 21st
35:21 - century
35:23 - so
35:24 - there's a practice you know of of
35:26 - computational thinking
35:28 - and and we were a little limited uh i
35:30 - mean i'm just going to be kind of blunt
35:32 - here
35:33 - um you know the ngss were
35:36 - developed based on the framework for
35:38 - k-12 science education which came from
35:40 - the national academies
35:42 - and the decision was made at that
35:45 - committee
35:46 - that
35:47 - we would stay with the natural sciences
35:49 - so that's because we got a lot of push
35:52 - to
35:53 - to do computer science standards too
35:55 - and it just wasn't in the scope for us
35:57 - to do the standards for computer science
35:59 - and that so
36:01 - we tried to give entry points
36:04 - and i think that there's a couple
36:05 - i think that you know obviously the
36:07 - practice of computational thinking is
36:09 - there
36:11 - but the engineering standards are most
36:13 - definitely there
36:15 - but y'all the instructional part is wide
36:18 - open for computer science so
36:21 - i was actually sharing this with kirsten
36:22 - earlier when i was in kentucky
36:24 - we worked with collegeboard and code.org
36:28 - to take the computers ap computer
36:30 - science principles course
36:33 - and we offered it as a science course
36:35 - that a kid counts toward their
36:37 - graduation
36:40 - we train science teachers to teach it
36:42 - and in apcsp
36:45 - you know students do six to eight
36:47 - projects
36:49 - well what we did to justify it being a
36:51 - science was we said
36:53 - we trained the science teachers to help
36:55 - the students create those projects that
36:57 - prove they know science
36:59 - now they weren't doing a traditional
37:01 - science class they weren't standing at
37:02 - the board they weren't necessarily even
37:04 - doing labs in the traditional way
37:07 - but the stuff that came out of it was
37:09 - incredible
37:10 - i mean we had kids that were able to
37:12 - predict glacial movement that could
37:14 - predict weather
37:16 - because they were able to actually
37:17 - construct the computer modeling which by
37:20 - the way is another practice
37:23 - so the instruction was actually wide
37:25 - open and it fully aligned to ngss it
37:27 - fully aligned to
37:29 - csp
37:31 - but it was an instructional technique
37:33 - more so than a standards technique does
37:35 - that make sense yes it does thank you
37:37 - thank you welcome thank you for that i
37:40 - don't know if you recall stephen i know
37:42 - yes i'll make sure we'll get to the
37:43 - question i don't know if you recall but
37:45 - we had this one time when i said why do
37:47 - we have to label things life science
37:50 - earth science a student doesn't
37:51 - necessarily especially at elementary
37:53 - need to know that they're working in
37:55 - life science and that to me is speaks to
37:57 - the integration right because they're
37:59 - actually engaging in the content if
38:01 - they're using the science and
38:02 - engineering practices that's what we
38:04 - want students to do across all
38:06 - disciplines not just within science but
38:09 - in computer science and in ela so i just
38:11 - want to bring and we're going to get
38:12 - back to integration at k5 level yeah
38:15 - yeah because i would like to talk a
38:17 - little bit more about that because it
38:18 - it's uh
38:21 - yeah it can be an issue we'll talk about
38:22 - that
38:24 - hi
38:25 - good morning my name is dr marlo barnett
38:28 - and i am from chicago illinois
38:31 - so i have a question i wanted to go back
38:33 - to
38:34 - connecting the dots
38:36 - and so one thing the pandemic has brung
38:38 - out is the digital divide
38:41 - and so
38:42 - in connecting the dots how do you get
38:44 - your colleagues to understand that
38:47 - the digital divide
38:49 - has become greater and how computer
38:52 - science plays into that especially when
38:54 - we're talking about devices
38:57 - internet connectivity
38:59 - so how are you getting your colleagues
39:01 - to understand the bigger picture um and
39:04 - that all of this um is a part of affects
39:08 - and impacts computer science as well
39:11 - yeah you know
39:12 - i think we've got a great could y'all
39:14 - all hear the question okay
39:16 - i i i should have been asking that
39:18 - question all along
39:19 - um
39:20 - so
39:22 - i think that we've got a prime
39:24 - opportunity because that's because the
39:26 - digital divide has been on people's
39:28 - minds i mean i meet with the the chiefs
39:30 - in the south
39:31 - or the commissioners in the south i meet
39:33 - with
39:34 - you know i'm still connected with ccsso
39:37 - and i think there is a
39:39 - realization
39:40 - that the digital divide is a real thing
39:44 - what i'm not
39:45 - convinced of is that we have made the
39:47 - jump from
39:50 - the digital divide because we need to
39:52 - help students who
39:54 - are behind to
39:57 - actually
39:58 - this is a wave of comple of the future
40:00 - where we're going to have this
40:02 - recognition that the world will never go
40:04 - back to the way it was right
40:09 - and then i would actually go even one
40:10 - more step to say
40:14 - to recognize the digital divide is to
40:18 - also recognize the limitations placed on
40:20 - a student for their future um the the
40:24 - reality is that
40:29 - i that working in computer science is
40:31 - going to afford students
40:33 - greater autonomy and greater opportunity
40:36 - in that field
40:38 - exactly and that field is going to be at
40:40 - home
40:41 - they're not going to report to an office
40:44 - so
40:45 - you know there so there's a
40:48 - i think where everybody is is we realize
40:49 - there's a digital vibe i mean look you
40:51 - can have fiber running underneath your
40:53 - building in downtown atlanta but if i
40:55 - can't afford to get
40:57 - to that
40:58 - then it's just cable running underneath
41:00 - the building
41:02 - so i think there's the recognition of
41:03 - that part
41:05 - i think that people realize that the
41:07 - world is not going to go back and
41:09 - actually it affords us the opportunity
41:10 - to
41:11 - and much to the chagrin of children
41:14 - across the nation
41:15 - snow days may not be a thing in the
41:17 - future
41:18 - exactly and but i don't know that we've
41:21 - made the next jump to say
41:26 - we're going to have a remote environment
41:28 - for the most part
41:30 - so
41:31 - we might need to help make connect those
41:33 - dots yeah that's what needs to get out
41:35 - yeah thank you
41:39 - hi hi i'm samantha i'm a regional
41:42 - partner with iowa and my question is
41:44 - if you have any tips around the
41:46 - different aspects of computer science
41:48 - that are bubbling up now similar to
41:50 - science where there's life science and
41:52 - earth science and all of that we have ai
41:54 - and data science and cyber security and
41:57 - um i think we're starting to see some
41:59 - confusion at least in our area of
42:01 - where the focus should be and i think
42:04 - most of us know that that's all part of
42:05 - computer science but how do we
42:07 - have a clear messaging to our states our
42:10 - regions and our districts
42:12 - and how do we deal with that so you want
42:13 - to go ahead
42:15 - go ahead all right
42:18 - this may be a minute
42:22 - so
42:24 - here's the picture i want to lay out for
42:26 - you and this this goes to the connecting
42:28 - dots and it goes to your question
42:32 - sreb
42:34 - we we've done we've done several things
42:36 - over the last several years in 2016
42:39 - under the leadership of governor
42:41 - hutchinson in
42:43 - arkansas we did a commission report on
42:46 - computer science and pathways
42:50 - in 2019 we released a report called
42:52 - unprepared and unaware
42:54 - and
42:55 - earned 2018 2019 we followed that up
42:57 - with an economic impact of what will
43:00 - happen
43:01 - and let me just give you the short story
43:03 - here
43:06 - this is obviously was pre-pandemic
43:08 - and what we found was that there are
43:11 - people who are currently in the
43:12 - workforce
43:14 - who
43:15 - you know they're they're they're owning
43:17 - their homes they're going on vacations
43:19 - with their family life is good they're
43:21 - making money
43:23 - these folks also have high school
43:25 - diplomas or less
43:27 - all right
43:29 - so ages 25 to 35 is who we looked at
43:32 - and what we found was the impact of
43:34 - artificial intelligence and automation
43:37 - on the workforce over the next 10 years
43:40 - would be significant enough
43:43 - that a large majority of the current
43:46 - workforce in the south would be impacted
43:49 - by
43:51 - automation
43:53 - nai
43:55 - so
43:56 - we further looked and said what are the
43:58 - ages of these people's kids
44:01 - and we found that that they actually
44:03 - would be graduating around 2030
44:07 - well those kids are 10 times more likely
44:09 - to go into the same line of work and
44:11 - have the same level of education as
44:13 - their parents
44:16 - so we followed that up
44:18 - with this economic impact
44:20 - and what we found was in the south alone
44:24 - now i understand how we did we defined
44:26 - the south sreb is
44:29 - from delaware
44:31 - don't laugh
44:33 - delaware
44:34 - yes you cannot buy sweet tea in the
44:36 - restaurants in delaware but we love them
44:38 - anyway okay
44:40 - but from delaware down to florida over
44:42 - to texas back up to arkansas kentucky
44:44 - okay
44:47 - 18 million
44:49 - unemployable
44:51 - adults by 2030.
44:54 - now not unemployed
44:57 - unemployable
44:58 - which means they do not have the skill
45:01 - to be involved in an environment
45:03 - or in an economy
45:05 - where
45:06 - food service already in the south is
45:09 - roughly 67 percent
45:12 - automatable
45:14 - by 2030 100
45:17 - is going to be automatable
45:18 - you can already go to wendy's in some
45:20 - parts of the country and order
45:22 - and a robot prepares the food and it
45:25 - kind of shoots out of a little vending
45:26 - machine kind of deal
45:28 - so you think about 18 million
45:30 - unemployables that doesn't count their
45:32 - kids
45:33 - who if we haven't done the work
45:36 - that they learn in stem won't be able to
45:38 - be a part of that so advanced
45:40 - manufacturing welding
45:42 - carpentry and
45:44 - building the things that we've
45:46 - traditionally thought of as as kind of
45:48 - blue collar you know working with your
45:50 - hands
45:52 - not anymore
45:53 - they're actually going to be done
45:56 - using computer science i walked into
45:59 - henry henderson county high school in
46:00 - kentucky
46:02 - and
46:03 - you know when the commissioner comes to
46:04 - visit you know what they do is they
46:05 - strap roller skates on
46:08 - the person and they drag them all over
46:10 - the building you know
46:12 - and i love that i always did it after
46:14 - legislative session because god knows i
46:16 - needed to be out of the capitol and with
46:18 - kids after the legislative session
46:20 - and so i walk in and and um they were
46:23 - like we got to get you to the welding
46:24 - lab i'm like okay so they took me a few
46:28 - places and they got me there and i walk
46:30 - in and the kid's like oh thank goodness
46:32 - you're here
46:33 - i got something to show you i'm like
46:35 - okay great he said come here and push
46:36 - this button
46:37 - i said dude i'm from the south you know
46:39 - how many jokes start that way i'm not
46:41 - pushing this button
46:44 - and so
46:46 - so he says no no this is going to be
46:47 - safe i said okay so i'll go over and i
46:49 - push the button
46:50 - and he had put
46:54 - he had made this design
46:56 - to cut my name into this giant piece of
46:59 - metal
47:02 - on a plasma welder
47:04 - okay
47:05 - so i'm standing there talking to this
47:06 - kid
47:08 - i'm like well tell me a little bit about
47:09 - because you know it didn't happen
47:10 - immediately you had to cut it i said
47:11 - tell well tell me a little bit about
47:12 - this he said
47:14 - well you know the first thing is you
47:17 - know i had to select a metal because i
47:18 - wanted this to be something you can keep
47:20 - a long time so
47:22 - i'm thinking okay science structure and
47:24 - properties of matter
47:26 - awesome
47:27 - he said you know what took probably the
47:29 - the longest though was to code the
47:32 - machine
47:34 - i'm like okay all right so tell me more
47:37 - about that and he starts telling me how
47:38 - he had to learn to write lines of code
47:42 - how he had to calculate the angles
47:44 - of the r and the circle in the middle of
47:47 - the r and all that and i'm like
47:49 - man i bet your math teacher loves you he
47:51 - said
47:52 - i hate math
47:55 - he said i'm not very good at it
47:58 - i'm like dude
48:00 - i like the word dude if you hadn't
48:01 - figured it out dude
48:04 - you just talked about trigonometry you
48:06 - actually said sign
48:09 - s-i-n not s-i-g-n okay
48:12 - he said yeah
48:14 - i just did what i had to do to make this
48:15 - piece
48:18 - relevance matters
48:20 - and so if we're going to actually
48:24 - do the things that you're talking about
48:25 - with we do have to recognize artificial
48:28 - intelligence automation are going to be
48:30 - a significant part of our workforce
48:33 - and that covet accelerated dependence on
48:35 - automation by five years
48:38 - so we're not looking at 2030 anymore
48:40 - we're looking at 2025.
48:44 - so hopefully that that answers your
48:46 - question i mean like i said i'm sorry
48:47 - you had to stand there for that long but
48:50 - i'm really passionate about this we are
48:52 - going to be as a country
48:54 - in a world of hurt by 2030 if we have
48:58 - not significantly changed how we're
49:01 - approaching k-12 and post-secondary and
49:03 - adult ed to upskill our populace to be
49:07 - able to work in this environment in
49:09 - which computer science is a key part
49:12 - of that economy
49:15 - darcy you have a question yes thanks
49:17 - that's actually a perfect segue to my
49:18 - question too so hi i'm darcy i'm from
49:20 - sacred heart university the regional
49:22 - partner in connecticut and i want to go
49:24 - back also to the description that you
49:26 - had about um the course scheduling right
49:29 - that okay there's access but is there
49:30 - really if this is scheduled at the same
49:32 - time as that and you know i have a lot
49:34 - of compassion for
49:36 - principals who are dealing with the real
49:38 - world and these real choices that that
49:40 - are that students are faced with and
49:42 - that they have to organize around and so
49:44 - i'm wondering if you have any
49:46 - strategies or thoughts about kind of
49:48 - just broadly breaking through the log
49:51 - jam of this idea of a zero-sum game
49:53 - right that more space
49:56 - is less space for someone else
49:58 - um some other area and thinking about
50:01 - you know creating those whole students
50:03 - um you know at the at the secondary
50:05 - level we see that with these course
50:06 - offerings at the elementary level that
50:08 - often comes down to this conversation
50:10 - about minutes of instruction time for
50:12 - one thing or another
50:14 - so i wanted to know if you had any
50:15 - thoughts about kind of working through
50:17 - that um and so for example in ngss my
50:20 - background is in science education as
50:22 - well you know i know that there was so
50:24 - much care and attention done to
50:26 - identifying those standards in literacy
50:28 - and mathematics that related to the next
50:30 - generation science standards
50:32 - and i wonder if you feel that
50:35 - that attention to the potential for
50:39 - working across areas
50:40 - has been reciprocated by those other
50:44 - content areas
50:46 - and if you were seeing some progress at
50:48 - breaking through the zero-sum game and
50:50 - if there are lessons that we can learn
50:51 - for computer science from that great
50:54 - question
50:55 - um big question but great question um
50:59 - so
51:01 - i i guess let me start with your second
51:04 - question about
51:06 - have other content areas reciprocated
51:09 - not as much as i would have hoped
51:12 - you know that there's a
51:17 - people are scared of the unknown
51:19 - and teachers by nature
51:24 - want to be
51:25 - the expert in the room
51:27 - and and i get that i mean i was in that
51:30 - room i i get it
51:32 - um
51:34 - so
51:36 - to just kind of throw stuff out there
51:39 - and hope that it sticks
51:42 - won't work
51:43 - now i will tell you this
51:46 - i have seen incredible
51:49 - science education instruction in
51:51 - elementary
51:54 - and i've seen some really bad
51:56 - instruction in high school
51:58 - okay
52:00 - and here's why i think
52:02 - i think that from the day we started the
52:04 - framework
52:06 - and then once the we started in gss
52:08 - everybody was worried about those poor
52:10 - elementary teachers
52:12 - you remember hearing all that oh they
52:14 - don't know the content oh they don't
52:16 - know this i don't know what i tell you
52:17 - what they do know they know good
52:19 - instruction
52:20 - and they know how you can integrate
52:23 - things
52:25 - um not that they always do but that how
52:27 - they can
52:29 - and i saw some so the rule when i was
52:31 - commissioned was you had to take me to
52:32 - at least one non-tested science class
52:35 - which freaked out the superintendents
52:37 - because they were sometimes they were
52:38 - like i'm not sure if we have any
52:41 - and so
52:42 - but i saw incredible stuff in elementary
52:45 - school because
52:47 - because as a
52:49 - state
52:50 - before i became commissioner they had
52:52 - invested lots of training
52:54 - on how to use math english
52:57 - and science together
53:00 - but then you go to high school
53:03 - and i'm a former high school teacher so
53:05 - nobody get offended i'm talking about my
53:06 - own people here
53:08 - you know we just know how to do it
53:10 - just ask us
53:13 - um and and i mean i you know i'll never
53:15 - forget this one teacher telling me
53:19 - how if we don't teach the four phases of
53:20 - mitosis and won't be prepared for
53:23 - college and a college professor sitting
53:25 - six feet from her said
53:27 - i wish i wouldn't even teach that
53:28 - because
53:30 - we usually have to fix it
53:33 - you know and so
53:35 - but there was not an investment in high
53:37 - school like there was in elementary
53:39 - because the assumption was they knew the
53:41 - content
53:42 - and the reality is and i think this is
53:45 - true in computer science
53:47 - it's not about just the content it's
53:49 - about the thinking that goes into the
53:51 - content and the thinking of how
53:54 - instruction has to be cultivated
53:56 - the second part of your ques or the
53:58 - first part of your question you know i
54:00 - think that there's a big part of this
54:02 - that
54:04 - industry partners have to play if you're
54:06 - going to find room in the curriculum for
54:09 - for computer science
54:11 - um
54:12 - bill even building career pathways that
54:15 - start in high school
54:17 - that have dual enrollment and all that
54:18 - kind of stuff
54:20 - is not enough if you don't have industry
54:22 - partners at the table that say we need
54:24 - these kinds of people
54:26 - okay or these trainings
54:28 - so having i mean
54:30 - georgia has just
54:32 - uh we've been working with them they've
54:33 - just finished a
54:35 - pathway on nursing
54:37 - and there's nursing pathways cross
54:39 - country but the reason i think this
54:40 - one's going to work is wellstar
54:42 - who's the biggest healthcare provider in
54:44 - georgia
54:46 - has guaranteed every kid that graduates
54:48 - at every level an interview
54:51 - well guess what
54:52 - they got kids that are taking those
54:54 - courses now
54:55 - and i think we've got to do a better job
54:57 - of of
54:58 - local districts
55:00 - and states
55:02 - finding ways to partner with industry
55:04 - to give a a reason for that because i
55:08 - the biggest problem i see with k-12 is
55:11 - we still look at things as a course code
55:14 - and a course name
55:17 - and not what they can the full
55:19 - collection of knowledge needs to be back
55:21 - by 12th grade to be successful at the
55:24 - next level
55:26 - thank you
55:27 - and we have two other questions i think
55:29 - but i just want to add we're focusing so
55:31 - much right now on k-12 but what about
55:34 - teacher preparation
55:35 - if we're not changing what teach how
55:37 - teachers are learning we're still doing
55:39 - the same thing that we've done years ago
55:41 - and still teaching teachers that teach
55:43 - the same way we're not going to see
55:45 - change
55:46 - in k-12 oh that's absolutely true right
55:49 - that's absolutely true absolutely true
55:51 - but we'll go to the next question
55:53 - okay
55:55 - hi dr pereira i am sherry mcguffin i'm
55:57 - stem coordinator from advanced kentucky
55:59 - so thank you for your work in kentucky
56:01 - we appreciate it
56:02 - always good to see you kentucky
56:04 - absolutely and so what my question
56:07 - revolves around
56:09 - advanced placement ap computer science
56:11 - principles apcsa and what is potentially
56:14 - seen and sometimes seen as a conflict
56:16 - with the dual credit courses and that's
56:18 - been one of the issues that we've had in
56:20 - kentucky getting in computer science
56:22 - into some of those schools where it does
56:24 - not exist
56:25 - is that it is seen as a competition
56:27 - between dual credit and sometimes in
56:29 - that mentality dual credit and computer
56:31 - science don't coexist because teachers
56:34 - aren't seen as qualified enough to teach
56:36 - those so i would ask what your advice is
56:39 - to alleviate that idea of competition
56:42 - and how we can help it to be seen as
56:44 - something that works with dual credit
56:46 - rather than a competitor
56:48 - yeah so i you know
56:50 - i i think the first thing you've got to
56:52 - realize is it is a competition
56:54 - it's unfortunate but it is
56:56 - and i don't believe that education made
56:59 - it a competition i think that parents
57:02 - and communities sort of did
57:04 - the idea that i can go and take a dual
57:07 - credit course
57:08 - and immediately have credit on my
57:10 - transcript
57:13 - and not have to take a test
57:16 - i think had a big allure to people
57:19 - i
57:20 - my advice is and you know we tried to do
57:22 - this when i was in kentucky is to try to
57:24 - lower that temperature about around the
57:26 - competition
57:27 - in fact even
57:29 - allowing the ap courses to count as dual
57:32 - credit
57:34 - i think that it's a lot of
57:37 - it's a lot of work on the front end of
57:39 - case making especially to parents
57:42 - and to administrators because let's face
57:44 - it to them it's also
57:46 - easier
57:47 - because you know there's usually a
57:48 - little bit of money involved
57:51 - especially if it's being taught on
57:52 - campus
57:55 - there is a lot of um
57:59 - uh
58:00 - i think perception that it's a little
58:02 - bit easier to do a dual credit because
58:04 - you don't have to deal with test
58:05 - security
58:06 - you don't have to deal with the
58:08 - perception of having to stop dropping
58:11 - tests kind of deal
58:13 - so
58:13 - my advice to you would be
58:17 - show people how those two things coexist
58:20 - and not just that they can but that they
58:22 - probably should
58:24 - because there are some things that kids
58:25 - do get a better benefit out of taking
58:27 - dual enrollment because ap doesn't offer
58:30 - it
58:31 - but there are also things that
58:32 - especially
58:34 - i mean
58:35 - you know
58:36 - we have one state in the south that has
58:38 - started requiring
58:40 - the ap test at the end of dual
58:42 - enrollment courses
58:44 - if there's a a match
58:47 - to verify that the dual enrollment
58:49 - course was actually at an appropriate
58:50 - level because there's people at the
58:53 - policy making level that are skeptical
58:54 - of dual enrollment too
58:57 - um but i think that making that case i
58:59 - mean i had parents when i was in
59:00 - kentucky that would come up because i
59:02 - you know i i'm a former ap teacher um
59:06 - and
59:08 - i had kids that would go down the road
59:10 - and take
59:11 - chemistry
59:12 - even
59:13 - for my first year class not even
59:14 - counting my ap class because they knew
59:16 - they had a better chance of getting a
59:17 - higher grade in there than they did in
59:19 - my class well
59:20 - they could make a high grade in my class
59:22 - but they have to work for it
59:24 - and um
59:26 - i'd have parents come up and say well
59:27 - why in the world would i do that
59:29 - when i can just go take that class why
59:31 - would i want them to take that test and
59:32 - i think we've got to figure out how as a
59:34 - school in your case as a school
59:37 - to communicate to the community how
59:39 - those things fit together and work
59:41 - together
59:42 - i don't know where it is now but you
59:44 - know one of the things that we worked on
59:45 - when i was in kentucky was a career
59:47 - pathway
59:48 - in computer science that included
59:51 - ap
59:52 - and dual enrollment
59:54 - so that there's actually a model there
59:56 - assuming it's still there that you can
59:58 - actually show to parents and say look
59:59 - there's value here
60:01 - for both of these
60:04 - and then you got to make that case
60:07 - thank you you're welcome
60:09 - and you know the cats are playing ut
60:11 - this weekend um i don't know where my
60:13 - tennessee guy went but there he is
60:15 - so um
60:16 - we have another question tuesday yep hi
60:19 - good morning uh thank you for all your
60:20 - work and i just want to say thank you
60:22 - for acknowledging that teachers bring so
60:24 - many strengths to the table and that we
60:26 - need to build off of those strengths and
60:27 - not just consider the deficit model my
60:30 - name is lee and eliza i'm the executive
60:31 - director at cs for all and we've been
60:33 - talking a lot about what schools and
60:35 - states can do but i want to shift the
60:37 - focus a little bit in the other
60:38 - direction we know that we have a local
60:41 - control country with regionality around
60:43 - state policy for education
60:45 - but in what ways can the federal
60:46 - government think about
60:49 - empowering accelerating supporting the
60:52 - great work that our states do and
60:54 - getting out of their way
60:56 - we just did a report on ai and data
60:58 - science education with ostp and the
61:00 - department of labor
61:02 - how did you see in the science education
61:04 - work
61:05 - the federal government could be
61:07 - supportive in the national policies
61:09 - they're allowed
61:11 - to enact not requirements but supportive
61:14 - policies to make the work go faster
61:18 - so um
61:20 - you're probably not going to like this
61:22 - answer
61:25 - i did everything i could to keep the
61:27 - federal government out of anything with
61:29 - science
61:32 - you might remember that when we were
61:33 - doing the science standards there was
61:34 - this little kerfuffle going on
61:37 - around math and english called common
61:39 - core um i wasn't going to say their name
61:41 - but yeah and and so
61:43 - i mean
61:44 - i
61:45 - would beg the department do not say the
61:48 - word science
61:50 - i mean i mean i literally remember
61:52 - having a nightmare of watching of me
61:55 - watching the presidential
61:57 - debate
61:58 - and seeing the ngss brought up on the on
62:01 - a debate stage i mean it was
62:04 - and i guess that was one of the nice
62:05 - things you know
62:08 - it was nice to be the second group that
62:10 - walked through the minefield
62:11 - you know
62:13 - um i mean at the end of the day i don't
62:17 - regardless of
62:20 - politics
62:21 - i don't think states like being told
62:23 - what to do by the federal government and
62:26 - and look i i mean i as commissioner i
62:28 - was an equal opportunity offender
62:30 - i had my fights with with
62:33 - both administrations
62:34 - because if i thought they were wrong i
62:36 - told them
62:38 - sometimes more loudly than i needed to
62:39 - but you're seeing things like ies money
62:42 - yeah there are many people here who have
62:43 - received scale-up grants from the
62:45 - institute for education sciences
62:48 - you spoke about bringing industry
62:50 - partners to the table
62:52 - labor is a very good way so i'm not
62:54 - talking about like
62:55 - putting a flag in the ground or somehow
62:57 - enacting policies around the politics
63:00 - but using and leveraging their
63:02 - particular network i totally get it that
63:04 - what i was telling you is kind of the
63:05 - preamble yeah okay i i think that you've
63:08 - got to
63:11 - when you're taught i mean the thing is
63:12 - when you go in and you have cs for all
63:14 - on your business card and you're trying
63:16 - to get them and you're talking to them
63:18 - about industry partners they've looked
63:20 - at your card and said cs for all
63:23 - okay
63:24 - so
63:25 - you need to develop very deliberate
63:27 - messages of
63:29 - things that
63:32 - obviously support cs
63:34 - but don't necessarily
63:38 - make that the primary because because
63:41 - one good way to kill things in a lot of
63:43 - states is you know i mean
63:45 - look my number one job at ng for ngss
63:49 - was to make sure nobody said no right
63:51 - away
63:52 - i mean they said no later that's fine
63:53 - but
63:54 - you know i i wasn't but i didn't want
63:56 - them to dismiss it out of hand
63:58 - immediately
63:59 - so
64:01 - knowing full well
64:03 - what is in ice ies grants what are in
64:07 - uh i mean
64:08 - there are i mean snap grants you know
64:11 - have opportunity for upskilling adults
64:13 - in computer science
64:15 - um
64:16 - in fact
64:17 - a lot of people don't even realize if
64:19 - you write your your program the right
64:21 - way
64:22 - while you're up skilling those those uh
64:24 - adults snap grant will pay for meals for
64:28 - the students for their kids while
64:30 - they're getting trained i mean there's
64:31 - ways to do that
64:33 - so i think that the lever to pull is
64:36 - being fully aware of what's offered by
64:38 - the federal government in terms of
64:40 - funding
64:41 - and
64:43 - having a message is deliberate
64:46 - that allows the federal government to
64:48 - give
64:50 - options for use of that money
64:52 - but without having the federal
64:54 - government say you need to go do it for
64:56 - this reason does that make sense a lot
64:58 - yes and i think i love that advice and i
65:00 - think that's probably super useful for
65:02 - all of our state leaders too so thank
65:04 - you you're welcome
65:07 - so it looks like we're bringing the
65:08 - planet plane in for a landing and i have
65:11 - one more question to close with and you
65:12 - were worried we didn't have enough
65:13 - questions
65:17 - great participation on a friday right
65:19 - all right so let's talk about gender
65:21 - parity
65:22 - currently
65:24 - women obtain more than half of u.s
65:27 - undergraduate degrees in biology 60
65:30 - chemistry and mathematics yet only earn
65:33 - about 20 percent of computer science
65:35 - undergraduate degrees
65:37 - the gender parity in biochem
65:40 - and mathematics wasn't the case just a
65:41 - couple of days
65:42 - decades ago
65:44 - what do you think this is why do you
65:45 - think this is and what changed in k-12
65:48 - to help us usher these changes and what
65:50 - can we learn from that movement
65:53 - for cs
65:56 - so
65:57 - it's a
66:02 - i think there's a lot of there's a
66:04 - couple reasons there's some that maybe
66:05 - would be more valid in terms of research
66:07 - and then there are some that i just
66:08 - think
66:10 - um i think that
66:12 - we
66:14 - have seen especially more females in the
66:16 - areas of biology chemistry and physics
66:18 - because those have been promoted better
66:22 - the part that's probably less
66:26 - rooted in in research is
66:28 - the people who are usually the decision
66:30 - makers in college are biology chemistry
66:32 - and physics people
66:34 - um you know a lot of your provosts are
66:36 - physicists
66:37 - uh
66:38 - you've got a lot of that
66:40 - but also it's what gets taught in school
66:43 - so
66:45 - earth science is still
66:47 - not taught in high school
66:49 - you know why would it be i mean you know
66:50 - we only live here
66:52 - um
66:54 - you know but but for the most part we we
66:56 - finished teaching um
66:58 - earth science in eighth grade
67:00 - well
67:02 - you know
67:03 - i think the same parallel could be made
67:05 - with computer science if if there's not
67:08 - an attention to it in k-12
67:11 - um
67:12 - we're not going to be able to feed
67:15 - the pipeline into
67:17 - more people taking those courses and
67:19 - subsequently becoming employed
67:22 - um
67:23 - so you know i mean and and
67:26 - i think it's just i mean we were
67:28 - laughing about this earlier
67:30 - you know if you watch the big bang
67:31 - theory
67:33 - they make fun of the poor earth science
67:35 - guy all the time and and
67:38 - unfortunately it's kind of
67:40 - it's satirical i mean it is there's some
67:42 - truth to that now
67:44 - the people that are they're doing
67:46 - chemistry physics and biology are great
67:47 - people too don't get me wrong i got a
67:49 - really good friend back there somewhere
67:51 - gay that's a great physicist
67:53 - um but i do think that when we start to
67:56 - shortchange students
67:59 - um
68:01 - uh experience
68:03 - in k-12
68:05 - there's no way to think that they're
68:06 - going to get to college and just somehow
68:08 - miraculously find this
68:10 - so things like earth and things
68:12 - specifically like computer science
68:15 - we've got to do a better job of and i
68:17 - think we've done that with biology
68:19 - chemistry and physics and that's and and
68:21 - i think we've worked to lift the stigma
68:23 - of that girls can't do science
68:26 - but when you define science as only
68:28 - biology chemistry and physics
68:30 - that's where we see the increase
68:34 - well i think we've come to our time to
68:36 - end the session so can you please join
68:38 - me in thanking stephen for being with us
68:40 - today
68:42 - [Applause]
68:47 - well i'll say one last thing you know if
68:49 - we don't get our act together
68:51 - then all the opportunity we have will
68:54 - just go up in flames
68:56 - [Laughter]
69:00 - well here you go thank you so much thank
69:02 - you i'll give you honey
69:05 - thank you
69:06 - thank you guys
69:08 - thanks pat
69:11 - well that's exactly what i uh was hoping
69:13 - that we'd get folks um i've been
69:15 - following uh what stephen pruitt has
69:17 - been doing for many years now i remember
69:19 - when
69:20 - actually some of the advocates in this
69:22 - room
69:23 - uh were reaching out to the science
69:24 - community during the time of the
69:26 - development of the framework and the
69:28 - ngss we're wondering hey where does
69:30 - computer science fit in folks
69:33 - and what we heard back and you know
69:35 - stephen would say this as well in fact
69:36 - he might have already mentioned it that
69:38 - they were kind of handcuffed by the
69:40 - framework given to them in the
69:41 - development of the standards and then he
69:44 - did allude to certain things that were
69:46 - included things like computational
69:47 - thinking computer modeling etc
69:50 - what i hope to understand from stephen
69:52 - was
69:54 - how we can
69:55 - learn lessons from the science movement
69:57 - even though the you know the science
69:59 - world is still struggling to include
70:01 - signs in all elementary schools but how
70:03 - we can learn from them rather than just
70:05 - repeat maybe the same mistakes so again
70:07 - thank you jackie thank you steven let's
70:09 - give them another round of applause
70:11 - [Applause]
70:15 - if i can get the slides showing please
70:21 - so
70:23 - i wanted to
70:25 - uh
70:26 - be open with you guys about
70:28 - something i taught computer science at
70:31 - the high school level actually i was a
70:32 - high school computer science teacher as
70:34 - well and then i switched to computer
70:35 - science
70:37 - taught computer science for a number of
70:38 - years
70:39 - now i've been at code.org for eight and
70:41 - a half nine years now so probably been
70:43 - in the computer science game for
70:45 - 15 to 20 years now
70:48 - and much of the conversation has been
70:50 - around
70:51 - the capacity of the system
70:53 - now we have about 33 states with
70:57 - computer science
70:58 - state supervisors when just five years
71:01 - ago it was basically a couple people in
71:03 - anthony owen
71:04 - um
71:06 - and now even arkansas has like eight to
71:08 - ten
71:09 - uh state specialists focused on computer
71:11 - science
71:13 - but we've been talking about capacity
71:14 - for a long time we've been talking about
71:16 - just access for a long time like just
71:19 - just getting it on the menu and steve
71:21 - talked about that just just schools just
71:24 - put it on the menu kids will take it and
71:26 - we're seeing that
71:28 - we've been talking about participation
71:29 - how can we just get you know
71:32 - representational participation
71:35 - i'm so eager
71:37 - so eager one
71:38 - day that the discussion around computer
71:41 - science will be about the experience
71:43 - that kids are having now i know that we
71:45 - do
71:46 - i know that we do talk about that and
71:48 - there is some research around that
71:49 - experience but i i look for i look
71:52 - forward to the day when the majority of
71:55 - the conversation
71:56 - is around the experience that all of our
71:59 - students are having
72:01 - that cs4 is not about necessarily just
72:04 - all schools offering it or
72:06 - all students represented but all
72:09 - students having an amazing time
72:11 - and learning a lot and doing something
72:14 - with it
72:15 - so i know we're on the
72:16 - the edge of that now folks and that's
72:19 - why the state of cs report was all about
72:21 - accelerating
72:23 - action
72:24 - we're there we are really close there
72:26 - are states right now
72:28 - that are basically our lighthouse states
72:31 - our successes
72:33 - they're still early on but you know what
72:36 - we're at a point where we can really say
72:39 - doing this or doing that really does
72:41 - change the game
72:43 - right now
72:44 - they're you know
72:46 - i think nationally the the percent of
72:48 - women in computer sciences
72:51 - in at the high school level is something
72:53 - like 30-ish percent maybe
72:55 - i mean that's still far away from the 50
72:57 - percent we're looking for but there are
72:59 - states
73:01 - where it's like 46
73:02 - 48 at the high school level that's
73:04 - amazing so this can be done
73:07 - and i look forward to the time when all
73:08 - of us are gathering together maybe next
73:10 - year maybe the next year after that
73:12 - and much of our conversations around the
73:14 - experience of students
73:18 - so
73:20 - how do we get there
73:22 - well like i told you before when i uh
73:25 - was talking on uh wednesday this cut
73:27 - this
73:28 - conference has been designed around
73:29 - engagement and interaction and i so
73:31 - appreciate jackie calling you up to ask
73:34 - questions during the presentation during
73:36 - the uh during the conversation
73:38 - in the same way we've set aside time for
73:41 - you all
73:42 - to have strategy sessions from 10 30 to
73:45 - 11 30. now if you don't have a date or a
73:47 - plan
73:49 - during that time
73:50 - after i finish talking i want you to
73:52 - make a plan
73:54 - some of you
73:56 - are from california
73:58 - say woo
74:00 - a lot of you all are from california
74:02 - right
74:03 - you're going to have a specific state
74:05 - session
74:06 - just for california
74:08 - following this uh presentation during
74:11 - this time
74:12 - if you're not from california you can go
74:14 - to your regional room
74:17 - and have a conversation around a table
74:19 - or two and just bring people together
74:22 - uh alternatively
74:24 - maybe there aren't that actually many
74:26 - people from your state here and maybe
74:28 - you just want to meet with people from
74:29 - another state because you heard about
74:32 - their successes and you just want to
74:33 - replicate them you want to ask questions
74:35 - you want to
74:36 - you know learn the lessons that they
74:38 - learned and
74:40 - not make the same missteps maybe that
74:42 - uh they share
74:44 - so you can meet with another state in
74:46 - that regional room
74:48 - you can also meet with a speaker or
74:50 - other cs edcon participant
74:52 - remember you have a a link
74:54 - to everyone who agreed to share their
74:57 - contact information that was emailed to
74:58 - you this monday it's towards the bottom
75:01 - of the email in case you missed it
75:03 - and
75:04 - feel free to reach out to those folks
75:06 - and just ask them hey can i you know
75:08 - while we're here at the conference can
75:10 - we just talk about x y or z
75:12 - maybe there was a speaker that you just
75:14 - wanted to talk a little bit
75:15 - uh more to
75:18 - and uh
75:19 - you could also meet with a code.org
75:20 - regional partner code or regional
75:22 - partners if you could stand up
75:28 - so
75:29 - these are these regional organizations
75:32 - are doing a lot of the legwork the
75:33 - groundwork in their regions
75:36 - if you're a district in their region
75:38 - certainly you can talk to them to find
75:39 - out more about what they're doing in the
75:41 - region to support you uh additionally
75:44 - you can meet with some of the state cs
75:45 - supervisors i mentioned them if they
75:47 - could stand up
75:48 - we can give them a round of applause
75:52 - [Applause]
75:55 - you could also meet up with some of your
75:57 - state computer science supervisors to
75:59 - understand what's happening statewide
76:00 - and be part of the statewide movement
76:04 - lastly
76:07 - feedback
76:08 - uh imagine that that y is next to the e
76:11 - uh
76:13 - so go ahead and take out your your
76:15 - computing device your
76:17 - [Music]
76:18 - uh
76:19 - your your phone or your laptop or your
76:22 - tablet
76:24 - do you know why cs edcon is the way it
76:26 - is this year we did a number of things
76:28 - different compared to 2019. for example
76:31 - rather than state networking we did
76:33 - regional networking
76:34 - rather than just one reception we
76:35 - included a happy hour as well
76:38 - you know we do these things based off of
76:41 - feedback
76:42 - so if you at any moment during this
76:44 - conference thought you know what
76:46 - they could have probably done this or
76:48 - that better
76:49 - unfortunately i can't read minds
76:52 - so
76:54 - please
76:55 - type in this link
76:57 - bit.li
76:58 - cs edcon 2021 survey
77:01 - it probably takes about
77:04 - five minutes
77:05 - four to five minutes
77:08 - sorry
77:12 - gotcha
77:14 - jackie will take care of it
77:18 - yeah and hopefully that link is not to
77:20 - the actual uh
77:21 - the editable form it's to the the view
77:23 - form
77:26 - it says view okay
77:28 - you know sometimes when you uh
77:31 - do these forms they have that default
77:33 - where it's like locked to just the
77:34 - organizational users
77:36 - yeah
77:37 - anyway um
77:39 - thank you for trying
77:41 - you'll you'll just refresh when jackie
77:44 - gives me the thumbs up yeah it's working
77:46 - now oh
77:47 - jackie thank you
77:48 - um yeah go ahead and refresh
77:51 - again we really appreciate your feedback
77:55 - we do intend on doing cs edcon again
77:58 - and so we want to use your feedback to
78:00 - make it even better for you
78:02 - did you like the whole concierge
78:04 - experience where folks like emailed you
78:06 - and tried to connect you with other
78:07 - people do you want more of that
78:10 - do you do you
78:12 - like the food did you not like the food
78:15 - do you wish there was this do you wish
78:17 - there was that
78:18 - uh do we do you wish that a certain
78:20 - topic was was covered go ahead and uh
78:23 - provide that feedback again we're going
78:25 - to use it
78:27 - again thank you on behalf of the
78:29 - conference team
78:30 - we're going to be moving to strategy
78:32 - sessions now uh starting at 10 30 to 11
78:35 - 30 and 11 30 we'll be back here
78:38 - for just some quick words and um
78:41 - and lunch if you do have to leave early
78:44 - at 11 30 and you can't just sit through
78:46 - lunch we're actually gonna have some box
78:47 - lunches that you can just grab
78:49 - and take
78:50 - on the way to the airport that was based
78:52 - off of feedback as well so again thank
78:54 - you on behalf of the conference team
78:58 - my name is pat
78:59 - my email is patco.org
79:02 - you can always personally email me as
79:03 - well
79:04 - um
79:05 - you are dismissed thank you
79:13 - one two three
79:17 - [Music]
79:39 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hmm um do uh bad foreign hmm so ladies and gentlemen the session will begin in five minutes thank you so hmm do so over the years i've come to realize how impactful and influential ai is as a technology and it's so important to understand the different ways in which that technology works to make it less intimidating to make it clear that it's a series of human decisions that we can control rather than um this futuristic scifi uncontrollable thing that is out of reach in terms of us being able to change where do you think you're going well i'm not going that way so i think that there's a lot of benefit there's a lot to gain from involving yourself and really understanding the details of how this technology works is something that will influence your life and the life of everyone that you love and the life of everyone around you and that's why i would encourage young people especially to even if they don't want to be an engineer and do it for the rest of their life uh to to really just properly engage in in getting an uh a sense or an understanding of the basics of what it means for uh the technology to work if you're someone that cares passionately about people and you have an interest in computer science the field definitely needs you there's so much that we can learn from you and learn from your empathy and learn from your attention to the experiences of other people we desperately need diverse perspectives in this field to shape a future vision for ai that is inclusive that is impactful in the right ways and is attentive to the concerns of those that are most vulnerable in our society i think that's it good morning everyone oh we can do better than that good morning i'm jackie smalls i'm the chief programs officer at code.org and i'm so excited to be here really it's kind of personal because when i joined code.org 18 months ago in march of 2020 it was announced that we were in a pandemic and the world shut down great time to start a new job right but there are many challenges but i just knew that there was challenges that i was facing was not like the challenges our teachers were facing so before we began today i really would like for everyone to join me if you could push away from your tables stand up i'm not going to make you do anything crazy i promise and let's really give the teachers and all the school systems a round of applause for all that they've done to make sure and keep standing because i also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone that made this happen for us this week hasn't it been great all right great great stretch break you may be seated thank you so much for that i'm also excited today because eight years ago i shared the stage with my friend and colleague steven pruitt i came on to the stage and it was my responsibility at the national teachers association conference to introduce steven as the keynote speaker and we were so excited when i looked out into the audience it was filled with teachers but not just filled with teach they were lined up on the walls they were in the aisles the room had reached capacity because that day stephen announced the release of the next generation science standards and so that was an amazing opportunity and here we are today to listen to the lessons learned from that process and how it might be applied to the cs movement so without further ado i'm going to ask stephen to introduce himself good morning oh very good it's so good so nor so i've been able to speak in public now a couple times since you know everything's shut down and normally i pretend i'm on mute for the first couple of sentences but since i'm having to wear the mask i couldn't do that because you wouldn't know what i was doing so yeah it's i think it's a protocol now so i'm stephen pruitt i am president of the southern regional education board um i guess it's sometimes i don't know that i need to say southern because as soon as you hear me talk you're kind of clear that um he's not from here um but uh we i'm president of the regional education board uh former commissioner of education for the commonwealth of kentucky uh i was the the lead for the development of the next generation science standards and most importantly i was a high school science teacher that was always my most important job but i've had a i've had a lot of luck and a lot of great opportunities in my life one of them was to work with this wonderful person to my right who she hates it when i bring this up but i'm going to anyway so jackie was in the army and chose to go work to teach elementary um and that's i mean and when i say she was in the army i mean she you know has a brilliant science and engineering mind and where most of us that have that kind of training go into high school she chose to go into elementary and i don't know about you but once they get under 14 they got to be somebody else's um because i i i can't do that so i always loved to brag on the fact that jackie had a mission and she worked on that and a lot of kids got a lot of benefit thank you so much for that all right well let's get started how about that so i have a bunch of questions but we really want this to be interactive you can ease drop in this conversation or you can participate so we would love for you to come up to the mic at any time not just wait until the end you know that awkward pause does anyone have any questions please come to the mics and we'll make sure that we recognize you during our conversation so the first question i have stephen in terms of you just spoke of the next generation science standards what a small project we worked on together small project what can we learn in the cs movement from that journey like what are the lessons so the journey i know you can go on and on for days about the journey but what about the lessons what would you have done differently well you know the i would say that the first thing that comes to mind is you need to recognize that any type of movement in education is going to take time um you know no great education idea ever died in the vision phase uh you know it always it's it's about implementation um and so you know when you go into this you have to know that this is not going no matter how dedicated how committed you are to a particular issue it takes time because you have to make a case you know i like to say that education is not rocket science because rocket science is actually easier um now given i'm a chemist so maybe i'm not the best person to make that comment but you know the point is you're dealing with human beings so it takes time to build that that understanding another lesson i would say is ownership um we uh one thing i think that we did a very good job of in that room that you talked about you know we had people stand up if they were part of a writing team if they were part of a review team if they were and at the end i mean there were there were about 5 000 people in that room and at the end more than 95 of the people in the room were standing because i can tell you that states do not like to have things put on them they want to feel that ownership and so finding a way to help people become what i call shareholders instead of stakeholders you know stakeholders kind of comes from that time of ringling brothers when somebody held a large stake while somebody else swung a really big hammer near their head a shareholder somebody that now owns it and they invest in it um and then i guess you know the thing that that you know i'm not sure completely what i would do different but i think there would be some things that we would push harder and one of the biggest ones is clarity around what the initiative is and how it fits into an overall educational scheme i think we did a pretty good job with that but the connector we didn't necessarily make as well as i thought we could have was around workforce um we'll talk a little bit more about that in a little bit but you know in the world of science and in the world of computer science there are people who don't know what those things are so you have to find a way to talk their language and help them see what you see but how it's in the context as a former commissioner of education i can tell you every day there was somebody that had something that i needed to do every day it was like oh you got to do this oh you got to do that and it becomes really kind of white noise and you end up making decisions based on you know your advisors or whatever the people that got to me the most were how the ones that could show me how what they were pushing fit into the overall educational context and i think computer science is a particular one there that that would be a good focus no questions yet don't be shy all right i have another question for you many states have adopted cs standards and we've been working towards ensuring cs is accessible to all students which comes with many challenges as we all know what should we consider as we reach the milestone of 51 of high schools now offer cs and we applauded that this this week but we still have a long way to go so what should we consider in the next mile well so there's a couple of things i think obviously the push to continue to offer the opportunity to be a part of computer science but i think you're going to have to make that case of why that's going to be important for that student's future and not just that they take a computer science class you know we'll we're going to be living in a world where if you don't understand the thinking involved around this you're not going to be a viable member of the economy so that would be one part but the other part that i would push already even in those 51 percent is equity and the equity here is this there there are lots of things listed on a course of study in schools across our country that doesn't mean students actually get to take them so one of the things that that i've pushed even in accountability is that we lessen the amount that we rely on statewide assessment and look more at what we're providing opportunities to do so example here would be if you offer computer science fourth period of course everybody knows fourth period is the longest period because that's lunch period but that's also the same time that you're offering remediation courses for students that need to be caught up because it's the longest period and you're offering band that same period because it's the longest because it takes them a while to get out to practice and you're offering ap courses that period you don't actually have opportunity to take the class or what i would think opportunity so one of the things that i would push for in the next mile is how many students are actually getting to take those courses are we giving that access to each student and not just you know and i'm very particular about saying all because all is a way to mask things but are our students of color students of poverty uh are are females being able to to be actually in those courses or is our master schedule actually prohibiting it so you brought it up so i'm going to continue with what you said about access and actual participation because we know that there's a difference so what do we need to do to close the gap that we know that exists in cs for black students young women hispanic students native students what do we really need to focus on to really close that gap well i i think that part of it is the folks that are making decisions about education in at the school and district level there have to broaden their perspective beyond math and literacy and we we tend to get very caught up in the accountability aspect of this and it's one of the reasons why i've been proponent of actually making those changes to accountability systems so that people i'm not saying math and literacy aren't important they obviously are but if we really want to educate a whole child to let them have access to what eventually will be our workforce part of that focus has to be re the recognition that while i'm trying to catch kids up those kids also deserve opportunities but when it comes specific to our students of color you know we have a little bit of a chicken and an egg issue here in that they aren't seeing people in the industry that look like them so we got to have very specific strategies on how we're recruiting starting in middle school students of color students of poverty into career pathways that are central around computer science cyber security i.t all so that eventually students it becomes just more normal that that i i say okay because i mean i think there's some truth in the fact that if i don't see anybody that looks like me doing it then i'm not supposed to do it so i think we've got to work on both levels we've got to work on the recruitment at the workforce level but we've got to increase the pipeline it's not a leaky pipeline there's no pipeline or there it's a trickle i guess but we've got to really do a better job of identifying and recruiting students at that middle school level just to make them aware of what's there you know i mean um the opportunities that students are afforded in the workforce of actually especially in a postcovered world of being able to work remotely that's going to be something that this generation of kids are going to like so we should promote that so i'm going to push on that a little bit because i could say for myself i didn't get support or see myself in a stem field until it came to college and i went to historical black college south carolina state university i know there's somebody from south carolina in here however what you said middle school and high school what about the k5 why don't we start at k5 because many of us that's what we're doing and actually we're focused on because we can see if we get them early and can see themselves early maybe they might stay and continue beyond high school because they think it's an opportunity so i absolutely think k5 should be engaged in work around computer science my comments were more around the fact that about middle school is when you start or when you should start exposing students to potential careers but why would i do something in middle school for a career of something that i've never had experience with before that so having students engage in that in elementary school is i think is a really important thing i think that to do that there's got to be an investment in our teachers though because and frankly an investment in the understanding of our administrators because again if i'm more worried about math and literacy i'm not having time for computer science science social studies and all of those things are actually important for a student to be a whole student that becomes a member of a society by which they can pursue their version of the american dream so having a k5 experience in uh in computer science that is able to be communicated to people who don't and again this kind of goes back to what i was saying earlier about communicating it to the general populace i think an unfortunate aspect at times in elementary school is parents look at what kids are doing with computer science as fun and not necessarily learning and i think we have to find a way to reposition that that they are yeah they're having fun but i mean let's face it in science i mean you know one of the reasons i decided to teach was because i could blow stuff up legally you know i mean you have fun but we've got to figure out how to communicate that to the parents there then when they get to middle school they're able to look back and go okay i've had a little experience with this coding thing and a little bit i understand about what this could be and then we can start to let them explore what careers are out there in middle school by the way you would have been a great elementary school teacher because the kids would have focused on your socks yeah i i you know my wife won't let me buy normal socks and it's partly because i'm colorblind so i really don't know what i have on right now and we could talk about why ngss are the colors yeah so we have victoria i think i don't have my glasses on but i think victoria has a question for us hi hi good morning thank you so much for being here you've mentioned really important shareholders in the education of our students you've mentioned teachers administrators parents how can we get school counselors on board especially in the middle and high school when a lot of times students have to go through them to figure out what classes should i take what can i take yeah that's that oh man that's a tough one yeah that's a tough one um you know the so i'll start with a more basic comment and then build it a little bit i hope one thing is we probably should start letting counselors be counselors and not test administrators in fact i'll never forget i was walking into the kentucky department of education and i'm seeing all these tweets from counselors saying they're at the state assessment conference like why in the world are all the dang counselors at this test conference so i walked in the room and and i knew a lot of them and i said why are y'all all here and they're like well we're the the building assessment coordinator i'm like okay i want all of you right now get out your phones hit a hit two and put your principal's name in there and say commissioner pruitt said i should not be here you can imagine the emails i got later but um but i think that's you know one thing is we need to give counselors the room to be counselors and not duties as assigned that's one another one is and i i've always been a little bit of a proponent of having additional support in schools either through community partnerships or through an actual fte employee that whose real focus it is is to connect students to careers especially in the immediate area but that are in high need um i mean so i have a degree in chemistry i know in general well a little more in general i know what chemists do but your average high school counselor probably couldn't really communicate that very well because they never did it and even as a chemistry major and with a chemistry degree i couldn't necessarily tell you all the stuff that's out there for industry to do because i was a teacher i didn't go into industry and then come come back so i think that it's somewhat of an unrealistic expectation to have to think that our counselors can automatically make that connection to workforce and to computer science so that means that we've got to do some investment in either extra people or helping them understand in the area that their school's in or as a country what our highest high needs sectors are and certainly computer sciences is that it's a tough nut to crack because let's face it the other again i keep going back to accountability a lot of our counselors are focused on how do i make sure kids get into courses that are going to meet graduation requirements and that are going to help our accountability scores and the first one i can get the second one yeah i think we got to do a better job and we have another question um over here i believe our friends from code crew that's correct uh good morning former commissioner and um and my name is maker egg i'm the executive director one of the founders of code crew which is based in memphis which is in your region and i am i'm actually asking this question because we've been very active in tennessee around computer science education policy um and i wanted to ask based on your experience as a former commissioner in kentucky our neighbor to the north um what would have been the most effective way to lobby or persuade uh you as a commissioner of education to increase access to computer science education uh as the commission of education and such as like high every high school offering computer science classes and other important initiatives that's a great question so i um you wouldn't have to do a lot for me to convince me of it so i'll tell you i'll tell you a little bit about what um what i think helped my colleagues uh who may not have had that i think the first thing the first advice i would give you is recognize the amount of um people who are trying to convince you to do something okay so what's going to distinguish your position over those that everybody else has i mean uh you know my good friend kirsten's here she'll tell you here this too i mean on a daily basis i'd get i'd get anywhere from 100 to 300 emails a day just to tell me hey you need to do x when i was doing the standards in georgia the science standards in georgia i had a lady i don't know what her name was to this day her name but i just called her the folic acid lady because she called me every friday morning at 10 o'clock to tell me how important folic acid was you know and i'm like yeah i get that folic acid is very important but what do you want me to do with that well i want it in the standards like well what do you want in the standards to say i understand the importance of folic acid you know and and i mean i'm saying it's partly because it's a little bit funny but partly because that is also very typical of what a commissioner deals with you have people that are coming with these dis with something they are very passionate about and it's possibly very important but it's disjointed from the bigger picture that i'm trying to create as a commissioner so in doing this my first suggestion would be connect it to something that they see as value and give them a path forward so you know one of the things that that you know i give hottie big props for with code.org was you know there was a time when everybody's like we got to make this a a graduation requirement we've got to make our graduation program we all everybody wants to make everything a graduation requirement you know in most schools you got you know you got 24 options because there's four there's six periods a day four years right you can't make everything a graduation requirement so you have to figure out how to get there and what heidi did really well was he started saying look let's just get it in schools to start with because at that time we didn't even have it in schools so what he and then of course now we're seeing where states are making a high school graduation requirement but what i think he did well was gave people a path forward so when you're doing your work with the commissioner it's how do you help move this you know so this is where i want to be but this is a path that you could go to get there then the last thing i would just share is you've got to talk about it in a language they understand and it's um i mean for me in kentucky you know especially in appalachia you know you the familial bond was so strong in eastern kentucky that a kid was would not leave eastern kentucky because of their family even if they could have a better life so one of the reasons why computer science became a big part for us too was that we could see how students could still continue to live with their family unit but be able to get a degree that would actually be able to make for a better economy so when you're talking to legislators policy makers they understand workforce they understand what it means to have a workforce but you've got to sometimes help connect those dots we have another question hello my name is becky muller and i'm a code.org facilitator csf and csd but i work at a stem school and we have adopted the ngss standards um as soon as they came out but colorado did it later on and but what i'm asking is can you kind of go back and tell me how did you put how where where was your concept of being able to include those engineering standards within ngss and and is there some way that we could attach some kind of computer science standards in the same way or through those crosscutting concepts as you introduce them to students yeah absolutely in fact i even said back when we were developing in gss if you don't do computer science within gss then you're actually not fully preparing students for 21st century so there's a practice you know of of computational thinking and and we were a little limited uh i mean i'm just going to be kind of blunt here um you know the ngss were developed based on the framework for k12 science education which came from the national academies and the decision was made at that committee that we would stay with the natural sciences so that's because we got a lot of push to to do computer science standards too and it just wasn't in the scope for us to do the standards for computer science and that so we tried to give entry points and i think that there's a couple i think that you know obviously the practice of computational thinking is there but the engineering standards are most definitely there but y'all the instructional part is wide open for computer science so i was actually sharing this with kirsten earlier when i was in kentucky we worked with collegeboard and code.org to take the computers ap computer science principles course and we offered it as a science course that a kid counts toward their graduation we train science teachers to teach it and in apcsp you know students do six to eight projects well what we did to justify it being a science was we said we trained the science teachers to help the students create those projects that prove they know science now they weren't doing a traditional science class they weren't standing at the board they weren't necessarily even doing labs in the traditional way but the stuff that came out of it was incredible i mean we had kids that were able to predict glacial movement that could predict weather because they were able to actually construct the computer modeling which by the way is another practice so the instruction was actually wide open and it fully aligned to ngss it fully aligned to csp but it was an instructional technique more so than a standards technique does that make sense yes it does thank you thank you welcome thank you for that i don't know if you recall stephen i know yes i'll make sure we'll get to the question i don't know if you recall but we had this one time when i said why do we have to label things life science earth science a student doesn't necessarily especially at elementary need to know that they're working in life science and that to me is speaks to the integration right because they're actually engaging in the content if they're using the science and engineering practices that's what we want students to do across all disciplines not just within science but in computer science and in ela so i just want to bring and we're going to get back to integration at k5 level yeah yeah because i would like to talk a little bit more about that because it it's uh yeah it can be an issue we'll talk about that hi good morning my name is dr marlo barnett and i am from chicago illinois so i have a question i wanted to go back to connecting the dots and so one thing the pandemic has brung out is the digital divide and so in connecting the dots how do you get your colleagues to understand that the digital divide has become greater and how computer science plays into that especially when we're talking about devices internet connectivity so how are you getting your colleagues to understand the bigger picture um and that all of this um is a part of affects and impacts computer science as well yeah you know i think we've got a great could y'all all hear the question okay i i i should have been asking that question all along um so i think that we've got a prime opportunity because that's because the digital divide has been on people's minds i mean i meet with the the chiefs in the south or the commissioners in the south i meet with you know i'm still connected with ccsso and i think there is a realization that the digital divide is a real thing what i'm not convinced of is that we have made the jump from the digital divide because we need to help students who are behind to actually this is a wave of comple of the future where we're going to have this recognition that the world will never go back to the way it was right and then i would actually go even one more step to say to recognize the digital divide is to also recognize the limitations placed on a student for their future um the the reality is that i that working in computer science is going to afford students greater autonomy and greater opportunity in that field exactly and that field is going to be at home they're not going to report to an office so you know there so there's a i think where everybody is is we realize there's a digital vibe i mean look you can have fiber running underneath your building in downtown atlanta but if i can't afford to get to that then it's just cable running underneath the building so i think there's the recognition of that part i think that people realize that the world is not going to go back and actually it affords us the opportunity to and much to the chagrin of children across the nation snow days may not be a thing in the future exactly and but i don't know that we've made the next jump to say we're going to have a remote environment for the most part so we might need to help make connect those dots yeah that's what needs to get out yeah thank you hi hi i'm samantha i'm a regional partner with iowa and my question is if you have any tips around the different aspects of computer science that are bubbling up now similar to science where there's life science and earth science and all of that we have ai and data science and cyber security and um i think we're starting to see some confusion at least in our area of where the focus should be and i think most of us know that that's all part of computer science but how do we have a clear messaging to our states our regions and our districts and how do we deal with that so you want to go ahead go ahead all right this may be a minute so here's the picture i want to lay out for you and this this goes to the connecting dots and it goes to your question sreb we we've done we've done several things over the last several years in 2016 under the leadership of governor hutchinson in arkansas we did a commission report on computer science and pathways in 2019 we released a report called unprepared and unaware and earned 2018 2019 we followed that up with an economic impact of what will happen and let me just give you the short story here this is obviously was prepandemic and what we found was that there are people who are currently in the workforce who you know they're they're they're owning their homes they're going on vacations with their family life is good they're making money these folks also have high school diplomas or less all right so ages 25 to 35 is who we looked at and what we found was the impact of artificial intelligence and automation on the workforce over the next 10 years would be significant enough that a large majority of the current workforce in the south would be impacted by automation nai so we further looked and said what are the ages of these people's kids and we found that that they actually would be graduating around 2030 well those kids are 10 times more likely to go into the same line of work and have the same level of education as their parents so we followed that up with this economic impact and what we found was in the south alone now i understand how we did we defined the south sreb is from delaware don't laugh delaware yes you cannot buy sweet tea in the restaurants in delaware but we love them anyway okay but from delaware down to florida over to texas back up to arkansas kentucky okay 18 million unemployable adults by 2030. now not unemployed unemployable which means they do not have the skill to be involved in an environment or in an economy where food service already in the south is roughly 67 percent automatable by 2030 100 is going to be automatable you can already go to wendy's in some parts of the country and order and a robot prepares the food and it kind of shoots out of a little vending machine kind of deal so you think about 18 million unemployables that doesn't count their kids who if we haven't done the work that they learn in stem won't be able to be a part of that so advanced manufacturing welding carpentry and building the things that we've traditionally thought of as as kind of blue collar you know working with your hands not anymore they're actually going to be done using computer science i walked into henry henderson county high school in kentucky and you know when the commissioner comes to visit you know what they do is they strap roller skates on the person and they drag them all over the building you know and i love that i always did it after legislative session because god knows i needed to be out of the capitol and with kids after the legislative session and so i walk in and and um they were like we got to get you to the welding lab i'm like okay so they took me a few places and they got me there and i walk in and the kid's like oh thank goodness you're here i got something to show you i'm like okay great he said come here and push this button i said dude i'm from the south you know how many jokes start that way i'm not pushing this button and so so he says no no this is going to be safe i said okay so i'll go over and i push the button and he had put he had made this design to cut my name into this giant piece of metal on a plasma welder okay so i'm standing there talking to this kid i'm like well tell me a little bit about because you know it didn't happen immediately you had to cut it i said tell well tell me a little bit about this he said well you know the first thing is you know i had to select a metal because i wanted this to be something you can keep a long time so i'm thinking okay science structure and properties of matter awesome he said you know what took probably the the longest though was to code the machine i'm like okay all right so tell me more about that and he starts telling me how he had to learn to write lines of code how he had to calculate the angles of the r and the circle in the middle of the r and all that and i'm like man i bet your math teacher loves you he said i hate math he said i'm not very good at it i'm like dude i like the word dude if you hadn't figured it out dude you just talked about trigonometry you actually said sign sin not sign okay he said yeah i just did what i had to do to make this piece relevance matters and so if we're going to actually do the things that you're talking about with we do have to recognize artificial intelligence automation are going to be a significant part of our workforce and that covet accelerated dependence on automation by five years so we're not looking at 2030 anymore we're looking at 2025. so hopefully that that answers your question i mean like i said i'm sorry you had to stand there for that long but i'm really passionate about this we are going to be as a country in a world of hurt by 2030 if we have not significantly changed how we're approaching k12 and postsecondary and adult ed to upskill our populace to be able to work in this environment in which computer science is a key part of that economy darcy you have a question yes thanks that's actually a perfect segue to my question too so hi i'm darcy i'm from sacred heart university the regional partner in connecticut and i want to go back also to the description that you had about um the course scheduling right that okay there's access but is there really if this is scheduled at the same time as that and you know i have a lot of compassion for principals who are dealing with the real world and these real choices that that are that students are faced with and that they have to organize around and so i'm wondering if you have any strategies or thoughts about kind of just broadly breaking through the log jam of this idea of a zerosum game right that more space is less space for someone else um some other area and thinking about you know creating those whole students um you know at the at the secondary level we see that with these course offerings at the elementary level that often comes down to this conversation about minutes of instruction time for one thing or another so i wanted to know if you had any thoughts about kind of working through that um and so for example in ngss my background is in science education as well you know i know that there was so much care and attention done to identifying those standards in literacy and mathematics that related to the next generation science standards and i wonder if you feel that that attention to the potential for working across areas has been reciprocated by those other content areas and if you were seeing some progress at breaking through the zerosum game and if there are lessons that we can learn for computer science from that great question um big question but great question um so i i guess let me start with your second question about have other content areas reciprocated not as much as i would have hoped you know that there's a people are scared of the unknown and teachers by nature want to be the expert in the room and and i get that i mean i was in that room i i get it um so to just kind of throw stuff out there and hope that it sticks won't work now i will tell you this i have seen incredible science education instruction in elementary and i've seen some really bad instruction in high school okay and here's why i think i think that from the day we started the framework and then once the we started in gss everybody was worried about those poor elementary teachers you remember hearing all that oh they don't know the content oh they don't know this i don't know what i tell you what they do know they know good instruction and they know how you can integrate things um not that they always do but that how they can and i saw some so the rule when i was commissioned was you had to take me to at least one nontested science class which freaked out the superintendents because they were sometimes they were like i'm not sure if we have any and so but i saw incredible stuff in elementary school because because as a state before i became commissioner they had invested lots of training on how to use math english and science together but then you go to high school and i'm a former high school teacher so nobody get offended i'm talking about my own people here you know we just know how to do it just ask us um and and i mean i you know i'll never forget this one teacher telling me how if we don't teach the four phases of mitosis and won't be prepared for college and a college professor sitting six feet from her said i wish i wouldn't even teach that because we usually have to fix it you know and so but there was not an investment in high school like there was in elementary because the assumption was they knew the content and the reality is and i think this is true in computer science it's not about just the content it's about the thinking that goes into the content and the thinking of how instruction has to be cultivated the second part of your ques or the first part of your question you know i think that there's a big part of this that industry partners have to play if you're going to find room in the curriculum for for computer science um bill even building career pathways that start in high school that have dual enrollment and all that kind of stuff is not enough if you don't have industry partners at the table that say we need these kinds of people okay or these trainings so having i mean georgia has just uh we've been working with them they've just finished a pathway on nursing and there's nursing pathways cross country but the reason i think this one's going to work is wellstar who's the biggest healthcare provider in georgia has guaranteed every kid that graduates at every level an interview well guess what they got kids that are taking those courses now and i think we've got to do a better job of of local districts and states finding ways to partner with industry to give a a reason for that because i the biggest problem i see with k12 is we still look at things as a course code and a course name and not what they can the full collection of knowledge needs to be back by 12th grade to be successful at the next level thank you and we have two other questions i think but i just want to add we're focusing so much right now on k12 but what about teacher preparation if we're not changing what teach how teachers are learning we're still doing the same thing that we've done years ago and still teaching teachers that teach the same way we're not going to see change in k12 oh that's absolutely true right that's absolutely true absolutely true but we'll go to the next question okay hi dr pereira i am sherry mcguffin i'm stem coordinator from advanced kentucky so thank you for your work in kentucky we appreciate it always good to see you kentucky absolutely and so what my question revolves around advanced placement ap computer science principles apcsa and what is potentially seen and sometimes seen as a conflict with the dual credit courses and that's been one of the issues that we've had in kentucky getting in computer science into some of those schools where it does not exist is that it is seen as a competition between dual credit and sometimes in that mentality dual credit and computer science don't coexist because teachers aren't seen as qualified enough to teach those so i would ask what your advice is to alleviate that idea of competition and how we can help it to be seen as something that works with dual credit rather than a competitor yeah so i you know i i think the first thing you've got to realize is it is a competition it's unfortunate but it is and i don't believe that education made it a competition i think that parents and communities sort of did the idea that i can go and take a dual credit course and immediately have credit on my transcript and not have to take a test i think had a big allure to people i my advice is and you know we tried to do this when i was in kentucky is to try to lower that temperature about around the competition in fact even allowing the ap courses to count as dual credit i think that it's a lot of it's a lot of work on the front end of case making especially to parents and to administrators because let's face it to them it's also easier because you know there's usually a little bit of money involved especially if it's being taught on campus there is a lot of um uh i think perception that it's a little bit easier to do a dual credit because you don't have to deal with test security you don't have to deal with the perception of having to stop dropping tests kind of deal so my advice to you would be show people how those two things coexist and not just that they can but that they probably should because there are some things that kids do get a better benefit out of taking dual enrollment because ap doesn't offer it but there are also things that especially i mean you know we have one state in the south that has started requiring the ap test at the end of dual enrollment courses if there's a a match to verify that the dual enrollment course was actually at an appropriate level because there's people at the policy making level that are skeptical of dual enrollment too um but i think that making that case i mean i had parents when i was in kentucky that would come up because i you know i i'm a former ap teacher um and i had kids that would go down the road and take chemistry even for my first year class not even counting my ap class because they knew they had a better chance of getting a higher grade in there than they did in my class well they could make a high grade in my class but they have to work for it and um i'd have parents come up and say well why in the world would i do that when i can just go take that class why would i want them to take that test and i think we've got to figure out how as a school in your case as a school to communicate to the community how those things fit together and work together i don't know where it is now but you know one of the things that we worked on when i was in kentucky was a career pathway in computer science that included ap and dual enrollment so that there's actually a model there assuming it's still there that you can actually show to parents and say look there's value here for both of these and then you got to make that case thank you you're welcome and you know the cats are playing ut this weekend um i don't know where my tennessee guy went but there he is so um we have another question tuesday yep hi good morning uh thank you for all your work and i just want to say thank you for acknowledging that teachers bring so many strengths to the table and that we need to build off of those strengths and not just consider the deficit model my name is lee and eliza i'm the executive director at cs for all and we've been talking a lot about what schools and states can do but i want to shift the focus a little bit in the other direction we know that we have a local control country with regionality around state policy for education but in what ways can the federal government think about empowering accelerating supporting the great work that our states do and getting out of their way we just did a report on ai and data science education with ostp and the department of labor how did you see in the science education work the federal government could be supportive in the national policies they're allowed to enact not requirements but supportive policies to make the work go faster so um you're probably not going to like this answer i did everything i could to keep the federal government out of anything with science you might remember that when we were doing the science standards there was this little kerfuffle going on around math and english called common core um i wasn't going to say their name but yeah and and so i mean i would beg the department do not say the word science i mean i mean i literally remember having a nightmare of watching of me watching the presidential debate and seeing the ngss brought up on the on a debate stage i mean it was and i guess that was one of the nice things you know it was nice to be the second group that walked through the minefield you know um i mean at the end of the day i don't regardless of politics i don't think states like being told what to do by the federal government and and look i i mean i as commissioner i was an equal opportunity offender i had my fights with with both administrations because if i thought they were wrong i told them sometimes more loudly than i needed to but you're seeing things like ies money yeah there are many people here who have received scaleup grants from the institute for education sciences you spoke about bringing industry partners to the table labor is a very good way so i'm not talking about like putting a flag in the ground or somehow enacting policies around the politics but using and leveraging their particular network i totally get it that what i was telling you is kind of the preamble yeah okay i i think that you've got to when you're taught i mean the thing is when you go in and you have cs for all on your business card and you're trying to get them and you're talking to them about industry partners they've looked at your card and said cs for all okay so you need to develop very deliberate messages of things that obviously support cs but don't necessarily make that the primary because because one good way to kill things in a lot of states is you know i mean look my number one job at ng for ngss was to make sure nobody said no right away i mean they said no later that's fine but you know i i wasn't but i didn't want them to dismiss it out of hand immediately so knowing full well what is in ice ies grants what are in uh i mean there are i mean snap grants you know have opportunity for upskilling adults in computer science um in fact a lot of people don't even realize if you write your your program the right way while you're up skilling those those uh adults snap grant will pay for meals for the students for their kids while they're getting trained i mean there's ways to do that so i think that the lever to pull is being fully aware of what's offered by the federal government in terms of funding and having a message is deliberate that allows the federal government to give options for use of that money but without having the federal government say you need to go do it for this reason does that make sense a lot yes and i think i love that advice and i think that's probably super useful for all of our state leaders too so thank you you're welcome so it looks like we're bringing the planet plane in for a landing and i have one more question to close with and you were worried we didn't have enough questions great participation on a friday right all right so let's talk about gender parity currently women obtain more than half of u.s undergraduate degrees in biology 60 chemistry and mathematics yet only earn about 20 percent of computer science undergraduate degrees the gender parity in biochem and mathematics wasn't the case just a couple of days decades ago what do you think this is why do you think this is and what changed in k12 to help us usher these changes and what can we learn from that movement for cs so it's a i think there's a lot of there's a couple reasons there's some that maybe would be more valid in terms of research and then there are some that i just think um i think that we have seen especially more females in the areas of biology chemistry and physics because those have been promoted better the part that's probably less rooted in in research is the people who are usually the decision makers in college are biology chemistry and physics people um you know a lot of your provosts are physicists uh you've got a lot of that but also it's what gets taught in school so earth science is still not taught in high school you know why would it be i mean you know we only live here um you know but but for the most part we we finished teaching um earth science in eighth grade well you know i think the same parallel could be made with computer science if if there's not an attention to it in k12 um we're not going to be able to feed the pipeline into more people taking those courses and subsequently becoming employed um so you know i mean and and i think it's just i mean we were laughing about this earlier you know if you watch the big bang theory they make fun of the poor earth science guy all the time and and unfortunately it's kind of it's satirical i mean it is there's some truth to that now the people that are they're doing chemistry physics and biology are great people too don't get me wrong i got a really good friend back there somewhere gay that's a great physicist um but i do think that when we start to shortchange students um uh experience in k12 there's no way to think that they're going to get to college and just somehow miraculously find this so things like earth and things specifically like computer science we've got to do a better job of and i think we've done that with biology chemistry and physics and that's and and i think we've worked to lift the stigma of that girls can't do science but when you define science as only biology chemistry and physics that's where we see the increase well i think we've come to our time to end the session so can you please join me in thanking stephen for being with us today well i'll say one last thing you know if we don't get our act together then all the opportunity we have will just go up in flames [Laughter] well here you go thank you so much thank you i'll give you honey thank you thank you guys thanks pat well that's exactly what i uh was hoping that we'd get folks um i've been following uh what stephen pruitt has been doing for many years now i remember when actually some of the advocates in this room uh were reaching out to the science community during the time of the development of the framework and the ngss we're wondering hey where does computer science fit in folks and what we heard back and you know stephen would say this as well in fact he might have already mentioned it that they were kind of handcuffed by the framework given to them in the development of the standards and then he did allude to certain things that were included things like computational thinking computer modeling etc what i hope to understand from stephen was how we can learn lessons from the science movement even though the you know the science world is still struggling to include signs in all elementary schools but how we can learn from them rather than just repeat maybe the same mistakes so again thank you jackie thank you steven let's give them another round of applause if i can get the slides showing please so i wanted to uh be open with you guys about something i taught computer science at the high school level actually i was a high school computer science teacher as well and then i switched to computer science taught computer science for a number of years now i've been at code.org for eight and a half nine years now so probably been in the computer science game for 15 to 20 years now and much of the conversation has been around the capacity of the system now we have about 33 states with computer science state supervisors when just five years ago it was basically a couple people in anthony owen um and now even arkansas has like eight to ten uh state specialists focused on computer science but we've been talking about capacity for a long time we've been talking about just access for a long time like just just getting it on the menu and steve talked about that just just schools just put it on the menu kids will take it and we're seeing that we've been talking about participation how can we just get you know representational participation i'm so eager so eager one day that the discussion around computer science will be about the experience that kids are having now i know that we do i know that we do talk about that and there is some research around that experience but i i look for i look forward to the day when the majority of the conversation is around the experience that all of our students are having that cs4 is not about necessarily just all schools offering it or all students represented but all students having an amazing time and learning a lot and doing something with it so i know we're on the the edge of that now folks and that's why the state of cs report was all about accelerating action we're there we are really close there are states right now that are basically our lighthouse states our successes they're still early on but you know what we're at a point where we can really say doing this or doing that really does change the game right now they're you know i think nationally the the percent of women in computer sciences in at the high school level is something like 30ish percent maybe i mean that's still far away from the 50 percent we're looking for but there are states where it's like 46 48 at the high school level that's amazing so this can be done and i look forward to the time when all of us are gathering together maybe next year maybe the next year after that and much of our conversations around the experience of students so how do we get there well like i told you before when i uh was talking on uh wednesday this cut this conference has been designed around engagement and interaction and i so appreciate jackie calling you up to ask questions during the presentation during the uh during the conversation in the same way we've set aside time for you all to have strategy sessions from 10 30 to 11 30. now if you don't have a date or a plan during that time after i finish talking i want you to make a plan some of you are from california say woo a lot of you all are from california right you're going to have a specific state session just for california following this uh presentation during this time if you're not from california you can go to your regional room and have a conversation around a table or two and just bring people together uh alternatively maybe there aren't that actually many people from your state here and maybe you just want to meet with people from another state because you heard about their successes and you just want to replicate them you want to ask questions you want to you know learn the lessons that they learned and not make the same missteps maybe that uh they share so you can meet with another state in that regional room you can also meet with a speaker or other cs edcon participant remember you have a a link to everyone who agreed to share their contact information that was emailed to you this monday it's towards the bottom of the email in case you missed it and feel free to reach out to those folks and just ask them hey can i you know while we're here at the conference can we just talk about x y or z maybe there was a speaker that you just wanted to talk a little bit uh more to and uh you could also meet with a code.org regional partner code or regional partners if you could stand up so these are these regional organizations are doing a lot of the legwork the groundwork in their regions if you're a district in their region certainly you can talk to them to find out more about what they're doing in the region to support you uh additionally you can meet with some of the state cs supervisors i mentioned them if they could stand up we can give them a round of applause you could also meet up with some of your state computer science supervisors to understand what's happening statewide and be part of the statewide movement lastly feedback uh imagine that that y is next to the e uh so go ahead and take out your your computing device your uh your your phone or your laptop or your tablet do you know why cs edcon is the way it is this year we did a number of things different compared to 2019. for example rather than state networking we did regional networking rather than just one reception we included a happy hour as well you know we do these things based off of feedback so if you at any moment during this conference thought you know what they could have probably done this or that better unfortunately i can't read minds so please type in this link bit.li cs edcon 2021 survey it probably takes about five minutes four to five minutes sorry gotcha jackie will take care of it yeah and hopefully that link is not to the actual uh the editable form it's to the the view form it says view okay you know sometimes when you uh do these forms they have that default where it's like locked to just the organizational users yeah anyway um thank you for trying you'll you'll just refresh when jackie gives me the thumbs up yeah it's working now oh jackie thank you um yeah go ahead and refresh again we really appreciate your feedback we do intend on doing cs edcon again and so we want to use your feedback to make it even better for you did you like the whole concierge experience where folks like emailed you and tried to connect you with other people do you want more of that do you do you like the food did you not like the food do you wish there was this do you wish there was that uh do we do you wish that a certain topic was was covered go ahead and uh provide that feedback again we're going to use it again thank you on behalf of the conference team we're going to be moving to strategy sessions now uh starting at 10 30 to 11 30 and 11 30 we'll be back here for just some quick words and um and lunch if you do have to leave early at 11 30 and you can't just sit through lunch we're actually gonna have some box lunches that you can just grab and take on the way to the airport that was based off of feedback as well so again thank you on behalf of the conference team my name is pat my email is patco.org you can always personally email me as well um you are dismissed thank you one two three you
