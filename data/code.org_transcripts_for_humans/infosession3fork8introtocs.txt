00:00 - hi everyone we are here for our third
00:04 - info session on code orgs intro to
00:06 - computer science course thanks for
00:08 - joining us again we really appreciate
00:09 - you coming to take your time and
00:11 - learning more about our course so my
00:15 - name is Katie apone and I'm the K
00:17 - through 8 program manager here at
00:19 - code.org and also today with me we have
00:22 - Roxanne she does our social media and we
00:27 - have known who is one of our engineers
00:30 - who has worked on blockley and worked
00:32 - extensively on this K through H intro to
00:36 - computer science course so today is the
00:40 - third session and we'll be covering the
00:43 - teacher dashboard support for teachers
00:45 - and any kind of miscellaneous questions
00:47 - you haven't had answered over these past
00:50 - three sessions so please keep asking
00:52 - questions and we'll get to them when we
00:54 - can so the first session covered the
01:00 - unplugged activities and the second
01:02 - session covered the blockley puzzles so
01:05 - if you have questions about those feel
01:07 - free to go and watch those sessions that
01:10 - are on our Google+ page and they're also
01:12 - listed on our website I definitely
01:17 - encourage everyone to watch the first
01:19 - session especially on the unplugged
01:21 - lessons because it might be easy to skip
01:24 - over the unplug lessons while following
01:26 - through the course but I think it's a
01:27 - great chance for your kids to get some
01:29 - hands-on experience and really work with
01:32 - others on computer science concepts so I
01:35 - highly recommend going and watching
01:38 - about the unplugged activities and
01:39 - seeing how they play out in your
01:41 - classroom they're really fun with
01:42 - students also we will be giving away a
01:46 - fifty dollars donor choose gift card to
01:49 - one US public school teacher who asks
01:53 - questions during these sessions so if we
01:55 - get your questions and questions in and
01:57 - we'll contact one teacher after these
02:00 - sessions are finished so why don't we
02:05 - just dive right into some logistics of
02:08 - the online setup of our learning
02:10 - platform
02:12 - we can look at some of the different
02:14 - links fair so I'm going to start a
02:17 - screen share so we can see what it looks
02:21 - like the first page that I have pulled
02:33 - up here is just code org slash educate /
02:37 - 20 hour 20 HR so it's on our website and
02:43 - it has a overview of the 20-hour course
02:47 - it has a link directly to teacher
02:49 - signups it tells you how to get started
02:52 - it has info about these info sessions it
02:57 - has information about some of our
02:59 - classroom rewards and it goes into
03:03 - overviews of this course tells you
03:06 - what's in this course and it gives you
03:11 - some information about how to prep for
03:13 - the course and during the lessons what
03:15 - you can do during the lessons and it
03:17 - also mentions that it's one hundred
03:19 - percent free who are non-profit so we
03:21 - want to make sure that all of our
03:22 - materials are spread around and used
03:27 - widely by teachers and they also we also
03:31 - have links to our forums here so you can
03:34 - ask questions on our forum and you can
03:37 - also give us feedback or suggestions
03:40 - rather so you can find a lot of great
03:44 - information here and let's look at to
03:49 - the teacher sign up so there are a
03:53 - couple different ways you can sign up as
03:54 - a teacher you just go to code org you
03:57 - can hit the sign in button
04:01 - well tells me I'm already signed in but
04:06 - it would normally take you to the signup
04:11 - page or the sign in page and it says on
04:14 - the right if you haven't joined yet sign
04:16 - up so this is how you would sign up as a
04:18 - teacher and then you can click this are
04:22 - you a teacher button when you come to
04:24 - this sign up page
04:29 - another way to sign up a tu as a teacher
04:31 - if is if you go to learn code org
04:35 - there's some sign-in options right under
04:38 - the banner it says so you can sign up as
04:39 - a student or sign up as a teacher so
04:44 - once you're signed up as a teacher
04:46 - you'll wanted to sign up your students
04:48 - so if your students have email addresses
04:52 - they can sign up here which is the sign
04:56 - sign up page we just saw so you can fill
05:00 - out information and sign up as a student
05:04 - with an email address
05:08 - oh I change I wanted what's rejected all
05:12 - right so let's also take a look at a
05:19 - different way to sign up as a student
05:20 - which is through the join link so
05:24 - students don't need an email for this
05:26 - option and to do that you'll sign in to
05:30 - your teacher account and you'll want to
05:33 - head to starting switching tabs around
05:36 - your lap you'll want so when your sign
05:38 - in to your teacher account you want to
05:39 - head to manage sections
05:45 - well sign in so under manage sexings you
05:48 - can add a section so say I wanted to add
05:50 - my fourth-grade classroom as a section
05:56 - and i will say create section so here
06:02 - under section it says fourth-grade
06:04 - classroom and it says add students using
06:07 - section code so this is the section code
06:11 - for this classroom I'm going to copy
06:13 - this it's just a six letter code so then
06:18 - when my students come into class they
06:21 - can go to you'll have them head to code
06:24 - org slash join so for students to sign
06:33 - up without an email they'll come to code
06:35 - or flash join and you can write your
06:39 - section code up on the board and you can
06:42 - have them enter it they'll press GO
06:47 - and then they'll actually fill out
06:51 - another page that says sign up as it
06:58 - asks you for a username and a password
07:00 - and I think that's about it sorry I was
07:04 - signed in when I did that so let me just
07:06 - do that again just to look at what we
07:11 - would fill out okay so it says register
07:16 - to join the class fourth grade classroom
07:18 - taught by meet Katie apone so your
07:20 - students can enter their full name Katie
07:24 - apone this is the spot for their
07:27 - username so they'll enter a username
07:29 - there they'll pick a password and then
07:32 - they can enter if they're male or female
07:34 - if they want and then they can into
07:36 - their birthday if they like um the
07:39 - reason we ask we just asked for a couple
07:43 - of bits of information if you are
07:45 - interested in getting some of the donor
07:48 - choose classroom rewards make sure that
07:50 - your students fill out this gender field
07:52 - that's important so then as a teacher I
07:58 - can look at all the information for the
08:01 - students that are associated with me so
08:03 - I can head to the manage students link
08:07 - and sorry about all this sign in/sign
08:12 - out issues so I can go to my manage
08:15 - students link and I can see all of the
08:18 - all these are all of my students so the
08:21 - students that have you that have become
08:25 - my students using the join code the the
08:29 - option to use without an email I can i
08:32 - can click on this edit password so i can
08:35 - edit their password if they joined using
08:38 - that join code if they signed up using
08:42 - an email address i can't edit their
08:44 - password for them and it will tell me
08:47 - which section there in if i wanted to
08:49 - move them to a different section i could
08:52 - click on their name and say move this
08:55 - student to a fourth grade classroom
08:58 - and it will sign them to that section if
09:02 - we head over to the progress dashboard
09:06 - we can see these are the trophies that
09:11 - the students have collected so we can
09:16 - see that laura has won the silver trophy
09:19 - and the sequence concept Laura's won the
09:22 - bronze trophy in the if concept and
09:24 - these are the puzzle she has completed
09:28 - so you can see the level key up here the
09:32 - the green checkmark means it's completed
09:35 - and using the optimal number of blocks
09:37 - and this kind of lighter green is that
09:43 - they completed it but they used too many
09:46 - blocks and the purple means that they
09:50 - try the puzzle but they have not
09:52 - completed it yet and the white means
09:54 - that they haven't tried it yet so we can
09:57 - use the scroll bar at the bottom to see
10:03 - all of the puzzles for the students um
10:11 - one other thing that I wanted to mention
10:13 - about the teacher dashboard is that we
10:18 - have a solutions link that people have
10:22 - been asking about it's been broken for a
10:25 - while but it should be fixed pretty soon
10:28 - so
10:34 - when you're in your teacher account when
10:37 - you look at a puzzle down here it says
10:39 - see the solution and I'm not sure if
10:42 - this one will work but it should be
10:44 - working soon and we have a question here
10:48 - um the question says how many sections
10:52 - can one teacher have i'm pretty sure
10:56 - that you can have almost an unlimited
11:00 - number of sections I'm there's there's
11:03 - not a limit that I know of so you should
11:06 - feel free to keep creating sections
11:09 - great thank you for the questions so one
11:16 - other thing I wanted to mention that
11:17 - we're about to add to the teacher
11:18 - dashboard is a certificate for the
11:21 - 20-hour course currently when you end
11:23 - the 20-hour course there's not the
11:26 - appropriate amount of congratulations
11:28 - but we're working on fixing that so soon
11:31 - we will have a certificate like you
11:33 - might have seen the certificate for the
11:34 - hour of code we will have a
11:37 - congratulations you completed your
11:39 - twenty our certificate and you'll be
11:41 - able to print that from the teacher
11:43 - dashboard so that should be available in
11:44 - the future as well um I'd like to talk a
11:48 - little bit about I'm going to stop my
11:50 - screen share here I'd like to talk a
11:53 - little bit about problem solving for
11:57 - teachers so also in the Q&A app if you
12:02 - want to just add suggestions to anything
12:03 - I'm talking about that would be great so
12:06 - if you're using this in your classroom
12:08 - you come across things that worked well
12:09 - kind of put your comments in the Q&A app
12:12 - and other people can read them and I'll
12:14 - comment on them as necessary um so
12:18 - problem solving for teachers let's see
12:23 - really in in a computer science
12:27 - classroom a teachers there to facilitate
12:30 - student discovery it's not always that
12:33 - you have to be the expert in the room
12:35 - it's about helping students take a step
12:41 - back and breaking down problems in two
12:44 - parts so you can help them identify
12:47 - where when the problem of the program
12:50 - like isn't working right and then you
12:52 - can like help them identify how to solve
12:57 - their problem so that's a much it takes
13:01 - a little pressure off the teacher being
13:02 - the expert in the room so it's it's
13:05 - taking some that pressure off you and
13:07 - it's it's kind of it's fostering a
13:09 - community of learners rather than the
13:11 - teacher having all the information let's
13:18 - see also on our on our forum so forums
13:26 - code org there in the eighth grade
13:28 - curriculum section we have an FAQ that
13:32 - you can have some of your frequently
13:34 - answered questions taken care of and we
13:38 - would love that forum to become a space
13:40 - for educators to come and discuss things
13:43 - with other educators so if you have
13:45 - something that you're struggling with in
13:47 - your classroom you can come and post a
13:50 - thread and maybe someone else will
13:52 - answer it with suggestions they had in
13:54 - their classroom there are over 10,000
13:57 - teachers signed up to do this course and
13:59 - I think utilizing that forum would be a
14:02 - really powerful tool to see how other
14:05 - people are using it in their classrooms
14:06 - and get support from people who are
14:08 - doing it out in the field another way
14:12 - you could find educators locally you
14:17 - could ask your district to send out an
14:20 - email to all the teachers in the
14:21 - district to see if there are other
14:23 - people teaching this course it might
14:26 - even spur some people to want to try and
14:28 - teach the course I think it's great to
14:30 - have in person connections and people
14:32 - who are in your community that might
14:34 - know more about you or about your school
14:36 - about your
14:36 - students to really collaborate with on I
14:39 - think that's a really powerful thing so
14:41 - just going out and finding who's already
14:44 - teaching us or who might want to teach
14:45 - this and having them as a place to
14:50 - bounce ideas off of or get support from
14:52 - would be great we have another question
14:59 - says I finished all 27 badges and tried
15:03 - to redeem my game the code was expired
15:06 - what should I do um I would say you
15:12 - should probably post something on the
15:16 - forum or email help at code.org if
15:22 - that's an issue that might be an issue
15:25 - with the code the game code um yeah and
15:37 - another question me says are you trying
15:41 - to put this in all schools that's not
15:47 - our goal we would love to see computer
15:50 - science in more schools and it's fine if
15:53 - schools want to use our course but there
15:57 - are there are plenty of other great
15:58 - courses out there so we have more
16:01 - offerings on our website from
16:03 - third-party resources so if you go to
16:05 - code org slash learn / beyond there are
16:11 - also other computer science offerings
16:13 - that would be great choices for schools
16:19 - great and we have an another question
16:23 - that says what do i do if my all my
16:26 - students finish the course but I don't
16:29 - get my prize from donors cheese so we do
16:32 - have classroom rewards currently that
16:36 - the first 1,000 teachers who
16:40 - successfully need the 15 students
16:42 - through this course will get a thousand
16:47 - dollars and donor choose gift cards
16:50 - so the way it works is that 15 of your
16:55 - students have to receive all 27 concept
16:59 - trophies and then you'll be emailed a
17:02 - code that you can redeem at DonorsChoose
17:06 - and the question said what do you do if
17:11 - all your students finish the course but
17:13 - you don't get your prize that's that's a
17:17 - tough one because the cases are so
17:20 - specialized I would be sure that all of
17:24 - your students have successfully gotten
17:26 - all 27 trophies you can check that for
17:29 - your progress dashboard making sure they
17:30 - have gold trophies next to all of their
17:32 - names and if you're looking for the
17:35 - extra two hundred and fifty dollar bonus
17:38 - for having seven of those students be
17:41 - female me users have to have selected
17:46 - female when they sign up or before they
17:51 - complete the 27 concept trophies so you
17:55 - have to make sure that their account
17:56 - says that they're female to receive that
17:59 - extra two hundred fifty dollars great we
18:05 - have another question that says if
18:06 - students forget their username how can I
18:09 - help them log in that is a good question
18:14 - if you go to your progress dashboard I'm
18:19 - just going to look at mine quickly here
18:21 - if you go to your progress dashboard and
18:24 - same manage students you can click on
18:28 - the student's name and then if you
18:31 - scroll all the way down to the bottom it
18:34 - says there's some different fields at
18:38 - the bottom and one of them says username
18:40 - so that's how you would find out their
18:43 - username
18:53 - another question great this question
18:57 - says do you have any plans to include
18:59 - any video clips for teachers showing
19:02 - them a peek inside a classroom where one
19:04 - of the coding lessons is going on this
19:05 - might be a good way to show teachers
19:07 - they do not have to be the expert that
19:09 - is a great idea we have definitely
19:12 - thought about that in the past and we
19:15 - could definitely implement that going
19:17 - forward I think it's a great resource
19:19 - for especially new teachers who are new
19:22 - to computer science to be able to see
19:24 - that see see it happening in the
19:27 - classroom and see how it really unfolds
19:29 - ouch out in the field that's great to
19:34 - know that other educators are looking
19:35 - for that as well so we will we will try
19:37 - and include that in future offerings I
19:39 - will make think about that right now
19:42 - great so
19:49 - there are just a couple other things I
19:51 - wanted to mention about support for
19:56 - using the 20-hour course or using any
19:59 - new computer science education materials
20:02 - it's possible that some of your students
20:05 - parents might work in software or might
20:08 - have knowledge about computer science
20:11 - it's possible to ask them for help on
20:13 - the technical side of questions while
20:15 - you provide the educational side of
20:20 - computer science education
20:23 - because someone might have technical
20:26 - expertise in the area but you as the
20:29 - classroom teacher and use the educator
20:31 - know what's right for your classroom and
20:32 - what works well and why so I would
20:35 - definitely take whatever advice a you
20:40 - might get from a professional software
20:42 - expert or someone who has background in
20:44 - the field I would definitely take that
20:45 - and adapt it to your classrooms needs
20:51 - great we have another question that says
20:54 - I notice that your website has arabic
20:57 - language do the PDF files translate to
20:59 - Arabic as well currently they do not so
21:07 - we might include that in the future it's
21:11 - something we'd like to do because we
21:12 - would love for students who no other
21:17 - languages to be able to use it as well
21:18 - currently we don't but that is something
21:21 - we might do in the future we have
21:27 - another question it says is there a
21:28 - reason my teachers and need to be public
21:31 - school teachers in order to receive the
21:33 - awards I'm a private school teacher just
21:34 - inquiring thanks so the way we do our
21:37 - educator processes is through
21:40 - donorschoose and they require that
21:44 - teachers the US public school teachers
21:47 - so that's just kind of the way that
21:49 - we've decided to do our teacher prizes
21:52 - and also co dot orgs mission as a
21:55 - non-profit is to help bring science
21:58 - computer science education to K through
22:01 - 12 US public schools so that as the
22:05 - mission of our nonprofit is what we
22:09 - decided to give rewards for but
22:11 - obviously we're still giving our
22:13 - curriculum and our advice and lots of
22:17 - our other materials for free for
22:18 - everybody so we hope that everybody uses
22:21 - them but we can only give rewards to so
22:23 - many people great and Roxanne would like
22:27 - to absurd to add a little more detail
22:29 - and from working with donors shoes I
22:31 - know the reason why they only work with
22:33 - public schools is because the process to
22:36 - bear
22:37 - by a school is much easier you know I
22:40 - think they would love to have the
22:42 - infrastructure to work with all schools
22:44 - but the reason that we have decided to
22:46 - work with them is you know when anyone's
22:49 - doing this curriculum we want to verify
22:50 - that they are indeed a teacher at a
22:53 - school in the u.s. to give them a prize
22:56 - not like a fraudulent account or someone
22:59 - else so um that's what we're doing now
23:02 - but we definitely more prizes to come
23:04 - cool Thank You Robin and we have another
23:09 - question great i love all these
23:11 - questions coming in this one says can
23:16 - you give a working definition of
23:18 - computer science i am a media teacher
23:20 - awesome that you're teaching consider
23:23 - yeah thank you for thanks for being
23:25 - interested in computer science a great
23:26 - start so in the PDF for the first
23:39 - unplugged lesson there is a definition
23:43 - of computer science the interesting
23:46 - thing about the field of computer
23:49 - science is that there is no there's not
23:54 - a definition that is widely accepted as
23:59 - the definition of computer science so
24:04 - the one that we provide in our unplugged
24:08 - activity that introduces computer
24:12 - science to students the definition says
24:14 - the art of blending human ideas and
24:17 - digital tools to increase
24:20 - problem-solving power so that's that's a
24:24 - small definition you could probably ask
24:26 - 10 different computer scientists and get
24:28 - 10 different answers so I know that's um
24:31 - a tough answer but I hope that helps
24:39 - your bottom
24:41 - oh great we have another question that
24:45 - says will you do other stuff besides
24:47 - games um I'm not exactly sure what's
24:51 - meant by games so I'm assuming you mean
24:56 - the the blockley puzzles so we will be
25:00 - offering other environments in the
25:07 - future so there there will be other
25:12 - things we do we do like to present
25:14 - things in a fun and engaging manner so
25:18 - I'm not sure if that's what you mean by
25:20 - games but
25:23 - we will have different offerings in the
25:25 - future some of them will be more geared
25:30 - towards math and science and what you
25:33 - might think of more as in a traditional
25:37 - classroom but they'll still be fun and
25:40 - engaging so yep great keep the questions
25:46 - coming if you'd like um I will just
25:48 - continue a little more with if people
25:50 - are looking for more support while
25:54 - they're teaching their 20 outward course
25:57 - so we talked to earlier about kind of
26:01 - creating a community of learners in that
26:04 - the teacher doesn't have to be the
26:05 - expert in the room in this scenario and
26:08 - it's interesting because here at the
26:10 - code org office we have a lot of
26:14 - different kind of computer programmers
26:17 - working for us and two with varying
26:21 - experience some of them have years of
26:22 - experience that big companies years of
26:25 - experience with successful startups and
26:27 - some programmers are straight out of
26:29 - college and it's interesting because
26:33 - there are there are days that the
26:37 - seasoned computer programmer with 20
26:41 - years of experience will ask advice from
26:44 - the programmer who's just gotten out of
26:47 - college it's there's there's so many
26:51 - things to know in the field of computer
26:53 - science you can't know them all so it's
26:55 - it's really great if you start off with
26:58 - the attitude of saying it's okay that I
27:01 - don't know everything and I'm I'm okay
27:04 - with saying i don't know let's figure it
27:06 - out together so also let's see what else
27:16 - can we talk about um strategies that
27:19 - might help your students work through
27:21 - tough spots so some teachers like to use
27:25 - the rule not for kind of rule of thumb
27:29 - that says ask three and then me which
27:32 - means
27:33 - if a student is struggling with it a
27:35 - problem they'll ask three of their
27:37 - neighbors before they'll ask the
27:39 - classroom teacher so this fosters a lot
27:42 - of students working together and it also
27:47 - reduces the stress of students asking
27:49 - you for the the first question every
27:51 - single time because students are bound
27:53 - to have similar questions so once one
27:55 - student figures it out they can share
27:58 - with their neighbor and work
28:00 - collaboratively in that way let's see do
28:13 - we have any more questions to look at
28:15 - yes rayos we also have a question that
28:20 - says for the unplugged computational
28:22 - thinking lessons do students need the
28:24 - copies of the monster catalog that have
28:27 - a line on this line sheets should they
28:30 - be on overhead transparency sheets so
28:35 - let me just pull up that lesson just to
28:39 - make sure that we're all looking at the
28:47 - same thing so I have my computational
28:58 - thinking PDF open here
29:02 - and it says do students need the copies
29:07 - of the monster catalog
29:10 - so so for this activity I think this is
29:17 - good for this activity if you're working
29:20 - with groups of students I would each i
29:22 - would give each group of student a
29:25 - catalog and you they can be printed on
29:30 - transparencies or you can have them put
29:35 - tracing paper over each of the monster
29:39 - features so they can pick and choose
29:42 - which monster feature they want because
29:46 - printing on transparency isn't that easy
29:48 - so you can have them put in on tracing
29:51 - paper but yes i would give each student
29:53 - or each group of students a monster
29:56 - catalog definitely we have another
30:00 - question that says says so this course
30:03 - is about how to teach computer science
30:06 - it's not about how to use a computer yes
30:10 - so this is about teaching computer
30:13 - science rather than using a computer or
30:18 - a technology course so a technology
30:24 - course or using a computer might be a
30:27 - course about using how to you know use
30:30 - PowerPoint or word or how to search
30:35 - things on the internet but computer
30:39 - science is how do you create a program
30:44 - like PowerPoint it's it's really
30:48 - becoming a creator of technology than
30:51 - just a user of technology
30:56 - let's see we also have another question
30:58 - that says are you working with Kahn
31:00 - Academy so we're not specifically
31:06 - working with them but they do have some
31:08 - great resources on computer science
31:10 - education so I believe they are listed
31:13 - in our if you go to co.org / learn /
31:17 - beyond I believe they are listed in our
31:22 - set of materials that other people are
31:25 - using to teach computer science we
31:26 - definitely they're doing some very cool
31:28 - stuff out there we have another question
31:32 - that says I have four sections of
31:34 - classes if one section completes it
31:37 - before the others will that qualify for
31:39 - the donors choose award or do all
31:41 - students have to complete it so no just
31:44 - as soon as 15 of your students finish
31:46 - the course that's fine it's not it's not
31:49 - a percentage of how many students you
31:51 - have signed up it's just 15 total let's
31:58 - see we have another question that says
32:00 - what can we do after we finish the
32:03 - 20-hour course to keep teaching that is
32:05 - a great question i would head over to
32:09 - the section i keep talking about its
32:13 - code org slash learn / beyond so that
32:18 - has other computer science materials if
32:20 - your kids are really excited about to
32:23 - learning computer science also in
32:27 - hopefully by the fall of this year we
32:30 - will have some more offerings in the K
32:33 - through 8 space so you can look forward
32:36 - to using those materials in your
32:37 - classroom as well great we have a
32:45 - comment that says I have to say my
32:47 - after-school Club of computer science
32:49 - easing your materials is a huge hit
32:51 - among my 5th graders they leave saying
32:52 - that was fun but it's really nice to
32:55 - hear I'm really glad that your students
32:59 - are enjoying them that's definitely what
33:02 - we set out to do is we set out to not
33:05 - only teach computer science but to show
33:07 - that it's fun computer science is a
33:09 - really fun and creative thing and it's a
33:13 - really empowering feeling to say I'm
33:16 - gonna tell this computer what to do
33:18 - that's that's not something that all
33:20 - students have a chance to do and I think
33:22 - that's so cool that you're teaching it
33:25 - with your students and you're enjoying
33:26 - it so thank you great we have another
33:32 - question that says if the ideal outcome
33:36 - is that students come up with solution
33:38 - to real problems what is the stimulus
33:41 - for them thinking about those problems
33:44 - hmm that is a good question
33:54 - um this is interesting because our
33:59 - currently are k through 8 intro to
34:03 - computer science course really focuses
34:06 - on some of the technical pieces of
34:10 - computer science in some of our future
34:14 - offerings we're going to make sure that
34:22 - there's there's more application to
34:24 - real-world problems so that students
34:27 - will be identifying real-world problems
34:30 - and thinking about how to use computer
34:33 - science to solve those so you kind of
34:35 - have to have a base knowledge of
34:37 - computer science and then figure out how
34:41 - can I use this set of tools to help me
34:43 - solve these real-world problems because
34:45 - once you have that base set of tools
34:47 - you'll start thinking of of things in
34:50 - your everyday life and and things kind
34:53 - of in bigger picture that you can use
34:55 - computer science to solve
34:58 - and what I would like to add too great
35:01 - just a few ideas for introducing
35:04 - students before you even start the
35:06 - curriculum that Katie's been explaining
35:08 - if you haven't already show them the
35:10 - videos we have on our website we found
35:12 - that it both or all of them are really
35:16 - effective in just getting students
35:18 - interested in computer science and our
35:20 - video titles what most schools don't
35:23 - teach just shows people with amazing
35:25 - careers doing amazing things with
35:27 - computer science and also for girls
35:30 - especially a lot of them don't um might
35:34 - think it's just for boys or might be
35:35 - turned off but think about maybe
35:37 - inviting a college student a few years
35:40 - older than your students to your class
35:42 - who's studying computer science or you
35:45 - know students from clubs who are doing
35:48 - other things and they can talk about
35:50 - what they're doing with it or show them
35:52 - role model is either like a video or
35:54 - interview or an article or a poster um
35:57 - there's a website called diva for ideas
36:02 - for girls that shows basically any
36:05 - industry whether it's like fashion
36:07 - business science medicine how you can
36:10 - use technology and computer science to
36:12 - be in those fields and I think all those
36:15 - things are really effective in getting
36:17 - students to think about how this relates
36:19 - to the real life and then once they're
36:21 - learning the tools will be like this is
36:23 - cool I can do something with it that's
36:25 - the most rewarding thing yeah great hey
36:32 - it's another comment this looks like a
36:34 - comment that says the problem in
36:36 - computer education where I live is it's
36:39 - only for how to use the computer I think
36:40 - that's a reality that lot a lot of
36:43 - people are facing and it's it's
36:48 - definitely nice to see educators come
36:49 - out and and are looking to teach
36:55 - computer science versus just how to use
36:57 - the computer and and we do see a lot of
37:02 - clubs that have more girls and boys and
37:04 - that's awesome that's that's very cool
37:07 - that you have so many
37:08 - girls interested that's awesome that is
37:11 - we're definitely looking to help the
37:14 - ratio of male to female computer
37:18 - scientists get back to a little more
37:20 - normal we also have a question says can
37:24 - classes sections you split out on the
37:27 - teachers screen edit student function I
37:30 - need to change my students passwords but
37:32 - I can't do it by course as it's an alpha
37:34 - list also can't see their password to
37:37 - give it to them but have to change it
37:39 - when forgotten
37:42 - um let's see so can classes be split out
37:49 - on the teachers screen um I guess I'm
38:01 - not understanding the question enough do
38:04 - you do you have any insight I just want
38:07 - to make sure i'm answering the right
38:08 - questions so i guess there's an edit
38:10 - student section let me let me go to the
38:13 - screen and pull it up yes so if you have
38:16 - multiple classes can you edit them by
38:20 - class so when I feel free to add some
38:24 - more yeah its own below if you can help
38:27 - us out yeah I just want to make sure I'm
38:30 - answering your question correctly so if
38:33 - I so like can you sort by section if I
38:38 - wanted to put a bunch of students in a
38:41 - new section I could highlight all their
38:43 - names and then we're not highlight but I
38:46 - could click the empty box next to their
38:50 - name so the check mark appears and I
38:52 - could say a sign check students to
38:54 - section and then there's a drop down
38:56 - menu and I could pick which which
38:58 - section I wanted them to put into
39:05 - and once again you can only change
39:07 - students password if they signed up
39:10 - using that section code through co.org
39:14 - /join so if they signed up using an
39:16 - email they have to reset them the
39:18 - passwords themselves so that's that's
39:21 - the only thing
39:24 - cool and if I didn't answer your
39:27 - question well enough please feel free to
39:28 - ask it again in a different way great
39:38 - yeah and if well we'll stay on just a
39:43 - little longer just in case anyone has
39:44 - any questions there's some time a little
39:46 - less sometimes a low lag between the
39:48 - broadcast and people asking questions
39:49 - but I really hope that people have
39:53 - gotten a lot out of these info sessions
39:56 - and I hope that people convert will use
40:02 - the forums to connect with other
40:03 - educators about further questions they
40:07 - might have or advice they'd like to get
40:10 - from other educators or suggestions on
40:13 - how we could make it better so if you
40:16 - like to connect with other educators you
40:19 - can head over to forums code org and
40:22 - click on the K through 8 curriculum and
40:26 - if you if you start a thread there
40:29 - hopefully other educators will come
40:30 - along and and really make it a vibrant
40:33 - community of people who are using this
40:35 - on the field because people are and
40:37 - people are enjoying it and people
40:39 - students are enjoying it so I would love
40:40 - for people to connect and have a really
40:43 - great experience doing that so I think
40:48 - we will end a little early today if
40:50 - anyone would like to continue asking
40:57 - questions please have a head over to
40:59 - forums code org and we really appreciate
41:03 - you coming to show up and I really
41:05 - appreciate Roxanne and mom for being
41:09 - here today this is great so thanks again
41:14 - and um happy teaching computer science

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone we are here for our third info session on code orgs intro to computer science course thanks for joining us again we really appreciate you coming to take your time and learning more about our course so my name is Katie apone and I'm the K through 8 program manager here at code.org and also today with me we have Roxanne she does our social media and we have known who is one of our engineers who has worked on blockley and worked extensively on this K through H intro to computer science course so today is the third session and we'll be covering the teacher dashboard support for teachers and any kind of miscellaneous questions you haven't had answered over these past three sessions so please keep asking questions and we'll get to them when we can so the first session covered the unplugged activities and the second session covered the blockley puzzles so if you have questions about those feel free to go and watch those sessions that are on our Google+ page and they're also listed on our website I definitely encourage everyone to watch the first session especially on the unplugged lessons because it might be easy to skip over the unplug lessons while following through the course but I think it's a great chance for your kids to get some handson experience and really work with others on computer science concepts so I highly recommend going and watching about the unplugged activities and seeing how they play out in your classroom they're really fun with students also we will be giving away a fifty dollars donor choose gift card to one US public school teacher who asks questions during these sessions so if we get your questions and questions in and we'll contact one teacher after these sessions are finished so why don't we just dive right into some logistics of the online setup of our learning platform we can look at some of the different links fair so I'm going to start a screen share so we can see what it looks like the first page that I have pulled up here is just code org slash educate / 20 hour 20 HR so it's on our website and it has a overview of the 20hour course it has a link directly to teacher signups it tells you how to get started it has info about these info sessions it has information about some of our classroom rewards and it goes into overviews of this course tells you what's in this course and it gives you some information about how to prep for the course and during the lessons what you can do during the lessons and it also mentions that it's one hundred percent free who are nonprofit so we want to make sure that all of our materials are spread around and used widely by teachers and they also we also have links to our forums here so you can ask questions on our forum and you can also give us feedback or suggestions rather so you can find a lot of great information here and let's look at to the teacher sign up so there are a couple different ways you can sign up as a teacher you just go to code org you can hit the sign in button well tells me I'm already signed in but it would normally take you to the signup page or the sign in page and it says on the right if you haven't joined yet sign up so this is how you would sign up as a teacher and then you can click this are you a teacher button when you come to this sign up page another way to sign up a tu as a teacher if is if you go to learn code org there's some signin options right under the banner it says so you can sign up as a student or sign up as a teacher so once you're signed up as a teacher you'll wanted to sign up your students so if your students have email addresses they can sign up here which is the sign sign up page we just saw so you can fill out information and sign up as a student with an email address oh I change I wanted what's rejected all right so let's also take a look at a different way to sign up as a student which is through the join link so students don't need an email for this option and to do that you'll sign in to your teacher account and you'll want to head to starting switching tabs around your lap you'll want so when your sign in to your teacher account you want to head to manage sections well sign in so under manage sexings you can add a section so say I wanted to add my fourthgrade classroom as a section and i will say create section so here under section it says fourthgrade classroom and it says add students using section code so this is the section code for this classroom I'm going to copy this it's just a six letter code so then when my students come into class they can go to you'll have them head to code org slash join so for students to sign up without an email they'll come to code or flash join and you can write your section code up on the board and you can have them enter it they'll press GO and then they'll actually fill out another page that says sign up as it asks you for a username and a password and I think that's about it sorry I was signed in when I did that so let me just do that again just to look at what we would fill out okay so it says register to join the class fourth grade classroom taught by meet Katie apone so your students can enter their full name Katie apone this is the spot for their username so they'll enter a username there they'll pick a password and then they can enter if they're male or female if they want and then they can into their birthday if they like um the reason we ask we just asked for a couple of bits of information if you are interested in getting some of the donor choose classroom rewards make sure that your students fill out this gender field that's important so then as a teacher I can look at all the information for the students that are associated with me so I can head to the manage students link and sorry about all this sign in/sign out issues so I can go to my manage students link and I can see all of the all these are all of my students so the students that have you that have become my students using the join code the the option to use without an email I can i can click on this edit password so i can edit their password if they joined using that join code if they signed up using an email address i can't edit their password for them and it will tell me which section there in if i wanted to move them to a different section i could click on their name and say move this student to a fourth grade classroom and it will sign them to that section if we head over to the progress dashboard we can see these are the trophies that the students have collected so we can see that laura has won the silver trophy and the sequence concept Laura's won the bronze trophy in the if concept and these are the puzzle she has completed so you can see the level key up here the the green checkmark means it's completed and using the optimal number of blocks and this kind of lighter green is that they completed it but they used too many blocks and the purple means that they try the puzzle but they have not completed it yet and the white means that they haven't tried it yet so we can use the scroll bar at the bottom to see all of the puzzles for the students um one other thing that I wanted to mention about the teacher dashboard is that we have a solutions link that people have been asking about it's been broken for a while but it should be fixed pretty soon so when you're in your teacher account when you look at a puzzle down here it says see the solution and I'm not sure if this one will work but it should be working soon and we have a question here um the question says how many sections can one teacher have i'm pretty sure that you can have almost an unlimited number of sections I'm there's there's not a limit that I know of so you should feel free to keep creating sections great thank you for the questions so one other thing I wanted to mention that we're about to add to the teacher dashboard is a certificate for the 20hour course currently when you end the 20hour course there's not the appropriate amount of congratulations but we're working on fixing that so soon we will have a certificate like you might have seen the certificate for the hour of code we will have a congratulations you completed your twenty our certificate and you'll be able to print that from the teacher dashboard so that should be available in the future as well um I'd like to talk a little bit about I'm going to stop my screen share here I'd like to talk a little bit about problem solving for teachers so also in the Q&A app if you want to just add suggestions to anything I'm talking about that would be great so if you're using this in your classroom you come across things that worked well kind of put your comments in the Q&A app and other people can read them and I'll comment on them as necessary um so problem solving for teachers let's see really in in a computer science classroom a teachers there to facilitate student discovery it's not always that you have to be the expert in the room it's about helping students take a step back and breaking down problems in two parts so you can help them identify where when the problem of the program like isn't working right and then you can like help them identify how to solve their problem so that's a much it takes a little pressure off the teacher being the expert in the room so it's it's taking some that pressure off you and it's it's kind of it's fostering a community of learners rather than the teacher having all the information let's see also on our on our forum so forums code org there in the eighth grade curriculum section we have an FAQ that you can have some of your frequently answered questions taken care of and we would love that forum to become a space for educators to come and discuss things with other educators so if you have something that you're struggling with in your classroom you can come and post a thread and maybe someone else will answer it with suggestions they had in their classroom there are over 10,000 teachers signed up to do this course and I think utilizing that forum would be a really powerful tool to see how other people are using it in their classrooms and get support from people who are doing it out in the field another way you could find educators locally you could ask your district to send out an email to all the teachers in the district to see if there are other people teaching this course it might even spur some people to want to try and teach the course I think it's great to have in person connections and people who are in your community that might know more about you or about your school about your students to really collaborate with on I think that's a really powerful thing so just going out and finding who's already teaching us or who might want to teach this and having them as a place to bounce ideas off of or get support from would be great we have another question says I finished all 27 badges and tried to redeem my game the code was expired what should I do um I would say you should probably post something on the forum or email help at code.org if that's an issue that might be an issue with the code the game code um yeah and another question me says are you trying to put this in all schools that's not our goal we would love to see computer science in more schools and it's fine if schools want to use our course but there are there are plenty of other great courses out there so we have more offerings on our website from thirdparty resources so if you go to code org slash learn / beyond there are also other computer science offerings that would be great choices for schools great and we have an another question that says what do i do if my all my students finish the course but I don't get my prize from donors cheese so we do have classroom rewards currently that the first 1,000 teachers who successfully need the 15 students through this course will get a thousand dollars and donor choose gift cards so the way it works is that 15 of your students have to receive all 27 concept trophies and then you'll be emailed a code that you can redeem at DonorsChoose and the question said what do you do if all your students finish the course but you don't get your prize that's that's a tough one because the cases are so specialized I would be sure that all of your students have successfully gotten all 27 trophies you can check that for your progress dashboard making sure they have gold trophies next to all of their names and if you're looking for the extra two hundred and fifty dollar bonus for having seven of those students be female me users have to have selected female when they sign up or before they complete the 27 concept trophies so you have to make sure that their account says that they're female to receive that extra two hundred fifty dollars great we have another question that says if students forget their username how can I help them log in that is a good question if you go to your progress dashboard I'm just going to look at mine quickly here if you go to your progress dashboard and same manage students you can click on the student's name and then if you scroll all the way down to the bottom it says there's some different fields at the bottom and one of them says username so that's how you would find out their username another question great this question says do you have any plans to include any video clips for teachers showing them a peek inside a classroom where one of the coding lessons is going on this might be a good way to show teachers they do not have to be the expert that is a great idea we have definitely thought about that in the past and we could definitely implement that going forward I think it's a great resource for especially new teachers who are new to computer science to be able to see that see see it happening in the classroom and see how it really unfolds ouch out in the field that's great to know that other educators are looking for that as well so we will we will try and include that in future offerings I will make think about that right now great so there are just a couple other things I wanted to mention about support for using the 20hour course or using any new computer science education materials it's possible that some of your students parents might work in software or might have knowledge about computer science it's possible to ask them for help on the technical side of questions while you provide the educational side of computer science education because someone might have technical expertise in the area but you as the classroom teacher and use the educator know what's right for your classroom and what works well and why so I would definitely take whatever advice a you might get from a professional software expert or someone who has background in the field I would definitely take that and adapt it to your classrooms needs great we have another question that says I notice that your website has arabic language do the PDF files translate to Arabic as well currently they do not so we might include that in the future it's something we'd like to do because we would love for students who no other languages to be able to use it as well currently we don't but that is something we might do in the future we have another question it says is there a reason my teachers and need to be public school teachers in order to receive the awards I'm a private school teacher just inquiring thanks so the way we do our educator processes is through donorschoose and they require that teachers the US public school teachers so that's just kind of the way that we've decided to do our teacher prizes and also co dot orgs mission as a nonprofit is to help bring science computer science education to K through 12 US public schools so that as the mission of our nonprofit is what we decided to give rewards for but obviously we're still giving our curriculum and our advice and lots of our other materials for free for everybody so we hope that everybody uses them but we can only give rewards to so many people great and Roxanne would like to absurd to add a little more detail and from working with donors shoes I know the reason why they only work with public schools is because the process to bear by a school is much easier you know I think they would love to have the infrastructure to work with all schools but the reason that we have decided to work with them is you know when anyone's doing this curriculum we want to verify that they are indeed a teacher at a school in the u.s. to give them a prize not like a fraudulent account or someone else so um that's what we're doing now but we definitely more prizes to come cool Thank You Robin and we have another question great i love all these questions coming in this one says can you give a working definition of computer science i am a media teacher awesome that you're teaching consider yeah thank you for thanks for being interested in computer science a great start so in the PDF for the first unplugged lesson there is a definition of computer science the interesting thing about the field of computer science is that there is no there's not a definition that is widely accepted as the definition of computer science so the one that we provide in our unplugged activity that introduces computer science to students the definition says the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase problemsolving power so that's that's a small definition you could probably ask 10 different computer scientists and get 10 different answers so I know that's um a tough answer but I hope that helps your bottom oh great we have another question that says will you do other stuff besides games um I'm not exactly sure what's meant by games so I'm assuming you mean the the blockley puzzles so we will be offering other environments in the future so there there will be other things we do we do like to present things in a fun and engaging manner so I'm not sure if that's what you mean by games but we will have different offerings in the future some of them will be more geared towards math and science and what you might think of more as in a traditional classroom but they'll still be fun and engaging so yep great keep the questions coming if you'd like um I will just continue a little more with if people are looking for more support while they're teaching their 20 outward course so we talked to earlier about kind of creating a community of learners in that the teacher doesn't have to be the expert in the room in this scenario and it's interesting because here at the code org office we have a lot of different kind of computer programmers working for us and two with varying experience some of them have years of experience that big companies years of experience with successful startups and some programmers are straight out of college and it's interesting because there are there are days that the seasoned computer programmer with 20 years of experience will ask advice from the programmer who's just gotten out of college it's there's there's so many things to know in the field of computer science you can't know them all so it's it's really great if you start off with the attitude of saying it's okay that I don't know everything and I'm I'm okay with saying i don't know let's figure it out together so also let's see what else can we talk about um strategies that might help your students work through tough spots so some teachers like to use the rule not for kind of rule of thumb that says ask three and then me which means if a student is struggling with it a problem they'll ask three of their neighbors before they'll ask the classroom teacher so this fosters a lot of students working together and it also reduces the stress of students asking you for the the first question every single time because students are bound to have similar questions so once one student figures it out they can share with their neighbor and work collaboratively in that way let's see do we have any more questions to look at yes rayos we also have a question that says for the unplugged computational thinking lessons do students need the copies of the monster catalog that have a line on this line sheets should they be on overhead transparency sheets so let me just pull up that lesson just to make sure that we're all looking at the same thing so I have my computational thinking PDF open here and it says do students need the copies of the monster catalog so so for this activity I think this is good for this activity if you're working with groups of students I would each i would give each group of student a catalog and you they can be printed on transparencies or you can have them put tracing paper over each of the monster features so they can pick and choose which monster feature they want because printing on transparency isn't that easy so you can have them put in on tracing paper but yes i would give each student or each group of students a monster catalog definitely we have another question that says says so this course is about how to teach computer science it's not about how to use a computer yes so this is about teaching computer science rather than using a computer or a technology course so a technology course or using a computer might be a course about using how to you know use PowerPoint or word or how to search things on the internet but computer science is how do you create a program like PowerPoint it's it's really becoming a creator of technology than just a user of technology let's see we also have another question that says are you working with Kahn Academy so we're not specifically working with them but they do have some great resources on computer science education so I believe they are listed in our if you go to co.org / learn / beyond I believe they are listed in our set of materials that other people are using to teach computer science we definitely they're doing some very cool stuff out there we have another question that says I have four sections of classes if one section completes it before the others will that qualify for the donors choose award or do all students have to complete it so no just as soon as 15 of your students finish the course that's fine it's not it's not a percentage of how many students you have signed up it's just 15 total let's see we have another question that says what can we do after we finish the 20hour course to keep teaching that is a great question i would head over to the section i keep talking about its code org slash learn / beyond so that has other computer science materials if your kids are really excited about to learning computer science also in hopefully by the fall of this year we will have some more offerings in the K through 8 space so you can look forward to using those materials in your classroom as well great we have a comment that says I have to say my afterschool Club of computer science easing your materials is a huge hit among my 5th graders they leave saying that was fun but it's really nice to hear I'm really glad that your students are enjoying them that's definitely what we set out to do is we set out to not only teach computer science but to show that it's fun computer science is a really fun and creative thing and it's a really empowering feeling to say I'm gonna tell this computer what to do that's that's not something that all students have a chance to do and I think that's so cool that you're teaching it with your students and you're enjoying it so thank you great we have another question that says if the ideal outcome is that students come up with solution to real problems what is the stimulus for them thinking about those problems hmm that is a good question um this is interesting because our currently are k through 8 intro to computer science course really focuses on some of the technical pieces of computer science in some of our future offerings we're going to make sure that there's there's more application to realworld problems so that students will be identifying realworld problems and thinking about how to use computer science to solve those so you kind of have to have a base knowledge of computer science and then figure out how can I use this set of tools to help me solve these realworld problems because once you have that base set of tools you'll start thinking of of things in your everyday life and and things kind of in bigger picture that you can use computer science to solve and what I would like to add too great just a few ideas for introducing students before you even start the curriculum that Katie's been explaining if you haven't already show them the videos we have on our website we found that it both or all of them are really effective in just getting students interested in computer science and our video titles what most schools don't teach just shows people with amazing careers doing amazing things with computer science and also for girls especially a lot of them don't um might think it's just for boys or might be turned off but think about maybe inviting a college student a few years older than your students to your class who's studying computer science or you know students from clubs who are doing other things and they can talk about what they're doing with it or show them role model is either like a video or interview or an article or a poster um there's a website called diva for ideas for girls that shows basically any industry whether it's like fashion business science medicine how you can use technology and computer science to be in those fields and I think all those things are really effective in getting students to think about how this relates to the real life and then once they're learning the tools will be like this is cool I can do something with it that's the most rewarding thing yeah great hey it's another comment this looks like a comment that says the problem in computer education where I live is it's only for how to use the computer I think that's a reality that lot a lot of people are facing and it's it's definitely nice to see educators come out and and are looking to teach computer science versus just how to use the computer and and we do see a lot of clubs that have more girls and boys and that's awesome that's that's very cool that you have so many girls interested that's awesome that is we're definitely looking to help the ratio of male to female computer scientists get back to a little more normal we also have a question says can classes sections you split out on the teachers screen edit student function I need to change my students passwords but I can't do it by course as it's an alpha list also can't see their password to give it to them but have to change it when forgotten um let's see so can classes be split out on the teachers screen um I guess I'm not understanding the question enough do you do you have any insight I just want to make sure i'm answering the right questions so i guess there's an edit student section let me let me go to the screen and pull it up yes so if you have multiple classes can you edit them by class so when I feel free to add some more yeah its own below if you can help us out yeah I just want to make sure I'm answering your question correctly so if I so like can you sort by section if I wanted to put a bunch of students in a new section I could highlight all their names and then we're not highlight but I could click the empty box next to their name so the check mark appears and I could say a sign check students to section and then there's a drop down menu and I could pick which which section I wanted them to put into and once again you can only change students password if they signed up using that section code through co.org /join so if they signed up using an email they have to reset them the passwords themselves so that's that's the only thing cool and if I didn't answer your question well enough please feel free to ask it again in a different way great yeah and if well we'll stay on just a little longer just in case anyone has any questions there's some time a little less sometimes a low lag between the broadcast and people asking questions but I really hope that people have gotten a lot out of these info sessions and I hope that people convert will use the forums to connect with other educators about further questions they might have or advice they'd like to get from other educators or suggestions on how we could make it better so if you like to connect with other educators you can head over to forums code org and click on the K through 8 curriculum and if you if you start a thread there hopefully other educators will come along and and really make it a vibrant community of people who are using this on the field because people are and people are enjoying it and people students are enjoying it so I would love for people to connect and have a really great experience doing that so I think we will end a little early today if anyone would like to continue asking questions please have a head over to forums code org and we really appreciate you coming to show up and I really appreciate Roxanne and mom for being here today this is great so thanks again and um happy teaching computer science
