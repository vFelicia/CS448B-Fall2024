00:04 - When you put a loop inside of another loop,
we call that a nested loop. For example, here
00:11 - we're given the code already to draw one triangle
with sides of length 100 pixels using the
00:16 - repeat times block set to three, once for
each side of a triangle. But we want to draw
00:22 - six triangles. In order to do that, we're
going to take that loop and place it inside
00:27 - of another repeat times block. Pretty cool!
