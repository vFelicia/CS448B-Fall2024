00:00 - in 2013 when just one in 10 schools
00:03 - taught computer science and more than 1
00:06 - million of America's best paying jobs
00:08 - were going unfilled brothers hotti and
00:12 - Ali partovi brought together Tech
00:14 - leaders from across the us to talk about
00:17 - their personal connection to computer
00:19 - science and its importance in today's
00:24 - society through the creation of this
00:26 - landmark video which has amassed more
00:29 - than 15 million views thousands of
00:32 - Educators and parents were captivated to
00:34 - take action and reached out to see how
00:36 - they could bring computer science to
00:38 - schools across the globe the video
00:41 - started off with this quote from Steve
00:43 - Jobs I think everybody in this country
00:45 - should learn how to program a computer
00:47 - because it teaches you how to think and
00:49 - this Remains the essence of code.org
00:52 - mission in December of 2013 code.org and
00:56 - the first hour of code were launched
00:58 - that was so easy the goal of reaching 10
01:01 - million students was blown away and a
01:03 - movement began we're doing the hour of
01:07 - the following year unimaginable
01:10 - engagement was reached with 60 million
01:12 - students from around the world I was
01:14 - really unfamiliar with computer science
01:16 - but I tried an hour of code for the
01:18 - first time I saw myself understanding
01:20 - computer science and so I took it back
01:21 - to my classroom and they were so excited
01:24 - and so empowered and this was something
01:26 - that they didn't know about and that
01:27 - hour of cold went from an hour to like
01:30 - four weeks I mean the kids just didn't
01:33 - want to stop i' love it coding super fun
01:35 - yes Educators were not the only ones
01:37 - inspired to join the movement world
01:40 - leaders celebrities athletes artists and
01:44 - activists all saw the immense value in
01:47 - computer science education and
01:49 - volunteered their time to not only talk
01:51 - about it but to join in on the fun today
01:54 - code.org curriculum is the preferred
01:56 - provider for teaching computer science
01:59 - and code.org is consistently ranked
02:02 - number one by Common Sense Media and by
02:05 - teachers for offering the best computer
02:07 - science
02:08 - curriculum this is possible because of
02:10 - the engagement of Educators
02:13 - administrators education partner
02:15 - organizations the creativity of more
02:17 - than 500 content partners and the
02:20 - financial support of code.org Mission
02:23 - code.org holistic approach has helped
02:25 - close gaps in participation and improve
02:28 - Equity across gender race income and
02:32 - geography I have a lot of students that
02:34 - would be traditionally very intimidated
02:36 - by computer science I don't think I
02:39 - would be nearly successful and have the
02:41 - number of students that I have that keep
02:43 - coming back from my classes and go to
02:45 - college or go get jobs in Industry if it
02:48 - was not for code.org
02:50 - code.org measurable impact is creating
02:54 - Global systemic
02:56 - [Music]
02:58 - change we recognize I the job is not
03:00 - done yet artificial intelligence is
03:03 - rapidly changing education and the
03:05 - global Workforce there are still wide
03:08 - computer science access gaps to address
03:10 - domestically and globally with your help
03:13 - code.org staff
03:15 - of25 and its expansive partner ecosystem
03:19 - are up to this challenge our vision is
03:21 - clear to bring computer science globally
03:24 - to all students in all schools and to
03:27 - ensure the foundation exists to prepare
03:30 - and Empower education systems to teach
03:33 - this rapidly evolving Technology field
