00:00 - software and computers
00:02 - um
00:03 - it used to be that that was just kind of
00:05 - a separate area of the world but now
00:06 - software touches all these different
00:08 - things that you use um i think if you
00:10 - look in everything i mean there's more
00:12 - phones and tablets and laptops and
00:15 - websites and everybody's on social media
00:18 - and i mean it's just all these different
00:19 - things and everything's just moving
00:21 - faster
00:22 - so um
00:24 - just being in a position to kind of
00:26 - understand that language that's going to
00:28 - be the future i mean um i think it's uh
00:31 - i think it's a good thing to do it's
00:33 - absolutely crucial to know how to code
00:35 - and to understand how technology is
00:37 - built even if you don't choose to you
00:40 - know make a living or be a full-time
00:42 - software developer understanding how
00:45 - software works which is something that
00:46 - affects everything around you from your
00:48 - purchases to
00:50 - you know how you eat and just how
00:51 - everything works nowadays it's really
00:53 - important to be able to know
00:56 - how it works so that you are not
00:59 - sort of a victim of other people's
01:00 - choices it's important for these kids
01:03 - right now starting at eight years old to
01:05 - be a citizen on this planet
01:09 - hey whatever country you're from
01:12 - to read and write code you know if you
01:14 - wait until you're an adult you probably
01:17 - will never do it i just felt like if i
01:19 - didn't learn how to program it it would
01:21 - be like not learning how to read you
01:23 - know the the future would just be closed
01:25 - to me when i think about what we're
01:27 - going to be teaching in schools 5 10 15
01:29 - years from now i definitely think that
01:31 - computer science or at least
01:33 - basic programming is going to be as
01:35 - important of a skill as
01:37 - being able to
01:38 - do basic reading and writing
01:41 - and
01:42 - i think we're going to look back and
01:43 - wonder why it took us so long to get to
01:45 - that point
01:51 - [Music]
01:56 - you
