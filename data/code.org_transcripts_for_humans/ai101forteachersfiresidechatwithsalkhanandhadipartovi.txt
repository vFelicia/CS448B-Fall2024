00:02 - foreign
00:08 - for teachers my name is Jess I'm a
00:11 - former teacher and now specialize in
00:13 - adult learning I will be your guide for
00:15 - this professional learning series
00:17 - artificial intelligence has become a Hot
00:19 - Topic in education leaving many
00:21 - Educators wondering about things like
00:23 - what is AI
00:25 - are my students going to use AI to cheat
00:28 - is AI going to replace me as a teacher
00:32 - what should I be teaching my students
00:34 - about AI
00:36 - throughout this professional learning
00:37 - series our goal is to answer these
00:40 - questions and more while also equipping
00:42 - you with the Knowledge and Skills you
00:44 - will need to navigate this new landscape
00:47 - in this session we will hear from Hadi
00:49 - partovy the creator of code.org and
00:52 - salcon the creator of Khan Academy
00:56 - let's hear what hottie and Sal have to
00:58 - say about some of the biggest questions
01:01 - related to AI in education
01:06 - [Music]
01:11 - AI has been around for many years but
01:13 - what's happened very recently with the
01:16 - launch of chat GPT and similar tools is
01:18 - that AI can actually generate
01:20 - information it can generate creative
01:23 - writing images even videos and so what
01:27 - used to be a tool for pattern matching
01:29 - can actually create new ideas new
01:32 - thoughts and the reason this is very
01:35 - important in education is there's so
01:37 - many aspects of Education work that
01:39 - either teachers do or that students do
01:41 - that can now be done automatically using
01:43 - generative AI
01:45 - so I know like both of us I'm sure it's
01:47 - just Tech nerds of sorts have been
01:49 - paying attention to generative AI for
01:51 - many years and you know yeah gpt2 which
01:54 - could write an Elon Musk famously said
01:56 - you know this this has to be controlled
01:58 - in some ways because it could write very
01:59 - convincing articles but it was nonsense
02:02 - what it was writing so it could be good
02:03 - for generating fake news gpt3 did
02:07 - similar things although it was just
02:08 - better at it which in some way ways made
02:10 - folks even more worried than things like
02:13 - Dolly came out where it showed that you
02:15 - could create images that you could have
02:17 - you know the Mona Lisa and you could
02:19 - tell the computer or the generative AI
02:21 - to say well what's what's the back of
02:23 - her head look like or what is the rest
02:25 - of the scene actually look like when I
02:27 - was monitoring all of that over the
02:29 - years I was just like oh this is cool
02:30 - but it's really just a a quirky thing
02:33 - it's not going to be really useful
02:35 - anytime soon especially in education and
02:39 - I think what really changed was that
02:41 - transition from gpt3 to either you could
02:45 - say GPT 3.5 which is chat gbt or more
02:48 - importantly gpt4 and that's when it
02:50 - really hit me that this thing that
02:52 - looked like a novelty for the last
02:54 - several years now could start to have un
02:58 - seemingly understand seemingly
03:00 - understand information and make sense of
03:02 - it and not just answer the question but
03:05 - explain why it chose that answer explain
03:07 - why the other choices are not the answer
03:10 - generate generative AI it could generate
03:13 - other questions like it and it could you
03:16 - could prompt it so that it could act as
03:18 - a tutor it could act as a teaching
03:20 - assistant and so that's when we started
03:22 - to appreciate okay the world is now
03:23 - different and this is not only going to
03:26 - be relevant to education but it's
03:28 - probably going to transform it in some
03:30 - pretty significant ways
03:34 - when you use a tool like chat GPT or any
03:36 - tool that's generating text or code as
03:39 - an AI these are based on an underlying
03:41 - technology called a large language model
03:43 - and a large language model is basically
03:45 - a giant neural network that has trained
03:48 - on all sorts of information all the
03:50 - books or articles or code that it can
03:53 - find on the internet and then can then
03:55 - actually generate new information new
03:58 - essays stories even writing new code and
04:01 - it's worth understanding that this
04:02 - technology is not truly intelligent it
04:06 - is just using statistics and
04:07 - probabilities to generate new
04:10 - information at code.org we're actually
04:12 - creating a video series explaining
04:14 - exactly how large language models work
04:16 - and in fact the chief technology officer
04:18 - of open AI Mira murati is one of the the
04:21 - stars of this video to talk about
04:23 - basically an explanation of large
04:25 - language models
04:26 - well one thing I will say because people
04:28 - have said oh it's just statistically
04:29 - figuring out the next best word to say
04:31 - in a lot of ways it's starting to teach
04:33 - us a little bit about ourselves like
04:35 - even when I'm talking right now you know
04:37 - when I'm speaking in in oral language
04:38 - I'm just expressing a series of thoughts
04:40 - that are coming and I'm not consciously
04:42 - deciding each next word I just know that
04:45 - the next word is going to be whatever it
04:48 - is going to be so large language models
04:51 - to your mentioned it was a neural it's
04:52 - neural net neural Nets are computer
04:54 - essentially computer simulations of
04:56 - neurons and synapses
04:58 - um and and they're starting to approach
04:59 - the complexity of at least large chunks
05:01 - of the human brain we're not at a point
05:03 - where AI is conscious of itself or has
05:06 - its own motivations and desires other
05:09 - than what we ask it to do but yeah it's
05:11 - worth noting that this probabilities and
05:13 - statistics the numbers inside of an AI
05:16 - and generally at large language models
05:18 - are basically literally the computer
05:21 - equivalent of the synapses and the
05:24 - connections in the nerves in your brain
05:26 - and you have trillions of nerves in your
05:28 - brain and the strengths of all those
05:29 - synapses of what forms your memories
05:31 - creates your thoughts and gives you all
05:34 - your of your intelligence in a large
05:36 - language model that's being simulated
05:37 - across literally millions of computers
05:40 - uh and is that intelligent it's at least
05:44 - a representation of how your brain works
05:46 - and it's interesting that it they this
05:49 - works on math your brain works on
05:51 - neurons but the outputs of what a large
05:54 - language model provides are quite
05:56 - similar to what humans do themselves
06:01 - I think pretty much anybody working in
06:02 - education is surprised was surprised to
06:05 - be able to ask
06:06 - AI to write an essay about the Civil War
06:09 - or explain photosynthesis or create a
06:13 - short story about a princess living on
06:15 - mars or write the code to you know to
06:18 - reverse to shuffle a deck of cards
06:21 - whatever it is these are things that you
06:23 - might think of as homework or as exams
06:25 - for teachers you can just ask it to make
06:27 - a lesson plan or to make a presentation
06:29 - about some Topic in history and it
06:32 - pretty much does all of it pretty well
06:34 - uh and it is really causing a need to
06:36 - rethink How We Do education and what's
06:38 - even I 100 agree what's even more
06:39 - amazing than that is it can answer these
06:41 - questions and do these tasks but then
06:43 - you could even ask it to take on roles
06:45 - and personas you can say B Robin
06:48 - Williams in Dead Poet Society and
06:50 - inspire me about literature
06:52 - and it did it and that's what that's
06:55 - what it's like this this is getting
06:56 - weird fast
07:01 - it's hard for schools to say what tools
07:03 - you do or don't use when you do homework
07:05 - so the reality is the way homework is
07:08 - taught or assigned in most schools today
07:11 - lots of it can be done automatically
07:13 - with AI when chat gbt first came out uh
07:16 - I showed it on the first day to my son
07:18 - he's 16 and his first question was can I
07:22 - use this for homework he was like
07:23 - excited uh and then while I was about to
07:26 - answer he said actually what's the point
07:28 - of school if this can even do all these
07:29 - things and those two questions are sort
07:32 - of the two bounds of what I think
07:34 - Educators need to think about because if
07:36 - we just continue assigning homework the
07:38 - way we have been yes you can use AI to
07:41 - do that and you could argue that that's
07:43 - cheating but I actually think we need to
07:45 - evolve what we think about as being the
07:48 - work that students need to do at home
07:49 - your point about homework you have very
07:51 - little control about what happens but I
07:53 - think it in some ways this shines a
07:55 - healthy Spotlight because before chat
07:57 - GPT you had chat big sister or or some
08:00 - people had parents or tutors and a lot
08:02 - of poor kids did not have any of those
08:04 - things the biggest inequity that forms
08:06 - in our school system is when the kids
08:08 - aren't in school it happens when you
08:09 - assign homework you or I can help our
08:11 - kids or we might be able to help get get
08:15 - a family member to do it or we might be
08:17 - able to hire a tutor a lot of families
08:19 - can't afford to do that that's where the
08:21 - inequity develops and if you can do more
08:23 - in school the better
08:27 - when you think about equity and AI
08:29 - there's two almost opposite things going
08:32 - on on the one hand AI closes an equity
08:35 - Gap in that every student who has access
08:38 - to it now can get basically a low-cost
08:42 - personalized tutor they can get a lot of
08:45 - things done that in the past you needed
08:47 - basically more money to get done AI
08:49 - basically provides a superpower to
08:51 - anybody who has access on the flip side
08:53 - the student who doesn't have internet
08:55 - access doesn't have a device whether
08:56 - it's a phone or a computer is actually
08:58 - now farther behind because they
09:02 - basically the gap of not having a
09:03 - computer became more costly than it was
09:06 - before because here's this yet another
09:08 - superpower that you don't have
09:14 - AI technology as a whole can have
09:17 - strengths and benefits as we've talked
09:18 - about but it also has downsides and
09:20 - risks it makes mistakes it could create
09:23 - misinformation it has biases it can have
09:26 - either a political bias or a racial or
09:29 - gender bias it might have uh it might
09:32 - get tricked into to creating dangerous
09:34 - content there's all sorts of potential
09:37 - pitfalls and this is part of why schools
09:41 - and educators are have in many cases hit
09:43 - on the brakes to say let's like not jump
09:45 - into this too quickly but it's worth
09:47 - noting that there isn't a single tool
09:49 - that is all of AI there's multiple tools
09:52 - coming out some of which are general
09:54 - purpose like chat GPT which is not even
09:56 - licensed for use by by students under
09:59 - the age of 18 but there's tons of tools
10:01 - that are being created specifically for
10:03 - the purpose of Education Khan Academy's
10:05 - con Migo being a great example of that
10:07 - where these tools have done specific
10:10 - things to protect against these risks
10:13 - and these these downsides sides to
10:15 - protect student privacy to prevent the
10:17 - creation of misinformation or
10:18 - hallucination or biases or or dangerous
10:21 - content so the most important jobs
10:23 - Educators or at least education I.T
10:26 - departments need to think about is not
10:27 - whether you ban AI or allow AI it's
10:30 - really choosing which tools are the ones
10:33 - you which AI tools are the ones that are
10:35 - ready for Education that address these
10:37 - downsides yeah I couldn't agree more and
10:40 - even on those very real downsides like
10:42 - bias and misinformation and making
10:44 - mistakes hallucinations I also always
10:47 - point out that you know compared to what
10:49 - is already there and what also has bias
10:52 - and the internet the internet has all of
10:54 - those issues other human beings have all
10:56 - of those issues and there's often not
10:58 - the transparency where you can audit
11:00 - what's what what was said or what what
11:02 - bias might be introduced so in some ways
11:04 - it's it's just an extension of a lot of
11:07 - that
11:12 - we were working on a generative Ai and
11:15 - large language models from about
11:18 - mid-2022 and then we all remember end of
11:20 - November chat GPT comes out but that
11:22 - took the World by storm because when you
11:24 - chat with it it just seemed to feel a
11:26 - little bit more magical as we all
11:27 - remember but immediately the education
11:30 - community and teachers rightfully saw
11:32 - wait this thing can write essays and I'm
11:34 - sure a lot of students realize that this
11:36 - thing could write essays and it was a
11:38 - cheating tool and I was really worried
11:40 - because I was like yeah yes it can be a
11:42 - cheating tool and Chad gbt was not
11:44 - designed for education so in March when
11:47 - we were able to to launch what we call
11:49 - conmigo we were able to show that not
11:51 - only can you mitigate some of that you
11:53 - can create generative AIS that have
11:55 - guard rails everything that a student
11:57 - does it's monitorable by a teacher you
11:59 - could have a second AI monitor what the
12:01 - student's doing with it so if they do
12:03 - anything shady whether it's unproductive
12:05 - unhealthy behavior all the way to
12:06 - cheating it can actively notify the
12:10 - parents or actively notify the teacher
12:12 - and then on top of that create ways so
12:14 - the AI isn't doing the work for you but
12:17 - doing it with you so if you ask can we
12:18 - go to write your paper it won't but to
12:20 - say I can be your writing coach and so
12:21 - we think the future is actually going to
12:23 - be there's going to be certain tasks
12:24 - where I think teachers will say yes use
12:27 - whatever tool you want because that's
12:29 - happening in the workforce where
12:30 - sometimes you do want to use these tools
12:32 - to maybe write some parts or give you
12:35 - some revision or craft some parts of
12:37 - what what you're doing but then there's
12:39 - going to be other places where teachers
12:40 - are going to say I need to make sure
12:41 - you're writing this yourself so what
12:43 - we're doing on our side we're trying to
12:44 - create those tools where teachers can
12:46 - assign through the AI the AI can work
12:48 - with the student and the AI can report
12:50 - back to the teacher yeah I worked with
12:51 - them we did some outlining we did some
12:53 - brainstorming I gave them some feedback
12:55 - and this is where they are now and this
12:56 - is even my first pass at how they did
12:58 - according to the rubric
13:01 - when Educators think about generative AI
13:04 - the first thing they hear about or think
13:06 - about often is chat PPT because of its
13:08 - popularity and because it was the first
13:10 - popular sort of generative AI tool that
13:12 - took the World by storm but it's worth
13:14 - noting that almost every tool in Tech is
13:17 - going to have an element of generated AI
13:19 - built into it and this is actually most
13:21 - relevant as some schools early on banned
13:24 - chat gbt just to sort of say like can we
13:26 - stop this and figure it out but we
13:28 - should recognize that Microsoft Word is
13:30 - going to have generative AI it'll just
13:32 - create documents for you PowerPoint or
13:34 - Google Slides or Google spreadsheets or
13:36 - Excel they will generate formulas or
13:39 - generate slides there's even an app
13:41 - called gamma that will generate an
13:43 - entire presentation start to bottom you
13:45 - just give it a topic it'll give you an
13:47 - outline you edit the outline it
13:49 - generates the entire presentation for
13:51 - you there's coding tools that
13:53 - automatically write code and many of
13:55 - these are built on the same underlying
13:57 - technology as chat gbt you know the
13:59 - large language models uh but it's not
14:02 - there's not just one tool it'll be
14:04 - impossible to ban this in education
14:07 - because we won't be banning Microsoft
14:09 - Word and Google Docs usage in schools so
14:12 - schools need to figure out how to
14:13 - embrace that this technology is going to
14:15 - be available there's going to be tools
14:17 - like comigo that are designed
14:19 - specifically for education and then
14:21 - there's going to be tools that are
14:22 - designed for general purpose work but
14:24 - schools will need to figure out that
14:26 - students will have access to these
14:27 - whether they like it or not
14:31 - there's a lot of sort of
14:34 - questions being raised about is AI going
14:36 - to replace jobs uh and there may be some
14:38 - jobs that are completely replaced but
14:40 - when it comes to teaching I'm quite sure
14:43 - we're not going to have less of a need
14:45 - for teachers globally the world has a
14:47 - massive teacher shortage if AI can
14:50 - simply help make the job of teaching
14:52 - easier reduce the sort of hardship of
14:55 - teaching enable more personalized
14:57 - learning we might at least get to a
14:59 - point where we no longer have teacher
15:01 - shortages we're far from a worry of
15:03 - teachers losing jobs and we have such a
15:05 - dramatic shortage and what I believe AI
15:07 - is going to do is enable more
15:09 - personalized learning less busy work on
15:12 - the job of the teacher more coaching and
15:14 - facilitating and working with that kid
15:16 - who has a something is blocking them or
15:19 - they're struggling with something or
15:20 - they need a motivation boost or whatnot
15:22 - where so much of a teacher's day is busy
15:24 - doing things that aren't directly with
15:26 - that student AI should help us get us to
15:29 - a world where teachers spend more
15:31 - one-on-one time with students and that
15:33 - is not a about Job losses in education
15:36 - it's about really empowering teachers to
15:38 - do the work that they really got into
15:40 - the field to do I couldn't agree with
15:43 - you more when I think of the jobs that
15:45 - are safest in this generative AI World
15:48 - anything that is really about that human
15:51 - connection and about kind of elevating
15:53 - and and almost being the conductor and
15:55 - of other human beings I think there's
15:57 - going to be a very good place to be and
16:00 - uh generative AI is going to make that
16:03 - job a lot more sustainable to your point
16:05 - the reason why we have the shortages
16:06 - because so much teacher burnout if you
16:08 - can take the administrative things off
16:09 - of a teacher's plate and also give them
16:11 - ways to support their students better in
16:13 - a more differentiated way they're going
16:15 - to be enjoying their their work more of
16:17 - what I've tell a lot of teachers is
16:18 - imagine if all of a sudden the
16:20 - Department of Education or your District
16:22 - said hey good news everyone we somehow
16:24 - found budget to give every one of you
16:26 - five teaching assistants who are just
16:29 - going to be there do what you need help
16:30 - you with lesson plans help your grade
16:32 - papers help you work with your students
16:34 - answer questions when you're not but
16:36 - they're going to report back to you and
16:37 - they're going to do exactly what you
16:38 - want I think every teacher would
16:40 - celebrate
16:41 - that's what's about to happen
16:47 - touch every industry at every possible
16:51 - part of it now I do want to make clear a
16:53 - lot of people have started differentiate
16:54 - which I think is an important thing
16:55 - between jobs and tasks I think it's
16:57 - going to allow a lot of folks to do more
17:00 - tasks more productively but it's not
17:02 - going to replace in many cases whole
17:04 - whole jobs so pretty much any job where
17:07 - you have to do any type of writing
17:09 - I think you're going to have a
17:10 - productivity Improvement at least 2x
17:11 - probably more any job where you have to
17:14 - create presentations you have to create
17:17 - any type of artifact uh probably I would
17:20 - say any job that involves working with a
17:22 - computer in any way is going to become
17:25 - in some way not replaced by AI but
17:29 - Easier by AI which means whether you're
17:31 - writing code whether you're reviewing
17:34 - contracts if you're writing a patent if
17:37 - you're reviewing a patent if you're
17:39 - creating marketing if you're posting to
17:41 - social media if you're creating a
17:44 - spreadsheet or analyzing data with a
17:46 - spreadsheet everywhere from marketing to
17:48 - sales to accounting you name it
17:51 - AI isn't going to replace your job it'll
17:53 - make your job easier because certain
17:55 - tasks that are repetitive will become
17:57 - completely automated certain tasks where
18:00 - you might have writer's block AI might
18:02 - make the first draft for you or help you
18:03 - out or give you corrections to basically
18:06 - reduce the time you need to spend to get
18:08 - the job done one of the things that's
18:09 - important is when you think about how
18:11 - much all digital work is going to be
18:13 - impacted by AI is recognizing how
18:15 - critical it is that our education system
18:18 - teaches students what this is how to use
18:21 - it how it works and what are its risks
18:24 - what are its strengths and weaknesses
18:26 - because right now most adults just treat
18:29 - it as a sort of magical tool like oh it
18:31 - just came out in its magic but it's
18:33 - important to actually understand the
18:35 - underpinnings of what is a large
18:37 - language model realizing that it's using
18:39 - statistics to generate its thoughts to
18:41 - realize that that statistical generation
18:44 - is why it could make mistakes and
18:47 - recognizing that it's been trained on
18:48 - data so the data that it's used to
18:50 - figure out what it's going to and could
18:52 - have biases could have you know missing
18:55 - gaps in the data things like that it's
18:58 - important for students to as they get
19:01 - prepared for this Workforce of the
19:02 - future to know how the technology
19:05 - they're using in these future jobs is
19:08 - actually working
19:11 - foreign
19:13 - so one thing that a lot of non-teachers
19:15 - don't realize but every teacher realizes
19:17 - is that almost half of their time is
19:20 - grading papers writing progress reports
19:24 - generating lesson plans and not in the
19:27 - classroom not students it might be
19:29 - happening but it's not facing the
19:32 - students and that's above and beyond all
19:33 - of the issues around in the typical
19:35 - classroom you might have three four five
19:38 - grade levels of students and so you're
19:39 - trying to differentiate and address all
19:41 - that but generative AI we think is going
19:44 - to be a huge gift to teachers almost
19:46 - everything else in edtech even if it's
19:48 - very valuable a lot of stuff we've
19:49 - historically done at Khan Academy we
19:50 - think it can really enhance what's
19:52 - happening in the classroom but teachers
19:53 - like oh it's just one more thing for me
19:55 - to learn and I'm already I'm already
19:57 - burnt out but what's exciting about
19:58 - generative AI that let's call it 10 15
20:01 - 20 hours a week where teachers are
20:02 - writing lesson plans writing progress
20:04 - reports rubrics Etc et cetera grading
20:07 - papers that might over the next few
20:09 - years come from 15 hours 20 hours a week
20:12 - down to a few hours week so that's going
20:14 - to save a lot of time and energy for
20:16 - teachers one to recharge themselves
20:18 - because they're getting spread too thin
20:20 - and also have more time and energy for
20:22 - their students and then of course it's
20:23 - going to help them create more
20:25 - differentiated instruction it's going to
20:27 - be able to support them as teaching
20:28 - assistants it's going to be able to
20:29 - support the students as Tutors or
20:31 - teaching assistants in the classroom so
20:32 - they'll also be able to to personalize
20:34 - more for their students yeah some of
20:36 - this is stuff that is already available
20:37 - and a lot of it is going to be worked
20:39 - into the tools that teachers already use
20:41 - to make grading easier creating rubrics
20:45 - or even add testing work against the
20:47 - rubrics is something that AI can now do
20:49 - for you so lots of tools are going to be
20:51 - incorporating this into them to make
20:53 - teachers lives easier
20:59 - even before a chat GPT and gender of AI
21:02 - people was like you know the world is
21:03 - changing so fast what do kids need to
21:04 - learn and they're they're oftentimes
21:06 - surprised that I said well you know it's
21:08 - actually the same traditional skills if
21:10 - you learn to write really well if you
21:13 - have a solid knowledge base say of
21:16 - civics financial literacy if you have uh
21:20 - you know how to use tools well and
21:22 - increasingly these are going to be
21:23 - technological tools you have strong
21:24 - critical thinking skills as you know
21:26 - probably at least as an algebra early
21:28 - algebra type type of level some
21:31 - statistics knowledge you're going to be
21:33 - quite potent in any point in history and
21:37 - I think that's going to be even more so
21:38 - in this generative AI Revolution a lot
21:41 - of people say well the gender of AI can
21:43 - write papers now the gender of AI is
21:44 - going to be able to solve the math
21:45 - problem but one way to think about it is
21:47 - students of the future are going to have
21:48 - to manage these generative Ai and if I
21:50 - told you that somebody's going to be an
21:52 - editor of a newspaper they're going to
21:53 - have to manage writers does that person
21:55 - need to know how to write and you're
21:57 - like not only do they need to know how
21:58 - to write they need to know how to write
21:59 - better now because they're going to be
22:00 - managing other people they're going to
22:01 - act as an editor so gender of AI doesn't
22:03 - give us a free pass to say oh no one has
22:06 - to learn any of this stuff anymore for
22:07 - the folks who want to operate in the
22:09 - knowledge economy and want to have
22:10 - really
22:12 - well-positioned careers they need to
22:14 - elevate above the generative Ai and know
22:15 - how to manage those generative AI so
22:17 - that means not just understanding the
22:18 - tools but it actually means
22:20 - understanding the underlying skills that
22:22 - the generative AI is doing better than
22:25 - the AI itself if I think about the
22:27 - skills that are going to be most
22:28 - relevant for the future it's those
22:30 - things that you mentioned critical
22:32 - thinking problem solving Reading Writing
22:34 - I also think digital skills both knowing
22:37 - how to use digital tools but also
22:39 - actually understanding how they work are
22:41 - going to be more and more important in
22:42 - the workplace people also ask me all the
22:45 - time because I run code.org whether
22:47 - coding jobs are going to disappear
22:49 - because AI can now write code and it's
22:52 - very similar to writing AI can write
22:54 - essays does do we stop teaching writing
22:57 - anymore I don't think anybody is
22:59 - questioning whether we should stop
23:00 - teaching people to write because writing
23:03 - is a form of communication and for the
23:05 - exact same reason we shouldn't stop
23:06 - teaching coding as you mentioned they
23:09 - see the person who knows how to code
23:11 - just got a superpower because they can
23:13 - manage a team of coders that are AI just
23:16 - like a person who knows how to write
23:18 - gained a new superpower because AI can
23:20 - do they now have a team of writers yeah
23:22 - no one's going to be able to maybe
23:25 - people are going to be able to create
23:26 - prototypes of apps without being able to
23:28 - code but you're not going to be able to
23:30 - create a real app that you could put out
23:31 - in the world because you're not going to
23:33 - know all of the edge cases and security
23:35 - holes uh the performance issues that it
23:37 - might face you need to know how to code
23:40 - we're in this moment right now where
23:42 - because of chat gbt and large language
23:44 - models we're all imagining that AI is
23:46 - going to be this thing that we for the
23:48 - most part chat with I think a lot of
23:49 - people are thinking about oh well you
23:51 - could put text-to-speech and speech to
23:52 - text and you can start to to talk with
23:54 - it the way that you might do it Siri or
23:56 - Alexa but what we're trying to see is
23:58 - Technologies where the large language
24:01 - models can even though their language
24:03 - models can also understand writing and
24:05 - they can also generate images so these
24:07 - different dimensions of gender to AI are
24:09 - starting to converge so it's going to be
24:11 - really interesting over the coming years
24:12 - probably in the three to five year time
24:14 - Horizon where you're gonna a generative
24:18 - AI or an AI is going to be able to make
24:20 - sense of students writing it's going to
24:22 - be able to talk with them it's going to
24:23 - be able to listen in conversations and
24:25 - it's going to be able to make make
24:27 - insights about them so it's a really
24:29 - interesting time where the the chat the
24:32 - traditional chat interface that we all
24:33 - know from chat GPT I think might just be
24:35 - the stepping stone to something much
24:36 - richer
24:37 - how long how far away do you think we
24:40 - are from a point where an AI tutor is
24:43 - actually something that you can see and
24:45 - speak to and hear its responses I think
24:48 - 2025 2026 you'll be able to video
24:50 - conference with an AI tutor and it'll be
24:53 - pretty thoughtful it'll be able to
24:54 - remember you it'll have insights about
24:56 - you
24:57 - I think you know the other Trend that AI
25:00 - has almost leapfrogged in certain ways
25:01 - but Apple now is introducing its virtual
25:04 - reality headset but I I have a feeling
25:06 - that's going to take a little bit longer
25:07 - for that to get mainstream that's
25:08 - probably more in the five to ten year
25:10 - Horizon but yeah in 10 years I could
25:12 - imagine that it almost feels like you're
25:13 - in the room with a with an AI if you if
25:15 - you if you have your goggles on but uh
25:18 - you're going to be able to zoom with an
25:19 - AI in in the next three years yeah I
25:21 - don't know about the Virtual Reality
25:22 - Part just because of the weight on the
25:24 - head but video conferencing with an AI
25:26 - having a personal human-like tutor I
25:29 - agree is on the order of five years away
25:31 - and it's worth it for anybody in
25:33 - education to think about what is the
25:34 - world going to be like when every
25:36 - student with a computer with an internet
25:38 - access actually can get a one-on-one
25:40 - tutor it is a great story from the
25:42 - standpoint of equity because today only
25:44 - the wealthiest families can get
25:46 - one-on-one tutoring for their kids and
25:48 - now it's going to be something that not
25:50 - just with chatting but even talking is
25:52 - going to be available
25:54 - so if I'm a teacher who's new to this
25:57 - world of gender duvet I first I would
25:58 - tell them breathe relax even though it
26:01 - feels like the world is moving very fast
26:02 - just the fact that you are thinking
26:04 - about it right now means that you're
26:05 - still on on
26:07 - you're on The Cutting Edge No need no
26:10 - need to worry so especially if if you
26:13 - have a few Cycles if it's over the
26:14 - summer if it's over a holiday start
26:16 - playing with these tools you could go to
26:18 - something like chat GPT and you could
26:20 - probably make it immediately useful to
26:22 - yourself say hey help me plan a lesson
26:24 - help me create a rubric use conmigo
26:27 - conmigo has special purpose prompts and
26:30 - and layers in there that have the best
26:33 - practices of what does a good rubric
26:35 - look like what is a good lesson plan
26:37 - look like we have activities for
26:38 - teachers where they can refresh their
26:40 - own knowledge before they go into a
26:41 - lesson it can also help create exit
26:43 - tickets lesson plans rubrics learning
26:46 - objectives and then there's a whole
26:48 - bunch of activities for students some of
26:49 - them are just classic tutor me in in
26:51 - stem or tutor me in the humanities let's
26:53 - have a conversation with George
26:54 - Washington or we're about to read or
26:56 - we've just read the first three chapters
26:58 - of The Great Gatsby we have a special
27:00 - guest today kids Jay Gatsby himself and
27:03 - then you can this isn't science fiction
27:04 - that sounds like science fiction but
27:06 - literally this exists on on conmigo
27:08 - today and teachers can start playing
27:09 - with it literally right now
27:11 - you can also ask AI to give you a
27:15 - creative way to teach a certain topic
27:16 - you know if you have the same way you've
27:18 - taught something but you want to mix it
27:19 - up a little what's a creative way to
27:21 - teach and then enter the name of a topic
27:24 - and it'll come up with ideas that might
27:26 - not be ones that a teacher's thought of
27:27 - already so it's a great tool for
27:29 - brainstorming with
27:31 - no not at that point our most uh our
27:34 - most one of our most used activities by
27:36 - teachers already is create a lesson hook
27:37 - which is exactly that a lesson book a
27:39 - lesson hook like how do I get the kids
27:41 - excited and exactly we've been impressed
27:43 - with how creative the AI can get and
27:45 - once again it's not about deferring the
27:46 - creativity to the AI what happens is if
27:48 - you have two creative people in the room
27:49 - it doesn't make one person less creative
27:51 - it makes activity we've seen teachers
27:54 - riff with the AI and they're like well
27:55 - what about this and the a is like oh
27:56 - yeah and what about this and then they
27:57 - get it gets better and better to a place
27:59 - that neither party would have done on
28:00 - their own people talk about the risks of
28:03 - AI and education I actually think the
28:05 - biggest risk is doing nothing is just
28:08 - saying we're going to teach everything
28:09 - the exact same way as we always have
28:11 - been and sort of the head and sand
28:13 - approach of just like let's let's hope
28:15 - this technology goes away or prevent it
28:17 - from being used in our classrooms the
28:19 - biggest risk is teaching the exact same
28:22 - subjects the exact same way the real
28:24 - opportunity with AI is the job of
28:28 - teaching can become easier the job of
28:30 - learning can become more engaging and
28:32 - more personalized and just more creative
28:35 - and also some of the old stuff we may
28:37 - not need to teach anymore and there's
28:39 - new skills that students could learn
28:41 - they can learn creating with AI and
28:43 - develop superpowers that kids from last
28:46 - century didn't have
28:48 - wow there sure is a lot of potential in
28:51 - AI for education
28:53 - in the next session of this professional
28:54 - learning series we will dig deeper into
28:57 - AI as we explore what AI is and how
29:00 - teachers can use generative AI for tasks
29:02 - such as lesson planning creating
29:04 - classroom resources and saving time on
29:07 - administrative tasks
29:09 - if you are a teacher who constantly
29:11 - feels like there just isn't enough time
29:13 - in the day you definitely don't want to
29:15 - miss session two demystifying AI for
29:18 - educators in the meantime be sure to

Cleaned transcript:

foreign for teachers my name is Jess I'm a former teacher and now specialize in adult learning I will be your guide for this professional learning series artificial intelligence has become a Hot Topic in education leaving many Educators wondering about things like what is AI are my students going to use AI to cheat is AI going to replace me as a teacher what should I be teaching my students about AI throughout this professional learning series our goal is to answer these questions and more while also equipping you with the Knowledge and Skills you will need to navigate this new landscape in this session we will hear from Hadi partovy the creator of code.org and salcon the creator of Khan Academy let's hear what hottie and Sal have to say about some of the biggest questions related to AI in education AI has been around for many years but what's happened very recently with the launch of chat GPT and similar tools is that AI can actually generate information it can generate creative writing images even videos and so what used to be a tool for pattern matching can actually create new ideas new thoughts and the reason this is very important in education is there's so many aspects of Education work that either teachers do or that students do that can now be done automatically using generative AI so I know like both of us I'm sure it's just Tech nerds of sorts have been paying attention to generative AI for many years and you know yeah gpt2 which could write an Elon Musk famously said you know this this has to be controlled in some ways because it could write very convincing articles but it was nonsense what it was writing so it could be good for generating fake news gpt3 did similar things although it was just better at it which in some way ways made folks even more worried than things like Dolly came out where it showed that you could create images that you could have you know the Mona Lisa and you could tell the computer or the generative AI to say well what's what's the back of her head look like or what is the rest of the scene actually look like when I was monitoring all of that over the years I was just like oh this is cool but it's really just a a quirky thing it's not going to be really useful anytime soon especially in education and I think what really changed was that transition from gpt3 to either you could say GPT 3.5 which is chat gbt or more importantly gpt4 and that's when it really hit me that this thing that looked like a novelty for the last several years now could start to have un seemingly understand seemingly understand information and make sense of it and not just answer the question but explain why it chose that answer explain why the other choices are not the answer generate generative AI it could generate other questions like it and it could you could prompt it so that it could act as a tutor it could act as a teaching assistant and so that's when we started to appreciate okay the world is now different and this is not only going to be relevant to education but it's probably going to transform it in some pretty significant ways when you use a tool like chat GPT or any tool that's generating text or code as an AI these are based on an underlying technology called a large language model and a large language model is basically a giant neural network that has trained on all sorts of information all the books or articles or code that it can find on the internet and then can then actually generate new information new essays stories even writing new code and it's worth understanding that this technology is not truly intelligent it is just using statistics and probabilities to generate new information at code.org we're actually creating a video series explaining exactly how large language models work and in fact the chief technology officer of open AI Mira murati is one of the the stars of this video to talk about basically an explanation of large language models well one thing I will say because people have said oh it's just statistically figuring out the next best word to say in a lot of ways it's starting to teach us a little bit about ourselves like even when I'm talking right now you know when I'm speaking in in oral language I'm just expressing a series of thoughts that are coming and I'm not consciously deciding each next word I just know that the next word is going to be whatever it is going to be so large language models to your mentioned it was a neural it's neural net neural Nets are computer essentially computer simulations of neurons and synapses um and and they're starting to approach the complexity of at least large chunks of the human brain we're not at a point where AI is conscious of itself or has its own motivations and desires other than what we ask it to do but yeah it's worth noting that this probabilities and statistics the numbers inside of an AI and generally at large language models are basically literally the computer equivalent of the synapses and the connections in the nerves in your brain and you have trillions of nerves in your brain and the strengths of all those synapses of what forms your memories creates your thoughts and gives you all your of your intelligence in a large language model that's being simulated across literally millions of computers uh and is that intelligent it's at least a representation of how your brain works and it's interesting that it they this works on math your brain works on neurons but the outputs of what a large language model provides are quite similar to what humans do themselves I think pretty much anybody working in education is surprised was surprised to be able to ask AI to write an essay about the Civil War or explain photosynthesis or create a short story about a princess living on mars or write the code to you know to reverse to shuffle a deck of cards whatever it is these are things that you might think of as homework or as exams for teachers you can just ask it to make a lesson plan or to make a presentation about some Topic in history and it pretty much does all of it pretty well uh and it is really causing a need to rethink How We Do education and what's even I 100 agree what's even more amazing than that is it can answer these questions and do these tasks but then you could even ask it to take on roles and personas you can say B Robin Williams in Dead Poet Society and inspire me about literature and it did it and that's what that's what it's like this this is getting weird fast it's hard for schools to say what tools you do or don't use when you do homework so the reality is the way homework is taught or assigned in most schools today lots of it can be done automatically with AI when chat gbt first came out uh I showed it on the first day to my son he's 16 and his first question was can I use this for homework he was like excited uh and then while I was about to answer he said actually what's the point of school if this can even do all these things and those two questions are sort of the two bounds of what I think Educators need to think about because if we just continue assigning homework the way we have been yes you can use AI to do that and you could argue that that's cheating but I actually think we need to evolve what we think about as being the work that students need to do at home your point about homework you have very little control about what happens but I think it in some ways this shines a healthy Spotlight because before chat GPT you had chat big sister or or some people had parents or tutors and a lot of poor kids did not have any of those things the biggest inequity that forms in our school system is when the kids aren't in school it happens when you assign homework you or I can help our kids or we might be able to help get get a family member to do it or we might be able to hire a tutor a lot of families can't afford to do that that's where the inequity develops and if you can do more in school the better when you think about equity and AI there's two almost opposite things going on on the one hand AI closes an equity Gap in that every student who has access to it now can get basically a lowcost personalized tutor they can get a lot of things done that in the past you needed basically more money to get done AI basically provides a superpower to anybody who has access on the flip side the student who doesn't have internet access doesn't have a device whether it's a phone or a computer is actually now farther behind because they basically the gap of not having a computer became more costly than it was before because here's this yet another superpower that you don't have AI technology as a whole can have strengths and benefits as we've talked about but it also has downsides and risks it makes mistakes it could create misinformation it has biases it can have either a political bias or a racial or gender bias it might have uh it might get tricked into to creating dangerous content there's all sorts of potential pitfalls and this is part of why schools and educators are have in many cases hit on the brakes to say let's like not jump into this too quickly but it's worth noting that there isn't a single tool that is all of AI there's multiple tools coming out some of which are general purpose like chat GPT which is not even licensed for use by by students under the age of 18 but there's tons of tools that are being created specifically for the purpose of Education Khan Academy's con Migo being a great example of that where these tools have done specific things to protect against these risks and these these downsides sides to protect student privacy to prevent the creation of misinformation or hallucination or biases or or dangerous content so the most important jobs Educators or at least education I.T departments need to think about is not whether you ban AI or allow AI it's really choosing which tools are the ones you which AI tools are the ones that are ready for Education that address these downsides yeah I couldn't agree more and even on those very real downsides like bias and misinformation and making mistakes hallucinations I also always point out that you know compared to what is already there and what also has bias and the internet the internet has all of those issues other human beings have all of those issues and there's often not the transparency where you can audit what's what what was said or what what bias might be introduced so in some ways it's it's just an extension of a lot of that we were working on a generative Ai and large language models from about mid2022 and then we all remember end of November chat GPT comes out but that took the World by storm because when you chat with it it just seemed to feel a little bit more magical as we all remember but immediately the education community and teachers rightfully saw wait this thing can write essays and I'm sure a lot of students realize that this thing could write essays and it was a cheating tool and I was really worried because I was like yeah yes it can be a cheating tool and Chad gbt was not designed for education so in March when we were able to to launch what we call conmigo we were able to show that not only can you mitigate some of that you can create generative AIS that have guard rails everything that a student does it's monitorable by a teacher you could have a second AI monitor what the student's doing with it so if they do anything shady whether it's unproductive unhealthy behavior all the way to cheating it can actively notify the parents or actively notify the teacher and then on top of that create ways so the AI isn't doing the work for you but doing it with you so if you ask can we go to write your paper it won't but to say I can be your writing coach and so we think the future is actually going to be there's going to be certain tasks where I think teachers will say yes use whatever tool you want because that's happening in the workforce where sometimes you do want to use these tools to maybe write some parts or give you some revision or craft some parts of what what you're doing but then there's going to be other places where teachers are going to say I need to make sure you're writing this yourself so what we're doing on our side we're trying to create those tools where teachers can assign through the AI the AI can work with the student and the AI can report back to the teacher yeah I worked with them we did some outlining we did some brainstorming I gave them some feedback and this is where they are now and this is even my first pass at how they did according to the rubric when Educators think about generative AI the first thing they hear about or think about often is chat PPT because of its popularity and because it was the first popular sort of generative AI tool that took the World by storm but it's worth noting that almost every tool in Tech is going to have an element of generated AI built into it and this is actually most relevant as some schools early on banned chat gbt just to sort of say like can we stop this and figure it out but we should recognize that Microsoft Word is going to have generative AI it'll just create documents for you PowerPoint or Google Slides or Google spreadsheets or Excel they will generate formulas or generate slides there's even an app called gamma that will generate an entire presentation start to bottom you just give it a topic it'll give you an outline you edit the outline it generates the entire presentation for you there's coding tools that automatically write code and many of these are built on the same underlying technology as chat gbt you know the large language models uh but it's not there's not just one tool it'll be impossible to ban this in education because we won't be banning Microsoft Word and Google Docs usage in schools so schools need to figure out how to embrace that this technology is going to be available there's going to be tools like comigo that are designed specifically for education and then there's going to be tools that are designed for general purpose work but schools will need to figure out that students will have access to these whether they like it or not there's a lot of sort of questions being raised about is AI going to replace jobs uh and there may be some jobs that are completely replaced but when it comes to teaching I'm quite sure we're not going to have less of a need for teachers globally the world has a massive teacher shortage if AI can simply help make the job of teaching easier reduce the sort of hardship of teaching enable more personalized learning we might at least get to a point where we no longer have teacher shortages we're far from a worry of teachers losing jobs and we have such a dramatic shortage and what I believe AI is going to do is enable more personalized learning less busy work on the job of the teacher more coaching and facilitating and working with that kid who has a something is blocking them or they're struggling with something or they need a motivation boost or whatnot where so much of a teacher's day is busy doing things that aren't directly with that student AI should help us get us to a world where teachers spend more oneonone time with students and that is not a about Job losses in education it's about really empowering teachers to do the work that they really got into the field to do I couldn't agree with you more when I think of the jobs that are safest in this generative AI World anything that is really about that human connection and about kind of elevating and and almost being the conductor and of other human beings I think there's going to be a very good place to be and uh generative AI is going to make that job a lot more sustainable to your point the reason why we have the shortages because so much teacher burnout if you can take the administrative things off of a teacher's plate and also give them ways to support their students better in a more differentiated way they're going to be enjoying their their work more of what I've tell a lot of teachers is imagine if all of a sudden the Department of Education or your District said hey good news everyone we somehow found budget to give every one of you five teaching assistants who are just going to be there do what you need help you with lesson plans help your grade papers help you work with your students answer questions when you're not but they're going to report back to you and they're going to do exactly what you want I think every teacher would celebrate that's what's about to happen touch every industry at every possible part of it now I do want to make clear a lot of people have started differentiate which I think is an important thing between jobs and tasks I think it's going to allow a lot of folks to do more tasks more productively but it's not going to replace in many cases whole whole jobs so pretty much any job where you have to do any type of writing I think you're going to have a productivity Improvement at least 2x probably more any job where you have to create presentations you have to create any type of artifact uh probably I would say any job that involves working with a computer in any way is going to become in some way not replaced by AI but Easier by AI which means whether you're writing code whether you're reviewing contracts if you're writing a patent if you're reviewing a patent if you're creating marketing if you're posting to social media if you're creating a spreadsheet or analyzing data with a spreadsheet everywhere from marketing to sales to accounting you name it AI isn't going to replace your job it'll make your job easier because certain tasks that are repetitive will become completely automated certain tasks where you might have writer's block AI might make the first draft for you or help you out or give you corrections to basically reduce the time you need to spend to get the job done one of the things that's important is when you think about how much all digital work is going to be impacted by AI is recognizing how critical it is that our education system teaches students what this is how to use it how it works and what are its risks what are its strengths and weaknesses because right now most adults just treat it as a sort of magical tool like oh it just came out in its magic but it's important to actually understand the underpinnings of what is a large language model realizing that it's using statistics to generate its thoughts to realize that that statistical generation is why it could make mistakes and recognizing that it's been trained on data so the data that it's used to figure out what it's going to and could have biases could have you know missing gaps in the data things like that it's important for students to as they get prepared for this Workforce of the future to know how the technology they're using in these future jobs is actually working foreign so one thing that a lot of nonteachers don't realize but every teacher realizes is that almost half of their time is grading papers writing progress reports generating lesson plans and not in the classroom not students it might be happening but it's not facing the students and that's above and beyond all of the issues around in the typical classroom you might have three four five grade levels of students and so you're trying to differentiate and address all that but generative AI we think is going to be a huge gift to teachers almost everything else in edtech even if it's very valuable a lot of stuff we've historically done at Khan Academy we think it can really enhance what's happening in the classroom but teachers like oh it's just one more thing for me to learn and I'm already I'm already burnt out but what's exciting about generative AI that let's call it 10 15 20 hours a week where teachers are writing lesson plans writing progress reports rubrics Etc et cetera grading papers that might over the next few years come from 15 hours 20 hours a week down to a few hours week so that's going to save a lot of time and energy for teachers one to recharge themselves because they're getting spread too thin and also have more time and energy for their students and then of course it's going to help them create more differentiated instruction it's going to be able to support them as teaching assistants it's going to be able to support the students as Tutors or teaching assistants in the classroom so they'll also be able to to personalize more for their students yeah some of this is stuff that is already available and a lot of it is going to be worked into the tools that teachers already use to make grading easier creating rubrics or even add testing work against the rubrics is something that AI can now do for you so lots of tools are going to be incorporating this into them to make teachers lives easier even before a chat GPT and gender of AI people was like you know the world is changing so fast what do kids need to learn and they're they're oftentimes surprised that I said well you know it's actually the same traditional skills if you learn to write really well if you have a solid knowledge base say of civics financial literacy if you have uh you know how to use tools well and increasingly these are going to be technological tools you have strong critical thinking skills as you know probably at least as an algebra early algebra type type of level some statistics knowledge you're going to be quite potent in any point in history and I think that's going to be even more so in this generative AI Revolution a lot of people say well the gender of AI can write papers now the gender of AI is going to be able to solve the math problem but one way to think about it is students of the future are going to have to manage these generative Ai and if I told you that somebody's going to be an editor of a newspaper they're going to have to manage writers does that person need to know how to write and you're like not only do they need to know how to write they need to know how to write better now because they're going to be managing other people they're going to act as an editor so gender of AI doesn't give us a free pass to say oh no one has to learn any of this stuff anymore for the folks who want to operate in the knowledge economy and want to have really wellpositioned careers they need to elevate above the generative Ai and know how to manage those generative AI so that means not just understanding the tools but it actually means understanding the underlying skills that the generative AI is doing better than the AI itself if I think about the skills that are going to be most relevant for the future it's those things that you mentioned critical thinking problem solving Reading Writing I also think digital skills both knowing how to use digital tools but also actually understanding how they work are going to be more and more important in the workplace people also ask me all the time because I run code.org whether coding jobs are going to disappear because AI can now write code and it's very similar to writing AI can write essays does do we stop teaching writing anymore I don't think anybody is questioning whether we should stop teaching people to write because writing is a form of communication and for the exact same reason we shouldn't stop teaching coding as you mentioned they see the person who knows how to code just got a superpower because they can manage a team of coders that are AI just like a person who knows how to write gained a new superpower because AI can do they now have a team of writers yeah no one's going to be able to maybe people are going to be able to create prototypes of apps without being able to code but you're not going to be able to create a real app that you could put out in the world because you're not going to know all of the edge cases and security holes uh the performance issues that it might face you need to know how to code we're in this moment right now where because of chat gbt and large language models we're all imagining that AI is going to be this thing that we for the most part chat with I think a lot of people are thinking about oh well you could put texttospeech and speech to text and you can start to to talk with it the way that you might do it Siri or Alexa but what we're trying to see is Technologies where the large language models can even though their language models can also understand writing and they can also generate images so these different dimensions of gender to AI are starting to converge so it's going to be really interesting over the coming years probably in the three to five year time Horizon where you're gonna a generative AI or an AI is going to be able to make sense of students writing it's going to be able to talk with them it's going to be able to listen in conversations and it's going to be able to make make insights about them so it's a really interesting time where the the chat the traditional chat interface that we all know from chat GPT I think might just be the stepping stone to something much richer how long how far away do you think we are from a point where an AI tutor is actually something that you can see and speak to and hear its responses I think 2025 2026 you'll be able to video conference with an AI tutor and it'll be pretty thoughtful it'll be able to remember you it'll have insights about you I think you know the other Trend that AI has almost leapfrogged in certain ways but Apple now is introducing its virtual reality headset but I I have a feeling that's going to take a little bit longer for that to get mainstream that's probably more in the five to ten year Horizon but yeah in 10 years I could imagine that it almost feels like you're in the room with a with an AI if you if you if you have your goggles on but uh you're going to be able to zoom with an AI in in the next three years yeah I don't know about the Virtual Reality Part just because of the weight on the head but video conferencing with an AI having a personal humanlike tutor I agree is on the order of five years away and it's worth it for anybody in education to think about what is the world going to be like when every student with a computer with an internet access actually can get a oneonone tutor it is a great story from the standpoint of equity because today only the wealthiest families can get oneonone tutoring for their kids and now it's going to be something that not just with chatting but even talking is going to be available so if I'm a teacher who's new to this world of gender duvet I first I would tell them breathe relax even though it feels like the world is moving very fast just the fact that you are thinking about it right now means that you're still on on you're on The Cutting Edge No need no need to worry so especially if if you have a few Cycles if it's over the summer if it's over a holiday start playing with these tools you could go to something like chat GPT and you could probably make it immediately useful to yourself say hey help me plan a lesson help me create a rubric use conmigo conmigo has special purpose prompts and and layers in there that have the best practices of what does a good rubric look like what is a good lesson plan look like we have activities for teachers where they can refresh their own knowledge before they go into a lesson it can also help create exit tickets lesson plans rubrics learning objectives and then there's a whole bunch of activities for students some of them are just classic tutor me in in stem or tutor me in the humanities let's have a conversation with George Washington or we're about to read or we've just read the first three chapters of The Great Gatsby we have a special guest today kids Jay Gatsby himself and then you can this isn't science fiction that sounds like science fiction but literally this exists on on conmigo today and teachers can start playing with it literally right now you can also ask AI to give you a creative way to teach a certain topic you know if you have the same way you've taught something but you want to mix it up a little what's a creative way to teach and then enter the name of a topic and it'll come up with ideas that might not be ones that a teacher's thought of already so it's a great tool for brainstorming with no not at that point our most uh our most one of our most used activities by teachers already is create a lesson hook which is exactly that a lesson book a lesson hook like how do I get the kids excited and exactly we've been impressed with how creative the AI can get and once again it's not about deferring the creativity to the AI what happens is if you have two creative people in the room it doesn't make one person less creative it makes activity we've seen teachers riff with the AI and they're like well what about this and the a is like oh yeah and what about this and then they get it gets better and better to a place that neither party would have done on their own people talk about the risks of AI and education I actually think the biggest risk is doing nothing is just saying we're going to teach everything the exact same way as we always have been and sort of the head and sand approach of just like let's let's hope this technology goes away or prevent it from being used in our classrooms the biggest risk is teaching the exact same subjects the exact same way the real opportunity with AI is the job of teaching can become easier the job of learning can become more engaging and more personalized and just more creative and also some of the old stuff we may not need to teach anymore and there's new skills that students could learn they can learn creating with AI and develop superpowers that kids from last century didn't have wow there sure is a lot of potential in AI for education in the next session of this professional learning series we will dig deeper into AI as we explore what AI is and how teachers can use generative AI for tasks such as lesson planning creating classroom resources and saving time on administrative tasks if you are a teacher who constantly feels like there just isn't enough time in the day you definitely don't want to miss session two demystifying AI for educators in the meantime be sure to check out our two new instructional videos one video is all about chat Bots and large language models the other video addresses questions such as does AI really have creativity and Imagination these videos are a great way for teachers and students to learn more about generative Ai and how it works visit the AI 101 for teachers website at co.org AI 101 to view these videos and additional resources from code.org ETS iste and Khan Academy thanks for joining us see you again in session two foreign
