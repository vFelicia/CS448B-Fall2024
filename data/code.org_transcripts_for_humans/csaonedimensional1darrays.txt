00:22 - genius across the world came up with
00:24 - this an amazing idea that i get to use
00:26 - now there's always a new thing around
00:27 - the corner
00:29 - what if we had to store a lot of values
00:32 - so many values that it isn't practical
00:34 - to create a variable to manage each one
00:36 - individually
00:38 - arrays are one solution to this problem
00:41 - well what are arrays
00:43 - arrays are linear structures that store
00:45 - one or more values of the same data type
00:48 - imagine a bike rack bike racks have a
00:51 - fixed number of slots this one has four
00:53 - slots each slot can only hold one type
00:56 - of object a bike
00:58 - you can't park a tractor in this bike
01:00 - array we would need to put that tractor
01:02 - in its own tractor array
01:04 - let's see how we can use arrays when
01:06 - coding in java
01:08 - we can create a raise with the following
01:09 - steps
01:11 - first we write the data type which can
01:13 - be a primitive like an into our double
01:16 - or a reference like an object
01:18 - then we add square brackets
01:21 - then we add a variable name for the
01:23 - array
01:25 - after the assignment operator we add new
01:27 - data type this must match the type of
01:29 - data chosen earlier
01:32 - following this again we write square
01:33 - brackets this time with a length in
01:35 - between the two brackets
01:38 - the length is important because arrays
01:40 - are immutable this means that the
01:42 - structural parts the length and the data
01:44 - type cannot be changed
01:47 - just like the bike rack our array has a
01:49 - set number of spaces to store data
01:51 - together these spaces are called an
01:53 - index
01:54 - in java an index starts at zero and goes
01:57 - up it ends at the length of the array
01:59 - minus one
02:01 - arrays allow us to store multiple values
02:03 - of the same type together with one
02:06 - variable
