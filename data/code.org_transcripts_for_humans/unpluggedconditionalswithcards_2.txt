This activity is called coding with cards and it's great for any age. Like you learned with the if statements in earlier lessons, during Blockly, if statements have a piece about them you have to evaluate to find out if it's true or false. That's the conditional and it can be used in lots of different ways. We take advantage of that by creating programs on paper that you run using a random draw of playing cards. You might have an if statement that says something like if the card you draw is greater than 8, you get a point. Otherwise, your opponent gets a point. You can make it as simple or as complicated as you feel comfortable.
