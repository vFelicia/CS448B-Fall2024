00:00 - My name is Caia, and I'm a poet
and a computer science student.
00:05 - I've learned so much from coding
that's made me a better poet
00:08 - and so much about
my poetry has made me better at coding.
00:13 - Just because you have to really think
about the words that you choose
00:16 - and what you're going to create
once it all comes together
00:21 - over the next hour,
you're going to learn about
00:24 - computer science and poetry
by creating an animated poem.
00:28 - In essence,
poetry is making art with words.
00:31 - I create poetry to express myself.
00:34 - I try to stir
the audience's imagination and emotions
00:37 - when I write by using my unique style
and rhythm just like art.
00:42 - Poems can be interpreted
in many different ways.

01:10 - You'll have the opportunity
to illustrate and animate
01:13 - the mood of a poem based on
how it makes you feel.
01:16 - Let's take a look at how you'll do this
using code.
01:21 - You'll see that your screen is split
01:22 - into three main parts
01:25 - on the left is the play space.
01:28 - This is where your animated poem
will show up.
01:30 - Each poem has a title and an author.
01:34 - This middle area is the toolbox,
no blocks of code
01:38 - will become available in this space
as you go through the lesson.
01:43 - The space on the right is the workspace.
01:45 - You can drag blocks out of the tool box
and into the workspace
01:49 - to build your program.
01:52 - The instructions
01:53 - for each level will be up here
at the top of the screen.
01:57 - If you want a hint.
01:58 - Click on the light bulb.
02:01 - first, select a poem you like.
02:04 - There are all kinds of poems and

that matches the mood of your poem.
02:19 - Then click Run to see your poem
in action.
02:25 - We'll spend some time
reading the different poems
02:28 - and find one that sparks an emotion
