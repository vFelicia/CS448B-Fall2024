With timestamps:

00:00 - [Music]
00:10 - let's make an array to store three
00:12 - temperatures the type of data i want to
00:15 - store is type double the number of
00:17 - spaces in the index is three
00:19 - to add an element to my array i type the
00:21 - name of the array let's call it temps
00:23 - short for temperature
00:25 - next add square brackets and write the
00:28 - index space where the element is stored
00:30 - then add the assignment operator and the
00:32 - new value in this case the value is the
00:35 - temperature measured in fahrenheit i can
00:37 - set up my whole array this way
00:40 - alternatively we can create an array
00:43 - that already has all of its values
00:44 - assigned we'll set up the array the same
00:47 - way as before but after the assignment
00:49 - operator instead of writing new we put a
00:52 - pair of curly braces
00:54 - inside of the curly braces we write each
00:56 - of the values we would like to store in
00:57 - our array
01:00 - in this case there are three values
01:02 - between the curly braces so the length
01:04 - of our array is three you can add as
01:06 - many values as you like
01:08 - for our temperature array the setup
01:10 - looks like this
01:14 - once the values are put into the array
01:16 - we can easily access them we use the
01:19 - index to get values from the array or
01:21 - update values in the array
01:24 - for example if i wanted to change the
01:26 - first temperature in my array from 75.6
01:29 - to 85.1
01:30 - i would type the name of the array temps
01:33 - and then inside the square brackets i
01:34 - would type the index which is zero
01:36 - zero refers to the first position in the
01:39 - array then after the assignment operator
01:41 - i would put the new value 85.1
01:45 - sometimes you might want to get elements
01:47 - from your array and store them in new
01:48 - variables
01:49 - you can do that
01:51 - let's say i want to store the second
01:53 - temperature in my list in a variable
01:55 - called noon temp
01:57 - i would declare my variable type double
01:59 - and name noon temp then after the
02:02 - assignment operator write the name of
02:03 - the array which is called temps and the
02:06 - index in square brackets now the
02:08 - variable noon temp points to the second
02:10 - value that is at index 1 in my temps
02:12 - array
02:14 - now that we can create our own arrays
02:16 - we're going to have a much easier time
02:18 - managing multiple pieces of data at once
