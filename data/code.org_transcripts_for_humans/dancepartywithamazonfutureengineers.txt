00:03 - future engineer program and today we
00:05 - brought 15 of our amazon future engineer
00:08 - interns to code.org to help them build
00:11 - hour of code dance party backgrounds all
00:14 - of us have been working on p5.js trying
00:16 - to figure out
00:17 - how to create nice little designs for
00:19 - the backgrounds i'm doing a whole bunch
00:21 - of different stars that are going to all
00:22 - like spread out in cool ways so that
00:25 - kids all around the world can have more
00:27 - cool backgrounds to play with so that
00:29 - they can keep learning and getting
00:30 - inspired by computer science a lot of
00:32 - creativity happening a lot of code a lot
00:34 - of fun happening
00:36 - i think with the afe program um they're
00:39 - definitely been very supportive so it
00:41 - feels like there's really someone there
00:42 - who cares about you and is looking out
00:44 - for you

00:47 - so much in this past summer i've gotten
00:49 - exposed to
00:51 - what it actually is to be a software
00:53 - development engineer it's really cool
00:56 - being able to take what you learned in a
00:59 - like classroom setting and applying it
01:01 - to like real world stuff computer
01:03 - science isn't just like tech or like
01:05 - stem it's problem solving it's figuring
01:08 - out ways to do things before that no one
01:11 - has thought of yet
01:12 - some people think you'd be a genius to
01:14 - like get it and understand it and it's
01:16 - so far from the truth honestly computer
01:18 - science is so broad that whatever you
01:20 - care about whatever you're passionate
01:21 - about you can make that happen
01:24 - it's really exciting to see all the
01:25 - different opportunities and all the
01:27 - things i can go into if i want to
01:29 - computer science
01:30 - changed my life computer science is the
01:32 - reason why i'm able to intern at amazon
01:35 - today
01:36 - computer science is for everyone
01:40 - change the world
01:41 - start with an hour of code
