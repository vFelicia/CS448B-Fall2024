00:04 - I think non-financial use cases of
00:07 - blockchain are just emerging the biggest
00:08 - such application currently are nfts or
00:11 - non-fungible tokens which represent
00:13 - unique assets things like Collectibles
00:15 - primarily today but there's been an
00:17 - explosion of representing other types of
00:20 - assets things like carbon credits real
00:22 - estate Securities and those kinds of
00:24 - things fundamentally you can think of
00:25 - blockchain as creating more efficient
00:29 - usage or exchanges in almost any Arena
00:33 - one way to use blockchain is to track
00:35 - energy and and how it's used throughout
00:38 - a grid and being able to then help
00:41 - people figure out how to use it much
00:43 - more efficiently
00:45 - any time where there's like a contract
00:47 - the participants they need some level of
00:50 - trust right and usually we bring in
00:51 - lawyers to do that and it's great
00:52 - lawyers are an awesome solution to that
00:54 - they're also an expensive solution to
00:55 - that blockchains can create situations
00:57 - they can't solve every problem but they
00:59 - can create situations where we don't
01:01 - necessarily need a lawyer to be involved
01:03 - because things that the lawyer would
01:05 - take care of can happen on the
01:06 - blockchain in a way that everyone can
01:08 - trust currently when we upload photos or
01:10 - videos we don't actually have ownership
01:12 - over that data so there's a huge
01:14 - opportunity in terms of how do we
01:15 - communicate with people that we love but
01:17 - also how do we create online
01:19 - [Music]
01:20 - what excites me most about blockchain is
01:22 - the opportunity to deal with the wealth
01:25 - Gap blockchain enables opportunity
01:27 - because in this space we get to
01:29 - de-identify ourselves and now I'm able
01:31 - to interact with people anonymously or
01:34 - pseudo anonymously with just as a series
01:36 - of numbers my public key and I can
01:39 - participate in any type of use cases
01:41 - that I want without having that
01:44 - regulation preventing me simply because
01:46 - you know I'm of a particular demographic
01:48 - or a particular gender My Hope for the
01:51 - future of blockchain is that we find
01:54 - ways to solve problems that we haven't
01:58 - been very good at solving Financial
01:59 - inclusions an obvious one blockchain
02:02 - technology either by itself will solve
02:05 - this problem or it will push governments
02:08 - to put in more sensible regulation to
02:12 - have more sensible policies on access
02:15 - that'll solve the problem the thing that
02:18 - keeps me up at night that I'm really
02:19 - worried about is that we will wind up
02:21 - whether accidentally or deliberately
02:23 - rebuilding the same biases that we have
02:26 - in our existing system
02:27 - foreign
02:31 - there definitely are environmental
02:33 - impacts when it comes to blockchain
02:35 - technology with Bitcoin it's proof of
02:37 - work and proof of work requires energy
02:39 - consumption but the value that Bitcoin
02:41 - brings is much higher than that energy
02:43 - consumption the environmental impacts
02:46 - are disastrous in the case of the proof
02:49 - of work Technologies that's Bitcoin as
02:52 - an example so proof of stake is another
02:53 - form of consensus system we have
02:56 - stakeholders that stake on a on a
02:59 - blockchain to say that this block is
03:01 - valid so using proof of stake we're
03:04 - actually not expending any electricity
03:05 - usage a lot of people believe that it's
03:07 - it's less decentralized so I think
03:09 - you're going to see blockchain reducing
03:11 - its own carbon footprint meanwhile
03:13 - providing Technologies and abilities
03:15 - that will help improve things outside of
03:16 - the blockchain space
03:17 - [Music]
03:19 - I believe that crypto currency in
03:21 - blockchain are going to continue to grow
03:22 - and be widely adopted it's true that it
03:25 - goes through Cycles so sometimes we'll
03:26 - see a massive run-up and then a
03:27 - correction but if you zoom out over
03:29 - these from one cycle to the next it
03:31 - continues to grow at a really rapid Pace
03:34 - my biggest concern with blockchain
03:36 - technology is that it's developing very
03:38 - fast but the regulators and governments
03:41 - don't really understand it they don't
03:43 - know how to regulate it they will
03:45 - eventually but short term they don't and
03:49 - it's important to agree across countries
03:52 - not just in one country it's already
03:54 - become a an underlying layer for lots of
03:57 - systems and applications worldwide and
03:59 - so it's pretty difficult to at this
04:00 - point stop using blockchains do I think
04:02 - decentralized permissionless open
04:04 - networks are here to say I certainly
04:07 - hope so and I think Bitcoin demonstrated
04:09 - that they are at least that one seems to
04:11 - be over a decade in existence will the
04:13 - new one survive it's really anybody's
04:15 - guess it's impossible to know for any
04:18 - new thing we need a lot of evidence to
04:19 - believe that it's really going to be the
04:21 - next big thing and in the case of
04:23 - blockchain we just don't have that
04:24 - evidence yet blockchain's helping push
04:26 - the technology it's pushing ideas it's
04:28 - pushing competition but sometimes the
04:31 - first mover isn't the one who wins
