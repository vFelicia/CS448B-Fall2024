00:00 - have you ever heard of debugging a
00:01 - program
00:03 - this is the way you figure out what's
00:04 - not working
00:06 - when you debug code you identify and
00:08 - remove errors
00:10 - so here we're given a few blocks already
00:12 - in our workspace we're going to use the
00:15 - step button to walk through the blocks
00:17 - step by step to see if this is the right
00:19 - solution and where we may need to fix it
00:23 - looks like there's our problem we need
00:25 - one more move forward block
00:28 - the step button helps us debug
00:30 - our program by identifying where the
00:32 - error is so we can fix it
