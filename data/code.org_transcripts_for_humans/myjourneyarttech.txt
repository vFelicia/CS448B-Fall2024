01:36 - question when you were in elementary
01:37 - school
01:38 - um what was your most prized stuffy or
01:42 - uh item so when i was uh my first
01:45 - birthday i actually got a little teddy
01:47 - bear that was um my favorite uh stuffed
01:50 - animal and i just called him teddy and i
01:52 - have two little boys who are seven and
01:54 - four and they have little stuffed dogs
01:56 - that they sleep with and they love so i
01:58 - just want to hear what's your most what
01:59 - was your most prized um
02:02 - uh possession at that age whether it was
02:04 - when you were in kindergarten or fourth
02:05 - or fifth grade um so let's go ahead and
02:07 - start with uh tomas and then you can
02:09 - tell us about what you do
02:12 - all right well that's an easy one uh my
02:14 - favorite uh
02:16 - stuffed animal when i was a kid was a
02:18 - rabbit named henry
02:20 - uh my grandma gave to me
02:22 - probably around the time i was six years
02:24 - old and he is still residing in my
02:27 - parents house he made it all the way
02:29 - through our childhood on many family
02:31 - trips and
02:32 - many long journeys uh every time i'm
02:34 - over there my dog does try and find him
02:38 - uh with the intention of destroying him
02:40 - but so far has been unsuccessful so
02:41 - henry continues to live
02:43 - um
02:45 - so and just introduce myself my name is
02:47 - thomas garcia
02:49 - i am the assistant vice
02:51 - president of technology and digital
02:53 - alaca which essentially means i oversee
02:55 - all of the technology and digital things
02:57 - that happen in the museum happen online
02:59 - around the museum
03:01 - um and get to work with a lot of really
03:03 - cool people like joel
03:08 - thanks thomas
03:09 - um
03:10 - so yeah my name is joel ferry and i am
03:13 - the program director of uh the
03:17 - art and technology lab at the
03:20 - la county museum of art
03:22 - and um
03:24 - let's see let me start with my my
03:26 - stuffed animal question
03:29 - so i had a stuffed animal dog um
03:33 - i left when i was really little i left
03:36 - i think i had a teddy bear
03:38 - and i was on a trip with my parents and
03:41 - we left
03:42 - the teddy bear in a motel room
03:45 - and i think i'm pretty as i remember it
03:47 - was in colorado and by the time i
03:49 - remembered
03:51 - that i forgot my stuffed animal we were
03:53 - in kansas
03:54 - and so it was kind of out of the
03:56 - question
03:57 - you know going back to get it um
04:01 - so i i got a new stuffed animal while i
04:03 - was on the road
04:05 - and it was a stuffed it was like a
04:06 - stuffed dog
04:08 - um
04:09 - and
04:10 - i named him ruff ruff
04:12 - and you know i think my sister actually
04:15 - still has ruff ruff
04:17 - uh but anyway it was like ruff ruff
04:20 - became my constant companion after that
04:23 - um
04:25 - so what do i do i run the art and
04:27 - technology lab program at lacma
04:30 - and what that is it's a grant program so
04:33 - we provide grants
04:34 - to artists
04:36 - uh that are working in technology in
04:38 - some way
04:40 - that are
04:40 - that are bringing technology into their
04:43 - artwork uh so we we help them produce
04:46 - their their work and we also give them a
04:49 - grant of up to fifty thousand dollars
04:54 - that's great thank you both so much and
04:57 - uh as a parent i know what that's like
04:59 - when you have a child losing a stuffy
05:01 - and having to go back and retrace your
05:03 - steps and yes going a whole nother state
05:05 - is usually out of the question
05:07 - um so i want to go back to tomas i want
05:09 - you to tell us a little bit more about
05:11 - the work at lacma and
05:14 - um some of the the projects you all are
05:16 - working on so if any of us happen to be
05:18 - in the los angeles area and want to
05:20 - visit what are some of the things we
05:21 - might be seeing
05:25 - absolutely um so you should be able to
05:27 - see on my screen a picture of laugh but
05:29 - it's probably the most
05:31 - recognizable picture of laughter around
05:34 - uh very popular on instagram and
05:37 - uh in in media and television shows and
05:40 - movies this is an artwork we have
05:41 - atletico called urban light um right in
05:43 - front of museums so if you if you've
05:45 - ever driven
05:46 - past these lights you've seen lacquer if
05:48 - you've ever been to these flights you've
05:49 - been to lacma um but lacma is a large
05:52 - museum in los angeles the largest uh
05:54 - encyclopedic museum on the western half
05:57 - of the united states and what that means
05:59 - is that we collect
06:00 - and exhibit a lot of different styles of
06:02 - art so while something like this is
06:04 - maybe our most famous uh we also have a
06:07 - really great collections of ancient
06:09 - american art
06:10 - uh we have uh exhibitions that come
06:13 - through about uh movies and and films
06:16 - uh we had an exhibition uh during the
06:19 - world cup around soccer
06:21 - uh we have japanese art you see samurai
06:25 - excuse me from a recent exhibition
06:27 - chinese art
06:29 - art on fashion and clothing
06:33 - this one is also a very recognizable
06:35 - piece this is the rain room uh which we
06:37 - had a few years back
06:38 - many of you may have seen that uh in
06:40 - which it rained in a room and wherever
06:42 - you were standing the rain stopped
06:45 - and then right now we're very excited to
06:47 - have the obama portrait tour in town
06:50 - many of you may recognize these images
06:52 - of uh former president barack obama
06:54 - former first lady michelle obama
06:57 - and they are at the museum right now so
06:59 - if you're in los angeles area i
07:01 - definitely recommend coming by they're
07:03 - really amazing portraits and we have a
07:05 - uh
07:06 - exhibition on you as well called black
07:08 - american portraits that showcases a wide
07:10 - variety of portraiture of black
07:12 - americans over the past uh three
07:14 - centuries so it's a really exciting
07:16 - place to work
07:18 - um it's a really you know meaningful
07:20 - museum for our community because it
07:21 - showcases a lot of different parts of
07:23 - different cultures different places and
07:26 - sort of you know helps to give the
07:28 - community more information and context
07:30 - around you know why that artwork exists
07:33 - why it's important
07:34 - um and you know why we should be uh
07:37 - considerate and aware of other cultures
07:39 - uh other artistic forms
07:42 - uh and just
07:43 - you know
07:44 - maintain a a positive and open uh
07:48 - uh mindset as as we look at art and look
07:51 - through our history
07:54 - thanks so much tomas
07:56 - so joel um given that we're talking to
07:59 - students um who are tuning in you know
08:02 - at code.org we obviously have an
08:04 - interest in technology but what i really
08:06 - like about your job is that it's the
08:08 - visual art and technology can you talk a
08:10 - little bit more about um about how that
08:13 - how that works if you're interested in
08:15 - art but you're also interested in tech
08:17 - tell us about tell us more about that
08:21 - sure so
08:23 - um we work with a wide range of artists
08:26 - we work with some artists
08:28 - that um come into our program with some
08:32 - pretty sophisticated technological
08:34 - skills
08:35 - um
08:36 - and we also work with artists that don't
08:39 - sometimes you know the artists that
08:41 - we'll work with will come in and they'll
08:43 - they'll have a sort of creative problem
08:46 - that they're looking to solve
08:48 - by producing an artwork and they know
08:50 - that they want to use technology to
08:53 - create it or to solve that problem but
08:56 - they don't know how
08:58 - but luckily we have an advisory board
09:01 - from a
09:02 - number of technology companies as well
09:05 - as from universities and independent
09:08 - artists
09:09 - who
09:10 - are able to help our grant recipients
09:13 - um
09:14 - come up with a technological solution
09:16 - um you know whether it's implementing
09:19 - uh
09:22 - robotics whether it's
09:24 - scripting
09:25 - something in uh
09:27 - java or
09:29 - python or you know one of the one of the
09:32 - many many languages
09:34 - um
09:35 - sometimes it's it's uh you know it's a
09:38 - very unexpected solution
09:41 - um
09:42 - we've we've done like very sophisticated
09:44 - 3d modeling
09:46 - of uh lacmas antipode which is the place
09:51 - on the exact opposite side of the earth
09:53 - from where you're standing
09:55 - and um we needed we're working with an
09:58 - artist to help image this or to imagine
10:00 - what lachman's antipoa looked like and
10:04 - um
10:06 - we did all this 3d modeling and what
10:08 - have you but in the end when it came to
10:10 - producing the physical sculpture of the
10:13 - anticode we ended up just hiring a
10:15 - sculptor who could work in marble and um
10:19 - you know so it was a very uh uh
10:21 - analog solution but it had a very
10:25 - sophisticated technological means of
10:27 - getting there and that's you know that's
10:30 - that's i feel like working with art and
10:32 - technology you know you're you're really
10:34 - trying to
10:36 - stay within the the marriage of those
10:38 - two and stay true to the creative
10:41 - impulse um while still you know
10:45 - leveraging all the power that that
10:48 - technology can provide you as an artist
10:52 - thank you so much joel we started
10:53 - getting a couple of um questions in the
10:55 - chat so again as a reminder to our
10:57 - teacher friends for tuning in with their
10:59 - classes feel free to put
11:01 - questions in the chat uh what your what
11:03 - grade your students are in and what the
11:05 - question is um before we get to those i
11:07 - would love to ask because we're talking
11:08 - about your work but we also know you're
11:11 - both creative individuals and have
11:13 - different passions outside of technology
11:15 - and art
11:16 - can you talk to us a little bit about
11:18 - what you like to do outside of work and
11:20 - i'll start with tomas
11:25 - sure um yeah outside of work i
11:29 - uh let's see i really
11:31 - have i'd say
11:33 - three main passions uh one of them is is
11:36 - just creating things and tinkering
11:38 - things and learning new things
11:40 - um recently i've uh been working on i
11:44 - learned how to program uh some video
11:47 - games and here's a simple
11:49 - video game project i was working on in
11:51 - which uh santa claus is uh trying to
11:54 - compete with a reindeer to collect the
11:57 - most cookies
11:58 - which ties in one of my other big
12:00 - passions which is christmas i really
12:02 - like christmas
12:03 - um
12:04 - another project i worked in on recently
12:06 - is digital rendering
12:08 - this is a digital rendering i made
12:10 - recently of
12:11 - a space with neon sign and my dad in it
12:15 - uh and which ties in one of my other
12:17 - passions which is neon
12:19 - this is a neon sign i made recently
12:22 - of an astronaut obviously
12:24 - uh and if you look closely you can see
12:26 - his visor is sort of mirrored so that
12:28 - when you look at the sign you see
12:29 - yourself in the face mask to remind
12:32 - yourself that you know anything you
12:33 - really want to do you can achieve if you
12:36 - put in uh the effort and then last but
12:39 - not least which i may have mentioned
12:40 - already is
12:42 - is my dog is definitely a big uh
12:45 - uh
12:46 - passion of mine in my free time we do a
12:48 - lot of things together so
12:50 - you know i think i think uh
12:52 - a mixture of of digital and non-digital
12:56 - and uh uh
12:58 - uh al all sorts of all over the map when
13:01 - it comes to my personal life but uh
13:03 - those are definitely
13:04 - things that keep me busy when i'm not at
13:06 - work
13:07 - that's great thanks so much tamask
13:09 - um and i'll ask you to stop screen
13:11 - sharing because i want to see maybe joel
13:13 - has some some interesting things to show
13:15 - us so joel what do you do
13:17 - um outside of work and you know what
13:19 - kind of projects are you working on
13:22 - um for me i i there's kind of two other
13:26 - things in my life
13:27 - one is i like to try
13:30 - i like to go hiking or or biking
13:34 - out in the wilderness um
13:36 - i like to try and find a place
13:39 - on the map that is like one of the most
13:41 - far away
13:43 - uh remote locations that is like you
13:46 - know within a day's worth of driving
13:48 - distance
13:50 - and then i i i typically will go there
13:52 - and i'll spend the night there
13:54 - um and just really kind of
13:57 - enjoy the peace and quiet the solitude
14:01 - um the landscape
14:03 - and
14:04 - um the you know and also you know just
14:07 - the the temporary disconnect from uh
14:11 - the internet and from technology it's
14:14 - it's just a nice way to kind of clear
14:16 - your head
14:17 - and um you know recharge your your
14:20 - batteries
14:21 - so um
14:23 - that i think is is one of my favorite
14:25 - things and i'll spend you know count
14:27 - right before doing this i'll spend
14:29 - countless hours
14:30 - studying the map and trying to figure
14:32 - out what the you know the lay of the
14:34 - land and how to get there and everything
14:37 - um how much water you have to bring how
14:40 - much food you have to bring all that
14:42 - planning is is part of the fun
14:45 - so um
14:46 - that you know that's a that's a passion
14:49 - and then i guess my other passion is um
14:52 - [Music]
14:53 - buying old bicycles taking them apart
14:56 - and then
14:57 - rebuilding them so
14:59 - i think i can my computer will will stay
15:02 - awake um i could show you my workshop
15:05 - which is actually right next to my
15:06 - office so yes please we would love to
15:09 - see that we would love to see your
15:10 - workshop
15:11 - okay hang on one sec
15:17 - this is so fun i can't wait
15:22 - [Music]
15:28 - i'm gonna get like an impromptu tour
15:33 - this is the garage
15:37 - let's see if my cat's awake
15:42 - my cat lives in the garage
15:48 - all right so
15:50 - well it's dark is it spooky oh that's so
15:53 - fun
15:54 - so you can kind of see this here yeah so
15:56 - this is my current project
15:58 - um this is an old mountain bike that i
16:01 - kind of hacked apart and
16:03 - um
16:04 - took some some different bike parts and
16:07 - put on it kind of like that you know
16:10 - i go i have a big bin of parts of random
16:13 - bike parts that i keep over here
16:17 - but
16:19 - i actually just sorted it out it doesn't
16:21 - look very tidy but actually that's very
16:24 - organized for me
16:25 - um
16:26 - but generally i like to
16:30 - take them apart i'll spend hours just
16:32 - trying new solutions
16:34 - to see if i can get certain bike parts
16:37 - to work that normally shouldn't work
16:38 - together
16:40 - and um
16:41 - when it does work it's really gratifying
16:43 - because you can end up with like a
16:44 - really cool bike that you know no one
16:46 - else has
16:48 - so and that's kind of also building
16:50 - bikes it's so much learning by doing and
16:53 - trial and error that
16:54 - it's you know when you get to a point
16:56 - where you have a really cool bike it's a
16:58 - lot of fun
16:59 - and then you can
17:01 - put some bags on it and go ride out into
17:03 - the wilderness so
17:05 - wow that is so cool thank you for
17:07 - sharing your workshop and
17:09 - um your passion both of you
17:11 - so in the in the 10 minutes we have left
17:13 - i really want to hear from our students
17:16 - and one of the questions here is from
17:19 - um i don't know if this is chamber's
17:20 - last name or the teacher's name but a
17:22 - fifth grade class the fifth grade class
17:24 - is asking um which has been your most
17:27 - difficult piece to create
17:29 - so i will leave it up to you to answer
17:32 - do you what's what's been the most
17:33 - difficult thing that you yourself have
17:35 - created or
17:37 - what has been one of the most difficult
17:39 - pieces that lacma artists have created
17:41 - maybe something that's kind of way out
17:43 - there and just a very time consuming or
17:45 - tough so i'll let each of you choose
17:47 - which one to answer but um let's start
17:49 - with tomas
17:52 - sure um we've we've got a lot of
17:55 - difficult projects let's see
17:57 - i'll i'll start with um some exciting
17:59 - ones that i think are relevant to
18:01 - conversation today
18:05 - we recently did a partnership with
18:07 - snapchat which is
18:08 - an app many of you may know and use in
18:10 - which we created augmented reality uh
18:13 - monuments around los angeles and so uh
18:16 - you can see here this is sort of what it
18:17 - looked like if you're at the park
18:19 - and then and through your phone screen
18:21 - you would see all these different um
18:23 - augmented reality pieces that the artist
18:25 - reuben ochoa came up with to display in
18:28 - the park and this is macarthur park in
18:29 - downtown los angeles uh as a
18:32 - honor to uh uh the the people who uh
18:36 - sell food
18:37 - um in stands in the park uh uh
18:40 - vendors and and um so it was a really
18:43 - cool project but really you know on the
18:45 - cutting edge of technology uh at the
18:47 - same time we did one um that showcased
18:50 - the story of ada pinkston
18:52 - um
18:53 - an african-american woman from uh uh
18:56 - early la history who who was a
18:59 - significant landowner and a significant
19:00 - role in uh los angeles history who had
19:03 - been sort of forgotten from some of the
19:05 - uh
19:06 - la histories and we really wanted to
19:08 - showcase her story and uh there's audio
19:11 - playing of her voice and when you go to
19:12 - the park you can experience her through
19:14 - an augmented reality experience
19:17 - um so those are really difficult there's
19:19 - a lot of other difficult projects that
19:20 - have happened but
19:22 - these ones are really cool because they
19:23 - sort of sort of told stories that you
19:24 - might not otherwise think of when you
19:26 - think of monuments
19:28 - um so it was really exciting project but
19:30 - i know joel has a lot of
19:32 - crazy and difficult projects i
19:34 - definitely want to leave some time for
19:36 - him to share those
19:40 - sure thanks tomas yeah that that
19:43 - snapchat collaboration was super cool
19:46 - and i think that the ada pinkson one is
19:48 - one of my favorites of that series that
19:50 - y'all did so
19:52 - very cool um
19:54 - for the art and tech program you know we
19:57 - we really try and work with the artists
19:59 - to realize what their vision is
20:02 - and that vision
20:04 - it's constantly changing and so we
20:07 - worked with an artist named tavares
20:09 - strzok who came into our program
20:12 - and he was really interested in
20:14 - launching
20:15 - um these small sort of glass model
20:18 - rockets
20:19 - um kind of like what you'd get in a
20:21 - hobby store or something
20:23 - but they're really beautiful he was me
20:25 - he was making them out of glass and he
20:27 - was making the glass from uh he's from
20:30 - the bahamas and so he made
20:33 - the glass out of sand that came from the
20:35 - bahamas or these beautiful little model
20:38 - rockets that he was launching
20:40 - and
20:41 - in our program he he we introduced him
20:44 - to the
20:46 - one of the
20:47 - directors of spacex
20:49 - um the rocket company
20:52 - and
20:53 - they got into a conversation and before
20:56 - we knew it
20:57 - we were going to be launching a
20:58 - satellite into space um a satellite that
21:01 - contained an artwork
21:03 - and all of a sudden
21:05 - you know i was at one point just
21:07 - thinking okay yeah we'll you know maybe
21:08 - launch some model rockets and um you
21:11 - know try and see if we can have an
21:13 - exhibition or something and
21:14 - well and now at this point we're we're
21:17 - actually trying to figure out how to get
21:19 - an artwork into space
21:21 - so that was a very steep learning curve
21:24 - um but
21:25 - we did uh
21:27 - we were able to i mean there was a lot
21:30 - of many many many many conversations
21:32 - that we had to have it was a lot of work
21:34 - it took us five years
21:36 - to do this just just to make the
21:39 - satellite
21:40 - um to meet all the requirements um
21:44 - for an artwork to be in space there's
21:47 - certain materials you have to use
21:49 - there's certain testing you have to go
21:51 - through
21:52 - um
21:53 - you have to talk to all these different
21:55 - government agencies and
21:57 - you know confirm with them that what
21:59 - you're doing isn't going to hurt
22:01 - everything else that's floating around
22:02 - in space
22:04 - but um actually it's
22:06 - it's going to be in
22:09 - i think our three-year anniversary of
22:11 - launching uh our enoch sculpture and
22:14 - that's the name of the artwork
22:16 - um our three-year anniversary is coming
22:18 - up in this early december
22:21 - so in this satellite that we launched
22:24 - it's about the size of a shoe box and
22:27 - it's orbiting earth like as we speak and
22:29 - i can go online and anyone can go online
22:32 - and if you google like um
22:34 - a uh
22:36 - satellite tracker if you just google
22:37 - like satellite tracker and then you type
22:39 - in
22:40 - lacma enoch you'll
22:42 - our satellite will show up and it will
22:44 - tell you where it is uh you know over
22:47 - the earth at this current moment so
22:49 - that's a really gratifying project that
22:52 - was really fraught with uh pitfalls
22:55 - but we were able to push through and
22:57 - realize it
22:58 - so
22:59 - that is so cool kids make sure you ask
23:02 - your teachers at some point maybe um
23:04 - after the thanksgiving holidays to
23:07 - please show you um the satellite tracker
23:09 - that is such a fun
23:11 - um an interesting thing i didn't even
23:13 - know that existed so it could be a
23:15 - lesson plan out of that probably
23:17 - um there was a question in here asking
23:19 - from miss woodward's class in
23:21 - connecticut the students would like to
23:23 - know where alexis is are you sitting in
23:24 - a museum i am not i was mentioning at
23:27 - the start i know some folks jumped on
23:29 - late i am actually at the most magical
23:31 - place on earth i am at walt disney world
23:34 - right now and i am sitting in a
23:37 - hotel
23:38 - kind of lobby area and i'll just show
23:41 - you really quick and it's obviously the
23:42 - holiday so they're decorating it with
23:44 - christmas trees and
23:46 - um yeah it's a fun little space so
23:49 - that's where i'm at um and thanks for
23:50 - asking
23:52 - so
23:53 - let's see the next question
23:55 - there are a lot of them here
24:03 - so uh victoria is actually um at home
24:06 - and victoria would like to know what was
24:08 - your favorite subject when you were a
24:11 - kid
24:12 - joel let's start with you
24:17 - all right that's a good question um
24:20 - all right i'm in a minute my favorite
24:22 - subject actually i mean well this is
24:24 - kind of obvious now but it was art
24:27 - but i wasn't
24:29 - an artist um
24:31 - that was you know the tricky thing is
24:33 - that i i may have had like a lot of
24:35 - creative ideas but
24:37 - i couldn't draw i couldn't i wasn't very
24:40 - good with sculpture and and
24:42 - when i was in lower school i really
24:44 - struggled with with art class just i
24:47 - mean i could do things that involved
24:49 - like collages and stuff like that but i
24:51 - just i just didn't my hands weren't good
24:53 - enough for me to draw
24:55 - um and so that kind of held me back for
24:58 - a long time
25:00 - until middle school when i took my first
25:02 - photography class and i got my hands on
25:04 - a camera
25:05 - and
25:06 - i guess that was the first time that i
25:08 - really started i realized that you know
25:11 - it when you start working with
25:13 - technology it can really help people who
25:15 - are creative who may not
25:16 - be able to come up with a sort of analog
25:19 - solution or you know a pencil and paper
25:21 - kind of solution but maybe
25:24 - work doing something on a computer can
25:25 - really help
25:27 - and i was one of those kids that you
25:29 - know technology really helped them
25:33 - find a way to ex express themselves um
25:38 - and so yeah that was sort of my earlier
25:41 - interests
25:44 - thanks joel
25:45 - what did you enjoy studying in what was
25:47 - your favorite subject
25:51 - you may have been able to tell from my
25:53 - uh
25:54 - response on the snapchat augmented
25:56 - reality project but history was my
25:58 - favorite i really love you know looking
26:00 - back in time and finding interesting
26:02 - stories all of the interesting people
26:04 - that have come before us
26:05 - understanding how we got you know to the
26:08 - world that we live in today and really
26:10 - just appreciating you know
26:13 - the that all of the things that we've
26:15 - accomplished um you know all the things
26:17 - that uh we can learn from
26:20 - and and and just you know look through
26:22 - that uh deep through history and try to
26:24 - apply those things to our lives
26:26 - um at the time i you know i wasn't keen
26:29 - on uh subjects like math uh because i
26:32 - didn't understand how they applied but
26:34 - as i got older and realized you know
26:36 - that like math is everywhere and
26:37 - everything we do like has some element
26:39 - of math in it uh even like joel was
26:42 - saying with planning a camping trip
26:44 - uh i also really started to appreciate
26:46 - math just because it was something that
26:48 - you know once you sort of understood it
26:49 - you could use it every day and it wasn't
26:52 - always you know something you'd have to
26:54 - write out on a chalkboard or a piece of
26:56 - paper you could really just you know
26:57 - think about it in your head and it'd
26:59 - help you get through your days so those
27:01 - are probably my top two
27:04 - thanks so much um we are almost out of
27:07 - time here but there was a question again
27:09 - from chambers fifth grade
27:10 - class um i don't know joel if you'd be
27:13 - able to answer it live if you just click
27:15 - on answer live in the in the q a and
27:17 - type in
27:18 - what the the name of the satellite is um
27:21 - the students were asking about that
27:26 - yeah so you just click on q a and then
27:28 - you scroll down to chamber fifth grade
27:30 - class and answer type answer and then

Cleaned transcript:

hi friends welcome my name is alexis i work at code.org and you are here with us today i want you to welcome you to my journey chat today i'm here with my friends joel and tomas and i'm actually coming to you from walt disney world resort in florida and the reason why my friend eric is here is just in case my connection drops because i am in a place where the connection is not great um eric is going to jump in and and help us out here but hopefully that won't happen um so to start off today i we're going to be hearing from um our friends over at the l.a county museum of art joel and tomas before we get into our discussion i want to open it up with a fun question and i want you to answer the question and then tell us what you do at lacma and how your work helps our community um because you both have awesome jobs so the question and i'll i'll be the first to answer it when you were in actually i'm sorry i forgot one piece we have students and teachers joining us from all over the world primarily in the united states please type in um uh your questions in the chat throughout today's discussion and let us know who's t whose class you're in your teacher's name and what your question is and we will get to as many of those questions as we can and let us know where you're coming from so with that um we're going to start off with the question when you were in elementary school um what was your most prized stuffy or uh item so when i was uh my first birthday i actually got a little teddy bear that was um my favorite uh stuffed animal and i just called him teddy and i have two little boys who are seven and four and they have little stuffed dogs that they sleep with and they love so i just want to hear what's your most what was your most prized um uh possession at that age whether it was when you were in kindergarten or fourth or fifth grade um so let's go ahead and start with uh tomas and then you can tell us about what you do all right well that's an easy one uh my favorite uh stuffed animal when i was a kid was a rabbit named henry uh my grandma gave to me probably around the time i was six years old and he is still residing in my parents house he made it all the way through our childhood on many family trips and many long journeys uh every time i'm over there my dog does try and find him uh with the intention of destroying him but so far has been unsuccessful so henry continues to live um so and just introduce myself my name is thomas garcia i am the assistant vice president of technology and digital alaca which essentially means i oversee all of the technology and digital things that happen in the museum happen online around the museum um and get to work with a lot of really cool people like joel thanks thomas um so yeah my name is joel ferry and i am the program director of uh the art and technology lab at the la county museum of art and um let's see let me start with my my stuffed animal question so i had a stuffed animal dog um i left when i was really little i left i think i had a teddy bear and i was on a trip with my parents and we left the teddy bear in a motel room and i think i'm pretty as i remember it was in colorado and by the time i remembered that i forgot my stuffed animal we were in kansas and so it was kind of out of the question you know going back to get it um so i i got a new stuffed animal while i was on the road and it was a stuffed it was like a stuffed dog um and i named him ruff ruff and you know i think my sister actually still has ruff ruff uh but anyway it was like ruff ruff became my constant companion after that um so what do i do i run the art and technology lab program at lacma and what that is it's a grant program so we provide grants to artists uh that are working in technology in some way that are that are bringing technology into their artwork uh so we we help them produce their their work and we also give them a grant of up to fifty thousand dollars that's great thank you both so much and uh as a parent i know what that's like when you have a child losing a stuffy and having to go back and retrace your steps and yes going a whole nother state is usually out of the question um so i want to go back to tomas i want you to tell us a little bit more about the work at lacma and um some of the the projects you all are working on so if any of us happen to be in the los angeles area and want to visit what are some of the things we might be seeing absolutely um so you should be able to see on my screen a picture of laugh but it's probably the most recognizable picture of laughter around uh very popular on instagram and uh in in media and television shows and movies this is an artwork we have atletico called urban light um right in front of museums so if you if you've ever driven past these lights you've seen lacquer if you've ever been to these flights you've been to lacma um but lacma is a large museum in los angeles the largest uh encyclopedic museum on the western half of the united states and what that means is that we collect and exhibit a lot of different styles of art so while something like this is maybe our most famous uh we also have a really great collections of ancient american art uh we have uh exhibitions that come through about uh movies and and films uh we had an exhibition uh during the world cup around soccer uh we have japanese art you see samurai excuse me from a recent exhibition chinese art art on fashion and clothing this one is also a very recognizable piece this is the rain room uh which we had a few years back many of you may have seen that uh in which it rained in a room and wherever you were standing the rain stopped and then right now we're very excited to have the obama portrait tour in town many of you may recognize these images of uh former president barack obama former first lady michelle obama and they are at the museum right now so if you're in los angeles area i definitely recommend coming by they're really amazing portraits and we have a uh exhibition on you as well called black american portraits that showcases a wide variety of portraiture of black americans over the past uh three centuries so it's a really exciting place to work um it's a really you know meaningful museum for our community because it showcases a lot of different parts of different cultures different places and sort of you know helps to give the community more information and context around you know why that artwork exists why it's important um and you know why we should be uh considerate and aware of other cultures uh other artistic forms uh and just you know maintain a a positive and open uh uh mindset as as we look at art and look through our history thanks so much tomas so joel um given that we're talking to students um who are tuning in you know at code.org we obviously have an interest in technology but what i really like about your job is that it's the visual art and technology can you talk a little bit more about um about how that how that works if you're interested in art but you're also interested in tech tell us about tell us more about that sure so um we work with a wide range of artists we work with some artists that um come into our program with some pretty sophisticated technological skills um and we also work with artists that don't sometimes you know the artists that we'll work with will come in and they'll they'll have a sort of creative problem that they're looking to solve by producing an artwork and they know that they want to use technology to create it or to solve that problem but they don't know how but luckily we have an advisory board from a number of technology companies as well as from universities and independent artists who are able to help our grant recipients um come up with a technological solution um you know whether it's implementing uh robotics whether it's scripting something in uh java or python or you know one of the one of the many many languages um sometimes it's it's uh you know it's a very unexpected solution um we've we've done like very sophisticated 3d modeling of uh lacmas antipode which is the place on the exact opposite side of the earth from where you're standing and um we needed we're working with an artist to help image this or to imagine what lachman's antipoa looked like and um we did all this 3d modeling and what have you but in the end when it came to producing the physical sculpture of the anticode we ended up just hiring a sculptor who could work in marble and um you know so it was a very uh uh analog solution but it had a very sophisticated technological means of getting there and that's you know that's that's i feel like working with art and technology you know you're you're really trying to stay within the the marriage of those two and stay true to the creative impulse um while still you know leveraging all the power that that technology can provide you as an artist thank you so much joel we started getting a couple of um questions in the chat so again as a reminder to our teacher friends for tuning in with their classes feel free to put questions in the chat uh what your what grade your students are in and what the question is um before we get to those i would love to ask because we're talking about your work but we also know you're both creative individuals and have different passions outside of technology and art can you talk to us a little bit about what you like to do outside of work and i'll start with tomas sure um yeah outside of work i uh let's see i really have i'd say three main passions uh one of them is is just creating things and tinkering things and learning new things um recently i've uh been working on i learned how to program uh some video games and here's a simple video game project i was working on in which uh santa claus is uh trying to compete with a reindeer to collect the most cookies which ties in one of my other big passions which is christmas i really like christmas um another project i worked in on recently is digital rendering this is a digital rendering i made recently of a space with neon sign and my dad in it uh and which ties in one of my other passions which is neon this is a neon sign i made recently of an astronaut obviously uh and if you look closely you can see his visor is sort of mirrored so that when you look at the sign you see yourself in the face mask to remind yourself that you know anything you really want to do you can achieve if you put in uh the effort and then last but not least which i may have mentioned already is is my dog is definitely a big uh uh passion of mine in my free time we do a lot of things together so you know i think i think uh a mixture of of digital and nondigital and uh uh uh al all sorts of all over the map when it comes to my personal life but uh those are definitely things that keep me busy when i'm not at work that's great thanks so much tamask um and i'll ask you to stop screen sharing because i want to see maybe joel has some some interesting things to show us so joel what do you do um outside of work and you know what kind of projects are you working on um for me i i there's kind of two other things in my life one is i like to try i like to go hiking or or biking out in the wilderness um i like to try and find a place on the map that is like one of the most far away uh remote locations that is like you know within a day's worth of driving distance and then i i i typically will go there and i'll spend the night there um and just really kind of enjoy the peace and quiet the solitude um the landscape and um the you know and also you know just the the temporary disconnect from uh the internet and from technology it's it's just a nice way to kind of clear your head and um you know recharge your your batteries so um that i think is is one of my favorite things and i'll spend you know count right before doing this i'll spend countless hours studying the map and trying to figure out what the you know the lay of the land and how to get there and everything um how much water you have to bring how much food you have to bring all that planning is is part of the fun so um that you know that's a that's a passion and then i guess my other passion is um buying old bicycles taking them apart and then rebuilding them so i think i can my computer will will stay awake um i could show you my workshop which is actually right next to my office so yes please we would love to see that we would love to see your workshop okay hang on one sec this is so fun i can't wait i'm gonna get like an impromptu tour this is the garage let's see if my cat's awake my cat lives in the garage all right so well it's dark is it spooky oh that's so fun so you can kind of see this here yeah so this is my current project um this is an old mountain bike that i kind of hacked apart and um took some some different bike parts and put on it kind of like that you know i go i have a big bin of parts of random bike parts that i keep over here but i actually just sorted it out it doesn't look very tidy but actually that's very organized for me um but generally i like to take them apart i'll spend hours just trying new solutions to see if i can get certain bike parts to work that normally shouldn't work together and um when it does work it's really gratifying because you can end up with like a really cool bike that you know no one else has so and that's kind of also building bikes it's so much learning by doing and trial and error that it's you know when you get to a point where you have a really cool bike it's a lot of fun and then you can put some bags on it and go ride out into the wilderness so wow that is so cool thank you for sharing your workshop and um your passion both of you so in the in the 10 minutes we have left i really want to hear from our students and one of the questions here is from um i don't know if this is chamber's last name or the teacher's name but a fifth grade class the fifth grade class is asking um which has been your most difficult piece to create so i will leave it up to you to answer do you what's what's been the most difficult thing that you yourself have created or what has been one of the most difficult pieces that lacma artists have created maybe something that's kind of way out there and just a very time consuming or tough so i'll let each of you choose which one to answer but um let's start with tomas sure um we've we've got a lot of difficult projects let's see i'll i'll start with um some exciting ones that i think are relevant to conversation today we recently did a partnership with snapchat which is an app many of you may know and use in which we created augmented reality uh monuments around los angeles and so uh you can see here this is sort of what it looked like if you're at the park and then and through your phone screen you would see all these different um augmented reality pieces that the artist reuben ochoa came up with to display in the park and this is macarthur park in downtown los angeles uh as a honor to uh uh the the people who uh sell food um in stands in the park uh uh vendors and and um so it was a really cool project but really you know on the cutting edge of technology uh at the same time we did one um that showcased the story of ada pinkston um an africanamerican woman from uh uh early la history who who was a significant landowner and a significant role in uh los angeles history who had been sort of forgotten from some of the uh la histories and we really wanted to showcase her story and uh there's audio playing of her voice and when you go to the park you can experience her through an augmented reality experience um so those are really difficult there's a lot of other difficult projects that have happened but these ones are really cool because they sort of sort of told stories that you might not otherwise think of when you think of monuments um so it was really exciting project but i know joel has a lot of crazy and difficult projects i definitely want to leave some time for him to share those sure thanks tomas yeah that that snapchat collaboration was super cool and i think that the ada pinkson one is one of my favorites of that series that y'all did so very cool um for the art and tech program you know we we really try and work with the artists to realize what their vision is and that vision it's constantly changing and so we worked with an artist named tavares strzok who came into our program and he was really interested in launching um these small sort of glass model rockets um kind of like what you'd get in a hobby store or something but they're really beautiful he was me he was making them out of glass and he was making the glass from uh he's from the bahamas and so he made the glass out of sand that came from the bahamas or these beautiful little model rockets that he was launching and in our program he he we introduced him to the one of the directors of spacex um the rocket company and they got into a conversation and before we knew it we were going to be launching a satellite into space um a satellite that contained an artwork and all of a sudden you know i was at one point just thinking okay yeah we'll you know maybe launch some model rockets and um you know try and see if we can have an exhibition or something and well and now at this point we're we're actually trying to figure out how to get an artwork into space so that was a very steep learning curve um but we did uh we were able to i mean there was a lot of many many many many conversations that we had to have it was a lot of work it took us five years to do this just just to make the satellite um to meet all the requirements um for an artwork to be in space there's certain materials you have to use there's certain testing you have to go through um you have to talk to all these different government agencies and you know confirm with them that what you're doing isn't going to hurt everything else that's floating around in space but um actually it's it's going to be in i think our threeyear anniversary of launching uh our enoch sculpture and that's the name of the artwork um our threeyear anniversary is coming up in this early december so in this satellite that we launched it's about the size of a shoe box and it's orbiting earth like as we speak and i can go online and anyone can go online and if you google like um a uh satellite tracker if you just google like satellite tracker and then you type in lacma enoch you'll our satellite will show up and it will tell you where it is uh you know over the earth at this current moment so that's a really gratifying project that was really fraught with uh pitfalls but we were able to push through and realize it so that is so cool kids make sure you ask your teachers at some point maybe um after the thanksgiving holidays to please show you um the satellite tracker that is such a fun um an interesting thing i didn't even know that existed so it could be a lesson plan out of that probably um there was a question in here asking from miss woodward's class in connecticut the students would like to know where alexis is are you sitting in a museum i am not i was mentioning at the start i know some folks jumped on late i am actually at the most magical place on earth i am at walt disney world right now and i am sitting in a hotel kind of lobby area and i'll just show you really quick and it's obviously the holiday so they're decorating it with christmas trees and um yeah it's a fun little space so that's where i'm at um and thanks for asking so let's see the next question there are a lot of them here so uh victoria is actually um at home and victoria would like to know what was your favorite subject when you were a kid joel let's start with you all right that's a good question um all right i'm in a minute my favorite subject actually i mean well this is kind of obvious now but it was art but i wasn't an artist um that was you know the tricky thing is that i i may have had like a lot of creative ideas but i couldn't draw i couldn't i wasn't very good with sculpture and and when i was in lower school i really struggled with with art class just i mean i could do things that involved like collages and stuff like that but i just i just didn't my hands weren't good enough for me to draw um and so that kind of held me back for a long time until middle school when i took my first photography class and i got my hands on a camera and i guess that was the first time that i really started i realized that you know it when you start working with technology it can really help people who are creative who may not be able to come up with a sort of analog solution or you know a pencil and paper kind of solution but maybe work doing something on a computer can really help and i was one of those kids that you know technology really helped them find a way to ex express themselves um and so yeah that was sort of my earlier interests thanks joel what did you enjoy studying in what was your favorite subject you may have been able to tell from my uh response on the snapchat augmented reality project but history was my favorite i really love you know looking back in time and finding interesting stories all of the interesting people that have come before us understanding how we got you know to the world that we live in today and really just appreciating you know the that all of the things that we've accomplished um you know all the things that uh we can learn from and and and just you know look through that uh deep through history and try to apply those things to our lives um at the time i you know i wasn't keen on uh subjects like math uh because i didn't understand how they applied but as i got older and realized you know that like math is everywhere and everything we do like has some element of math in it uh even like joel was saying with planning a camping trip uh i also really started to appreciate math just because it was something that you know once you sort of understood it you could use it every day and it wasn't always you know something you'd have to write out on a chalkboard or a piece of paper you could really just you know think about it in your head and it'd help you get through your days so those are probably my top two thanks so much um we are almost out of time here but there was a question again from chambers fifth grade class um i don't know joel if you'd be able to answer it live if you just click on answer live in the in the q a and type in what the the name of the satellite is um the students were asking about that yeah so you just click on q a and then you scroll down to chamber fifth grade class and answer type answer and then answer live um in the last minute thank you so in the last minute one question uh and please keep it keep it brief since we are almost out of time who helped you along your journey who was the person that helped you most achieve your success and get to where you are hamas um yeah there's so many people uh obviously you know my parents uh my grandparents uh you know all the people family but also teachers teachers have been huge along the way uh you know always there to sort of support when you have questions and and and push that curiosity the natural curiosity and so i definitely think my teachers along the way um and then you know as i started working my bosses uh a boss that joel and i both had amy was a really big influence uh on me and i know on joel as well and definitely really just you know a teacher for me as an adult uh someone who encouraged me to continue exploring curiosity and and you know let me know that my ideas mattered and uh supported me thanks so much unfortunately we are out of time um but i think that was a great ending to a really fun uh chat today again thanks to all of our friends and all of our teachers and classrooms who tuned in from all over um and thank you so much to lakma and uh joel and tomas for giving us of your time and everybody who asks questions i want everybody to have a great day and um please continue exploring your passions and interests bye friends thanks everyone have a great day thanks everybody
