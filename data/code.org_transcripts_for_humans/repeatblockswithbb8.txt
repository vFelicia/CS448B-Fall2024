00:08 - This is a repeat block.
00:10 - The code inside a repeat block will repeat, or "loop", as
many times as you'd like.
00:15 - In puzzles with BB-8, code that looks like this, works
exactly the same as code like this.
00:24 - When you see the same block repeated over
and over many times in a row like this, that is a clue
00:30 - that you can make your code shorter by moving the repeated section into
a repeat block.
00:36 - Now let's give it a try.

This is a repeat block. The code inside a repeat block will repeat, or "loop", as many times as you'd like. In puzzles with BB8, code that looks like this, works exactly the same as code like this. When you see the same block repeated over and over many times in a row like this, that is a clue that you can make your code shorter by moving the repeated section into a repeat block. Now let's give it a try.
