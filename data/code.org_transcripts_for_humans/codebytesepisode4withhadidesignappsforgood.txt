00:16 - hi there and welcome to code bites
00:19 - hi
00:19 - i'm here with my son darius darius how
00:22 - old are you 13
00:24 - he's 13 years old and we're excited to
00:26 - celebrate the fourth day of computer
00:27 - science education week
00:29 - you know all of this week throughout the
00:31 - country and all around the world
00:33 - tens of millions of students are
00:35 - participating in the hour of code to get
00:37 - an introduction to computer science and
00:39 - to celebrate this technology that is
00:41 - changing the society all around us
00:44 - and we have a very special birthday to
00:46 - celebrate today
00:48 - and that we're actually going to ask a
00:49 - poll to help you find out whose birthday
00:51 - it is it's the birthday of the person
00:53 - who wrote the first computer program
00:56 - so can we put up the poll on the screen
00:58 - who wrote the first computer program
01:01 - we have four choices
01:03 - ada lovelace born in 1815
01:06 - albert einstein born in 1879
01:09 - grace topper born in 1906
01:13 - and bill gates born in 1955.
01:18 - and look at that folks are answering the
01:19 - poll right now looks like the winner is
01:22 - bill gates
01:23 - no no grace hopper in 1906.
01:27 - all right almost everybody has voted so
01:30 - let's share the results of the poll
01:32 - yes so you can see uh
01:34 - most people think it's grace hopper who
01:36 - was born in 1906 and then there's kind
01:39 - of a tie between ada loveless and bill
01:41 - gates
01:43 - darius do you know the answer for this
01:45 - it's
01:46 - right
01:47 - let's see
01:48 - so i'm gonna share my screen
01:52 - [Music]
01:58 - and yes it's ada loveless and what's
02:01 - pretty incredible about this is ada
02:02 - loveless who was born in the early 1800s
02:06 - she wrote the first computer program
02:08 - 100 years before the first modern
02:11 - computer was invented
02:13 - and this is interesting it goes to show
02:14 - that computer programming isn't just
02:17 - about technology and electronics it's
02:19 - something you can do it's really more
02:21 - sort of about problem solving and
02:24 - algorithmic thinking computational
02:26 - thinking it's also why so many computer
02:28 - scientists learn computer science
02:30 - without a computer i i initially learned
02:33 - in a classroom with a whiteboard without
02:35 - any devices and if you want to see the
02:37 - computer that ada loveless used
02:40 - she didn't actually use this it was a
02:42 - theoretical idea of a wooden machine
02:44 - called the babbage machine
02:46 - and she wrote a computer program for how
02:48 - to control that little device
02:51 - it's kind of cool
02:53 - so
02:54 - one thing i want to do before we get
02:56 - started with today's lesson is to find
02:57 - out where everybody's from uh if folks
03:00 - could go into the chat area and type
03:02 - where your calling in from and
03:05 - unfortunately those of you who are on
03:06 - zoom
03:07 - uh won't have that but there's can you
03:09 - read off some of the locations as you
03:10 - see them michigan india toronto
03:14 - canada
03:15 - billy's
03:16 - florida uav
03:19 - arab emirates united arab emirates
03:21 - that's amazing that means it's 8 p.m
03:24 - over there sri lanka wow
03:27 - richmond hill wow that is all over the
03:29 - world
03:30 - uh all right well let's close the chat
03:32 - for now
03:33 - there's a lot of stuff there that's
03:35 - right so today what we're gonna talk
03:37 - about uh
03:39 - actually since there's some spam can you
03:41 - reopen the chat
03:43 - and can everybody just type your first
03:45 - name in
03:46 - just to make that spam scroll away
03:49 - all right thank you now we can close the
03:51 - chat
03:52 - all right
03:53 - um
03:54 - we're not going to use the chat anymore
03:56 - today because some some students are
03:58 - basically posting is probably not
03:59 - students it's spammers we're just
04:01 - posting random youtube urls that we
04:02 - don't want to distract people with so
04:05 - today we're going to talk about
04:07 - the theme of this week's computer
04:09 - science education week is computer
04:10 - science for good so what we're going to
04:12 - do is create some apps uh apps that are
04:16 - basically designed to basically help
04:17 - make the world a better place because
04:18 - one of the more important things with
04:20 - technology is figuring out not just what
04:22 - you can do with a computer but what you
04:25 - should do with a computer how to use
04:26 - technology to help our world
04:28 - so the first app we want to make
04:30 - is going to be based on volunteering in
04:32 - our region darius and i live in
04:35 - the area of seattle washington and
04:37 - bellevue just in the seattle metro area
04:39 - so i'm going to demo the app that i
04:42 - started working on and then darius is
04:44 - going to help finish it
04:47 - so
04:47 - in just one second
04:49 - we're going to go into app lab
04:54 - so here we are in app lab if you can see
04:56 - my screen
05:00 - and
05:01 - the app that we're building here
05:04 - you can see the app on the left and the
05:06 - code is going to be on the right and i'm
05:08 - going to run this app and it's not
05:10 - complete yet it shows some of the ways
05:11 - you can help in your local community and
05:14 - this area is empty but if you want one
05:15 - of these areas is to help with a food
05:17 - bank and to volunteer and you click here
05:19 - and it shows you options for different
05:22 - food banks and says you can donate or
05:23 - volunteer at a food bank to help those
05:25 - who are in need in the pandemic but of
05:27 - course wear a mask
05:29 - and we can go back here and i want to
05:31 - add another volunteering option with
05:33 - darius
05:34 - you ready for this
05:36 - okay
05:37 - right so um
05:39 - first i want first you can see up here
05:41 - we can do code mode or design mode we're
05:43 - gonna go into design mode to add some
05:45 - features to our app so first can you
05:48 - make a button like that
05:50 - you can drag a button out
05:53 - like that yeah
05:55 - and then make it larger
05:57 - button wait
05:59 - you can just drag it from the corner if
06:00 - you want that's cool
06:04 - oops
06:08 - oh there
06:11 - and then if you want to make it look
06:13 - kind of cool with that border you can
06:15 - change its border size if you scroll
06:17 - down here
06:18 - and make the border width like 10 or
06:20 - something
06:24 - but look how it's yours is more square
06:26 - and that's more curly so you can change
06:28 - the border radius a little bit too
06:31 - you can make i like card is a border
06:33 - color
06:34 - well what if i mean
06:37 - change the border radius to like
06:39 - i don't know
06:40 - you can hit the little arrow buttons to
06:42 - move those up and down
06:43 - it makes it more of a curvy button
06:45 - perfect
06:46 - and you want to make the border a little
06:48 - bit larger too so it's similar to the
06:50 - other border the other button
06:51 - [Music]
06:52 - yeah yeah
06:54 - cool and now pick an image to put in
06:57 - this and i want to make our volunteering
06:59 - place to be about cats and dogs so
07:01 - choose this image
07:05 - all right so we're going to do an animal
07:07 - shelter kind of volunteering thing
07:11 - and
07:12 - the other thing i wanted to do is to get
07:13 - rid of this text for this button here
07:18 - so this isn't super pretty one of the
07:20 - things we can do in app lab is change
07:22 - themes for our app so click on the theme
07:25 - area
07:27 - here yeah
07:28 - look at all those different themes but
07:30 - let's use a poll to ask what theme we
07:32 - should use
07:34 - can we display the poll up on the screen
07:36 - so you can choose the orange or glow in
07:39 - the dark or coral reef or blue steel no
07:43 - no don't don't choose them yet it's
07:44 - showing are you showing the options
07:46 - that's orange well it looks like
07:47 - everyone's doing glow in the dark anyway
07:52 - that's glow in the dark
07:55 - choose coral reef
07:58 - all right let's close the poll because
08:00 - and share the results it looks like
08:02 - almost everybody wanted glow in the dark
08:05 - so
08:06 - click stop sharing there
08:11 - all right so we're now in the glow in
08:12 - the dark theme with our buttons here
08:15 - so
08:16 - now what we want to do is if you look
08:18 - over here
08:20 - we have
08:21 - the
08:21 - home screen and the food screen the food
08:24 - screen is the one that i showed you here
08:26 - we want to make a screen that looks like
08:27 - this but that is for uh
08:30 - working at a you know
08:32 - supporting an animal shelter so there's
08:34 - multiple different ways we can make a
08:36 - screen like this we can either
08:38 - make a new screen or we can duplicate
08:41 - this existing screen
08:43 - the easy way would be to duplicate but i
08:45 - want to make it a little bit more work
08:46 - for you to show how design mode works so
08:49 - can you click to choose new
08:52 - screen now we're going to make a new
08:54 - screen do you want to pick a theme for
08:56 - this screen to make it slightly
08:57 - different than all the other ones
09:00 - i think our second choice that from the
09:01 - audience was orange so you could go with
09:03 - that if you want orange i think i
09:05 - thought it was blue steel okay choose
09:07 - blue steel that sounds good to me really
09:08 - matter
09:10 - i don't know why these aren't
09:11 - all right
09:12 - oh they're loose
09:14 - right so for this drag out two buttons
09:18 - or make one button you can then
09:19 - duplicate it and look how the button in
09:21 - blue steel has got extra round corners
09:23 - but make it bigger
09:24 - and kind of square
09:28 - bigger bigger bigger or bigger
09:29 - okay
09:30 - and if you want to make it totally
09:32 - circle shaped you can make the button
09:33 - radius
09:35 - even larger so
09:38 - that's a perfect square okay so scroll
09:40 - down see where it says border radius
09:43 - make that bigger and bigger until it
09:44 - becomes round just hold click your mouse
09:46 - and hold on it and see it makes all
09:48 - right now you have an all-around button
09:51 - and you can make the border with like 10
09:53 - to make it a thick
09:54 - border
09:55 - there you go
09:57 - and now choose an image for this button
10:00 - and let's choose the cap
10:03 - all right and then delete the text for
10:05 - button to cue cat all right and now we
10:07 - can duplicate this button
10:09 - to make another button
10:12 - and have this one
10:14 - have the dog
10:17 - all right
10:19 - and these are sort of our choices for
10:21 - the animal shelter
10:23 - and then lastly i'm going to make
10:24 - another button
10:25 - that is for going home and we'll put
10:28 - this up here
10:32 - and for this button we can look we if
10:34 - you want to choose the image for this
10:36 - you can also choose icons so can you
10:38 - type home
10:41 - home
10:42 - oh that icon is barely visible because
10:44 - it's covered by the text
10:46 - right there's our home button so now i
10:48 - want to show what happens how do we jump
10:50 - from the home screen to come to this
10:52 - screen we need to write some code and
10:55 - the question is what code should we
10:58 - use so which block should we use to
11:01 - change the screen when the button is
11:03 - clicked we can use an on event block a
11:07 - show element block a set check block or
11:09 - a set screen block let's do a poll to
11:12 - see what the our students think
11:14 - how do we change the screen
11:16 - to find out when the button is clicked
11:19 - we change the screen
11:22 - right most people are saying it's set
11:24 - screen but a lot of people are saying on
11:26 - event
11:28 - some people are saying show elements
11:30 - some people are saying set checked
11:32 - but the most popular one they say is set
11:34 - screen
11:36 - so this was actually a trick question
11:38 - because we need two blocks we need an on
11:40 - event block to find out when you click
11:42 - and then a set screen block to change
11:45 - the screens and let's show you how that
11:47 - works so we're going to go figure out
11:49 - the code here to say that when this
11:51 - button is clicked and it's called button
11:53 - 4 so darius can you pull out an on event
11:56 - block
11:57 - put it to the top the very top okay yeah
12:00 - and then choose
12:02 - when button four is clicked
12:08 - when button four is clicked and now go
12:10 - into set screen
12:17 - set screen
12:20 - and choose what are the choices there i
12:22 - think it's screen one that's the new
12:24 - screen that we created so now hit the
12:26 - run button
12:29 - and you can click that yeah and now that
12:32 - takes us to the animal shelter screen
12:34 - but if you click these none of these
12:35 - work so we need to make some changes to
12:37 - make those buttons work as well
12:39 - so go back and hit reset and go back
12:43 - now you want to
12:44 - look at the screen so click here to go
12:46 - look at the options there
12:49 - okay screen one with
12:54 - and if you hover over these buttons
12:56 - that's button five
12:57 - and that's button six so add the on
13:00 - events so for when button five is
13:02 - clicked
13:07 - and add another on event for when button
13:09 - six is clicked and we need to do write
13:11 - the code for what happens
13:13 - when these buttons are clicked and for
13:15 - these we use a piece of code to jump to
13:18 - a url using the open command
13:21 - see open url i didn't know about that
13:24 - one yeah
13:27 - right now it says they should go to
13:28 - code.org but if you look over here i've
13:31 - pre loaded these tabs so this is the
13:34 - meow cat rescue
13:36 - site so we're going to copy the link
13:38 - for that
13:40 - and put it here
13:42 - and over here we have the seattle humane
13:45 - society
13:46 - and i'm going to copy the link for that
13:49 - i'll put it here
13:51 - and then can you lastly for button seven
13:53 - make it so that goes back to the home
13:55 - screen
14:00 - on event button seven
14:05 - and then set screen
14:11 - so this is basically
14:12 - and have that go to the home screen
14:15 - so our app should be done now so click
14:17 - run to see how it works
14:23 - and now you can click and it says you're
14:25 - leaving this website you can click
14:26 - continue
14:28 - and it opens a new tab
14:34 - that takes you to meow cat rescue
14:39 - and you can click the home button to go
14:41 - back
14:42 - and look at food banks and so on
14:45 - so we finished our first basic app for
14:47 - volunteering and what's great is once
14:49 - you've made this app you can share it
14:50 - with anybody and in fact you can use
14:52 - this app on your phone so if you pull
14:54 - out your phone and scan this little qr
14:56 - code over here just open the phone's
14:59 - camera
15:00 - and scan that code and if anybody's
15:03 - following on
15:04 - you can also use your phone cameras to
15:06 - do the same thing
15:09 - and now you have the app on your phone
15:11 - doing basically exactly what we
15:12 - programmed
15:14 - so i want to show us a different type of
15:16 - app that's more kind of a feel-good app
15:19 - uh and you know since we're talking
15:21 - about the theme of computer science for
15:23 - good
15:24 - this app we're gonna show is going to
15:25 - show basically how to help support you
15:27 - with mental health and i've already got
15:28 - the finished version of this app what
15:30 - this app does is it's going to be sort
15:32 - of a pep talk app have you ever seen on
15:34 - youtube where people give pep talks to
15:36 - make you feel better
15:38 - have you taken those pep talks yourself
15:40 - no no
15:41 - all right well maybe you could they're
15:43 - kind of fun but this app will give me a
15:45 - pep talk by letting me take a picture of
15:47 - myself
15:49 - so i'm gonna take a photo of myself
15:52 - are you going to photo of you
15:54 - yay
15:55 - there's a photo of darius
15:58 - and then it puts his photo up on the
16:00 - screen with a little line that says
16:01 - believe in yourself
16:03 - you can't see it because of the camera
16:05 - it says believe in yourself it gave you
16:07 - a cool little pep talk you take a selfie
16:09 - and it gives you some encouraging words
16:11 - it's a very simple app but let's see how
16:14 - we built this
16:16 - so
16:17 - i'm going to share the screen again
16:25 - so
16:26 - right now what this app has it has this
16:28 - starter screen
16:29 - and what we want to do is add the
16:31 - ability to take a photo and put an
16:33 - encouraging message
16:35 - so
16:36 - let's go into design mode there's a new
16:38 - button you've never ever seen
16:41 - can you figure out how to add a button
16:42 - that takes a photo
16:45 - photo select photo select that's an all
16:48 - new button we've added to apple i put it
16:49 - at the bottom of the screen
16:51 - so what happens
16:52 - this is like a selector like a check box
16:55 - or a radio button but instead it's a
16:56 - photo selector
16:58 - so go to the code mode so i'll show you
17:01 - how we can use the code for this
17:04 - so you can say on event
17:08 - and then choose when photo select and
17:10 - it's photo select two and choose the
17:13 - change
17:15 - change
17:16 - so
17:18 - that basically finds out when the photo
17:19 - select button has changed which means
17:22 - somebody took a new photo with it
17:24 - and then you can actually get the image
17:26 - url for that and put that
17:28 - into this image see this image over here
17:32 - we want to change the image url for this
17:35 - um but to what we want to change it to
17:38 - is the photo that you picked from here
17:40 - so let's create a variable go under
17:42 - variables
17:46 - and say variable
17:48 - x equals
17:53 - i'll put it inside the on event
17:55 - and we're going to get the image url
18:00 - so look for get image url
18:05 - and we're going to get the
18:07 - get the image
18:08 - from the photo select
18:12 - so x now has that image and we want to
18:15 - put it into this guy so say set image
18:18 - url
18:21 - oh whoops
18:23 - set image url and now choose let's
18:30 - but we shouldn't give it the code logo
18:33 - we should give it the value of x
18:36 - and oops wait
18:39 - and you wouldn't need the you don't want
18:41 - the quotes
18:47 - so that puts the image on the screen and
18:50 - we can demo it although it's kind of
18:52 - funky because we aren't using a camera
18:54 - so when we click this right now to
18:56 - select an image it'll just ask us to
18:58 - choose a photo from our file system so
19:00 - i'm going to choose the cat image
19:02 - and look it put the cat on screen but it
19:04 - doesn't have any words of encouragement
19:06 - it just says you got this
19:08 - so now how do we pick the words of
19:09 - encouragement
19:10 - see this thing up here it's got this
19:12 - sort of texts like you are amazing today
19:15 - is your day believe in yourself
19:17 - i'm going to show what this is this is a
19:18 - list
19:21 - so basically the name of the list is
19:23 - encouragement
19:25 - and it has all these options you are
19:26 - amazing today is your day
19:28 - believe in yourself and one thing you
19:31 - should note is that
19:32 - lists in computer science start with
19:34 - location zero so this is the z you know
19:37 - when you count usually you go one two
19:39 - three four but for computers you start
19:41 - counting at zero the first number is
19:43 - zero this is one this is two
19:47 - so uh
19:49 - now
19:50 - the next thing i want to do is let's add
19:52 - some items to our list actually before
19:54 - we do that i want to test if people
19:56 - figure out how this works if i print out
19:58 - the encouragement at location one
20:01 - what will be printed
20:03 - can we do a quick poll to ask the
20:04 - audience this should be relatively easy
20:07 - but if we do a quick poll of what gets
20:09 - printed at location one you can choose
20:12 - you are amazing today is your day
20:15 - believe in yourself or all of the above
20:19 - all right i'm going to give you a little
20:20 - help remember that the locations start
20:23 - with zero
20:29 - all right
20:30 - well if we share the poll results
20:32 - add the answer is the second item
20:36 - location one is this one location zero
20:38 - as you are amazing
20:40 - location one is today is your day and
20:43 - location two is believe in yourself
20:47 - so now let's write some code that
20:49 - basically randomly picks one of these
20:51 - awesome options but i actually want to
20:53 - add to these because only three is
20:55 - enough so isn't enough so let's add some
20:58 - more examples not just three so can you
21:00 - say some happy things that you might
21:02 - want as pep talk
21:04 - and i'll type them in so pick something
21:06 - encouraging you could say
21:08 - um
21:09 - great job
21:10 - great job
21:14 - all right you are awesome
21:16 - you are awesome
21:20 - do one more
21:23 - you're the best
21:24 - okay
21:25 - all right yeah so now how many
21:27 - how many do we have total of these one
21:30 - two
21:31 - three
21:32 - four five
21:34 - six we have six awesome things to say
21:37 - and so what we want to do is put them
21:39 - in
21:40 - this little label which is id text
21:42 - output so to do that you want to go use
21:45 - the set text command
21:50 - actually i think it's higher up oh yes
21:52 - set text
21:58 - and choose the text output
22:02 - now instead of putting in the text that
22:04 - goes in there we want to choose one of
22:06 - those six items
22:07 - so we want to choose from that list
22:10 - the name of that list is encouragement
22:12 - so we want an item from that list
22:15 - so i'm going to type in
22:17 - encouragement
22:19 - and put these brackets and then we can
22:22 - put any number we want so we can put 0
22:25 - we can one
22:27 - two it'll pick a number from that list
22:29 - but if we do this what are the what are
22:32 - the choices for what numbers we put in
22:33 - there
22:36 - zero one two three four and five because
22:39 - there's no six there is no six there's
22:41 - five options so to do this we wanna pick
22:44 - a random number from zero to five
22:47 - so can you figure out how to do that
22:50 - if you go into the math function
22:52 - and i'm to change this into text mode
22:54 - and so we want to put a random thing
22:56 - here so can you figure out how to do
22:58 - that you go into math you said
23:03 - and choose random number random number
23:05 - we don't want between 1 and ten that's
23:07 - way too much you want from zero to six
23:15 - yep i got rid
23:21 - zero of five what's the other six no
23:23 - zero to five because there's six options
23:26 - i was trying to trick you okay all right
23:29 - i think we're good now so this should
23:31 - work
23:33 - i'm gonna run it one more time and again
23:36 - this isn't using my
23:37 - phone camera because i'm on a computer
23:39 - but i'll put the dog this time
23:41 - [Music]
23:45 - did i get it
23:49 - maybe it's slow because the dog is a big
23:51 - photo
23:57 - i'll try it again with the cat
24:04 - yes just
24:15 - well it should work let's use our
24:18 - can you i'm going to share it and you
24:20 - can
24:23 - scan it into your phone
24:29 - and choose that
24:34 - and now you have this app on your phone
24:36 - as well
24:37 - now you can take a photo
24:38 - [Music]
24:45 - you got a photo of me all right kind of
24:47 - use that photo
24:48 - and great and what does it say on it
24:50 - says you're the best i am the best thank
24:52 - you so much
24:55 - kind of hard to see
24:57 - all right well that was our second
24:59 - app of the day so we just showed two
25:01 - different apps one for volunteering and
25:03 - one for giving yourself encouragement to
25:05 - help support your mental health so this
25:07 - is our fourth day of the hour of code
25:10 - thank you for those of you who tuned in
25:11 - late if you missed this today we're
25:13 - going to have a repeat of today's
25:14 - episode later on today and otherwise
25:16 - we'll see you tomorrow morning at the
25:18 - same time same place and tomorrow we're
25:20 - going to do something awesome using
25:22 - minecraft and coding and using minecraft
25:25 - so thank you all for joining us for the
25:28 - hour of code this week and for today's
25:29 - code bites we'll see you later bye-bye
25:33 - bye
25:37 - [Music]
25:48 - so
25:51 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hi there and welcome to code bites hi i'm here with my son darius darius how old are you 13 he's 13 years old and we're excited to celebrate the fourth day of computer science education week you know all of this week throughout the country and all around the world tens of millions of students are participating in the hour of code to get an introduction to computer science and to celebrate this technology that is changing the society all around us and we have a very special birthday to celebrate today and that we're actually going to ask a poll to help you find out whose birthday it is it's the birthday of the person who wrote the first computer program so can we put up the poll on the screen who wrote the first computer program we have four choices ada lovelace born in 1815 albert einstein born in 1879 grace topper born in 1906 and bill gates born in 1955. and look at that folks are answering the poll right now looks like the winner is bill gates no no grace hopper in 1906. all right almost everybody has voted so let's share the results of the poll yes so you can see uh most people think it's grace hopper who was born in 1906 and then there's kind of a tie between ada loveless and bill gates darius do you know the answer for this it's right let's see so i'm gonna share my screen and yes it's ada loveless and what's pretty incredible about this is ada loveless who was born in the early 1800s she wrote the first computer program 100 years before the first modern computer was invented and this is interesting it goes to show that computer programming isn't just about technology and electronics it's something you can do it's really more sort of about problem solving and algorithmic thinking computational thinking it's also why so many computer scientists learn computer science without a computer i i initially learned in a classroom with a whiteboard without any devices and if you want to see the computer that ada loveless used she didn't actually use this it was a theoretical idea of a wooden machine called the babbage machine and she wrote a computer program for how to control that little device it's kind of cool so one thing i want to do before we get started with today's lesson is to find out where everybody's from uh if folks could go into the chat area and type where your calling in from and unfortunately those of you who are on zoom uh won't have that but there's can you read off some of the locations as you see them michigan india toronto canada billy's florida uav arab emirates united arab emirates that's amazing that means it's 8 p.m over there sri lanka wow richmond hill wow that is all over the world uh all right well let's close the chat for now there's a lot of stuff there that's right so today what we're gonna talk about uh actually since there's some spam can you reopen the chat and can everybody just type your first name in just to make that spam scroll away all right thank you now we can close the chat all right um we're not going to use the chat anymore today because some some students are basically posting is probably not students it's spammers we're just posting random youtube urls that we don't want to distract people with so today we're going to talk about the theme of this week's computer science education week is computer science for good so what we're going to do is create some apps uh apps that are basically designed to basically help make the world a better place because one of the more important things with technology is figuring out not just what you can do with a computer but what you should do with a computer how to use technology to help our world so the first app we want to make is going to be based on volunteering in our region darius and i live in the area of seattle washington and bellevue just in the seattle metro area so i'm going to demo the app that i started working on and then darius is going to help finish it so in just one second we're going to go into app lab so here we are in app lab if you can see my screen and the app that we're building here you can see the app on the left and the code is going to be on the right and i'm going to run this app and it's not complete yet it shows some of the ways you can help in your local community and this area is empty but if you want one of these areas is to help with a food bank and to volunteer and you click here and it shows you options for different food banks and says you can donate or volunteer at a food bank to help those who are in need in the pandemic but of course wear a mask and we can go back here and i want to add another volunteering option with darius you ready for this okay right so um first i want first you can see up here we can do code mode or design mode we're gonna go into design mode to add some features to our app so first can you make a button like that you can drag a button out like that yeah and then make it larger button wait you can just drag it from the corner if you want that's cool oops oh there and then if you want to make it look kind of cool with that border you can change its border size if you scroll down here and make the border width like 10 or something but look how it's yours is more square and that's more curly so you can change the border radius a little bit too you can make i like card is a border color well what if i mean change the border radius to like i don't know you can hit the little arrow buttons to move those up and down it makes it more of a curvy button perfect and you want to make the border a little bit larger too so it's similar to the other border the other button yeah yeah cool and now pick an image to put in this and i want to make our volunteering place to be about cats and dogs so choose this image all right so we're going to do an animal shelter kind of volunteering thing and the other thing i wanted to do is to get rid of this text for this button here so this isn't super pretty one of the things we can do in app lab is change themes for our app so click on the theme area here yeah look at all those different themes but let's use a poll to ask what theme we should use can we display the poll up on the screen so you can choose the orange or glow in the dark or coral reef or blue steel no no don't don't choose them yet it's showing are you showing the options that's orange well it looks like everyone's doing glow in the dark anyway that's glow in the dark choose coral reef all right let's close the poll because and share the results it looks like almost everybody wanted glow in the dark so click stop sharing there all right so we're now in the glow in the dark theme with our buttons here so now what we want to do is if you look over here we have the home screen and the food screen the food screen is the one that i showed you here we want to make a screen that looks like this but that is for uh working at a you know supporting an animal shelter so there's multiple different ways we can make a screen like this we can either make a new screen or we can duplicate this existing screen the easy way would be to duplicate but i want to make it a little bit more work for you to show how design mode works so can you click to choose new screen now we're going to make a new screen do you want to pick a theme for this screen to make it slightly different than all the other ones i think our second choice that from the audience was orange so you could go with that if you want orange i think i thought it was blue steel okay choose blue steel that sounds good to me really matter i don't know why these aren't all right oh they're loose right so for this drag out two buttons or make one button you can then duplicate it and look how the button in blue steel has got extra round corners but make it bigger and kind of square bigger bigger bigger or bigger okay and if you want to make it totally circle shaped you can make the button radius even larger so that's a perfect square okay so scroll down see where it says border radius make that bigger and bigger until it becomes round just hold click your mouse and hold on it and see it makes all right now you have an allaround button and you can make the border with like 10 to make it a thick border there you go and now choose an image for this button and let's choose the cap all right and then delete the text for button to cue cat all right and now we can duplicate this button to make another button and have this one have the dog all right and these are sort of our choices for the animal shelter and then lastly i'm going to make another button that is for going home and we'll put this up here and for this button we can look we if you want to choose the image for this you can also choose icons so can you type home home oh that icon is barely visible because it's covered by the text right there's our home button so now i want to show what happens how do we jump from the home screen to come to this screen we need to write some code and the question is what code should we use so which block should we use to change the screen when the button is clicked we can use an on event block a show element block a set check block or a set screen block let's do a poll to see what the our students think how do we change the screen to find out when the button is clicked we change the screen right most people are saying it's set screen but a lot of people are saying on event some people are saying show elements some people are saying set checked but the most popular one they say is set screen so this was actually a trick question because we need two blocks we need an on event block to find out when you click and then a set screen block to change the screens and let's show you how that works so we're going to go figure out the code here to say that when this button is clicked and it's called button 4 so darius can you pull out an on event block put it to the top the very top okay yeah and then choose when button four is clicked when button four is clicked and now go into set screen set screen and choose what are the choices there i think it's screen one that's the new screen that we created so now hit the run button and you can click that yeah and now that takes us to the animal shelter screen but if you click these none of these work so we need to make some changes to make those buttons work as well so go back and hit reset and go back now you want to look at the screen so click here to go look at the options there okay screen one with and if you hover over these buttons that's button five and that's button six so add the on events so for when button five is clicked and add another on event for when button six is clicked and we need to do write the code for what happens when these buttons are clicked and for these we use a piece of code to jump to a url using the open command see open url i didn't know about that one yeah right now it says they should go to code.org but if you look over here i've pre loaded these tabs so this is the meow cat rescue site so we're going to copy the link for that and put it here and over here we have the seattle humane society and i'm going to copy the link for that i'll put it here and then can you lastly for button seven make it so that goes back to the home screen on event button seven and then set screen so this is basically and have that go to the home screen so our app should be done now so click run to see how it works and now you can click and it says you're leaving this website you can click continue and it opens a new tab that takes you to meow cat rescue and you can click the home button to go back and look at food banks and so on so we finished our first basic app for volunteering and what's great is once you've made this app you can share it with anybody and in fact you can use this app on your phone so if you pull out your phone and scan this little qr code over here just open the phone's camera and scan that code and if anybody's following on you can also use your phone cameras to do the same thing and now you have the app on your phone doing basically exactly what we programmed so i want to show us a different type of app that's more kind of a feelgood app uh and you know since we're talking about the theme of computer science for good this app we're gonna show is going to show basically how to help support you with mental health and i've already got the finished version of this app what this app does is it's going to be sort of a pep talk app have you ever seen on youtube where people give pep talks to make you feel better have you taken those pep talks yourself no no all right well maybe you could they're kind of fun but this app will give me a pep talk by letting me take a picture of myself so i'm gonna take a photo of myself are you going to photo of you yay there's a photo of darius and then it puts his photo up on the screen with a little line that says believe in yourself you can't see it because of the camera it says believe in yourself it gave you a cool little pep talk you take a selfie and it gives you some encouraging words it's a very simple app but let's see how we built this so i'm going to share the screen again so right now what this app has it has this starter screen and what we want to do is add the ability to take a photo and put an encouraging message so let's go into design mode there's a new button you've never ever seen can you figure out how to add a button that takes a photo photo select photo select that's an all new button we've added to apple i put it at the bottom of the screen so what happens this is like a selector like a check box or a radio button but instead it's a photo selector so go to the code mode so i'll show you how we can use the code for this so you can say on event and then choose when photo select and it's photo select two and choose the change change so that basically finds out when the photo select button has changed which means somebody took a new photo with it and then you can actually get the image url for that and put that into this image see this image over here we want to change the image url for this um but to what we want to change it to is the photo that you picked from here so let's create a variable go under variables and say variable x equals i'll put it inside the on event and we're going to get the image url so look for get image url and we're going to get the get the image from the photo select so x now has that image and we want to put it into this guy so say set image url oh whoops set image url and now choose let's but we shouldn't give it the code logo we should give it the value of x and oops wait and you wouldn't need the you don't want the quotes so that puts the image on the screen and we can demo it although it's kind of funky because we aren't using a camera so when we click this right now to select an image it'll just ask us to choose a photo from our file system so i'm going to choose the cat image and look it put the cat on screen but it doesn't have any words of encouragement it just says you got this so now how do we pick the words of encouragement see this thing up here it's got this sort of texts like you are amazing today is your day believe in yourself i'm going to show what this is this is a list so basically the name of the list is encouragement and it has all these options you are amazing today is your day believe in yourself and one thing you should note is that lists in computer science start with location zero so this is the z you know when you count usually you go one two three four but for computers you start counting at zero the first number is zero this is one this is two so uh now the next thing i want to do is let's add some items to our list actually before we do that i want to test if people figure out how this works if i print out the encouragement at location one what will be printed can we do a quick poll to ask the audience this should be relatively easy but if we do a quick poll of what gets printed at location one you can choose you are amazing today is your day believe in yourself or all of the above all right i'm going to give you a little help remember that the locations start with zero all right well if we share the poll results add the answer is the second item location one is this one location zero as you are amazing location one is today is your day and location two is believe in yourself so now let's write some code that basically randomly picks one of these awesome options but i actually want to add to these because only three is enough so isn't enough so let's add some more examples not just three so can you say some happy things that you might want as pep talk and i'll type them in so pick something encouraging you could say um great job great job all right you are awesome you are awesome do one more you're the best okay all right yeah so now how many how many do we have total of these one two three four five six we have six awesome things to say and so what we want to do is put them in this little label which is id text output so to do that you want to go use the set text command actually i think it's higher up oh yes set text and choose the text output now instead of putting in the text that goes in there we want to choose one of those six items so we want to choose from that list the name of that list is encouragement so we want an item from that list so i'm going to type in encouragement and put these brackets and then we can put any number we want so we can put 0 we can one two it'll pick a number from that list but if we do this what are the what are the choices for what numbers we put in there zero one two three four and five because there's no six there is no six there's five options so to do this we wanna pick a random number from zero to five so can you figure out how to do that if you go into the math function and i'm to change this into text mode and so we want to put a random thing here so can you figure out how to do that you go into math you said and choose random number random number we don't want between 1 and ten that's way too much you want from zero to six yep i got rid zero of five what's the other six no zero to five because there's six options i was trying to trick you okay all right i think we're good now so this should work i'm gonna run it one more time and again this isn't using my phone camera because i'm on a computer but i'll put the dog this time did i get it maybe it's slow because the dog is a big photo i'll try it again with the cat yes just well it should work let's use our can you i'm going to share it and you can scan it into your phone and choose that and now you have this app on your phone as well now you can take a photo you got a photo of me all right kind of use that photo and great and what does it say on it says you're the best i am the best thank you so much kind of hard to see all right well that was our second app of the day so we just showed two different apps one for volunteering and one for giving yourself encouragement to help support your mental health so this is our fourth day of the hour of code thank you for those of you who tuned in late if you missed this today we're going to have a repeat of today's episode later on today and otherwise we'll see you tomorrow morning at the same time same place and tomorrow we're going to do something awesome using minecraft and coding and using minecraft so thank you all for joining us for the hour of code this week and for today's code bites we'll see you later byebye bye so
