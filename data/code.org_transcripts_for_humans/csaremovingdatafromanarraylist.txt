00:10 - and I'm a senior director of engineering
00:13 - in the Xbox team at Microsoft success is
00:15 - at the other side of failure where on
00:17 - this you try you will never you know
00:20 - continue to grow us just as a human
00:22 - being all up and so we definitely
00:23 - Embrace that now in fact you know the
00:25 - people in my team which are amazing
00:26 - engineers and leaders like I actually
00:28 - encourage them to go try new things and
00:31 - let's go fail fast instead of being
00:33 - adverse to it
00:35 - their release class has a remove method
00:37 - that we can use to remove elements from
00:39 - the list
00:40 - these moves all the other elements over
00:42 - to the left and decreases the size of
00:44 - the arraylist by one
00:46 - let's say we have a grocery list that
00:48 - has five items milk bread apples soda
00:52 - and pizza let's remove apples from the
00:54 - list
00:55 - we can call the remove method with the
00:57 - index of the apples we want to remove
01:00 - the apples are removed and the rest of
01:02 - the elements in the list move over
01:04 - now the list has four elements
01:07 - be careful when you remove elements from
01:09 - an arraylist while traversing it
01:12 - let's say we want to remove items from
01:13 - the list that cost over three dollars in
01:16 - our for Loop we'll check if the item is
01:18 - greater than three if the item is less
01:20 - than 3 then we will just check the next
01:22 - index if the item is more than 3 we will
01:25 - remove the item from the list
01:27 - this will actually skip some of the
01:28 - elements
01:29 - with each iteration the index increases
01:32 - by 1. however the rest of the island
01:35 - shift to the left when one is removed
01:37 - [Music]
01:39 - since the elements are shifted to the
01:40 - left by one we need to shift the index
01:42 - back by one so nothing gets skipped we
01:45 - do this by decreasing the index by one
01:47 - when we remove an element
01:49 - now when we remove elements while
01:51 - traversing the arraylist the index is
01:53 - shifted with the elements
01:54 - [Music]
01:58 - removing elements from an arraylist is
01:59 - easy with the remove method just be
02:02 - careful when removing elements while
02:03 - traversing an arraylist so you don't
02:05 - miss any elements that you're looking
02:06 - for
02:08 - foreign
