00:00 - Programming's a game.
00:02 - It's something that you and the computer are working towards together.
00:05 - But you're gonna fail a lot.
00:07 - Just get comfortable with failing because it happens.
00:10 - When you program, you have to get it wrong
00:13 - because that's how you learn.
00:14 - When you do make mistakes you're like
00:16 - "Okay it's fine. I can fix this."
00:18 - Everyone gets bugs.
00:19 - Whether you're a beginner, intermediate,
advanced...
00:23 - everyone gets bugs.
00:24 - When a computer is not working the way it's supposed to,
00:26 - the way we want it to,
00:27 - we call that a bug.
00:28 - I get bugs.
00:32 - I totally get bugs.
00:34 - Everyone gets bugs!
00:36 - Debugging is basically just looking
through your code
00:39 - and correcting your mistakes and fixing it.
00:42 - There are four really important steps
00:44 - that you want to follow when you're debugging.
00:45 - The first thing you want to do is describe your problem.
00:48 - So figure out what's happening.
00:50 - What did you want your code to do and what is it actually doing?
00:52 - Second step is you want to hunt for bugs.
00:54 - So figure out what is it in your code that's causing that.
00:57 - Step number three is you want to try out small solutions
01:01 - and see how they affect your code.
01:03 - And then finally step four is you want to document what you've learned.
01:08 - Debugging is maybe the number one thing
01:10 - that can help you become a better programmer
01:12 - because you're seeing the mistakes you made.
01:15 - Wait, don't delete that.
01:17 - Can you help me with this for a second?
01:18 - Can you help me with this for a second?
01:21 - Most of the time I spend debugging is finding the bug
01:24 - but once I find it it's easy to fix.
01:26 - What's this?
01:28 - Get out of here bugs.
01:29 - Did your parents put that there?
01:31 - Maybe, I don't know.
01:32 - I like debugging with other people
01:34 - because they are like a second brain
01:36 - which doubles your computing power
01:38 - so you can figure out bugs twice as fast.
01:41 - Dude we did it
01:43 - Experts make bugs.
01:45 - They make big bugs!
01:46 - In fact your goal should be, as you go along
01:49 - make bigger and bigger bugs that need to
be squashed
01:52 - because that just means you're doing something worth doing.
01:54 - Y'know, the more you practice, the better you get at it,
01:57 - the easier it will be.
01:59 - I can debug!
02:03 - I can debug
02:04 - and so can you!

Programming's a game. It's something that you and the computer are working towards together. But you're gonna fail a lot. Just get comfortable with failing because it happens. When you program, you have to get it wrong because that's how you learn. When you do make mistakes you're like "Okay it's fine. I can fix this." Everyone gets bugs. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, advanced... everyone gets bugs. When a computer is not working the way it's supposed to, the way we want it to, we call that a bug. I get bugs. I totally get bugs. Everyone gets bugs! Debugging is basically just looking through your code and correcting your mistakes and fixing it. There are four really important steps that you want to follow when you're debugging. The first thing you want to do is describe your problem. So figure out what's happening.
