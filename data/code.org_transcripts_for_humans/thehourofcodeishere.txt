00:03 - Hi, I'm Leigha,
and I'm Tanya,
00:05 - and we're lucky enough to be studying computer science.
00:08 - We think it's terrible that 90% of schools don't teach it.
00:11 - They definitely didn't offer it at my high school.
00:13 - So we're trying to make this video to show that anybody can learn.
00:16 - We want to get 10 million students to do the Hour of Code.
00:19 - Hour of Code (repeats)
00:26 - How do you get him to get to the sunflower?
00:28 - He needs to do some actions.
00:30 - I got it ... YAY!
00:31 - Oh!
(laughs)
00:33 - And then we'll run it and see what happens
00:34 - Haha, that's amazing!
00:36 - Yeah! There we go!
00:39 - That's pretty easy.
-You just wrote your first program
00:40 - I wrote it? 
-Yeah!
00:42 - This is the code that you just wrote
-Very awesome.
00:45 - I thought, like, code was like,FBI-hacker symbols and stuff.
00:49 - A little bit of problem solving a little bit of logic.
00:51 - It's like instructions.
00:52 - Programming is a lot easier today.
00:54 - Don't just play on your phone, program it.
00:57 - Alright!
-Awesome!
00:58 - How does someone go about getting a job?
01:00 - Maybe, take an online class - find a class at a community college.
01:03 - You can get one of the best paying jobs in the world.
01:05 - I think medicine's moving into the whole computer age.
01:07 - Technology touches every part of our lives.
01:09 - If you can create technology, you can change the world.
01:12 - So, we're excited that you are participating in today's Hour of Code.
01:15 - We just did 2 lines of code.
01:17 - 3 lines of code!
01:19 - 4 lines,
01:19 - 7 lines,
01:20 - 5 lines,
01:20 - 25 lines of code.
01:23 - I wrote 42 lines of code.
01:25 - 9 lines,
01:26 - 60 lines of code,
01:27 - 99 lines,
01:28 - 60 lines,
01:29 - 18 lines of code,
01:30 - 75 lines of code.
01:32 - It doesn't matter how old you are,
01:33 - Everybody can learn.
01:35 - Hour of Code (repeats)
01:42 - Whether you're a young man or a young woman;
01:45 - whether you live in a city or a rural area,
01:47 - everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer.
01:50 - I just completed
01:51 - the hour of code.
01:52 - It's actually really easy to learn.
01:54 - Girls should learn this too.
01:55 - Understand that language that's going to be the future.
01:59 - Anyone can learn computer science.
02:00 - And you can learn too.
02:01 - Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, all you all.
02:05 - I'm Learning!
02:06 - Give it a shot.
02:14 - the Hour of Code is here
02:17 - Spread it across the country
