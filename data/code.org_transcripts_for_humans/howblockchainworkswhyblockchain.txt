00:13 - my name is Tegan Klein I'm the
00:15 - co-founder of Edge and node the initial
00:17 - team behind the graph and with the graph
00:19 - what Google does for the web the graph
00:20 - does for blockchains and organizing data
00:22 - my name is Cynthia Haas and I'm the
00:24 - director of the world of women
00:25 - Foundation world of women is a
00:27 - collection of 10 000 women all across
00:29 - different backgrounds variety of skins
00:32 - traits and we are a community that
00:34 - Champions inclusion and diversity in the
00:36 - web through space my name is Charlie Lee
00:38 - I'm the creator of Litecoin one of the
00:40 - alternative currents fees to bitcoin I
00:43 - was playing around with the Bitcoin code
00:44 - base and decided to create my own
00:47 - cryptocurrency and it was a fun side
00:50 - project and it took off
00:52 - when you buy something with a credit
00:54 - card when your groceries are labeled
00:56 - organic when you see verified identity
00:58 - on social media or when you vote all of
01:01 - these things they depend on trust how do
01:04 - you know that the money was transferred
01:06 - that the food is actually organic that
01:08 - the person is real or that your vote is
01:11 - counted ultimately you trust records
01:14 - managed by Banks companies and
01:16 - governments
01:18 - but these days many people wonder if
01:20 - they can trust companies governments or
01:23 - any form of centralized power with the
01:27 - rise of misinformation what if we could
01:29 - build a system of trust that didn't
01:31 - depend on a central entity what if we
01:33 - could keep track of things like money or
01:35 - property in a way that anyone could
01:37 - audit the data without putting a company
01:39 - or government in charge
01:42 - that's possible today using the
01:44 - technology called blockchain
01:46 - blockchain is a new way of storing
01:47 - information across internet where
01:50 - everyone can participate with blockchain
01:52 - data can be decentralized and
01:55 - distributed nobody owns a blockchain but
01:58 - everybody can use it and verify the
02:00 - information on it this technology is the
02:02 - Innovation behind cryptocurrencies like
02:05 - Bitcoin it has other potential use cases
02:08 - which we'll get to in a later video but
02:11 - first let's look at how the problems of
02:12 - trust have been solved in the past
02:15 - since the earliest of human societies
02:17 - we've invented different ways of
02:19 - building trust by keeping track of
02:21 - information and transactions
02:23 - like who owns this Farm
02:26 - how much do I owe you for the milk what
02:29 - are the laws of the land
02:31 - humans started using shells or precious
02:34 - rocks to keep track of transactions and
02:36 - these became the earliest forms of
02:38 - currency as we moved from tribes to
02:41 - villages to cities we needed to keep
02:44 - track of property and laws this led to
02:47 - the early invention of numbers in
02:50 - writing
02:51 - isn't that incredible
02:53 - we didn't invent numbers for math class
02:55 - we didn't invent the alphabet to write
02:57 - books
02:58 - we invented them to keep track of land
03:01 - livestock debts and taxes
03:04 - and of course we've come a long way
03:06 - since then currency has evolved from
03:08 - shells to coins to banknotes to Digital
03:11 - Data writing has evolved from clay
03:13 - tablets to paper to digital formats
03:16 - along with inventing writing and numbers
03:18 - we've also invented a new way to
03:21 - establish trust because all of these
03:24 - ways of preserving records They still
03:26 - depend on trust that's why the laws of
03:30 - the land were set in stone to make sure
03:32 - nobody would change them
03:35 - but how do you trust something even if
03:38 - it's set in stone
03:40 - for example you might have a clay tablet
03:42 - that says you own 100 cows but how do I
03:46 - know that you didn't make that number up
03:48 - that's why we invented trusted seals
03:51 - stamps and signatures
03:55 - and with all of these inventions we've
03:57 - authorized and put our trust in a
03:58 - limited group of people organizations or
04:01 - governments with the special power to
04:03 - verify our records that's the one thing
04:05 - that has never changed over thousands of
04:07 - years and new technologies these systems
04:10 - only work if we trust the organizations
04:12 - and authorities that verify the records
04:15 - and this brings us back to the
04:16 - blockchain
04:18 - blockchain is the first technology that
04:19 - allows us to record information without
04:21 - needing to trust a central Authority
04:23 - it's a digital way to store and verify
04:26 - information that is set in stone without
04:30 - needing a stone or a seal or a bank or a
04:34 - government the information on a
04:36 - blockchain is saved on a distributed
04:39 - network of computers so long as these
04:42 - computers are independently managed in
04:46 - theory no individual or organization can
04:49 - take down the network or corrupt it
04:52 - this is like a form of writing that
04:54 - can't be counterfeit or destroyed it
04:57 - enables a new form of trust the first
04:59 - use is Bitcoin
05:01 - Bitcoin is a digital currency that
05:04 - safely tracks transactions in ownership
05:06 - without needing to put trust in any bank
05:09 - or government but that's only one
05:11 - example a blockchain could potentially
05:13 - be used to track ownership of real
05:15 - estate to establish contracts to
05:18 - authenticate documents and to verify
05:22 - document was created on a certain date
05:23 - it's now theoretically possible to do
05:26 - all of these things and
05:32 - blockchain technology still has a long
05:34 - way to reach its full potential and its
05:37 - future is a topic of regular debate some
05:40 - believe that this is the future with the
05:42 - potential to democratize who has power
05:45 - and authority in human societies others
05:47 - think it is a giant scam with no other
05:50 - purpose in the rest of this video series
05:52 - we'll look at how this technology works
05:54 - and then we'll explore different points
05:57 - of view
