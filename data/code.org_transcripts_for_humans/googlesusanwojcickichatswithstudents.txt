00:00 - us for this Tech luminary chat with
00:02 - Susan wsky from Google and Susan was one
00:06 - of the first employees of Google she's
00:07 - in charge of the entire advertising
00:09 - business at Google which is the largest
00:11 - source of revenue for Google and she's
00:12 - been called one of the most powerful
00:14 - women in the computer industry without
00:16 - any more Ado I'm gonna turn it over to
00:18 - Susan for a few comments Susan great
00:21 - good morning everyone it's wonderful to
00:23 - have so many people here participating
00:27 - in our hour of code and our computer
00:29 - science education week and um I thought
00:32 - I would just give a little background
00:34 - about me and about why computer science
00:37 - has been so important to my life and all
00:40 - the things that I've been able to do and
00:41 - why I think it's really important for
00:43 - all of you to be aware of and I should
00:45 - probably also mention I also have four
00:47 - kids um and they actually had hour of
00:50 - code at my kids school as well and so I
00:52 - participated there too and I know it was
00:54 - really meaningful for them so I hope I
00:56 - can make it very meaningful for you too
00:59 - so um um I've worked on lots of
01:02 - different things at Google um I got
01:04 - interested in computer science because I
01:06 - was always like to build things and
01:09 - create things so I don't know how many
01:11 - of you there in the audience like
01:14 - playing with Lego um maybe I can see
01:16 - your hands like how many of you guys
01:18 - like
01:19 - Lego um maybe when you were kids for the
01:22 - older kids the ones uh when you were
01:24 - little um or how many of you like doing
01:27 - different kinds of art projects um any
01:30 - kind of art project drawing
01:33 - Ceramics um whatever so these are the
01:37 - kind of things that I used to like to do
01:39 - when I was a kid and the other thing I
01:41 - also really liked was I liked um I used
01:44 - to have a little businesses on the side
01:46 - I used to sell lemons from my neighbors
01:49 - I don't know how and have lemonade
01:50 - stands I don't know how many of you are
01:52 - interested in that um but as I got older
01:55 - I realized that I could build things
01:57 - using computer science and I could
02:00 - distribute them not just to my neighbors
02:03 - but to the entire world and um so that's
02:07 - what I've been able to do as part of
02:08 - Google um is take some computer science
02:12 - um be able to build things and make
02:14 - things um like image search for example
02:17 - is one of the products that probably all
02:19 - of you use that I wound up being able to
02:21 - build and create and now it's used by
02:24 - people all over the world so it's been
02:26 - really enriching for me and I hope it
02:28 - can be really enriching for all of you
02:31 - now I'm not I'm sure that all of you um
02:34 - are interested in phones either you have
02:36 - your own phone or play with your parents
02:39 - phone um so how many of you here know
02:43 - about games like Angry Birds can I just
02:46 - see how many of you have played Angry
02:48 - Birds or heard about Angry Birds so I'm
02:52 - going to guess looks like okay I see
02:55 - pretty much everybody here has raised
02:56 - their hands um for Angry Birds and and
03:00 - so Angry Birds is um something that has
03:03 - been really fun for all of us to be able
03:05 - to create to use but it's also something
03:08 - that if you know computer science you
03:11 - can actually create you could create
03:13 - something like Angry Birds for yourself
03:16 - and for your friends and so if you go to
03:19 - the code.org website they have some
03:22 - really interesting games that you can
03:25 - play with Angry Birds where you can
03:28 - program um some really basic commands
03:31 - for Angry Birds and um if you think
03:35 - about computers they're really
03:37 - really um they're very basic um
03:41 - computers don't really know anything
03:43 - they're kind of dumb uh and it requires
03:46 - you to be able to make them smart um
03:49 - it's up to you to be able to say um what
03:52 - they what you want them to do and how
03:54 - you can make them do all the things that
03:57 - you want to do and so once you know a
03:59 - little computer science you can be in
04:01 - charge you can make that computer do
04:04 - what you want to do um you can make it
04:06 - do U make games like Angry Birds um you
04:10 - can change how the Pig and the and the
04:13 - birds interact um you can create new
04:16 - games and so computer science overall is
04:20 - something that will enable you to be
04:22 - able to um change your lives in the
04:25 - future and so what I see being at Google
04:28 - is that all of your lives in the future
04:31 - are going to be so digital um everything
04:34 - we do is going to have computers in the
04:36 - future and so if you can learn a little
04:39 - bit about computers even if you're not
04:41 - planning on being a computer scientist
04:44 - um you can do a lot more things and so
04:46 - it's going to be really important for
04:48 - all of you to learn that in the future
04:50 - um for whatever job you consider so I
04:53 - encourage all of you to be thinking
04:55 - about that and to be learning a little
04:57 - bit of computer science it's really fun
05:00 - and you'll see that once you learn a
05:02 - little bit you can do a lot of things
05:04 - with it and um it can really change your
05:07 - life so even whatever career you're
05:10 - planning on doing if you're planning on
05:12 - being a doctor or even if you're
05:14 - planning on being an artist so for
05:16 - example one of my best friends she's an
05:18 - artist she's a muralist and you wouldn't
05:21 - think you need computers but she uh
05:24 - advertises using Google um and she has a
05:27 - website so people can find her and it's
05:29 - because she knew a little bit about
05:31 - computer science that she's been able to
05:34 - have customers and be able to do so many
05:37 - interesting things so I just I'm really
05:39 - excited that your all of your schools
05:41 - are participating I hope you'll all do
05:43 - the hour of code um and if you want to
05:45 - know more you can go to code.org they
05:48 - have lots of places where you can learn
05:50 - about new programs and they have lots of
05:52 - games where you can play with the Angry
05:54 - Birds um um Angry Birds games and
05:57 - puzzles um and it will show you what
06:00 - programming is like and it's anyone can
06:02 - do it um my kindergartener um started
06:06 - out and tried to use it and my oldest
06:10 - child who is going into high school has
06:12 - also been able to use some of the games
06:14 - and been able to have a lot of fun so I
06:16 - really encourage any of you to um to
06:18 - check to check it out and to learn a
06:20 - little bit about computer science so I'm
06:23 - looking forward to doing questions uh
06:25 - let's yeah so so Susan thank you so much
06:28 - for for for for that great uction okay
06:29 - the first question is from Marine Joy
06:31 - charter school so Marine Joy Charter
06:33 - School want to come up the
06:36 - microphone where are you we're right
06:39 - here go ahead Amber
06:46 - louder go
06:48 - ahead just read this we are curious to
06:51 - know what challenges have you faced as a
06:52 - woman in the technical field I'm
06:58 - sorry yeah
07:00 - [Music]
07:02 - go ahead we are curious to know what
07:04 - challenges have you faced as a woman in
07:06 - a technical fi
07:09 - yeah so thank you so much for that
07:12 - question and um I me I think you're
07:14 - you're it's a good question because
07:17 - traditionally there haven't been as many
07:20 - girls or women in computer science and
07:24 - um I think that has been something that
07:26 - I've been wanting to try to change
07:29 - because I think it's really important
07:31 - and there are actually some girls and
07:33 - women that have been really successful
07:35 - in computer science so I know it's a
07:37 - great career and the challenges um I
07:41 - guess I would say is mostly that a lot
07:43 - of the people that are your peers right
07:44 - now are are men um or boys but the one
07:49 - of the ways I've really encouraged that
07:52 - and I encourage this from my own
07:53 - daughter too is to find someone else
07:56 - that is interested in it um and to do it
07:59 - with a friend and so what I found is is
08:02 - that even if most of the people that are
08:04 - around me are are male that there's
08:07 - always enough women that are really
08:09 - interesting um and that I can be friends
08:11 - with that I can do it with them that it
08:13 - winds up being a really fun and positive
08:15 - experience um so like some of the people
08:17 - like Marissa who's the CEO of Yahoo and
08:20 - Cheryl who's the CEO of of Facebook
08:23 - they've all been friends of mine they
08:24 - all worked at Google um we still are
08:27 - talk all the time um about different
08:29 - things that we um challenges that we
08:32 - have and so having a friend really can
08:33 - make a difference okay thank you
08:38 - lyat hi um we were wondering what risks
08:41 - did you uh take and obstacles did you
08:44 - overcome trying to get where you are
08:47 - today thank you so much for that
08:49 - question um well probably the biggest
08:52 - risk that I took was I joined Google
08:54 - when it was a really small company uh
08:58 - Google I joined Google when there were
09:00 - only 16 people and they were um I
09:06 - actually left a really big company I
09:08 - left Intel to join a company with only
09:10 - 16 people in it and um I was one of the
09:13 - first and uh women there and so but it
09:18 - was a it was something I was really
09:21 - excited about doing I was excited I saw
09:24 - that technology and Google could change
09:26 - the world I could saw that they their
09:28 - search engine was much better and so it
09:31 - was a big change for me to leave a big
09:33 - company and go to a tiny little company
09:35 - uh but I'm really glad I did and um I
09:39 - think sometimes with technology it's
09:41 - changing so fast that a lot of times we
09:44 - need to take risks we need to say this
09:46 - is what we think the future is going to
09:47 - look like and we have to plan for the
09:49 - future instead of plan for what we have
09:51 - right now so um I think technology is a
09:55 - great field but yeah it does include a
09:57 - few risks um but but the good news is
10:00 - that everyone takes risks and sometimes
10:02 - they work out and sometimes they don't
10:04 - and so um it's very forgiving people
10:07 - understand that a lot of times companies
10:08 - don't work out well um and they just
10:11 - those people usually just move on to the
10:12 - next one and it's okay so I encourage
10:14 - all of you to to try something and to
10:17 - take a risk sometimes especially when
10:19 - you're when you're young like all of you
10:22 - right thank thank you so much for that
10:23 - question all right very middle school
10:25 - and wave your hands to identify yourself
10:27 - okay very Middle School
10:30 - great okay go ahead what is your typical
10:33 - day like and what is your favorite part
10:35 - of your job oh thank you so much for
10:38 - that question uh well my typical day is
10:42 - um right now I I because I'm a manager
10:46 - responsible for a big part of Google
10:48 - most of what I do is I have meetings um
10:52 - but the meetings usually what we do is
10:54 - we talk about the the things that we're
10:56 - going to do next and so we talk about
10:58 - all the different ways that we're going
11:00 - to make Google better and so we CH we
11:02 - say for example like let's think about
11:04 - what Google's going to look like in the
11:06 - future what are people going to use um
11:08 - two years from now or a year from now
11:10 - and we think about this is how things
11:12 - could be so much better because
11:14 - everyone's going to have the internet
11:16 - and everyone's going to have phones um
11:18 - and we think and then we try to invent
11:20 - what the future is going to look like
11:22 - and then we actually build it and so we
11:25 - have meetings where people say this is
11:26 - how I think the future's going to be
11:28 - these are the products I'm really
11:29 - excited about and they they show um what
11:31 - we call mocks they show um pictures of
11:34 - what it would look like and we talk
11:36 - about the users and we actually
11:38 - sometimes go out and we talk to people
11:40 - like all of you and we say well what do
11:41 - you think about this would you like to
11:43 - use something like this and then we
11:45 - actually build it so I spend most of my
11:48 - time in meetings and the meetings a lot
11:50 - of times are talking about what we're
11:52 - going to build and what's working and
11:54 - what's not working and probably my
11:56 - favorite part of the day is is when I
11:59 - see something sometimes what happens to
12:02 - me is someone shows me something about
12:05 - what they're planning on building and it
12:07 - looks so amazing um and so like just for
12:12 - example um sometimes we've been the
12:14 - first ones to be able to see something
12:17 - like I worked on um very early versions
12:20 - of what is now YouTube and the first
12:23 - time we actually saw that and we saw
12:25 - wellow people all over the world can
12:26 - send us video and people can see it and
12:29 - share it and I actually showed it to my
12:31 - kids and they were like wow this is so
12:33 - great um and so when we see something
12:35 - that is just we know it's going to be
12:37 - important for the future um but it
12:40 - hasn't come out yet to the world that is
12:42 - a really really that's probably my
12:44 - favorite part of my job because then we
12:47 - know that's something that we're going
12:48 - to be able to bring to everybody and it
12:50 - will really be
12:51 - successful thank you so much for that
12:53 - question okay next we have Sam
12:56 - Houston Sam Houston School
13:00 - what is one way you apply computer
13:02 - science to your job at Google Sor one
13:05 - more
13:06 - time what is one way you apply computer
13:09 - science at your to your job at Google
13:12 - yeah that's a great question um well
13:15 - lots of people who work at Google have
13:17 - studied computer science there are lots
13:19 - and lots of experts in computer science
13:22 - and that's because Google builds a lot
13:25 - of things um and in order we run Google
13:30 - which you probably all know but also
13:32 - YouTube and chrome um and Android which
13:36 - runs on your phone and so we have um
13:39 - thousands of Engineers and they are
13:41 - building all of those things and um
13:44 - they're building those services to make
13:45 - them work for you but they're also
13:47 - building all the computers that actually
13:49 - support that and enable it to run and to
13:51 - serve for you really quickly and so
13:54 - there are lots and lots of computer
13:55 - scientists at Google and probably the
13:58 - way that I use it is in terms of
14:00 - understanding what we can build next and
14:03 - so it's been really really helpful for
14:04 - me to understand computer
14:06 - science okay all right thank you very
14:08 - much okay next we have the Midland
14:10 - Academy and again wave your hand so I
14:11 - know which one you are Midland Academy
14:13 - great okay Midland
14:15 - Academy do you have any advice for
14:17 - students trying to decide on their own
14:19 - career
14:20 - path let's see maybe we could repeat the
14:23 - question it do I have any advice advice
14:25 - for students trying to decide on their
14:27 - own career paths
14:29 - um well let's see so my my advice that I
14:32 - give to people when they're trying to do
14:34 - their career path is um two things which
14:36 - I think first of all so you have to
14:38 - choose something that you really enjoy
14:40 - doing um because you're going to spend a
14:42 - lot of time doing it so it should be
14:44 - something you like but I also encourage
14:46 - people to um to do something that is
14:49 - growing I think if you can go into a new
14:52 - area and do something that hasn't been
14:54 - done before or you can go into um
14:57 - something that is new it's always easier
15:00 - and so that's why if you look at the
15:02 - computer science degrees um there's
15:04 - going to be so much demand for people
15:06 - who know computer science in the future
15:08 - and um actually even all the people in
15:11 - the United States who are getting
15:12 - degrees there's there isn't enough
15:14 - demand um there's so many jobs that we
15:17 - can't fill with even all the people
15:19 - getting computer science degrees so I
15:21 - encourage all of you to well do things
15:24 - you love do things that you think are
15:25 - going to be important um but I think it
15:27 - would be great to look at doing things
15:30 - also with technology because if you
15:32 - think about the world everything's going
15:33 - to change um maybe even like our
15:36 - refrigerators in the future will have
15:38 - some kind of technology in them or our
15:41 - toasters or our shoes and so um and so
15:45 - everything is going to change and so
15:47 - it's really exciting if you can be a
15:49 - part of that great thank you okay uh hum
15:53 - Elementary good morning we wanted to ask
15:56 - you w wave your hand there you go okay
15:59 - go ahead matter matter good morning we
16:02 - wanted to ask you what is the best part
16:04 - about working for
16:05 - Google oh the best I've heard about
16:07 - working for Google well um I really
16:11 - enjoy working at Google that's why I've
16:12 - been here for 15 years and I think the
16:16 - best part about working for Google is
16:18 - that I get to work with a lot of great
16:20 - people and everyone who works here is
16:23 - trying to do the right thing and a lot
16:25 - of times we have to make really hard
16:27 - decisions about
16:29 - what we want to um like our search
16:31 - results um or what are the things that
16:32 - we want to build next and um and the
16:36 - things that we do they're used by people
16:38 - all over the world and so sometimes um
16:42 - sometimes we will launch something so
16:44 - like the doodle um for example which
16:46 - probably so that's actually something I
16:48 - I first I was like actually one of the
16:50 - first people who did all the Doodles for
16:51 - Google and so we would do a doodle and
16:54 - then we would launch it and within an
16:57 - hour people would write to us was from
16:58 - all over the world about what they
17:00 - thought about the doodle whether they
17:01 - liked it whether they didn't like it
17:03 - whether they wanted it in their country
17:05 - and so it's been really really great to
17:06 - be able to do important things but also
17:09 - hear from all the users who use it and
17:13 - um why it's important to them as well
17:16 - all right thank you okay uh two more
17:18 - questions Simmons Elementary Simon's
17:22 - Elementary I'm sorry question
17:25 - sir okay hi yeah Simon go
17:29 - ahead okay go ahead sweetie car comp car
17:33 - companies have been working on
17:35 - autonomous vehicles Google has been
17:37 - working on this concept for some time
17:39 - what makes Google interested in cars
17:41 - that drive themselves and what future do
17:43 - they see in this
17:46 - technology thank you so much um so I've
17:49 - been very interested in the um in the
17:52 - cars um
17:54 - because uh you know I think this is an
17:57 - example of something that nobody was
17:59 - doing until Google decided to get into
18:02 - doing self-driving cars and so it was an
18:05 - example of how we could take technology
18:07 - and apply it to something that no one
18:09 - else was doing anything with which was
18:11 - cars and if you think about all the
18:13 - things that we do um driving is one
18:17 - place that we could make it a lot safer
18:19 - because we have cars and the cars um can
18:22 - look at things and they can say oh look
18:24 - there's a car in front of you or um look
18:27 - you know something is you want to go
18:29 - left but there's a car there so it can
18:31 - make our driving a lot lot safer and so
18:34 - we realized that we could take
18:35 - technology we could put it into cars and
18:37 - we could make it better for everybody um
18:40 - and so also like think about it if you
18:43 - have self-driving cars like they could
18:44 - park themselves um you don't need to
18:47 - park them anymore and so I've been very
18:50 - excited about this also because I have
18:51 - kids who are going to start driving um
18:54 - and so I'm really keep encouraging the
18:56 - self-driving team to try to to make
18:58 - those self-driving cars available before
19:01 - my kids start driving um so they can be
19:04 - super safe on the road and I'm sure that
19:06 - by all of you especially those of you
19:08 - who are in the younger grades um you
19:10 - might not ever have to even learn to
19:11 - drive maybe you'll just have
19:13 - self-driving cars so if you actually
19:15 - look on the on YouTube there's a video
19:17 - about a blind man who uses a
19:20 - self-driving car and it's a really great
19:23 - example about someone who otherwise
19:24 - wouldn't be able to drive but because of
19:26 - that he's now able to go by him self and
19:29 - do different tasks um so um I'm really
19:32 - looking forward to the self-driving car
19:34 - and I'm sure it will be something
19:35 - available for all of you when you get
19:37 - older great thank you okay and our last
19:40 - question comes from Trinity Lutheran
19:42 - School so Trinity Lutheran
19:46 - School hi
19:48 - hi um hello um what kind of jobs can
19:53 - coders get at Google what kind of jobs
19:57 - can can can uh can you said did can
20:00 - students get it
20:04 - Google yes yes um well so we have lots
20:08 - of jobs at Google where Google is hiring
20:11 - um not just at our headquarters but all
20:13 - over the United States and actually all
20:15 - over the world and um we have a website
20:18 - um
20:19 - google.com/jobs and it lists all the
20:21 - different jobs that we have but we also
20:23 - have internships for students to come
20:26 - and to uh when they're in college they
20:29 - can come and they can work in the
20:30 - Summers and they can see if they like it
20:33 - um we can see if it's a fit so we have a
20:35 - lot of different jobs but the jobs are
20:37 - everything I really want to um remind
20:39 - people that the jobs we have a lot of
20:41 - jobs for people who become engineers uh
20:44 - but and who want to build things but we
20:46 - also have jobs in every field we have
20:48 - jobs for people who want to um design
20:50 - the UI so they're designer jobs we have
20:53 - jobs for people in legal um we have jobs
20:55 - for people who want to work with other
20:57 - people like hiring or recruiting those
20:59 - are job those are called human
21:01 - relationship um jobs and so we basically
21:05 - hire all different kinds of people but
21:08 - uh it's always good to have some
21:10 - background in computer science and
21:12 - understand how technology works but you
21:14 - don't have to be a computer scientist to
21:15 - work at Google um we also have sales
21:17 - lots of people who work in sales they go
21:19 - out they do presentations about the
21:20 - company so really we're hiring all kinds
21:23 - of people and um I encourage all of you
21:26 - guys when you grow up
21:28 - and you uh get go to college to consider
21:32 - jobs at Google and to apply apply to a
21:34 - lot of places apply to technology
21:35 - companies because there's a lot of
21:36 - growth and I think there'll be really
21:38 - good careers for all of you and that's
21:40 - why I think it's so important for you
21:42 - all to be thinking about technology is
21:44 - because that's where a lot of our future
21:46 - is and I think it will be great career
21:48 - options for all of you wow okay well
21:51 - look Susan thank you so much for taking

22:15 - cop okay right and um and remember have
22:19 - a great
22:21 - time okay have a great time this week
22:25 - everyone doing the RF code uh we've had
22:27 - a great time put together for you we've
22:28 - had a great time getting ready for this
22:30 - uh this is going to be the biggest
22:31 - educational event in history so by
22:33 - participating in the hour of code this
22:35 - week you are part of the new world
22:36 - record and you're part of literally
22:38 - making history we've never had more
22:39 - students try computer programming uh
22:41 - than we're going to have this week so
22:42 - thank you for that again Susan thank you
22:43 - very much for taking part thank you okay
22:46 - bye everyone bye everyone thank you so
22:48 - much for participating in the hour of
22:54 - code

Cleaned transcript:

us for this Tech luminary chat with Susan wsky from Google and Susan was one of the first employees of Google she's in charge of the entire advertising business at Google which is the largest source of revenue for Google and she's been called one of the most powerful women in the computer industry without any more Ado I'm gonna turn it over to Susan for a few comments Susan great good morning everyone it's wonderful to have so many people here participating in our hour of code and our computer science education week and um I thought I would just give a little background about me and about why computer science has been so important to my life and all the things that I've been able to do and why I think it's really important for all of you to be aware of and I should probably also mention I also have four kids um and they actually had hour of code at my kids school as well and so I participated there too and I know it was really meaningful for them so I hope I can make it very meaningful for you too so um um I've worked on lots of different things at Google um I got interested in computer science because I was always like to build things and create things so I don't know how many of you there in the audience like playing with Lego um maybe I can see your hands like how many of you guys like Lego um maybe when you were kids for the older kids the ones uh when you were little um or how many of you like doing different kinds of art projects um any kind of art project drawing Ceramics um whatever so these are the kind of things that I used to like to do when I was a kid and the other thing I also really liked was I liked um I used to have a little businesses on the side I used to sell lemons from my neighbors I don't know how and have lemonade stands I don't know how many of you are interested in that um but as I got older I realized that I could build things using computer science and I could distribute them not just to my neighbors but to the entire world and um so that's what I've been able to do as part of Google um is take some computer science um be able to build things and make things um like image search for example is one of the products that probably all of you use that I wound up being able to build and create and now it's used by people all over the world so it's been really enriching for me and I hope it can be really enriching for all of you now I'm not I'm sure that all of you um are interested in phones either you have your own phone or play with your parents phone um so how many of you here know about games like Angry Birds can I just see how many of you have played Angry Birds or heard about Angry Birds so I'm going to guess looks like okay I see pretty much everybody here has raised their hands um for Angry Birds and and so Angry Birds is um something that has been really fun for all of us to be able to create to use but it's also something that if you know computer science you can actually create you could create something like Angry Birds for yourself and for your friends and so if you go to the code.org website they have some really interesting games that you can play with Angry Birds where you can program um some really basic commands for Angry Birds and um if you think about computers they're really really um they're very basic um computers don't really know anything they're kind of dumb uh and it requires you to be able to make them smart um it's up to you to be able to say um what they what you want them to do and how you can make them do all the things that you want to do and so once you know a little computer science you can be in charge you can make that computer do what you want to do um you can make it do U make games like Angry Birds um you can change how the Pig and the and the birds interact um you can create new games and so computer science overall is something that will enable you to be able to um change your lives in the future and so what I see being at Google is that all of your lives in the future are going to be so digital um everything we do is going to have computers in the future and so if you can learn a little bit about computers even if you're not planning on being a computer scientist um you can do a lot more things and so it's going to be really important for all of you to learn that in the future um for whatever job you consider so I encourage all of you to be thinking about that and to be learning a little bit of computer science it's really fun and you'll see that once you learn a little bit you can do a lot of things with it and um it can really change your life so even whatever career you're planning on doing if you're planning on being a doctor or even if you're planning on being an artist so for example one of my best friends she's an artist she's a muralist and you wouldn't think you need computers but she uh advertises using Google um and she has a website so people can find her and it's because she knew a little bit about computer science that she's been able to have customers and be able to do so many interesting things so I just I'm really excited that your all of your schools are participating I hope you'll all do the hour of code um and if you want to know more you can go to code.org they have lots of places where you can learn about new programs and they have lots of games where you can play with the Angry Birds um um Angry Birds games and puzzles um and it will show you what programming is like and it's anyone can do it um my kindergartener um started out and tried to use it and my oldest child who is going into high school has also been able to use some of the games and been able to have a lot of fun so I really encourage any of you to um to check to check it out and to learn a little bit about computer science so I'm looking forward to doing questions uh let's yeah so so Susan thank you so much for for for for that great uction okay the first question is from Marine Joy charter school so Marine Joy Charter School want to come up the microphone where are you we're right here go ahead Amber louder go ahead just read this we are curious to know what challenges have you faced as a woman in the technical field I'm sorry yeah go ahead we are curious to know what challenges have you faced as a woman in a technical fi yeah so thank you so much for that question and um I me I think you're you're it's a good question because traditionally there haven't been as many girls or women in computer science and um I think that has been something that I've been wanting to try to change because I think it's really important and there are actually some girls and women that have been really successful in computer science so I know it's a great career and the challenges um I guess I would say is mostly that a lot of the people that are your peers right now are are men um or boys but the one of the ways I've really encouraged that and I encourage this from my own daughter too is to find someone else that is interested in it um and to do it with a friend and so what I found is is that even if most of the people that are around me are are male that there's always enough women that are really interesting um and that I can be friends with that I can do it with them that it winds up being a really fun and positive experience um so like some of the people like Marissa who's the CEO of Yahoo and Cheryl who's the CEO of of Facebook they've all been friends of mine they all worked at Google um we still are talk all the time um about different things that we um challenges that we have and so having a friend really can make a difference okay thank you lyat hi um we were wondering what risks did you uh take and obstacles did you overcome trying to get where you are today thank you so much for that question um well probably the biggest risk that I took was I joined Google when it was a really small company uh Google I joined Google when there were only 16 people and they were um I actually left a really big company I left Intel to join a company with only 16 people in it and um I was one of the first and uh women there and so but it was a it was something I was really excited about doing I was excited I saw that technology and Google could change the world I could saw that they their search engine was much better and so it was a big change for me to leave a big company and go to a tiny little company uh but I'm really glad I did and um I think sometimes with technology it's changing so fast that a lot of times we need to take risks we need to say this is what we think the future is going to look like and we have to plan for the future instead of plan for what we have right now so um I think technology is a great field but yeah it does include a few risks um but but the good news is that everyone takes risks and sometimes they work out and sometimes they don't and so um it's very forgiving people understand that a lot of times companies don't work out well um and they just those people usually just move on to the next one and it's okay so I encourage all of you to to try something and to take a risk sometimes especially when you're when you're young like all of you right thank thank you so much for that question all right very middle school and wave your hands to identify yourself okay very Middle School great okay go ahead what is your typical day like and what is your favorite part of your job oh thank you so much for that question uh well my typical day is um right now I I because I'm a manager responsible for a big part of Google most of what I do is I have meetings um but the meetings usually what we do is we talk about the the things that we're going to do next and so we talk about all the different ways that we're going to make Google better and so we CH we say for example like let's think about what Google's going to look like in the future what are people going to use um two years from now or a year from now and we think about this is how things could be so much better because everyone's going to have the internet and everyone's going to have phones um and we think and then we try to invent what the future is going to look like and then we actually build it and so we have meetings where people say this is how I think the future's going to be these are the products I'm really excited about and they they show um what we call mocks they show um pictures of what it would look like and we talk about the users and we actually sometimes go out and we talk to people like all of you and we say well what do you think about this would you like to use something like this and then we actually build it so I spend most of my time in meetings and the meetings a lot of times are talking about what we're going to build and what's working and what's not working and probably my favorite part of the day is is when I see something sometimes what happens to me is someone shows me something about what they're planning on building and it looks so amazing um and so like just for example um sometimes we've been the first ones to be able to see something like I worked on um very early versions of what is now YouTube and the first time we actually saw that and we saw wellow people all over the world can send us video and people can see it and share it and I actually showed it to my kids and they were like wow this is so great um and so when we see something that is just we know it's going to be important for the future um but it hasn't come out yet to the world that is a really really that's probably my favorite part of my job because then we know that's something that we're going to be able to bring to everybody and it will really be successful thank you so much for that question okay next we have Sam Houston Sam Houston School what is one way you apply computer science to your job at Google Sor one more time what is one way you apply computer science at your to your job at Google yeah that's a great question um well lots of people who work at Google have studied computer science there are lots and lots of experts in computer science and that's because Google builds a lot of things um and in order we run Google which you probably all know but also YouTube and chrome um and Android which runs on your phone and so we have um thousands of Engineers and they are building all of those things and um they're building those services to make them work for you but they're also building all the computers that actually support that and enable it to run and to serve for you really quickly and so there are lots and lots of computer scientists at Google and probably the way that I use it is in terms of understanding what we can build next and so it's been really really helpful for me to understand computer science okay all right thank you very much okay next we have the Midland Academy and again wave your hand so I know which one you are Midland Academy great okay Midland Academy do you have any advice for students trying to decide on their own career path let's see maybe we could repeat the question it do I have any advice advice for students trying to decide on their own career paths um well let's see so my my advice that I give to people when they're trying to do their career path is um two things which I think first of all so you have to choose something that you really enjoy doing um because you're going to spend a lot of time doing it so it should be something you like but I also encourage people to um to do something that is growing I think if you can go into a new area and do something that hasn't been done before or you can go into um something that is new it's always easier and so that's why if you look at the computer science degrees um there's going to be so much demand for people who know computer science in the future and um actually even all the people in the United States who are getting degrees there's there isn't enough demand um there's so many jobs that we can't fill with even all the people getting computer science degrees so I encourage all of you to well do things you love do things that you think are going to be important um but I think it would be great to look at doing things also with technology because if you think about the world everything's going to change um maybe even like our refrigerators in the future will have some kind of technology in them or our toasters or our shoes and so um and so everything is going to change and so it's really exciting if you can be a part of that great thank you okay uh hum Elementary good morning we wanted to ask you w wave your hand there you go okay go ahead matter matter good morning we wanted to ask you what is the best part about working for Google oh the best I've heard about working for Google well um I really enjoy working at Google that's why I've been here for 15 years and I think the best part about working for Google is that I get to work with a lot of great people and everyone who works here is trying to do the right thing and a lot of times we have to make really hard decisions about what we want to um like our search results um or what are the things that we want to build next and um and the things that we do they're used by people all over the world and so sometimes um sometimes we will launch something so like the doodle um for example which probably so that's actually something I I first I was like actually one of the first people who did all the Doodles for Google and so we would do a doodle and then we would launch it and within an hour people would write to us was from all over the world about what they thought about the doodle whether they liked it whether they didn't like it whether they wanted it in their country and so it's been really really great to be able to do important things but also hear from all the users who use it and um why it's important to them as well all right thank you okay uh two more questions Simmons Elementary Simon's Elementary I'm sorry question sir okay hi yeah Simon go ahead okay go ahead sweetie car comp car companies have been working on autonomous vehicles Google has been working on this concept for some time what makes Google interested in cars that drive themselves and what future do they see in this technology thank you so much um so I've been very interested in the um in the cars um because uh you know I think this is an example of something that nobody was doing until Google decided to get into doing selfdriving cars and so it was an example of how we could take technology and apply it to something that no one else was doing anything with which was cars and if you think about all the things that we do um driving is one place that we could make it a lot safer because we have cars and the cars um can look at things and they can say oh look there's a car in front of you or um look you know something is you want to go left but there's a car there so it can make our driving a lot lot safer and so we realized that we could take technology we could put it into cars and we could make it better for everybody um and so also like think about it if you have selfdriving cars like they could park themselves um you don't need to park them anymore and so I've been very excited about this also because I have kids who are going to start driving um and so I'm really keep encouraging the selfdriving team to try to to make those selfdriving cars available before my kids start driving um so they can be super safe on the road and I'm sure that by all of you especially those of you who are in the younger grades um you might not ever have to even learn to drive maybe you'll just have selfdriving cars so if you actually look on the on YouTube there's a video about a blind man who uses a selfdriving car and it's a really great example about someone who otherwise wouldn't be able to drive but because of that he's now able to go by him self and do different tasks um so um I'm really looking forward to the selfdriving car and I'm sure it will be something available for all of you when you get older great thank you okay and our last question comes from Trinity Lutheran School so Trinity Lutheran School hi hi um hello um what kind of jobs can coders get at Google what kind of jobs can can can uh can you said did can students get it Google yes yes um well so we have lots of jobs at Google where Google is hiring um not just at our headquarters but all over the United States and actually all over the world and um we have a website um google.com/jobs and it lists all the different jobs that we have but we also have internships for students to come and to uh when they're in college they can come and they can work in the Summers and they can see if they like it um we can see if it's a fit so we have a lot of different jobs but the jobs are everything I really want to um remind people that the jobs we have a lot of jobs for people who become engineers uh but and who want to build things but we also have jobs in every field we have jobs for people who want to um design the UI so they're designer jobs we have jobs for people in legal um we have jobs for people who want to work with other people like hiring or recruiting those are job those are called human relationship um jobs and so we basically hire all different kinds of people but uh it's always good to have some background in computer science and understand how technology works but you don't have to be a computer scientist to work at Google um we also have sales lots of people who work in sales they go out they do presentations about the company so really we're hiring all kinds of people and um I encourage all of you guys when you grow up and you uh get go to college to consider jobs at Google and to apply apply to a lot of places apply to technology companies because there's a lot of growth and I think there'll be really good careers for all of you and that's why I think it's so important for you all to be thinking about technology is because that's where a lot of our future is and I think it will be great career options for all of you wow okay well look Susan thank you so much for taking time out of your busy day we know how busy you are and to spend half an hour with these students it means everything so thank you very much do everyone here a round of applause for Susan uh I know you're all muted but we can all at least see it everyone cop okay right and um and remember have a great time okay have a great time this week everyone doing the RF code uh we've had a great time put together for you we've had a great time getting ready for this uh this is going to be the biggest educational event in history so by participating in the hour of code this week you are part of the new world record and you're part of literally making history we've never had more students try computer programming uh than we're going to have this week so thank you for that again Susan thank you very much for taking part thank you okay bye everyone bye everyone thank you so much for participating in the hour of code
