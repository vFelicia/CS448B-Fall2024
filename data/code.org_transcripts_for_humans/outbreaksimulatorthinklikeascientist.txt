Cleaned transcript:

Now that you have your simulation running and have observed how maks and population changes affect the spread of the virus, it's time to think more like a scientist. In the next part of the activity, you'll see how things like recovering, chance, and vaccines can change the outcome of each simulation run. Because the monsters show up in random locations on your screen every time you click run, try clicking reset and run a few different times and see what causes the virus to spread quicker or slower. You can also start making predictions and collecting data before you hit run. What do you think will happen? After you press run, how long does it take for half the monsters to get sick? What about all the monsters? Does it change every time you hit run? As you build your model, think about what you might want to change. I suggest changing only one thing at a time and comparing how each model changes the simulation. Keep tinkering to find a good solution. You can share with Dr Monster.
