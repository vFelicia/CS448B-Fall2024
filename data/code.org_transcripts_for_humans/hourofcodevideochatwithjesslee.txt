00:01 - hello everyone and thank you for joining
00:03 - us today for a stressful hour of code
00:06 - video chat to celebrate Computer Science
00:08 - Education Week with us today is justly
00:11 - the CEO and co-founder of the community
00:14 - powered social commerce website Polly
00:17 - born Jess is a computer science graduate
00:19 - from Stanford before co-founding
00:21 - Polyvore jess was a product manager at
00:24 - Google where she worked on Google Maps
00:27 - and launched features like my maps and
00:29 - draggable driving directions please join
00:32 - me in welcoming gesture eight well we'll
01:14 - get started with questions our first
01:16 - question comes from dr. and weighing
01:18 - middle school and Lowell Massachusetts
01:24 - how did you get involved in poly born
01:27 - sure um I was the product manager at
01:32 - Google I was super happy and excited to
01:34 - be working on and then one day someone
01:37 - showed me Polyvore it was a friend of
01:40 - mine
01:40 - we shared an off and showed it to me and
01:42 - I just started using the product every
01:44 - night because I loved it so much so poly
01:46 - bar lets you mix and match clothing into
01:49 - the outfit through these collages that
01:50 - we call sets and millions of people come
01:53 - to browse and shop those looks and I
01:54 - started playing with it and I just loved
01:56 - it because it was kind of this
01:57 - combination of art and technology and I
02:00 - was just really excited user and so I
02:01 - wrote a note to the co-founders I didn't
02:03 - know them at the time but I just wrote a
02:06 - note with some product suggestions some
02:08 - complaints and feedback and they wrote
02:10 - back and said hey why don't why don't
02:12 - you come here
02:13 - instead of complaining why don't you
02:14 - come and fix it yourself why don't you
02:15 - join us at Polyvore and that's how I got
02:17 - involved and met them in real life
02:19 - really liked them and decided hey I
02:21 - think I want to do this so I ended up at
02:23 - Polyvore did a little bit of everything
02:25 - we're very small at the time about a
02:27 - company of five people so I did
02:30 - everything from writing code to washing
02:32 - dishes to selling advertising got to
02:35 - learn a lot of new cool things and we've
02:37 - grown and grown since then and we're
02:38 - about 120 people at the company now and
02:41 - I became CEO about three years ago but
02:43 - it's been a pretty exciting and kind of
02:46 - unusual journey but that's how I got
02:48 - involved so I would say it kind of
02:50 - taught me to be proactive about you know
02:53 - when you have feedback on something or
02:54 - you're interested in something just go
02:56 - for it because you never know what will
02:57 - happen like I when I wrote to them I
02:59 - really wasn't expecting to get a job I
03:01 - just really excited about the product
03:03 - and what it did and it sort of changed
03:05 - my life to join the company so
03:07 - definitely be proactive thank you Jeff
03:11 - our next question is from Kenosha School
03:14 - of Technology enhanced curriculum in
03:16 - Kenosha Wisconsin so what was the
03:22 - greatest obstacle you face on your path
03:24 - to becoming a CEO how did you overcome
03:27 - it yeah so um the biggest obstacle I had
03:31 - to overcome was being kind of quiet and
03:33 - kind of introverted so in middle school
03:35 - and high school I was definitely pretty
03:37 - shy and quiet
03:39 - I didn't and I guess I kind of grew up
03:41 - with this impression that if you're an
03:43 - introvert or if you're kind of quiet you
03:45 - can't be a leader and it turned out that
03:48 - that's not true
03:49 - so I think I definitely I've learned
03:52 - that over the last few years that you
03:54 - can be a great leader leader even if
03:55 - you're an introvert as long as you can
03:57 - get people to to follow you have good
03:59 - ideas you know how to get stuff done
04:01 - another obstacle is I really hate public
04:03 - speaking and I have had to do a lot of
04:06 - it over the course of years and it's one
04:08 - of those things where even if you're
04:09 - super nervous in the beginning you just
04:11 - get better and better at it in middle
04:14 - school I had no in high school I had to
04:15 - read announcements out loud to the whole
04:19 - like my whole school as part of like my
04:21 - job at on student council and I would
04:23 - shake because I'm so scared of doing it
04:26 - and now I have to regularly give
04:27 - speeches in front of hundreds of people
04:28 - so just one of those things you just
04:29 - practice and get better at so that's
04:32 - probably the greatest obstacle being
04:35 - quiet and being not liking public
04:37 - speaking just take some practice alright
04:42 - next question is from Reidsville middle
04:44 - school and Reidsville North Carolina
04:49 - what do you look for when hiring a new
04:52 - person for your company um there are a
04:56 - lot of different things but one of them
04:57 - is we look for someone who has this
05:00 - innate drive to kind of make an impact
05:02 - who wants to do more you're the kind of
05:04 - person who volunteers to do a little bit
05:06 - more rather than just kind of skating by
05:09 - on the bare minimum we also care about
05:12 - we also look for people who are nice
05:14 - work sucks if you're working with jerks
05:17 - you don't there's no point so we want to
05:21 - make sure that you get to come to work
05:22 - and hang out with people that you
05:23 - actually would like to be around who are
05:26 - trying to do the right thing and we also
05:28 - look for people who are detail-oriented
05:29 - because a lot of the the product that we
05:31 - build has a lot of little details we
05:33 - want to make sure we get them right so
05:35 - those are some of the things that we
05:36 - care about
05:43 - and this is a O'Connell hydro in
05:48 - Arlington Virginia on so what inspired
05:53 - you to create a fashion website based on
05:56 - social interactions with people from
05:57 - around the world as opposed to just
05:59 - promoting transfer renowned designers so
06:02 - I mean I didn't come up with the
06:03 - original idea for poly board but um the
06:06 - the reason I was so drawn to it is
06:09 - because it all the style on Polyvore
06:12 - comes from this community of people all
06:13 - over the world I definitely felt like
06:16 - when I was growing up there was sort of
06:18 - this ideal of beauty and fashion that
06:22 - was upheld as like this is what you're
06:24 - supposed to look like I definitely felt
06:27 - that in high school middle school that I
06:28 - didn't look like that and it kind of
06:31 - felt it made me feel kind of bad about
06:33 - my style and so as I got older only then
06:38 - did I realize that those images that you
06:41 - see in the magazines a lot of them are
06:43 - incredibly airbrushed and the camera
06:46 - adds like I don't know 20 pounds and it
06:49 - just it once I saw Mike the first time I
06:51 - ever saw a real life runway model and
06:54 - realize I was like oh my gosh she Wow
06:56 - that's what I was wanting to look like
06:59 - that that would never be possible and it
07:01 - just seems kind of a shame that that's
07:04 - sort of the image of beauty that's
07:06 - upheld so the idea of democratizing
07:09 - style and making it so anybody could say
07:11 - no this is how this is beautiful this is
07:13 - what I think style should look like and
07:15 - being able to share that and get
07:18 - followers and you don't have to live in
07:19 - New York or Paris or Milan to be a
07:21 - trendsetter you just need to have a
07:23 - great perspective on style and be able
07:25 - to build an audience that idea just
07:27 - really really sort of appealed to me the
07:29 - idea of democratizing style great
07:33 - Coolidge middle school from Reading
07:36 - Massachusetts how long did the creation
07:42 - marketing is poly boy take it at what
07:44 - point did you consider your site
07:45 - successful well the funny thing is I've
07:49 - never really felt like woodland truly
07:51 - successful we keep hitting milestones
07:52 - that we keep getting bigger and bigger
07:53 - but then the world's always
07:55 - underneath us so you know the we have a
07:59 - great website but what about oh now we
08:00 - need to be on mobile apps and mobile
08:02 - phones and so the the bar is constantly
08:05 - getting higher as we get bigger and
08:08 - bigger and the and we're always
08:10 - constantly creating right because you do
08:12 - never stop like all the best products
08:13 - are always adding new features or
08:15 - improvements or changes as the world
08:17 - changes so we'll never really be done
08:20 - it's constantly ongoing and it that's
08:22 - kind of what makes it fun like I think
08:23 - it's it would be boring if we felt like
08:25 - oh we're done now we're super successful
08:27 - let's just chill and do nothing
08:29 - so you know it's gonna keep it's gonna
08:32 - keep going for a while I would say now
08:37 - we're gonna hear from Fairfield high
08:38 - school and how has being a woman in a
08:43 - male-dominated field how many field
08:46 - affected you positively and negatively
08:49 - so I'll start with positively I think in
08:54 - tech there aren't as many women but one
08:57 - of the unique things I bring to the
08:58 - table is an innate understanding of what
09:00 - email users why I personally you know
09:03 - care about style I like shopping I like
09:05 - home decor and those are the things that
09:07 - Polly Wars user community cares about
09:09 - and I just have a stronger connection to
09:11 - that because I am that user that's an
09:14 - advantage over I think other people who
09:16 - might not like a guy who might not be
09:18 - able to understand like deeply movie
09:20 - like because they're not a user
09:21 - themselves however I have seen plenty of
09:24 - I have met tons of men who are really
09:26 - good at getting in the heads of you know
09:28 - use email use I have also met women who
09:30 - are not good at getting in the heads of
09:32 - women email users too so it's you know
09:34 - there's all sorts but I think that's one
09:37 - of the unique things that's an advantage
09:38 - there's fewer people who deeply
09:40 - understand the audience that we're
09:42 - trying to build a product for maybe one
09:46 - of the negatives is that the people who
09:48 - control the money the investors who give
09:51 - you money and say here's money you know
09:52 - here's your loan basically or here's the
09:55 - money to go build your company that that
09:58 - industry the investor industry is
10:00 - definitely dominated by men and because
10:02 - they're not our user they have a harder
10:05 - time understanding innately our product
10:07 - so when I try to explain
10:08 - to them they might not get it right away
10:10 - and it takes a little bit more time so
10:12 - that's probably been one of the
10:13 - disadvantages thank you our last
10:18 - question comes from ta Howard middle
10:20 - school and Arlington Texas - what do you
10:24 - attribute your success today
10:27 - was it a skill a class a mentor or a
10:30 - life experience or all the above that's
10:33 - a great question um I think it's
10:37 - actually a approach you know it's a way
10:42 - of doing things I think one of the
10:44 - things that's made me that's helped me a
10:47 - lot is the the drive to go and try
10:52 - things try and learn even if I'm not
10:55 - sure I'll succeed I'm willing to kind of
10:57 - take a risk and I want to go for it
10:59 - because just as the understanding I have
11:02 - this understanding that even if I don't
11:04 - succeed at what I've tried to do at
11:07 - least I'll have learned something useful
11:08 - and then I can take that back with me
11:10 - and go do the next thing
11:14 - I realized how important this was
11:16 - probably in in high school so a couple
11:19 - examples like those our life experiences
11:21 - sort of shaked me but then taught me
11:24 - this approach to life so one example is
11:27 - my English teacher
11:29 - in high school I was an in AP English or
11:32 - one of the Honors English classes I was
11:34 - in regular English and she came to me
11:37 - she said hey you know what you should
11:38 - just take the AP English exam even
11:39 - though you haven't read any of the books
11:40 - I'm not qualified really - or you're not
11:42 - like you haven't fulfilled the prereqs
11:43 - just take it and I said well why why
11:46 - would I do that like well I mean I
11:47 - probably wouldn't pass she's like no
11:49 - just go for it doesn't matter just go
11:51 - for it so then I I did and I did really
11:52 - well on that exam and I just realized
11:55 - that taught me huh maybe maybe you
11:57 - should go for things even if you're not
11:58 - you know God if even if you don't have
12:01 - the right prerequisites on paper just go
12:04 - for it um another example was I ran for
12:07 - Student Council for class treasurer and
12:10 - I don't really think that I it didn't
12:11 - seem like I would win because I wasn't
12:13 - popular I was more quiet more
12:15 - introverted wasn't really very well
12:16 - known but it turns out that all the
12:17 - other I guess quiet kids and nerds like
12:21 - me voted for me and then I realized that
12:22 - hey you can still be a leader and I
12:23 - learned a lot from from doing that and
12:25 - having to speak in front of in front of
12:27 - the class so there was a lot of those
12:29 - two things taught me that you should
12:31 - always take sort of push yourself to
12:33 - take something more do something more
12:35 - challenging and then you'll definitely
12:36 - learn something from it and then when I
12:38 - got to college and I was I was looking
12:41 - for a job I was interviewing and I met
12:45 - Marissa Mayer during my interviews at
12:47 - Google she was not she's now the CEO of
12:49 - Yahoo but back then she was working at
12:52 - Google in the director of product and I
12:55 - met her during my interviews and she
12:56 - told me I asked her for some advice and
12:58 - she basically said exactly that she said
13:00 - you should always take the more
13:02 - challenging path and go where you're
13:05 - gonna Garrett you're guaranteed to grow
13:07 - and learn even if you're not gonna be
13:09 - successful and that advice is what got
13:11 - me to you know join Polyvore when I felt
13:14 - like I've never done started before how
13:15 - could I possibly do that and then when
13:17 - the opportunity comes CEO came up I
13:18 - thought I mean I've never done that
13:20 - before but why not try it and it's you
13:23 - know all those some of the best
13:24 - decisions I've ever made have been when
13:25 - I do just sort of went for it even
13:27 - though I didn't
13:28 - you'll like it was a guaranteed success
13:30 - yeah and I've failed sometimes too but
13:33 - even then you learn something that you
13:35 - take with you thanks guys we actually
13:38 - have one more question we had an eight
13:41 - school that couldn't join us protect
13:43 - difficulty so I'm just going to ask a
13:44 - question if you are starting out today
13:47 - what is one thing you would do
13:49 - differently in pursuit of your career
13:51 - goals um you know what I I'm pretty I
13:59 - guess I'm pretty happy with how things
14:01 - turned out I had a lot of angst around
14:02 - some of the decisions I made career-wise
14:04 - and some of the risks I took I didn't
14:08 - know at the time that those were good
14:09 - decisions so maybe if I could go back
14:11 - and talk to my younger self I would say
14:14 - you know go for it more like don't don't
14:16 - be worried about the risk risk is good
14:18 - um the other thing maybe I wish I'd done
14:21 - was I wish that I had learned a little
14:23 - bit more of some practical skills in
14:25 - college and high school and specifically
14:28 - things like Photoshop graphic design
14:32 - those things come in really really handy
14:34 - later a lot of work requires or can be
14:37 - helped by having a good understanding of
14:39 - design I wish I had spent more time
14:41 - writing and then actually wish I'd spent
14:43 - more time programming at a younger age I
14:45 - think the cool thing about computer
14:47 - science and about programming is it kind
14:50 - of teaches you this mentality or this
14:53 - approach where any big hairy complex
14:57 - problem that you have in life can be
14:59 - broken down and decomposed into smaller
15:02 - problems and then those smaller problems
15:04 - can be broken into even smaller problems
15:06 - and then you can tackle the small
15:08 - problems one at a time and that makes
15:11 - the big hairy problem seem less scary
15:14 - and that's one thing that's kind of the
15:17 - core principle underlying computer
15:19 - science and the that's that approach I
15:23 - wish I learned that sooner
15:30 - okay so um someone just wrote in and
15:33 - that's what influenced your major
15:35 - decision in college um so I I wasn't
15:41 - sure what I wanted to major in but I
15:43 - took a computer science class my
15:45 - freshman year and I just really really
15:47 - liked it I liked the the whole what I
15:50 - just talked about about decomposing
15:52 - problems into smaller pieces and then I
15:53 - loved that the output of my homework was
15:57 - basically a real product that someone
15:59 - else could play with like sometimes this
16:01 - little game or a little email client but
16:02 - just the idea that you could learn a
16:04 - skill that would enable you to build
16:06 - anything like that that was so cool to
16:08 - me and I just really enjoyed it so I
16:11 - thought that's why I was just cuz I took
16:12 - that first class great well thank you so
16:16 - much Jess for joining us today
16:17 - we appreciate you think I'm answering
16:19 - questions and sharing more with us yeah
16:21 - sorry more students to try computer
16:23 - science

16:29 - technology

16:33 - joining us today
16:34 - we hope you have a great time sharing
16:36 - this video chat so round of applause
16:39 - everyone

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for a stressful hour of code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week with us today is justly the CEO and cofounder of the community powered social commerce website Polly born Jess is a computer science graduate from Stanford before cofounding Polyvore jess was a product manager at Google where she worked on Google Maps and launched features like my maps and draggable driving directions please join me in welcoming gesture eight well we'll get started with questions our first question comes from dr. and weighing middle school and Lowell Massachusetts how did you get involved in poly born sure um I was the product manager at Google I was super happy and excited to be working on and then one day someone showed me Polyvore it was a friend of mine we shared an off and showed it to me and I just started using the product every night because I loved it so much so poly bar lets you mix and match clothing into the outfit through these collages that we call sets and millions of people come to browse and shop those looks and I started playing with it and I just loved it because it was kind of this combination of art and technology and I was just really excited user and so I wrote a note to the cofounders I didn't know them at the time but I just wrote a note with some product suggestions some complaints and feedback and they wrote back and said hey why don't why don't you come here instead of complaining why don't you come and fix it yourself why don't you join us at Polyvore and that's how I got involved and met them in real life really liked them and decided hey I think I want to do this so I ended up at Polyvore did a little bit of everything we're very small at the time about a company of five people so I did everything from writing code to washing dishes to selling advertising got to learn a lot of new cool things and we've grown and grown since then and we're about 120 people at the company now and I became CEO about three years ago but it's been a pretty exciting and kind of unusual journey but that's how I got involved so I would say it kind of taught me to be proactive about you know when you have feedback on something or you're interested in something just go for it because you never know what will happen like I when I wrote to them I really wasn't expecting to get a job I just really excited about the product and what it did and it sort of changed my life to join the company so definitely be proactive thank you Jeff our next question is from Kenosha School of

airbrushed and the camera adds like I don't know 20 pounds and it just it once I saw Mike the first time I ever saw a real life runway model and realize I was like oh my gosh she Wow that's what I was wanting to look like that that would never be possible and it just seems kind of a shame that that's sort of the image of beauty that's upheld so the idea of democratizing style and making it so anybody could say no this is how this is beautiful this is what I think style should look like and being able to share that and get followers and you don't have to live in New York or Paris or Milan to be a trendsetter you just need to have a great perspective on style and be able to build an audience that idea just really really sort of appealed to me the idea of democratizing style great Coolidge middle school from Reading Massachusetts how long did the creation marketing is poly boy take it at what point did you consider your site successful well the funny thing is I've never really felt like woodland truly successful we keep hitting milestones that we keep getting bigger and bigger but then the world's always underneath us so you know the we have a great website but what about oh now we need to be on mobile apps and mobile phones and so the the bar is constantly getting higher as we get bigger and bigger and the and we're always constantly creating right because you do never stop like all the best products are always adding new features or improvements or changes as the world changes so we'll never really be done it's constantly ongoing and it that's kind of what makes it fun like I think it's it would be boring if we felt like oh we're done now we're super successful let's just chill and do nothing so you know it's gonna keep it's gonna keep going for a while I would say now we're gonna hear from Fairfield high school and how has being a woman in a maledominated field how many field affected you positively and negatively so I'll start with positively I think in tech there aren't as many women but one of the unique things I bring to the table is an innate understanding of what email users why I personally you know care about style I like shopping I like home decor and those are the things that Polly Wars user community cares about and I just have a stronger connection to that because I am that user that's an advantage over I think other people who might not like a guy who might not be able to understand like deeply movie like because they're not a user themselves however I have seen plenty of I have met tons of men who are really good at getting in the heads of you know use email use I have also met women who are not good at getting in the heads of women email users too so it's you know there's all sorts but I think that's one of the unique things that's an advantage there's fewer people who deeply understand the audience that we're trying to build a product for maybe one of the negatives is that the people who control the money the investors who give you money and say here's money you know here's your loan basically or here's the money to go build your company that that industry the investor industry is definitely dominated by men and because they're not our user they have a harder time understanding innately our product so when I try to explain to them they might not get it right away and it takes a little bit more time so that's probably been one of the disadvantages thank you our last question comes from ta Howard middle school and Arlington Texas what do you attribute your success today was it a skill a class a mentor or a life experience or all the above that's a great question um I think it's actually a approach you know it's a way of doing things I think one of the things that's made me that's helped me a lot is the the drive to go and try things try and learn even if I'm not sure I'll succeed I'm willing to kind of take a risk and I want to go for it because just as the understanding I have this understanding that even if I don't succeed at what I've tried to do at least I'll have learned something useful and then I can take that back with me and go do the next thing I realized how important this was probably in in high school so a couple examples like those our life experiences sort of shaked me but then taught me this approach to life so one example is my English teacher in high school I was an in AP English or one of the Honors English classes I was in regular English and she came to me she said hey you know what you should just take the AP English exam even though you haven't read any of the books I'm not qualified really or you're not like you haven't fulfilled the prereqs just take it and I said well why why would I do that like well I mean I probably wouldn't pass she's like no just go for it doesn't matter just go for it so then I I did and I did really well on that exam and I just realized that taught me huh maybe maybe you should go for things even if you're not you know God if even if you don't have the right prerequisites on paper just go for it um another example was I ran for Student Council for class treasurer and I don't really think that I it didn't seem like I would win because I wasn't popular I was more quiet more introverted wasn't really very well known but it turns out that all the other I guess quiet kids and nerds like me voted for me and then I realized that hey you can still be a leader and I learned a lot from from doing that and having to speak in front of in front of the class so there was a lot of those two things taught me that you should always take sort of push yourself to take something more do something more challenging and then you'll definitely learn something from it and then when I got to college and I was I was looking for a job I was interviewing and I met Marissa Mayer during my interviews at Google she was not she's now the CEO of Yahoo but back then she was working at Google in the director of product and I met her during my interviews and she told me I asked her for some advice and she basically said exactly that she said you should always take the more challenging path and go where you're gonna Garrett you're guaranteed to grow and learn even if you're not gonna be successful and that advice is what got me to you know join Polyvore when I felt like I've never done started before how could I possibly do that and then when the opportunity comes CEO came up I thought I mean I've never done that before but why not try it and it's you know all those some of the best decisions I've ever made have been when I do just sort of went for it even though I didn't you'll like it was a guaranteed success yeah and I've failed sometimes too but even then you learn something that you take with you thanks guys we actually have one more question we had an eight school that couldn't join us protect difficulty so I'm just going to ask a question if you are starting out today what is one thing you would do differently in pursuit of your career goals um you know what I I'm pretty I guess I'm pretty happy with how things turned out I had a lot of angst around some of the decisions I made careerwise and some of the risks I took I didn't know at the time that those were good decisions so maybe if I could go back and talk to my younger self I would say you know go for it more like don't don't be worried about the risk risk is good um the other thing maybe I wish I'd done was I wish that I had learned a little bit more of some practical skills in college and high school and specifically things like Photoshop graphic design those things come in really really handy later a lot of work requires or can be helped by having a good understanding of design I wish I had spent more time writing and then actually wish I'd spent more time programming at a younger age I think the cool thing about computer science and about programming is it kind of teaches you this mentality or this approach where any big hairy complex problem that you have in life can be broken down and decomposed into smaller problems and then those smaller problems can be broken into even smaller problems and then you can tackle the small problems one at a time and that makes the big hairy problem seem less scary and that's one thing that's kind of the core principle underlying computer science and the that's that approach I wish I learned that sooner okay so um someone just wrote in and that's what influenced your major decision in college um so I I wasn't sure what I wanted to major in but I took a computer science class my freshman year and I just really really liked it I liked the the whole what I just talked about about decomposing problems into smaller pieces and then I loved that the output of my homework was basically a real product that someone else could play with like sometimes this little game or a little email client but just the idea that you could learn a skill that would enable you to build anything like that that was so cool to me and I just really enjoyed it so I thought that's why I was just cuz I took that first class great well thank you so much Jess for joining us today we appreciate you think I'm answering questions and sharing more with us yeah sorry more students to try computer science thank you so much for your time well thank you for having me guys my technology and thank you so much students for joining us today we hope you have a great time sharing this video chat so round of applause everyone
