00:17 - is pan and i am a software engineer at
00:19 - xbox my name is porva i am a lead
00:22 - product manager at uber when i think
00:24 - about a user story is pretty much the
00:26 - scenario you're trying to solve every
00:27 - time you start a new product is what are
00:29 - your scenarios that's the way i think
00:30 - about the users so think of it as almost
00:32 - like storyboarding what are we using
00:34 - this product for we're creating this
00:35 - feature this is when you start doing all
00:37 - the brainstorming and posting the user
00:38 - describing how it is they use an app or
00:41 - a product my user needs x what are the
00:44 - things that i need to do for each of the
00:45 - stories on code and hardware and
00:46 - experiences to be able to make that
00:48 - happen your user base isn't
00:50 - you right it's all of us they provide
00:53 - the feedback you need to be able to
00:54 - build the experiences what is the story
00:57 - of the user when they go in what do they
00:58 - do first do they click this button first
01:00 - do they walk forward first how do they
01:02 - do these things so you need that
01:03 - feedback in order to design what the
01:05 - experience is going to look like we
01:06 - always listen to our customers what do
01:07 - they want next right and you start all
01:09 - the way from like okay i need to enable
01:10 - the hardware to talking to creators when
01:12 - we write a new feature we want to be
01:14 - sure that they're going to like it that
01:17 - they're going to use it that it will
01:19 - bring value to our platform user
01:21 - scenarios are one of those things that
01:22 - you have you know program managers you
01:24 - have software engineers you have
01:25 - designers you have user experience
01:27 - experts
01:28 - so it's it's a process to make that user
01:30 - scenario just light up just perfectly
01:33 - user interviews are direct interviews
01:35 - where the user is telling you how they
01:36 - use your product so you need to be
01:38 - optimizing for the people that are
01:39 - learning from that experience you always
01:41 - start with how can we make our users
01:43 - happy what are the things that they need
01:44 - and that's where the creative process
01:45 - really starts you start developing
01:47 - scenarios out of that you can actually
01:49 - learn from customers quite a bit and so
01:50 - we get a lot of data continuously and
01:52 - you learn from it so it's like this
01:53 - really dynamic loop of just learning and
01:56 - trying it's important to get ideas from
01:58 - a diverse set of people so i think
02:00 - that's very key to making a successful
02:02 - product it's definitely exciting to
02:04 - finally push a product it takes us
02:06 - months so when we finally push it out we
02:08 - are so excited it's been a long time
02:10 - coming it looks simple
02:12 - but getting to that simplicity is
02:14 - because you are actually doing a lot of
02:15 - this scenario based pieces of coding
02:18 - behind a user story i'm excited about
02:20 - delivering our customers something
02:22 - really cool seeing other people use your
02:24 - product is really really amazing
