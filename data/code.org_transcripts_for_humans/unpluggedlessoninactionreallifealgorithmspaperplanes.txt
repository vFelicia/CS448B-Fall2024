With timestamps:

00:11 - okay so um one of the vocabulary words
00:14 - that we learned last time
00:16 - was algorithm
00:18 - will you guys say that with me again
00:22 - and what does it mean who remembers
00:25 - from so long ago
00:27 - andy what does algorithm mean a list of
00:29 - steps that you can follow to finish the
00:31 - task okay the list of steps right
00:34 - i bet that you follow algorithms every
00:38 - single day and you don't even realize it
00:41 - is there an algorithm in this classroom
00:44 - that anyone sees
00:47 - a list of steps
00:49 - that you follow
00:51 - to get something done
00:54 - jack schedule
00:56 - the schedule
00:57 - right that's a list of things that you
00:58 - need to do all together at a certain
01:00 - time for this example
01:03 - is there anything else what do you think
01:05 - anya
01:08 - oh i wrote a step a list of steps for
01:10 - math
01:11 - that's an algorithm that you follow to
01:13 - get something done right
01:15 - i didn't i didn't i didn't even know
01:16 - that it's so awesome okay so i want you
01:19 - to think of a specific
01:22 - situation
01:23 - where you have to follow a list of steps
01:27 - to get something done
01:29 - so
01:30 - i'll plant the seed in your brain
01:32 - think about what does it take for you
01:35 - to get to school in the morning
01:37 - there's a whole series of events that
01:39 - happens
01:40 - right
01:41 - so if you were explaining your life to
01:43 - someone that didn't know you
01:45 - and you said well in the morning i go to
01:48 - school
01:49 - the person that didn't know you might be
01:50 - like well
01:52 - do you live at school
01:53 - do you eat at school do you take a
01:56 - shower or a bath and then get dressed at
01:58 - school or is school at your house like
02:00 - you you just go to school
02:02 - that's it
02:04 - aren't there a whole lot of steps in
02:05 - between
02:06 - yeah so who can
02:08 - start me off with a list let's do this
02:10 - together as a class
02:12 - let's make a list of steps we have to do
02:14 - to get to school in the morning arjun
02:16 - will you start us what's going to be
02:18 - step number one well maybe wake up and
02:20 - get out of bed
02:22 - okay let's title this getting to
02:25 - school
02:27 - getting out of bed
02:30 - okay so number one's gonna say get out
02:32 - of bed
02:37 - do you guys all agree with that you have
02:38 - to go from your horizontal position to
02:41 - vertical to get out of bed okay
02:43 - what's next ariane what's next
02:47 - and we can gen relax go to the bathroom
02:49 - a lot of people do that go to the
02:50 - bathroom or take a shower
03:02 - okay so there's our algorithm there's
03:04 - our list for getting
03:07 - from the morning time to getting to
03:10 - school there's all these steps did you
03:12 - realize
03:13 - that you were doing 11 steps before you
03:15 - got to
03:16 - school anyway some of you did yeah and
03:19 - if you break it down even further
03:21 - there's a million steps right so
03:24 - sometimes it's nice to generalize
03:26 - like with
03:28 - getting your supplies you don't have to
03:29 - list every single supply
03:31 - you understand that that's general term
03:34 - for what you're doing
03:35 - okay
03:36 - so what i want us to practice today
03:39 - is thinking about more steps and
03:41 - specifically
03:43 - i want you to think about the steps that
03:46 - you need to follow
03:48 - to make
03:49 - paper airplanes
03:52 - paper airplanes
03:54 - the steps that you need to make paper
03:57 - airplanes
03:58 - some of you are saying but i don't know
03:59 - how to make paper airplanes well that's
04:00 - perfect because we're going to learn how
04:02 - to make paper airplanes
04:04 - so i have a couple of things to hand out
04:07 - to you
04:08 - and in the first sheet
04:13 - you are deciding
04:15 - you're deciding
04:17 - the steps that you follow to make a
04:20 - paper airplane
04:22 - so you're gluing the six correct steps
04:27 - how many choices are there does anyone
04:29 - know can you do quick math how many
04:31 - choices are there on the paper scion
04:33 - nine there's nine choices
04:36 - and there's six correct steps
04:38 - so will there be x will there be
04:40 - leftovers yes okay so six steps
04:45 - right that's one one part
04:47 - and what are we doing with those steps
04:49 - are we putting them health or skelter
04:51 - we're putting them in order okay so in
04:53 - order
04:57 - and then what's next
05:00 - trade
05:03 - okay so we'll trade after that
05:10 - trade your finished algorithm
05:13 - with another person or group and let
05:15 - them use it to make an actual flying
05:18 - paper airplane
05:20 - dramatic gasp
05:23 - paper airplanes
05:24 - okay so you'll trade it and then your
05:26 - partner will make an actual
05:29 - airplane
05:33 - i would love to make an airplane
05:35 - okay so does this help you to review our
05:38 - steps
05:39 - right these are the important bits if
05:40 - this was model drawing math this would
05:42 - be our important important bits
05:45 - yeah so let's do this
05:52 - so for this activity it takes a long
05:54 - time for the kids to cut out the steps
05:56 - themselves so if you want to do this
05:58 - quicker it'd be worth cutting out the
06:00 - steps and giving each kid an envelope
06:02 - with the steps cut out that takes that
06:04 - difficulty out of it and you can get
06:06 - through the lesson a little quicker
06:13 - something else you could use instead of
06:15 - folding paper airplanes for this
06:17 - activity is
06:18 - planting a seed following steps to plant
06:20 - a seed or anything origami that is
06:23 - folding paper is easy to get
06:38 - if you could add anything
06:41 - to the list of instructions that we had
06:43 - what would you have added
06:46 - arjun what do you think i would add
06:48 - decorate
06:50 - because i mean might look better with
06:51 - this stuff
06:52 - okay so we could add decorate on
06:55 - that'd be a good one to add i can write
06:57 - that in
06:58 - a different color
06:59 - these are things that we could add to
07:01 - this to this list
07:06 - decorate what else would you add or
07:08 - change i heard some kids saying that it
07:10 - was difficult
07:12 - to make the paper airplane out of the
07:14 - same paper that had the instructions on
07:15 - it yeah would you change that
07:18 - would in your instructions would you say
07:21 - get another piece of paper to make the
07:23 - paper airplane yeah
07:26 - it is wasting trees you'd have to decide
07:28 - what's important
07:29 - so could i write get another piece of
07:31 - paper question mark yes okay
07:39 - okay those are some great ideas

okay so um one of the vocabulary words that we learned last time was algorithm will you guys say that with me again and what does it mean who remembers from so long ago andy what does algorithm mean a list of steps that you can follow to finish the task okay the list of steps right i bet that you follow algorithms every single day and you don't even realize it is there an algorithm in this classroom that anyone sees a list of steps that you follow to get something done jack schedule the schedule right that's a list of things that you need to do all together at a certain time for this example is there anything else what do you think anya oh i wrote a step a list of steps for math that's an algorithm that you follow to get something done right i didn't i didn't i didn't even know that it's so awesome okay so i want you to think of a specific situation where you have to follow a list of steps to get something done so i'll plant the seed in your brain think about what does it take for you to get to school in the morning there's a whole series of events that happens right so if you were explaining your life to someone that didn't know you and you said well in the morning i go to school the person that didn't know you might be like well do you live at school do you eat at school do you take a shower or a bath and then get dressed at school or is school at your house like you you just go to school that's it aren't there a whole lot of steps in between yeah so who can start me off with a list let's do this together as a class let's make a list of steps we have to do to get to school in the morning arjun will you start us what's going to be step number one well maybe wake up and get out of bed okay let's title this getting to school getting out of bed okay so number
