00:10 - 90 thousand bucks a year, ok? Two-year degree. 
Imagine if we could train 200,000 programmers,  
00:18 - who qualify for these jobs. the average 
salary is 87,000 almost 90,000
00:27 - bucks year. So here's what this outfit, this 
high-tech small firm has done. Code.org is  
00:33 - helping K - 12 schools teach coding. 
Code.org provides training and funding. 
00:42 - The provide the funding to help schools create and expand computer science curriculum. 
00:48 - Last year 15,000 classrooms in America began teaching Code.org's K through 8 curriculum. They're also  
00:56 - encouraging all of you in your States - and some have already done it - to allow your schools,  
01:00 - and talk to the local school districts to allow to count coding classes as part of high school math  
01:12 - and science requirements. You realize less than one percent of the high schools do that now? and  
01:20 - here we have this gigantic need. For example in the past year they successfully lobbied Oklahoma,  
01:25 - Illinois or you lobbied them i don't know how it 
went, Arizona, New York, California, Idaho all of  
01:32 - whom have recently added computer science as a 
core subject, receiving state funding. 
01:40 - They're making coding feel accessible, the third thing 
to do. For example this year Code.org encouraged  
01:47 - Americans to code for just one hour on their 
website. 30 million Americans participated. 
01:57 - 30 million. Heck of an initiative! All you know 
what I know: Americans want to work. 
02:07 - They're willing to work. They're willing to be retrained, 
if they think there's any possibility of after the
