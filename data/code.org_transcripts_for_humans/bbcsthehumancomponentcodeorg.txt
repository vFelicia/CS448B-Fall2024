00:04 - coding is very special to me you got to
00:06 - find a way to look at code you have and
00:08 - fix it so Concepts like not giving up
00:12 - critical thinking being creative their
00:14 - minds can kind of be let free to imagine
00:17 - the unimaginable the partnership with
00:19 - code.org was founded on my own passion
00:22 - and interest in coding and then I knew I
00:24 - could apply it to my elementary students
00:26 - who struggled historically in math
00:40 - [Music]
00:45 - I was a senior in high school and my son
00:48 - was born I was a teen dad at 17 I used
00:52 - my position as motivation to go out and
00:55 - get a degree not for myself but for my
00:58 - son I ended up majoring in secondary
01:01 - education with an emphasis in business
01:03 - education at first it was just a job pay
01:06 - the bills I was making good money but
01:09 - kept on thinking about my community back
01:12 - home here and other tribal communities
01:14 - any questions before we get
01:16 - going in the group rather than the
01:18 - individual so me returning back to the
01:21 - community I was raised in is just part
01:23 - of the circle that we talk about always
01:25 - returning
01:27 - to state of Nevada has very low math
01:30 - test scores I knew that we needed to
01:33 - address math either curriculum at the
01:36 - time couldn't be addressed so what I had
01:38 - to do then was kind of step back and say
01:40 - how else can I introduce math concepts
01:42 - and make it fun and engaging I
01:45 - understood that coding and computer
01:48 - science have a correlation and
01:50 - connection to math concepts that's where
01:52 - code.org came in
01:54 - [Music]
02:01 - the goal of code.org is that every
02:03 - student in every school should have the
02:06 - opportunity to learn computer science as
02:08 - part of a basic education and so what
02:10 - our team spends time doing is creating
02:12 - fantastic online courses and training
02:15 - existing teachers in how to begin
02:18 - teaching those courses in their schools
02:20 - we started this campaign called the hour
02:21 - of code the suggestion that you should
02:23 - learn coding for just 1 hour in a
02:24 - classroom and our learning platform now
02:26 - has over 80 million students on it to me
02:29 - coding at heart is about creativity it's
02:31 - about imagining something and then using
02:34 - the language of code to bring your
02:36 - imagination to life I saw how students
02:38 - were engaged and Hands-On from literally
02:41 - day one the best reaction ever is this
02:44 - is easy technically it's not easy but
02:47 - they're making it easy with the rise of
02:49 - artificial intelligence it's more
02:50 - important than ever to teach computer
02:52 - science in schools because AI is going
02:54 - to change everything about our lives
02:56 - everybody should learn this as part of
02:58 - their school education the work of
03:00 - code.org as a nonprofit is only possible
03:02 - thanks to the generosity of
03:03 - philanthropic donations from companies
03:06 - such as Cisco who have helped support
03:07 - our work for many
03:10 - [Music]
03:13 - years this same is going to be helping
03:15 - us all day today I work at code.org I'm
03:19 - a product manager for the K through five
03:22 - curriculum my favorite part of my job is
03:25 - when I get to actually come into
03:26 - classrooms and watch what we create in
03:29 - action
03:30 - I developed the star quilt module with a
03:32 - teacher who works on a reservation in
03:34 - Montana and he had showed me the Star
03:36 - Quilts and I was just blown away by how
03:38 - beautiful they were I also saw that it
03:40 - was a really great way to teach students
03:42 - about pattern recognition which is part
03:44 - of the math standards when you look at
03:46 - this star quilt obviously it represents
03:48 - Star right and that star is actually
03:50 - called The Morning Star the most
03:52 - powerful stars in the sky even powerful
03:54 - than the moon more powerful than the sun
03:56 - it represents that crossing over between
04:00 - life and death I saw the Star Quilts
04:03 - draped along the tables and the students
04:05 - had their digital versions of the star
04:07 - quotes on their computers how deep this
04:10 - module actually is um in real life and
04:12 - experiencing the beauty of the actual
04:15 - star quilt alongside the digital version
04:18 - it blew me away I think that sorry I'm
04:22 - going to cry
04:28 - um students I would like you guys to
04:31 - present this um this gift this
04:33 - appreciation of thanks to Amy for um
04:36 - visiting with us uring the work TI is
04:39 - doing with code.org
04:46 - this was a treat I couldn't imagine a
04:49 - cooler way for this thing to come to
04:52 - life that the old and the new come
04:54 - together in a brand new way is
04:57 - absolutely mindblowing it is beautiful
05:00 - it's incredible it's truly a privilege
05:02 - and an incredible feeling to think about
05:04 - the number of children whose lives will
05:06 - be changed thanks to code.org and the
05:08 - work that we've done with all the
05:09 - problems in our world technology is one
05:11 - of the keys to improving the things that
05:13 - we need to solve and teaching students
05:15 - how to create that technology is
05:17 - critical to the lives they want to
05:18 - create for the future coding to me is
05:22 - very very important for any student who
05:24 - wants to continue to pursue some kind of
05:26 - computer science related field so I
05:28 - think it's uh incredible what c.org is
05:30 - doing
05:35 - [Music]
