00:07 - this is a conditional block
00:10 - the code inside a conditional block runs
00:13 - if a condition is true
00:16 - in puzzles with conditionals we might
00:18 - want to check a condition like if path
00:20 - ahead
00:22 - this code will only move forward if
00:24 - there is a path ahead
00:26 - you can use conditionals in lots of
00:28 - different ways like this
00:31 - or this
00:34 - what if you want something else to
00:35 - happen if a condition is false
00:39 - you can use an if-else block for that
00:42 - this code will move forward
00:44 - if there is a path ahead
00:46 - otherwise it will turn left
00:48 - your code will either move forward or
00:51 - turn left but never both
00:53 - this is helpful if you want your code to
00:55 - make decisions based on certain
00:57 - conditions
00:58 - here are some more ways you can use
01:00 - conditionals in if-else blocks
01:04 - if you want to add more conditions to
01:06 - your block you can do that with a block
01:08 - that looks like this
01:10 - this block will check two conditions
01:12 - with this code if the score is equal to
01:15 - 5 the actor will say you have 5 points
01:18 - otherwise if the score is equal to 10
01:21 - the actor will say you have 10 points
01:24 - otherwise the actor will say get more
01:26 - points
01:27 - remember only one set of instructions
01:30 - will run
01:31 - if you're ready let's give it a try
01:40 - you

Cleaned transcript:

this is a conditional block the code inside a conditional block runs if a condition is true in puzzles with conditionals we might want to check a condition like if path ahead this code will only move forward if there is a path ahead you can use conditionals in lots of different ways like this or this what if you want something else to happen if a condition is false you can use an ifelse block for that this code will move forward if there is a path ahead otherwise it will turn left your code will either move forward or turn left but never both this is helpful if you want your code to make decisions based on certain conditions here are some more ways you can use conditionals in ifelse blocks if you want to add more conditions to your block you can do that with a block that looks like this this block will check two conditions with this code if the score is equal to 5 the actor will say you have 5 points otherwise if the score is equal to 10 the actor will say you have 10 points otherwise the actor will say get more points remember only one set of instructions will run if you're ready let's give it a try you
