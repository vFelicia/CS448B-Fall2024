00:10 - in the theater we can manipulate images
00:13 - to create image filters like the ones we
00:15 - see on many social media and photo
00:17 - editing apps
00:18 - these image filters are created by
00:20 - changing the image's pixel colors
00:23 - in the theater we have an image class
00:26 - that represents an image
00:28 - when we look at the image class we see
00:30 - that one of its instance variables is a
00:32 - 2d array of pixel objects
00:35 - a pixel is the smallest unit of a
00:37 - digital image
00:39 - an image consists of rolls and columns
00:41 - of pixels
00:43 - each pixel has a color value that is
00:46 - determined by a mix of red green and
00:48 - blue color values or rgb
00:53 - the pixel class represents a single
00:55 - pixel in an image it has instant
00:58 - variables for these red green and blue
01:00 - color values
01:02 - when we want to get a single pixel
01:04 - object from an image we can use the get
01:06 - pixel method
01:09 - we specify the x and y location of the
01:11 - pixel we want for the arguments we can
01:14 - also change a single pixel object using
01:16 - the setpixel method
01:19 - we can specify the x and y location of
01:22 - the pixel and the color we want to
01:24 - change it to the values for each color
01:26 - range from 0 to 255
01:30 - 0 would be very dark and 255 would be
01:33 - very bright
01:34 - an image file whether it's a jpeg gif or
01:38 - png contains lots of these rgb
01:41 - red green blue triplets
01:44 - to access color values in the pixel
01:46 - class we can use the get red
01:50 - get green
01:51 - or get blue methods to get these values
01:54 - for a specific pixel
01:56 - we can also use set red
01:59 - set green
02:00 - or set blue to change these values for a
02:02 - pixel
02:04 - if we set each of these values to 0 for
02:06 - all the pixels in this image
02:09 - our entire image would be filled with
02:11 - black pixels
02:13 - if we were to increase each of these
02:15 - values by a specific amount for all
02:18 - pixels in this image
02:20 - it would make our image even brighter
02:23 - what happens when we max out one of the
02:25 - colors
02:26 - let's push up the red values
02:29 - our entire image now has a red tint
02:32 - by using different combinations of red
02:35 - green and blue color values we can
02:37 - create a variety of interesting image
02:40 - filters
02:41 - with image and pixel classes we can
02:43 - create our own image filters like what
02:45 - we see on social media and photo editing
02:48 - apps we can combine these filters with
02:50 - the other capabilities of the theater to
02:53 - make creative animation and visuals

Cleaned transcript:

in the theater we can manipulate images to create image filters like the ones we see on many social media and photo editing apps these image filters are created by changing the image's pixel colors in the theater we have an image class that represents an image when we look at the image class we see that one of its instance variables is a 2d array of pixel objects a pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image an image consists of rolls and columns of pixels each pixel has a color value that is determined by a mix of red green and blue color values or rgb the pixel class represents a single pixel in an image it has instant variables for these red green and blue color values when we want to get a single pixel object from an image we can use the get pixel method we specify the x and y location of the pixel we want for the arguments we can also change a single pixel object using the setpixel method we can specify the x and y location of the pixel and the color we want to change it to the values for each color range from 0 to 255 0 would be very dark and 255 would be very bright an image file whether it's a jpeg gif or png contains lots of these rgb red green blue triplets to access color values in the pixel class we can use the get red get green or get blue methods to get these values for a specific pixel we can also use set red set green or set blue to change these values for a pixel if we set each of these values to 0 for all the pixels in this image our entire image would be filled with black pixels if we were to increase each of these values by a specific amount for all pixels in this image it would make our image even brighter what happens when we max out one of the colors let's push up the red values our entire image now has a red tint by using different combinations of red green and blue color values we can create a variety of interesting image filters with image and pixel classes we can create our own image filters like what we see on social media and photo editing apps we can combine these filters with the other capabilities of the theater to make creative animation and visuals you
