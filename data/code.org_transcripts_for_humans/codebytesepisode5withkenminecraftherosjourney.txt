00:21 - hi everybody uh welcome to code bytes um
00:24 - we're really excited to have you all for
00:26 - the last episode of our week our
00:28 - computer science education week um today
00:32 - we're going to be we're working with
00:33 - minecraft to learn some more about
00:35 - coding we're really excited to do that
00:37 - just want to introduce ourselves first
00:39 - and kind of see who all is here so first
00:41 - of all i'm ken you can see our names
00:43 - above our heads i'm a curriculum
00:45 - developer
00:47 - code.org and this is owen and this is
00:50 - oliver
00:51 - and just let's hear a little bit quick
00:54 - from you guys um
00:55 - owen how old are you and what grade are
00:57 - you in i'm in first grade and i'm seven
01:00 - years old awesome and oliver i'm in
01:03 - third grade
01:04 - and i'm i'm in i am eight years old but
01:07 - i'm almost nine awesome and what school
01:10 - do you guys go to glenwood
01:12 - gatosk great and we're joining you guys
01:14 - from you all from
01:16 - lake stevens washington just north a
01:19 - little bit north of seattle so we're
01:21 - really excited to be with you these two
01:23 - are big fans of minecraft so they're
01:25 - going to be a big help in helping us all
01:27 - learn today
01:28 - we're
01:29 - [Music]
01:30 - yeah we're really excited to be joined
01:32 - by all of you um this hour of code
01:35 - movement has
01:37 - just recently passed you know one
01:39 - billion hours of code completed um so
01:43 - there's
01:44 - you know lots of people joining as we
01:46 - speak
01:47 - and people across the world in every
01:49 - single country and every single city
01:50 - have been doing hours of code so if
01:52 - you're joining um
01:54 - it's great to have you and so we can see
01:56 - here on the screen where we have people
01:57 - joining with us right now um looks like
02:00 - we have most people joining from the
02:02 - united states we have a few people
02:04 - internationally looks like someone from
02:06 - india maybe someone from venezuela
02:08 - um we're up in like i said in washington
02:10 - we can see quite a few people up there
02:12 - and there's some people looks like from
02:13 - california that's where i'm originally
02:14 - from so welcome to all of you i'm really
02:17 - excited to have you here um and and to
02:20 - get uh
02:21 - to to get going so
02:23 - um we're gonna do three main things
02:25 - today um yes the first thing is that
02:28 - we're gonna learn to code using
02:29 - minecraft and we're gonna solve some
02:31 - puzzles and so the first first part of
02:33 - that is we're gonna solve some puzzles
02:35 - involving um yes a character called the
02:37 - agent and used to explain that a little
02:40 - bit we're going to use loops to help um
02:42 - clear a path using some pressure plates
02:45 - to help us gather items
02:47 - and then the last thing that we'll do to
02:49 - help us get through doors awesome and
02:51 - then the last thing that we'll do
02:54 - is uh look at minecraft education
02:57 - edition which is basically like the real
02:59 - minecraft game but with a few different
03:00 - editions so
03:01 - if you would like to follow along with
03:03 - us at home as we go through we're going
03:05 - to start sharing our screen just a
03:06 - second but if you want to follow along
03:08 - you can go to this address right here
03:10 - it's code.org minecraft and we're going
03:13 - to be working on the hero's journey
03:15 - activity as we go through so if you'd
03:17 - like to join along go ahead or if you
03:19 - can just follow what's going on on the
03:20 - screen that is totally fine
03:22 - so we're gonna start sharing our screen
03:24 - here so we can you can see what we're
03:26 - working on and as we walk you through
03:28 - this and we're actually gonna need your
03:29 - all help right off the start
03:32 - so
03:33 - let me just share to make sure that
03:35 - that's all set so you should all be able
03:37 - to see my screen now and the first thing
03:39 - that we need to do in uh starting our
03:41 - heroes journey
03:43 - is to choose our character so we need to
03:44 - hear from all of you which character
03:47 - should we play as steve or alex so go
03:49 - ahead and type in your vote
03:51 - take another three seconds to type it in
03:53 - three
03:54 - two
03:56 - one and we'll close the poll
03:58 - so owen who is the winner steve okay so
04:01 - we'll pick steve steve again
04:04 - okay
04:06 - so one second over here let me just get
04:08 - that
04:09 - great yeah there you go awesome so you
04:11 - guys before we get going here's our
04:13 - first level so we've picked steve as our
04:14 - character just want to orient you to
04:16 - what we're seeing on our screen here on
04:18 - the left hand side you can see the
04:22 - kind of the gameplay space so this is
04:23 - where you see that our character steve
04:25 - you see the agent and when we start
04:27 - running the code you'll be able to move
04:28 - around so actually oliver can you hit
04:30 - run now
04:31 - and then
04:32 - see
04:33 - where we go
04:34 - we don't get anything i can't break this
04:36 - with my fists i can't just walk through
04:38 - here like i'm a ghost um
04:44 - that's a challenge i can't break
04:46 - anything so i can't
04:47 - and agent did do anything great so how
04:51 - to code him to do something exactly so
04:53 - let's hit reset thanks oliver that's
04:54 - great
04:55 - and then
04:56 - like oliver just said right we need to
04:59 - we need to code the agent to help us out
05:00 - because right now we can't get to the
05:02 - object that we're trying to get to in
05:03 - this level we're trying to get to a
05:05 - chest and it's down in the right hand
05:06 - corner so
05:08 - we're stuck in
05:14 - we've all been stuck in our houses way
05:15 - too much over the last over this
05:17 - pandemic so we need to get out of the
05:19 - house um
05:21 - the middle part right here you can see
05:22 - where there's some blocks you can choose
05:24 - from that's where all the code blocks
05:27 - are here and so far we only have one
05:30 - block
05:31 - and here's the walk space but we cannot
05:33 - drag this block um the orange block yeah
05:36 - when one we cannot drag it around but we
05:38 - can drag around the blue block yeah we
05:41 - can drag around these this great point
05:43 - so there's some blocks that we can drag
05:45 - and there's some that we can't the ones
05:46 - in under where it says blocks in our
05:48 - toolbox those are the ones that we can
05:49 - drag out into our workspace so let's try
05:51 - this oliver let's try to help the agent
05:53 - um step on that pressure plate so we can
05:55 - get to the chest do you think it would
05:57 - help if we did it twice
05:59 - let's try that
06:00 - yeah
06:03 - this one
06:04 - oh then they just trapped me in again so
06:07 - what did you notice last time so that he
06:10 - went right he just walked on the
06:11 - pressure plate and went off the pressure
06:13 - plate like if i was just able to hurry
06:15 - fast enough i would have been able to
06:16 - get out
06:17 - well let's make it so that we can get
06:19 - out no matter what what do you guys
06:20 - think like i can just wait there for
06:22 - hours so i see that he wouldn't
06:25 - so
06:26 - two he'd move on to this right here and
06:28 - that's two spaces so maybe if you take
06:31 - away one
06:33 - then it look yeah
06:36 - now i can go get the chest great so
06:39 - we're off and running we've got we got
06:41 - the agent on the pressure plate that
06:42 - allowed steve to get the chances to move
06:44 - forwards a lot and some levels we might
06:47 - need to use the
06:49 - like what are these other commands that
06:51 - you see now so now we have sunglasses
06:54 - we have a repeat block we have we have a
06:56 - tone right block and all the time
06:59 - and then what we have
07:00 - click the two and see what happens and
07:02 - we
07:03 - click and we know that you get click it
07:05 - if you see an arrow right here then that
07:08 - means if you click it you have multiple
07:10 - options like you can make it
07:12 - do it three times two times what do you
07:14 - think i think we should do two two
07:17 - hold on guys just one second so that ex
07:19 - i'm glad you guys brought that up but
07:20 - that's an example of what in computer
07:23 - science we call a loop so it's called a
07:24 - repeat block here but it's called the
07:26 - loop computers are really good at doing
07:28 - the same thing over and over and over
07:29 - again
07:31 - without getting bored right they didn't
07:32 - get bored they could just get bored from
07:33 - doing it things over and over again and
07:36 - in the earlier minecraft they had to
07:37 - usually
07:39 - a repeat loop to be able to keep
07:41 - chickens moving around the whole world
07:43 - right so they can do that without
07:44 - getting bored so we can we can utilize
07:47 - that power when we write our code but in
07:49 - this time in this case for the agent all
07:50 - right so we can't get to what we need to
07:52 - get without the agent so we need to hit
07:54 - reset and do some coding so let's get
07:55 - started on that oliver
07:59 - i make my buttons so let's say reset he
08:02 - said he said okay and then how we're
08:04 - gonna code the agent to help us get the
08:06 - map so we want to move him right here
08:09 - but like what we saw on the last level
08:10 - when we wanted him to get onto a
08:12 - pressure plate right in front of him we
08:14 - did move forward two times
08:17 - into this kind of area so maybe we
08:19 - should
08:20 - go for two times in this level
08:23 - and it will
08:24 - get us to the pressure plate and then i
08:27 - just want to share the street for no
08:28 - reason i don't know why
08:30 - i
08:31 - just wanted to gather that a little
08:32 - extra on our way into it yeah i wonder
08:34 - if i can
08:35 - yeah anything work so in that case right
08:38 - oliver you brought up that we could have
08:40 - done two move forward blocks kind of
08:42 - like we showed the beginning of the
08:43 - first level but in this case we use the
08:44 - repeat block to make it a little bit
08:46 - easier okay so now
08:48 - same thing here we've got a pressure
08:50 - plates that we need to get to a compass
09:03 - let's do let's get to the pressure put
09:05 - to the compass first and then you can
09:06 - show us your strategy okay so what do
09:08 - you notice that's different about the
09:09 - repeat block this time
09:11 - it
09:12 - is
09:13 - it's on the number four
09:15 - okay so maybe that is our answer we just
09:18 - don't know it let's see maybe let's try
09:21 - and see if we don't have to cheat
09:24 - okay so i can show you my strategy what
09:26 - i'll do i could instead of
09:29 - like having to discount how many i'm
09:31 - putting there i'll just go like this
09:33 - with my character one two three four and
09:36 - then i'll figure out that's four ah if
09:38 - we press one before we put anything
09:39 - we've figured out that that's thing oh
09:42 - really nice strategy owen so you can use
09:44 - your character to help you with the code
09:45 - because you can do a little
09:46 - investigating beforehand that's a great
09:48 - great point hopefully that's helpful to
09:50 - all of you watching should we go get the
09:51 - compass hmm i i see a diamond right here
09:55 - i wonder what happens if you collect are
09:57 - diamonds good in minecraft yes yeah they
09:59 - are good you can make yeah they're all
10:00 - kind of awesome
10:05 - we should probably try to get that then
10:07 - yeah we should probably try and get it
10:08 - so
10:09 - that what that means actually but this
10:11 - pressure plate you we should do is
10:13 - redstone go so maybe on you should maybe
10:16 - follow that led stone yeah so let's see
10:18 - the redstone path okay
10:20 - so now you can see when he is behind the
10:22 - tree oh it's also going under this block
10:25 - it's going here too okay so we need to
10:27 - get to that other pressure plate is that
10:29 - right yes i can't just stand here and
10:31 - then he goes okay he can't collect so we
10:34 - need some help from you all at home
10:36 - right we've written some code where we
10:38 - could get to the compass but we need to
10:40 - get um over to the other pressure points
10:43 - so here
10:44 - on our screen you can see four different
10:46 - options um you can see them on your poll
10:48 - too what should we write as our next bit
10:50 - of code after our first bit that we
10:52 - already have written to help us get over
10:54 - to the diamond uh to the pressure plate
10:56 - that will help us get the diamond all
10:58 - right so if you're voted uh this one
11:00 - takes a little bit more time so we'll
11:01 - give you kind of five more seconds
11:04 - you've got turn right and then move turn
11:07 - left and then move move and then turn
11:09 - left move and then turn right
11:11 - okay
11:13 - hmm okay so it looks like we've got a
11:15 - winner and the winner there's there's
11:17 - two close two very close winners so well
11:20 - maybe we'll try the real winner and then
11:22 - if we can see this happens in second
11:24 - place so the winner was turn right then
11:28 - move forward four times so let's go back
11:30 - to the code oliver
11:34 - yep
11:37 - and you can hear what one second we just
11:38 - closed i think we should close that so
11:40 - it says so we want to do turn right
11:43 - on the right
11:45 - and then move forward four times
11:49 - that's okay you just change that around
11:52 - so that was the winning vote so let's
11:54 - see what
11:54 - happens uh-huh we should probably see
11:58 - okay turn right it was like hmm so where
12:02 - did the where did the agent end up over
12:04 - here instead of over here huh needs to
12:06 - go got it so i noticed that the second
12:08 - so that's totally fine as we tried
12:10 - something right and we figured out if it
12:11 - worked just like we did in the first
12:12 - level so this is what's called debugging
12:14 - right we're gonna figure out a bug in
12:16 - our code what do you the second place
12:18 - option was to change it from turn right
12:21 - to turn
12:22 - left so let's try that
12:25 - i don't even need to pull one over here
12:27 - i can just change that
12:29 - let's try
12:30 - [Music]
12:32 - oh
12:34 - oh
12:35 - yes
12:36 - now we get the diamond plus we get to
12:39 - get the compass
12:40 - and then if you get this thing then you
12:44 - complete the level that's how it wait
12:45 - let's see what it says here
12:47 - congratulations you found the diamond
12:49 - path awesome
13:02 - once we get to the end then we can go
13:05 - all the way back and fix all the
13:06 - mess-ups to try and get all the diamonds
13:08 - and all the blows so you're saying if we
13:10 - went back if we had gone past this one
13:12 - we could have come back and come back to
13:14 - the diamond later if we felt like we
13:15 - wanted more of a challenge if we go back
13:17 - to one
13:22 - [Music]
13:25 - so let's let people at home do that if
13:26 - they want but we'll keep going on to
13:28 - number four five and six
13:29 - then we've seen the diamond on number
13:32 - three okay so now the diamonds out there
13:34 - so it's going to be hard to resist
13:36 - sometimes yeah sometimes it would like
13:38 - it would pop up
13:40 - character cannot walk over cannot
13:44 - go cannot swim but the agent can hover
13:47 - over okay so the agent has some
13:49 - abilities that we that we as the
13:51 - character don't have right
13:53 - um
13:54 - so
13:55 - great that's good to know so let's do
13:58 - one of these um
14:01 - and what do we need to do we need to get
14:02 - to that
14:03 - uh bucket
14:04 - let's try and bucket this pressure plate
14:07 - okay so we need to get all the way out
14:08 - there i kind of want to get the down
14:10 - again hmm
14:11 - all right so let's see if we can get to
14:12 - let's see first to get that one thing
14:20 - how much blocks were in front of the
14:22 - agent it was seven if you come to the
14:24 - pressure place so i put a repeat loop
14:26 - that's seven
14:28 - times that would repeat it seven times
14:30 - great so now i just need to find out
14:32 - what block is it so
14:34 - my strategy does not work on water you
14:37 - cannot like count with the camera but
14:39 - you can if you press
14:40 - this button
14:48 - we can do the strategy that you said if
14:50 - there was no water but in this case we
14:51 - kind of need to use the mouse to count
14:52 - the number of squares so let's put a
14:54 - move forward block in there and see what
14:55 - happens i cannot
15:07 - do a dance party so if you were part of
15:09 - the dance party episode earlier this
15:11 - week this might look familiar but it's
15:12 - not really going to help us
15:14 - solve our puzzle
15:16 - it's just kind of fun we're trying to
15:18 - dance right now we're trying to walk all
15:20 - right so let's try that again
15:22 - i i have something else this is
15:24 - a dance
15:28 - this is good oliver you i think you
15:30 - could you could become a choreographer
15:32 - with this with choreography uh you know
15:35 - teaching the agent all right so let's
15:36 - reset this clear this code
15:40 - and so good just to remember if you ever
15:42 - need to get rid of code you can just
15:43 - drag it like all others doing it in the
15:45 - trash
15:46 - the tone left or turn right is what we
15:49 - need and we have one more block right so
15:51 - i wonder what would happen if we put
15:52 - something like right here and it's like
15:55 - in the middle of nowhere there's no
15:57 - closure
15:58 - and what would happen like is that gonna
16:00 - work say forgot
16:01 - it starts it starts
16:05 - to have another block inside to walk
16:07 - make sure that oh it does not lock
16:09 - properly inside the container all right
16:12 - so let's just do the basic one here it
16:14 - says unused code
16:16 - thank you guys let's just do this basic
16:17 - one to get through it and then we're
16:18 - going to jump ahead to bubble stick so
16:20 - let's hit reset and run
16:22 - a7
16:27 - thank you agent needed that bucket yep
16:29 - needed that diamonds well maybe everyone
16:32 - to get home and go back and figure out
16:34 - how to get the diamond when they try it
16:35 - on their own so let's just actually jump
16:36 - ahead to number six oliver
16:38 - okay because in this case it involves
16:40 - water too we need to get across the
16:42 - water so we need to actually build a
16:43 - brick so it's kind of cool to kill to
16:46 - build glitches that's really cool i like
16:48 - it we also let's try and get the diamond
16:50 - in this level i think well so yeah let's
16:53 - go ahead just go ahead and do it over
16:54 - what do you think what we should do
16:56 - first so first we should count what's in
16:58 - front of the agent can we know how much
17:00 - times to make him move forward which is
17:02 - gonna be one two
17:05 - three
17:06 - great so let's do that after that so
17:08 - let's change this
17:10 - to a three
17:12 - what what kind of material are we gonna
17:14 - use at this time and what material are
17:16 - we gonna build it out of sand across
17:18 - planks bridge planks oak ring planks
17:22 - spruce planks great so we need a url's
17:24 - help at home what should we build our
17:26 - bridge out of
17:28 - go ahead and take five seconds to type
17:30 - in your answer i hope she and the winner
17:33 - yeah me too
17:35 - okay what was the winner
17:38 - i use that all the time in minecraft
17:40 - cool a lot and it's kind of the same
17:42 - color you can go and close that that's
17:44 - great yep
17:45 - good job all right so we'll make it out
17:46 - of oakland
17:47 - already on old planes
17:50 - but if we do this nothing's gonna happen
17:52 - yeah what is he doing what is he doing
17:54 - there must be another block we need so
17:56 - sometimes we actually have to put more
17:58 - than one block inside of a repeater we
18:00 - need a full
18:01 - move from one foot what we should do
18:04 - after the split i think we should do it
18:06 - after the build let's
18:09 - okay let's try that
18:12 - okay so please
18:13 - oh
18:14 - enough times
18:16 - i don't want to get a two blocks that's
18:18 - not gonna do all right that's not gonna
18:19 - do it let's try the other one
18:22 - like it was before before you changed it
18:24 - awesome okay so oliver i know you want
18:26 - to get the diamond but we're kind of
18:27 - running long time so we do need to move
18:29 - on so let's just go get there and then
18:30 - we're actually going to switch our
18:31 - screens here for a second so let me just
18:33 - take over for one second
18:36 - hopefully all of you at home either if
18:38 - you're following along now that's great
18:40 - and if you um want to check it out later
18:42 - we'll show you how to do that when you
18:43 - get to the end of this tutorial
18:46 - excuse me um you're going to be you're
18:49 - going to see
18:52 - that there's 12 levels and at the end of
18:53 - the level this is a free play level so
18:56 - me and oliver have done some work these
18:58 - two have made their own free play level
19:00 - but if you notice one second oliver if
19:02 - you notice in the toolbox
19:04 - right um would you show the toolbox
19:06 - they're all over just get rid of that
19:08 - repeat uh
19:11 - just get rid of that repeat um menu
19:13 - just click on the six there you go so
19:15 - you've got a lot more options here right
19:17 - you've got
19:18 - destroying blocks you've got rails um
19:33 - so great point owen says as you go
19:35 - through the rest of the levels you'll
19:36 - see that there's more blocks that get
19:38 - that you get to use and then this is the
19:39 - chance to use them all and there's also
19:41 - some functions you can do and these
19:43 - please control when you want to use the
19:45 - functions
19:46 - if you use a functional stuff so let's
19:49 - just click run and see what you guys
19:50 - have made and then everyone at home we
19:53 - hope you all again we challenge you to
19:54 - see how far you can take your own
19:56 - creativity your own imagination to make
19:59 - your own level
20:02 - i know i'm just
20:04 - writing
20:06 - so what i noticed right is that you
20:08 - actually you can go beyond what's shown
20:10 - the first time right and you can see a
20:12 - lot more
20:14 - cool so we've built some rails all the
20:16 - way to this other house and then he's
20:17 - going back because one time it messed up
20:19 - i hope that's not the house we were
20:20 - stuck in on level one
20:23 - no it's not because this has a garden i
20:25 - don't wanna get stuck in there again
20:27 - so
20:28 - oh cool we've got a rail coming across
20:30 - here
20:31 - it's gonna make a bridge right go oh no
20:34 - awesome right up there not yet so these
20:36 - two are still in process of working on
20:38 - it and they'll continue to work on it
20:39 - again we hope that everyone at home can
20:41 - do the same thing we're going to show
20:42 - you one more thing
20:44 - here so i'm just going to stop that
20:47 - we're going to show you one more thing
20:48 - which is um
20:50 - the like i said the education version of
20:52 - minecraft um and this is something that
20:55 - you can download and use without an
20:57 - account
21:00 - and uh we have to use our account
21:02 - actually tell me well enough not to do
21:04 - these activities right
21:06 - tell me a little bit about what you guys
21:08 - have noticed when you've played this
21:11 - um version
21:13 - so what have you guys noticed about this
21:16 - different kind of things that you can do
21:18 - so what do we do
21:21 - right and so tell us a little bit about
21:22 - this story that we're in so we're trying
21:25 - to make like
21:27 - the illidar town and the villager town
21:30 - being night and help each other and
21:33 - those like different quizzes and the
21:35 - more like levels you complete with code
21:38 - bigger your tree grows and so far we
21:40 - haven't done any levels
21:42 - maybe
21:53 - [Music]
21:57 - to the middle of villager town awesome
21:59 - great and so just while you guys go find
22:01 - uh somebody to talk to i'm just gonna
22:02 - explain a little bit this is called the
22:04 - tale of two cities and villages two
22:07 - villages oh you always correct me on
22:09 - that that's what it turns into tale of
22:10 - two villages and this is connects to uh
22:14 - the theme of kind of cs for good which
22:16 - is what like oliver know when we're
22:18 - saying they can help these two villagers
22:20 - have been apart for a long time and they
22:22 - are kind of afraid of each other they
22:23 - don't really know each other because
22:25 - they've just been a par for so long so
22:27 - you with code and using the agent can
22:29 - help kind of uh help the these villagers
22:32 - and these illegibles get to know each
22:33 - other and help each other so let's go
22:34 - talk to the fishermen
22:36 - okay let's oh
22:42 - hi friends fishing is something we've
22:45 - never been good at the aerodromes from
22:47 - next town over offering to help us to
22:50 - learn how but they say we need a doc
22:53 - first great
22:56 - can you help us build a dock at the edge
22:59 - of the show we just need the outline see
23:02 - if you can build it's six blocks long
23:04 - and four blocks wide great so let's
23:06 - click start activity we don't actually
23:08 - have time to do this but can i if you
23:09 - guys just show them the what it looks
23:11 - like to code the agent in uh no no what
23:14 - are we doing you're giving it to him
23:17 - all right
23:18 - can you show what it looks like to code
23:19 - the agent in this setting so let's see
23:24 - now now i have so low so what are some
23:26 - things that are similar to this what we
23:28 - just did and what are some things that
23:29 - are different that they're made of
23:31 - blocks so there's both blocks just like
23:33 - we have before it looks kind of exact
23:35 - same as mine that's the only minecraft i
23:37 - play right and it looks kind of like the
23:39 - minecraft so it's kind of a combination
23:40 - of for all of you played minecraft
23:42 - before and enjoyed it
23:43 - um right there's the there's the game
23:45 - itself but then you can also use the
23:47 - coding skills that you've practiced
23:49 - that we just practiced to help solve
23:51 - these problems so
23:54 - we're going to stop sharing right there
23:56 - okay
23:58 - the last thing i'll say is again here if
24:00 - you want to keep doing all of these
24:01 - activities go to code.org
24:04 - minecraft to check out these activities
24:06 - all the ones that you saw and more today
24:08 - how i find it is just by typing in
24:12 - minecraft coding that's how i type in to
24:14 - find it and share whatever you create
24:16 - with us using these two hashtags hour of
24:18 - code and code bytes and that's our show
24:20 - for today thank you all so much for
24:22 - tuning in we hope you had a great
24:23 - computer science education week and uh
24:26 - should we do our diamonds chat to send
24:28 - this out
24:29 - all right diamonds on three one two
24:31 - three diamonds
24:33 - bye everybody bye
24:36 - [Music]
24:53 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hi everybody uh welcome to code bytes um we're really excited to have you all for the last episode of our week our computer science education week um today we're going to be we're working with minecraft to learn some more about coding we're really excited to do that just want to introduce ourselves first and kind of see who all is here so first of all i'm ken you can see our names above our heads i'm a curriculum developer code.org and this is owen and this is oliver and just let's hear a little bit quick from you guys um owen how old are you and what grade are you in i'm in first grade and i'm seven years old awesome and oliver i'm in third grade and i'm i'm in i am eight years old but i'm almost nine awesome and what school do you guys go to glenwood gatosk great and we're joining you guys from you all from lake stevens washington just north a little bit north of seattle so we're really excited to be with you these two are big fans of minecraft so they're going to be a big help in helping us all learn today we're yeah we're really excited to be joined by all of you um this hour of code movement has just recently passed you know one billion hours of code completed um so there's you know lots of people joining as we speak and people across the world in every single country and every single city have been doing hours of code so if you're joining um it's great to have you and so we can see here on the screen where we have people joining with us right now um looks like we have most people joining from the united states we have a few people internationally looks like someone from india maybe someone from venezuela um we're up in like i said in washington we can see quite a few people up there and there's some people looks like from california that's where i'm originally from so welcome to all of you i'm really excited to have you here um and and to get uh to to get going so um we're gonna do three main things today um yes the first thing is that we're gonna learn to code using minecraft and we're gonna solve some puzzles and so the first first part of that is we're gonna solve some puzzles involving um yes a character called the agent and used to explain that a little bit we're going to use loops to help um clear a path using some pressure plates to help us gather items and then the last thing that we'll do to help us get through doors awesome and then the last thing that we'll do is uh look at minecraft education edition which is basically like the real minecraft game but with a few different editions so if you would like to follow along with us at home as we go through we're going to start sharing our screen just a second but if you want to follow along you can go to this address right here it's code.org minecraft and we're going to be working on the hero's journey activity as we go through so if you'd like to join along go ahead or if you can just follow what's going on on the screen that is totally fine so we're gonna start sharing our screen here so we can you can see what we're working on and as we walk you through this and we're actually gonna need your all help right off the start so let me just share to make sure that that's all set so you should all be able to see my screen now and the first thing that we need to do in uh starting our heroes journey is to choose our character so we need to hear from all of you which character should we play as steve or alex so go ahead and type in your vote take another three seconds to type it in three two one and we'll close the poll so owen who is the winner steve okay so we'll pick steve steve again okay so one second over here let me just get that great yeah there you go awesome so you guys before we get going here's our first level so we've picked steve as our character just want to orient you to what we're seeing on our screen here on the left hand side you can see the kind of the gameplay space so this is where you see that our character steve you see the agent and when we start running the code you'll be able to move around so actually oliver can you hit run now and then see where we go we don't get anything i can't break this with my fists i can't just walk through here like i'm a ghost um that's a challenge i can't break anything so i can't and agent did do anything great so how to code him to do something exactly so let's hit reset thanks oliver that's great and then like oliver just said right we need to we need to code the agent to help us out because right now we can't get to the object that we're trying to get to in this level we're trying to get to a chest and it's down in the right hand corner so we're stuck in we've all been stuck in our houses way too much over the last over this pandemic so we need to get out of the house um the middle part right here you can see where there's some blocks you can choose from that's where all the code blocks are here and so far we only have one block and here's the walk space but we cannot drag this block um the orange block yeah when one we cannot drag it around but we can drag around the blue block yeah we can drag around these this great point so there's some blocks that we can drag and there's some that we can't the ones in under where it says blocks in our toolbox those are the ones that we can drag out into our workspace so let's try this oliver let's try to help the agent um step on that pressure plate so we can get to the chest do you think it would help if we did it twice let's try that yeah this one oh then they just trapped me in again so what did you notice last time so that he went right he just walked on the pressure plate and went off the pressure plate like if i was just able to hurry fast enough i would have been able to get out well let's make it so that we can get out no matter what what do you guys think like i can just wait there for hours so i see that he wouldn't so two he'd move on to this right here and that's two spaces so maybe if you take away one then it look yeah now i can go get the chest great so we're off and running we've got we got the agent on the pressure plate that allowed steve to get the chances to move forwards a lot and some levels we might need to use the like what are these other commands that you see now so now we have sunglasses we have a repeat block we have we have a tone right block and all the time and then what we have click the two and see what happens and we click and we know that you get click it if you see an arrow right here then that means if you click it you have multiple options like you can make it do it three times two times what do you think i think we should do two two hold on guys just one second so that ex i'm glad you guys brought that up but that's an example of what in computer science we call a loop so it's called a repeat block here but it's called the loop computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over and over again without getting bored right they didn't get bored they could just get bored from doing it things over and over again and in the earlier minecraft they had to usually a repeat loop to be able to keep chickens moving around the whole world right so they can do that without getting bored so we can we can utilize that power when we write our code but in this time in this case for the agent all right so we can't get to what we need to get without the agent so we need to hit reset and do some coding so let's get started on that oliver i make my buttons so let's say reset he said he said okay and then how we're gonna code the agent to help us get the map so we want to move him right here but like what we saw on the last level when we wanted him to get onto a pressure plate right in front of him we did move forward two times into this kind of area so maybe we should go for two times in this level and it will get us to the pressure plate and then i just want to share the street for no reason i don't know why i just wanted to gather that a little extra on our way into it yeah i wonder if i can yeah anything work so in that case right oliver you brought up that we could have done two move forward blocks kind of like we showed the beginning of the first level but in this case we use the repeat block to make it a little bit easier okay so now same thing here we've got a pressure plates that we need to get to a compass let's do let's get to the pressure put to the compass first and then you can show us your strategy okay so what do you notice that's different about the repeat block this time it is it's on the number four okay so maybe that is our answer we just don't know it let's see maybe let's try and see if we don't have to cheat okay so i can show you my strategy what i'll do i could instead of like having to discount how many i'm putting there i'll just go like this with my character one two three four and then i'll figure out that's four ah if we press one before we put anything we've figured out that that's thing oh really nice strategy owen so you can use your character to help you with the code because you can do a little investigating beforehand that's a great great point hopefully that's helpful to all of you watching should we go get the compass hmm i i see a diamond right here i wonder what happens if you collect are diamonds good in minecraft yes yeah they are good you can make yeah they're all kind of awesome we should probably try to get that then yeah we should probably try and get it so that what that means actually but this pressure plate you we should do is redstone go so maybe on you should maybe follow that led stone yeah so let's see the redstone path okay so now you can see when he is behind the tree oh it's also going under this block it's going here too okay so we need to get to that other pressure plate is that right yes i can't just stand here and then he goes okay he can't collect so we need some help from you all at home right we've written some code where we could get to the compass but we need to get um over to the other pressure points so here on our screen you can see four different options um you can see them on your poll too what should we write as our next bit of code after our first bit that we already have written to help us get over to the diamond uh to the pressure plate that will help us get the diamond all right so if you're voted uh this one takes a little bit more time so we'll give you kind of five more seconds you've got turn right and then move turn left and then move move and then turn left move and then turn right okay hmm okay so it looks like we've got a winner and the winner there's there's two close two very close winners so well maybe we'll try the real winner and then if we can see this happens in second place so the winner was turn right then move forward four times so let's go back to the code oliver yep and you can hear what one second we just closed i think we should close that so it says so we want to do turn right on the right and then move forward four times that's okay you just change that around so that was the winning vote so let's see what happens uhhuh we should probably see okay turn right it was like hmm so where did the where did the agent end up over here instead of over here huh needs to go got it so i noticed that the second so that's totally fine as we tried something right and we figured out if it worked just like we did in the first level so this is what's called debugging right we're gonna figure out a bug in our code what do you the second place option was to change it from turn right to turn left so let's try that i don't even need to pull one over here i can just change that let's try oh oh yes now we get the diamond plus we get to get the compass and then if you get this thing then you complete the level that's how it wait let's see what it says here congratulations you found the diamond path awesome once we get to the end then we can go all the way back and fix all the messups to try and get all the diamonds and all the blows so you're saying if we went back if we had gone past this one we could have come back and come back to the diamond later if we felt like we wanted more of a challenge if we go back to one so let's let people at home do that if they want but we'll keep going on to number four five and six then we've seen the diamond on number three okay so now the diamonds out there so it's going to be hard to resist sometimes yeah sometimes it would like it would pop up character cannot walk over cannot go cannot swim but the agent can hover over okay so the agent has some abilities that we that we as the character don't have right um so great that's good to know so let's do one of these um and what do we need to do we need to get to that uh bucket let's try and bucket this pressure plate okay so we need to get all the way out there i kind of want to get the down again hmm all right so let's see if we can get to let's see first to get that one thing how much blocks were in front of the agent it was seven if you come to the pressure place so i put a repeat loop that's seven times that would repeat it seven times great so now i just need to find out what block is it so my strategy does not work on water you cannot like count with the camera but you can if you press this button we can do the strategy that you said if there was no water but in this case we kind of need to use the mouse to count the number of squares so let's put a move forward block in there and see what happens i cannot do a dance party so if you were part of the dance party episode earlier this week this might look familiar but it's not really going to help us solve our puzzle it's just kind of fun we're trying to dance right now we're trying to walk all right so let's try that again i i have something else this is a dance this is good oliver you i think you could you could become a choreographer with this with choreography uh you know teaching the agent all right so let's reset this clear this code and so good just to remember if you ever need to get rid of code you can just drag it like all others doing it in the trash the tone left or turn right is what we need and we have one more block right so i wonder what would happen if we put something like right here and it's like in the middle of nowhere there's no closure and what would happen like is that gonna work say forgot it starts it starts to have another block inside to walk make sure that oh it does not lock properly inside the container all right so let's just do the basic one here it says unused code thank you guys let's just do this basic one to get through it and then we're going to jump ahead to bubble stick so let's hit reset and run a7 thank you agent needed that bucket yep needed that diamonds well maybe everyone to get home and go back and figure out how to get the diamond when they try it on their own so let's just actually jump ahead to number six oliver okay because in this case it involves water too we need to get across the water so we need to actually build a brick so it's kind of cool to kill to build glitches that's really cool i like it we also let's try and get the diamond in this level i think well so yeah let's go ahead just go ahead and do it over what do you think what we should do first so first we should count what's in front of the agent can we know how much times to make him move forward which is gonna be one two three great so let's do that after that so let's change this to a three what what kind of material are we gonna use at this time and what material are we gonna build it out of sand across planks bridge planks oak ring planks spruce planks great so we need a url's help at home what should we build our bridge out of go ahead and take five seconds to type in your answer i hope she and the winner yeah me too okay what was the winner i use that all the time in minecraft cool a lot and it's kind of the same color you can go and close that that's great yep good job all right so we'll make it out of oakland already on old planes but if we do this nothing's gonna happen yeah what is he doing what is he doing there must be another block we need so sometimes we actually have to put more than one block inside of a repeater we need a full move from one foot what we should do after the split i think we should do it after the build let's okay let's try that okay so please oh enough times i don't want to get a two blocks that's not gonna do all right that's not gonna do it let's try the other one like it was before before you changed it awesome okay so oliver i know you want to get the diamond but we're kind of running long time so we do need to move on so let's just go get there and then we're actually going to switch our screens here for a second so let me just take over for one second hopefully all of you at home either if you're following along now that's great and if you um want to check it out later we'll show you how to do that when you get to the end of this tutorial excuse me um you're going to be you're going to see that there's 12 levels and at the end of the level this is a free play level so me and oliver have done some work these two have made their own free play level but if you notice one second oliver if you notice in the toolbox right um would you show the toolbox they're all over just get rid of that repeat uh just get rid of that repeat um menu just click on the six there you go so you've got a lot more options here right you've got destroying blocks you've got rails um so great point owen says as you go through the rest of the levels you'll see that there's more blocks that get that you get to use and then this is the chance to use them all and there's also some functions you can do and these please control when you want to use the functions if you use a functional stuff so let's just click run and see what you guys have made and then everyone at home we hope you all again we challenge you to see how far you can take your own creativity your own imagination to make your own level i know i'm just writing so what i noticed right is that you actually you can go beyond what's shown the first time right and you can see a lot more cool so we've built some rails all the way to this other house and then he's going back because one time it messed up i hope that's not the house we were stuck in on level one no it's not because this has a garden i don't wanna get stuck in there again so oh cool we've got a rail coming across here it's gonna make a bridge right go oh no awesome right up there not yet so these two are still in process of working on it and they'll continue to work on it again we hope that everyone at home can do the same thing we're going to show you one more thing here so i'm just going to stop that we're going to show you one more thing which is um the like i said the education version of minecraft um and this is something that you can download and use without an account and uh we have to use our account actually tell me well enough not to do these activities right tell me a little bit about what you guys have noticed when you've played this um version so what have you guys noticed about this different kind of things that you can do so what do we do right and so tell us a little bit about this story that we're in so we're trying to make like the illidar town and the villager town being night and help each other and those like different quizzes and the more like levels you complete with code bigger your tree grows and so far we haven't done any levels maybe to the middle of villager town awesome great and so just while you guys go find uh somebody to talk to i'm just gonna explain a little bit this is called the tale of two cities and villages two villages oh you always correct me on that that's what it turns into tale of two villages and this is connects to uh the theme of kind of cs for good which is what like oliver know when we're saying they can help these two villagers have been apart for a long time and they are kind of afraid of each other they don't really know each other because they've just been a par for so long so you with code and using the agent can help kind of uh help the these villagers and these illegibles get to know each other and help each other so let's go talk to the fishermen okay let's oh hi friends fishing is something we've never been good at the aerodromes from next town over offering to help us to learn how but they say we need a doc first great can you help us build a dock at the edge of the show we just need the outline see if you can build it's six blocks long and four blocks wide great so let's click start activity we don't actually have time to do this but can i if you guys just show them the what it looks like to code the agent in uh no no what are we doing you're giving it to him all right can you show what it looks like to code the agent in this setting so let's see now now i have so low so what are some things that are similar to this what we just did and what are some things that are
