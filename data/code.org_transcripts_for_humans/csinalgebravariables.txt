00:06 - Suppose we want to make an image of fifty
identical solid red triangles.
00:11 - To do so, you'd have to create this evaluation
block fifty times.
00:16 - Even worse, what if you decided you wanted
fifty blue triangles instead?
00:21 - You'd have to go through and change each and
every block.
00:24 - There must be a better way.
00:26 - What we need is a shortcut, some way to reference
our fifty pixel solid red triangle so that
00:32 - we can just ask for it fifty times.
00:35 - And if we wanted to change it, we'd only have
to do it in one place.
00:39 - We can do that by giving our block of code
a special name.
00:42 - Let's call it My Triangle.
00:45 - That name is shorthand for the block of code
that returns our fifty pixel solid red triangle
00:49 - and we can refer to My Triangle any time we

00:53 - The name My Triangle is called a variable.

Suppose we want to make an image of fifty identical solid red triangles. To do so, you'd have to create this evaluation block fifty times. Even worse, what if you decided you wanted fifty blue triangles instead? You'd have to go through and change each and every block. There must be a better way. What we need is a shortcut, some way to reference our fifty pixel solid red triangle so that we can just ask for it fifty times. And if we wanted to change it, we'd only have to do it in one place. We can do that by giving our block of code a special name. Let's call it My Triangle. That name is shorthand for the block of code that returns our fifty pixel solid red triangle and we can refer to My Triangle any time we want. The name My Triangle is called a variable. A special name given to a value so that it can be referenced repeatedly throughout a program. By using variables, you can write programs that are more flexible and return different values depending on the value of your variables. In this next stage, you'll define variables that can be used multiple times and change for each use throughout your programs. It gets pretty cool. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
