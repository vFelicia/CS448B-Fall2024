00:01 - i think it's really important for girls
00:02 - to study computer science i think for a
00:04 - long time the world thought that some
00:07 - things were for boys and some things
00:09 - were for girls and everyone understands
00:11 - now that boys and girls can have equal
00:13 - opportunity
00:14 - if we could just you know support girls
00:17 - and give them that initial encouragement
00:18 - that we can start balancing the skills
00:20 - and then we won't even have to play with
00:22 - the equation because it will just be a
00:23 - natural flow
00:25 - to be able to code gives you the freedom
00:27 - to
00:28 - build anything and that is is just
00:33 - so empowering i like having that power
00:36 - in my own hands to express what's in my
00:38 - imagination using programming
00:41 - just the experience of programming gives
00:43 - you access to a new method of thinking
00:45 - everything becomes the steps
00:47 - that you can take towards a solution and
00:50 - that is just extremely valuable
00:52 - you know it's one thing to use software
00:54 - it's a totally different thing to get to
00:56 - change how the software you use actually
00:58 - works yeah all my favorite memories from
01:01 - computer science are actually
01:02 - programming together with teams
01:04 - i mean i don't think cs is a solo thing
01:06 - i mean nothing is if you want to build
01:08 - something amazing you usually have to do
01:09 - it in a team and cs is no different
01:12 - you all live in a time where expressing
01:14 - yourself learning about different people
01:17 - making a business and a real difference
01:19 - in your communities is all totally
01:21 - possible with computers it's right at
01:23 - your fingertips
01:26 - it's not about being a girl or being a
01:29 - boy it's about being talented computer
01:32 - science needs more time people
01:34 - who are not afraid of being creative and
01:38 - making the world a better place jump
01:40 - into it learn just
01:43 - try and take one class try and take give
01:45 - it one hour
01:47 - it's amazing what you can learn in one
01:49 - hour
01:50 - and that's what's so exciting about hour
01:51 - of code all of you are able to
01:53 - participate from all parts of the
01:54 - country at all ages
01:57 - from all different backgrounds and
01:59 - that's what will create
02:01 - the right opportunities for everyone
02:04 - every girl deserves to take part in
02:05 - creating the technology that will change
02:08 - our world and change who runs it
02:10 - i challenge girls in every single
02:12 - country to learn one hour of code
02:17 - technology touches every part of our
02:19 - lives so if you can change technology
02:22 - you can change the world
