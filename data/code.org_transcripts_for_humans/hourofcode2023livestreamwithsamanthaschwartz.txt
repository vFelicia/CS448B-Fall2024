00:03 - good morning everyone happy Tuesday
00:07 - happy hour of code and happy Computer
00:09 - Science Education week thank you for
00:11 - joining us again for our second live
00:13 - stream this week we have something very
00:16 - special in store for you uh while you
00:19 - watch along we would love to hear your

00:30 - scan this QR code and send us your
00:33 - questions what's on your
00:35 - mind what questions do you have about
00:38 - dance party AI Edition or for our
00:41 - special
00:43 - host give a minute for people to join
00:46 - and get
00:55 - settled then I'm going to introduce to
00:57 - you our special host we're very very
01:00 - lucky to have her she is the product
01:03 - manager and creator of dance party AI
01:06 - Edition the activity that we're going to
01:08 - be doing today she's been at code.org
01:11 - for just about a year uh and she is
01:14 - going let's give her a warm Round of
01:16 - Applause and welcome Miss mantha
01:23 - Schwarz welcome Sam how are you doing hi

01:27 - to be here can you tell tell us a little
01:30 - bit about what it means to be a product
01:32 - manager and what you do at code.org yeah
01:35 - so I'm a product manager at code.org um
01:37 - and I help create all of the products
01:40 - and things that you would experience if
01:41 - you went to code.org and you saw the
01:44 - things that were on there I'm not
01:46 - exactly a software engineer but instead
01:48 - what I do is I work with our amazing
01:50 - team of software Engineers to make sure
01:52 - that we're building products and
01:55 - activities and lessons that are going to
01:57 - be fun and engaging for kids all over
01:59 - the world
02:01 - and lucky for all of you thank you Sam

02:17 - I'm a product manager here I was really
02:21 - excited to be able to work on something
02:23 - to incorporate teaching both coding and
02:26 - artificial intelligence allinone super
02:28 - fun activity and I'm excited to walk
02:31 - through it and share it with you today
02:34 - um so I'm going to share my
02:36 - screen and we're gonna start
02:40 - on code.org
02:42 - I'm G to share it in the chat here if
02:46 - you want to follow along um and we are
02:49 - going to start by going and seeing
02:51 - what's new on code.org which is going to
02:54 - take us to this coded dance party which
02:56 - we're super excited about and then we're
02:58 - going to be able to start dance party AI
03:04 - Edition in order to get us hyped up
03:06 - we're going to see some of this um
03:09 - dancing and action um and I'm going to
03:10 - share my screen and we can watch this
03:14 - video together a
03:24 - bit hi my name is mural cby and I'm a
03:28 - dancer software developer and creator of
03:33 - illuminate computer science relates to
03:35 - creativity in numerous ways immeasurable
03:39 - really I mean once you have the ability
03:41 - to write software you can put ideas into
03:44 - anything I do it with light suits
03:47 - there's so much you can do once you have
03:49 - the tools to write software and it's the
03:51 - possibilities are really
03:54 - endless over the next hour you're going
03:57 - to get started with computer science and
03:59 - artificial intelligence by coding your
04:01 - own dance party we've assembled some hip
04:04 - music and a team of great dancers for
04:06 - you to play
04:08 - with well I don't know about you but I'm
04:10 - super excited to get started to create
04:11 - our dance party together we're going to
04:14 - start on level
04:16 - one pick our
04:20 - age and when we come on here we're going
04:22 - to read the instructions um we'll start
04:25 - off with adding a block to create our
04:28 - dancer and code new dance move so that's
04:31 - super cool I'm excited to get that
04:33 - started um I see up here some songs that
04:36 - we have um if I want to hear what Harry
04:39 - Styles as it was sounds like I can come
04:41 - over here and press the play button I'm
04:43 - do that we can listen to some
04:53 - tunes
04:54 - nice I think I'm going to change the
04:56 - song I don't know if you can see it on
04:58 - Zoom but when I click this song I can
05:01 - pick some other options um so I'm going
05:03 - to click Born This Way by Lady Gaga and
05:06 - hear what that sounds
05:12 - like all right I'm super excited to
05:14 - create a dance party to borne this way
05:17 - um this call out here is telling me to
05:19 - start here on this red block so I'm
05:21 - going to start by making a cat at the
05:24 - center and I'm going to see what happens
05:26 - when I make the cat it starts
05:31 - weing pretty cool starts my dance party
05:35 - but I want to have the cat do something
05:38 - different I'm gonna have move over this
05:41 - purple block and have my cat
05:43 - do um maybe I want him to do the floss
05:47 - so let's see what happens when I'm
05:49 - telling my cat to do the
05:51 - floss oh my
05:58 - God
06:01 - so that's super exciting my cat did the
06:04 - floss um what if I want cats aren't
06:07 - really my thing um what if I want to
06:10 - instead make a
06:12 - sloth I'll have the sloth come here and
06:15 - see if it's going to do the
06:25 - floss oh no the sloth didn't do the
06:27 - floss like the cat did
06:30 - but it's telling me up here that I have
06:32 - to make sure that my dancer selected is
06:35 - the same one that's in the dance move so
06:38 - here I'm saying to make a new sloth but
06:40 - I guess I have to tell the sloth here
06:43 - that I want it to do the floss let's see
06:45 - what happens now see if this sloth will
06:47 - do the floss for me oh
06:57 - yeah yay we complet completed the first
07:00 - puzzle awesome I'm going to move on to
07:03 - the
07:04 - next level and see
07:08 - what dance party a has in store for
07:14 - me hi my name is hen and I'm head of the
07:18 - music search platform at Amazon I lead
07:21 - the team at Amazon music that helps you
07:24 - find your favorite song we use Advanced
07:27 - computer technology like artificial
07:29 - intelligence to make sure when you need
07:32 - music recommendations we give you the
07:35 - perfect match artificial intelligence or
07:38 - AI is a computer program that works like
07:41 - human brains it takes a lot of data
07:44 - learns patterns from the data and makes
07:47 - decisions based on what it has learned
07:50 - AI is
07:52 - always AI is super cool and as waen told
07:56 - us it takes a ton of information and
07:59 - makes decisions based on what it has
08:01 - learned in the past to create something
08:03 - new for the future so I'm excited to see
08:06 - how we're going to be using AI in our
08:08 - dance party um our little AI bot in the
08:11 - instructions is telling us that AI can
08:12 - help us create fun and visual effects
08:14 - for our dance party so what I'm going to
08:17 - do is I'm going to connect this AI
08:19 - generate effect block and then click the
08:21 - block to see what's going to happen so I
08:24 - have this new AI block and when I click
08:26 - the
08:27 - middle a little pop comes on and it asks
08:30 - me to choose three emojis um the song
08:34 - that I have here on the side is Calvin
08:36 - Harris's summer which I think summer
08:39 - reminds me of
08:42 - flowers and
08:44 - rainbows and ice cream is what I think
08:47 - of when I think of summer so those are
08:49 - the three emojis that I picked and I'm
08:50 - gon to ask AI to generate a new effect
08:53 - for
08:55 - me and I can see here AI is going
08:57 - through and finding the best effect
09:00 - based on the emojis that I gave it up
09:01 - here and it thinks that this is the best
09:05 - effect for my emoji pretty cool I love
09:09 - it I love the rainbows I love all the
09:12 - stars coming out I think it's going to
09:14 - fit perfectly um this is the effect that
09:16 - AI generated but if I wanted to look a
09:19 - little bit deeper I could also see the
09:21 - code that AI generated so it set the
09:25 - foreground effect to rainbows and it set
09:27 - the background effect to Sky in
09:29 - Starburst super cool so here I'm going
09:33 - to use the effect and see it in my dance
09:35 - party wow okay awesome it already showed
09:39 - up in the corner here I'll make that a
09:40 - little bit bigger and now let's run it
09:43 - and see what our dance party looks like
09:44 - so far and I Met You in
09:48 - summer to my heart
09:55 - sound yay oh I love that I think that
09:58 - fits so so perfectly with the song a
10:01 - great background I'm going to continue
10:02 - to the next the next one where they're
10:06 - asking me to use AI to generate a new
10:09 - effect for a different song so the song
10:11 - that it picked here is lizo to be loved
10:14 - I'm gonna see if I can pick another one
10:17 - um you can't I don't think you can see
10:18 - my choices here but I have a ton of
10:20 - different options here to pick from um
10:23 - and I'm GNA pick imagine dragon's
10:25 - Thunder and we can listen to what that
10:27 - sounds like just a young with the quick
10:30 - F I was
10:32 - up loose I Dreaming things nice okay I'm
10:38 - excited to create a moose dance party
10:40 - with thunder I'm gonna also connect the
10:43 - AI generate effect block again and I'm
10:44 - GNA go through the AI experience but
10:47 - with some different inputs so what does
10:49 - thunder remind me of I think this kind
10:52 - of cyclon guy um maybe the music and the
10:59 - light bulb I don't know light and
11:01 - thunder kind of remind me of the same
11:03 - thing so I'm going to generate a new
11:05 - effect here and AI is going through all
11:07 - of the different possible effects that
11:09 - it could generate but it didn't
11:12 - pick and this is the final one that it
11:14 - picked oh that is so cool it's pink and
11:18 - it's got these lights going
11:22 - and I think it is very cool we saw
11:24 - similar lights in our last
11:27 - background if you're curious about why
11:31 - AI decided to pick the one that it
11:33 - picked what you can do is you can come
11:34 - over to this graph on the side and it
11:37 - will show you which emojis contributed
11:40 - to the decision so here this kind of
11:43 - Starburst and lights was really strongly
11:47 - associated with this Cyclone Emoji it
11:49 - didn't have so much with the music emoji
11:52 - but it also had a strong effect with the
11:55 - light Emoji I think probably because of
11:57 - those stage lights that you see
12:01 - so I'm going to go back and I want to
12:03 - see if there are other things that AI is
12:05 - going to generate with these same inputs
12:07 - from there I can click the regenerate
12:10 - option which the AI will go through and
12:12 - find a different effect that it also
12:14 - thinks would match my
12:27 - Emojis
12:33 - so this is the Emoji that it picked um
12:36 - really or this is the background that I
12:39 - picked based on my Emojis I think this
12:40 - fits a little bit better with what I was
12:42 - imagining it's some different colors but
12:44 - it still has the same stage lights and
12:47 - and I'm going to use the
12:51 - effect
12:54 - awesome from here I'm going to click
12:57 - play and let's see our
12:59 - dance party in
13:06 - action I was uptight want to let loose I
13:10 - was dreaming a bigger things want to
13:13 - leave my own life
13:15 - [Music]
13:17 - behind so we passed that level and now
13:19 - we're going to move on to level
13:25 - five and we're going to watch a bit of
13:27 - the next video how do you think AI Works
13:31 - can it read your mind is it magic is it
13:34 - randomly
13:36 - guessing actually AI knows quite a lot
13:40 - AI looks at billions of data points and
13:42 - finds associations between words with
13:45 - some simple math concepts applied
13:47 - billions of times it calculates the
13:50 - strength between those associations then
13:53 - AI uses what it learned in order to make
13:56 - decisions on what to generate for you my
13:59 - team uses AI to look for associations
14:02 - between songs and artists to make sure
14:05 - Amazon music is recommending the best
14:08 - next song sometimes those decisions
14:11 - aren't the same
14:14 - ones you would make because AI is making
14:17 - associations based on billions of data
14:19 - points imagine a
14:22 - sunset what color do you see if you ask
14:25 - this questions to billions of people you
14:27 - would get many different
14:30 - answers when you choose three emojis so
14:33 - like quen just told us sometimes AI
14:36 - makes decisions on what it's learned but
14:38 - it may not be the same decisions that
14:40 - you would make like you may not have
14:42 - picked those stage lights in the last
14:44 - one like AI did so what we're going to
14:46 - do is we're going to see what we can do
14:49 - to customize the things that AI created
14:53 - so before we picked someone picked these
14:57 - options the I man the wave the Sparkle
15:01 - and this is the effect that AI created
15:04 - what we can do if just say you know we
15:06 - don't really love what AI did we can
15:09 - either regenerate like I showed you on
15:11 - the last screen where you can take the
15:12 - same inputs and see if it will generate
15:14 - a new output so we can see
15:21 - that oh nice so it generated this and
15:25 - what we can also do is we can go over to
15:28 - the code Tab and instead of just using
15:31 - the effect directly we can go and
15:34 - customize this code by using Code so
15:37 - when I click use code these two new
15:39 - blocks that AI generated are going to
15:41 - show up in my workspace and here I can
15:44 - customize the to be the exact option
15:47 - that I want so let's just say that I
15:49 - really like the snow and I really like
15:51 - the rain but I don't really like this
15:52 - pink color i instead want a darker color
15:55 - what I can do is I can come in here and
15:57 - I can pick a darker color like ocean
16:01 - where I get a more blue color and then I
16:04 - can see what that would look
16:05 - like like butter like criminal
16:10 - undercover like trouble breing into your
16:13 - heart like
16:14 - that nice awesome so that is how we can
16:19 - change what AI created and make it
16:22 - personalized for exactly what we want AI
16:24 - creates a great starting point for us
16:27 - but it may not always be exactly what
16:28 - want so we can use the starting point
16:30 - that AI gave us and then customize it to
16:32 - be exactly what we
16:37 - want now I'm going to
16:39 - [Music]
16:44 - show hi I'm Hannah and I'm a software
16:47 - engineer at code.org choreographers give
16:49 - dancers directions on exactly when to do
16:51 - a dance move in dance party you'll use
16:54 - code to direct your dancers to move when
16:56 - you want them to so how do you do this
16:58 - this think of a situation where you do
17:00 - something like press a doorbell and then
17:02 - something else happens the doorbell
17:04 - rings when coding your dance party you
17:06 - can use events to make your program
17:08 - respond to a key you press for ex nice
17:11 - so we are going to use events to make
17:14 - our program more interactive with the
17:16 - things that we're doing so on this next
17:19 - level if you're trying it out along with
17:21 - us um we are going to be able
17:25 - to control our duck and our dog based on
17:30 - the different keys and on these green
17:32 - event blocks it's going to tell the duck
17:36 - and the dog what to do when we do
17:38 - something so I'm going to press run and
17:41 - then I'll click some of these buttons
17:42 - and we'll see what
17:50 - [Music]
17:54 - happens did you notice that when I
17:56 - clicked the left left key the duck did a
18:00 - dab and when I clicked the right key the
18:03 - dog did a star that's because we program
18:06 - these events to have the different icons
18:11 - and dancers do different things based on
18:14 - the events that we
18:15 - clicked the next few levels of dance
18:18 - party AI are working on creating your
18:21 - own events So based on the buttons that
18:24 - you want to click you can either have
18:25 - the dancers do something you can
18:27 - potentially change the background you
18:29 - can do a whole bunch of things um but
18:31 - I'm going to skip to the last level to
18:34 - create kind of a final dance party based
18:36 - on everything that we've
18:39 - learned so here we're on level 10 it
18:42 - starts us with this cool effect based
18:45 - that AI picked based on rainbows and
18:47 - party hat and sparkles it also has 12
18:51 - cats in a circle and we've made a moose
18:54 - at the center of our screen and let's
18:57 - run and see kind of what this sounds
19:00 - [Music]
19:05 - like nice I think that we can work to
19:08 - make this more exciting and
19:12 - interactive um because we're on the last
19:14 - level the song is going to continue
19:17 - going for until the song ends for the
19:20 - whole two minutes so you won't be cut
19:22 - off short you'll be able to play with
19:24 - your dance party and do your dance party
19:26 - for the whole song
19:29 - so let's work together um I think I'm
19:31 - going to create a when up is pressed
19:34 - event so when up is pressed I think I'm
19:37 - gonna want my
19:40 - moose to
19:43 - do so I'm going to want my moose here in
19:46 - the center to do
19:52 - a a
19:54 - slide awesome so here I've done when up
19:57 - is pressed my moose is going to do a
19:58 - slide so let's try it let's try and see
20:01 - what happens when I press
20:04 - [Music]
20:10 - up nice so if you saw my moose did when
20:14 - I press up my moose did a cool slide
20:17 - action I'm going to create another event
20:21 - maybe when down is
20:22 - pressed when down is pressed I think I
20:25 - want my cats in the circle to do
20:27 - something
20:29 - so I'm going to come over here and put
20:34 - in a new purple event and I want my
20:38 - cats that are around in the circle I
20:42 - want my cats to do a clap when I click
20:46 - down so let's see how that
20:50 - looks Ro all my life surrounded by
20:55 - couples all the time I guess I
20:59 - should so I'm super excited my mouse my
21:02 - my moose can now slide and my cats can
21:06 - now clap and the last thing I'm going to
21:08 - do is I'm going to use this slightly
21:10 - different event block that we learn
21:12 - about in levels eight and nine that we
21:15 - skipped but what this does is it allows
21:17 - us to at a certain measure so at two
21:22 - measures of the song it's going to do
21:24 - something so what I'm going to have it
21:26 - do is I'm going to have it change the
21:28 - background at two measures so we'll go
21:30 - through the generate effect This song
21:32 - reminds me of Sparkles and the hearts
21:36 - and the Disco so we'll see what AI
21:38 - generates One Last Time For
21:46 - Us oh my gosh perfect I love it so I'm G
21:50 - to use this effect and I'm going to be
21:52 - able
21:53 - to press up and see my mouse my moose
21:57 - move and press press down and see my
21:58 - cats move and then I'm going to watch at
22:01 - measure two the background will change
22:02 - for
22:04 - me R all my life surrounded my all the
22:11 - time I guess I should take
22:17 - it and that is my dance party that I
22:21 - created which is super
22:23 - exciting um I could keep playing with
22:25 - this for the next
22:28 - hour um but I'll let you guys all keep
22:31 - going and try all of these different
22:33 - cool things that you can do um with your
22:36 - dance party and I'm super excited to see
22:38 - what you all
22:39 - create thanks Sam that was awesome you
22:42 - you saying that makes me kind of want uh
22:44 - do we have a mouse character we should
22:46 - add a mouse character that'd be really
22:48 - cute do you have a favorite
22:50 - character H my favorite character is the
22:53 - Unicorn so I'm gonna add a new unicorn
22:57 - to this dance party so you can see what
22:59 - they look
23:00 - like and I'm going to add them add them
23:04 - to
23:06 - the right yay unicorn there you go now

23:13 - character and I'm gonna I'll have the
23:15 - Unicorn do something give them something
23:18 - to do the Unicorn would do a Bend when I
23:20 - click up
23:24 - now I hope that's romantic all my life
23:29 - surrounded by couples all the time I
23:33 - guess I should take it as nice I love it
23:37 - the Unicorn is my
23:38 - favorite that's great that's even better
23:42 - um do you have any go-to dance moves
23:45 - when you get on the dance
23:47 - floor that is a good question I I will
23:51 - say that I'm a big fan of the floss um
23:54 - because it's easy and I'm not so
23:56 - coordinated so I'm able to do that
23:58 - pretty easily um I love the floss and I
24:00 - love a I love a good sprinkler everyone
24:03 - knows what that is yes classic classic
24:07 - sprinkler that's always a crowd
24:11 - pleaser we do have a question from Miss
24:14 - Teresa bian Ami and Pine Hill School
24:16 - Sherborn Massachusetts you touched on
24:19 - this a little bit but when did you know
24:20 - that you wanted a career in computer
24:22 - science and what sparked your
24:26 - interest so like I mentioned earlier I
24:30 - had to take computer
24:32 - science as like a required class in
24:35 - college and I was not so interested in
24:37 - taking it but I really loved all of the
24:41 - assignments that we had to do
24:43 - specifically that I was able to tell the
24:46 - computer what to do and if the computer
24:48 - was doing something wrong it was because
24:50 - I was telling it to do something wrong
24:53 - and that process of going through and
24:54 - trying to find out exactly what was
24:56 - wrong and like problem solve and
24:58 - troubleshoot in real time was so fun for
25:02 - me to like
25:04 - see like see something happen and then
25:06 - not have it happen exactly the right way
25:08 - and then go through and try and see what
25:10 - was wrong I really loved and I thought
25:12 - was super cool and then as I was looking
25:15 - for
25:16 - careers I felt like being in computer
25:20 - science was something that I really
25:22 - enjoyed doing in school and I was like
25:25 - how do
25:26 - I get to solve these kind of problems
25:28 - and have fun and have these fun
25:30 - conversations in my real world job and I
25:35 - was able to join the computer science
25:38 - field and I haven't looked back since
25:40 - and it's been so
25:41 - fun speaking of looking back what about
25:44 - looking forward what's coming next at
25:47 - c.org what are you excited about one of
25:50 - the things that I'm really excited about
25:51 - obviously um other than dance party AI
25:54 - Edition is me and the team are working
25:57 - on a new incubator project called
26:00 - project beats which allows you to create
26:03 - music on code.org site so we just
26:06 - created a dance party which is super fun
26:09 - but we're now create working on
26:11 - something that will allow you to use
26:14 - code to create your own songs and your
26:16 - own
26:18 - music everyone can go check that out if
26:21 - you go to code.org and do another hour
26:23 - of code after you've created your dance
26:25 - party and we also invite you to learn
26:28 - about AI you can go to ARF code.com and
26:33 - check out our learn how AI work series
26:35 - and if you have any other questions
26:37 - please do submit it thank you Sam for
26:40 - your time and walking us through that
26:43 - and I hope everyone has a great rest of
26:45 - your hour code week let us know how it
26:47 - went celebrate show us your pictures
26:50 - show us your dance moves and tag us with
26:53 - hashar of code we'd love to see what you
26:56 - create thank you everyone for joining
26:58 - and thank you Sam bye everyone thank you
27:02 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

good morning everyone happy Tuesday happy hour of code and happy Computer Science Education week thank you for joining us again for our second live stream this week we have something very special in store for you uh while you watch along we would love to hear your questions you can enter them in the zoom chat if you are here in zoom and you can also go to bit.ly school question or scan this QR code and send us your questions what's on your mind what questions do you have about dance party AI Edition or for our special host give a minute for people to join and get settled then I'm going to introduce to you our special host we're very very lucky to have her she is the product manager and creator of dance party AI Edition the activity that we're going to be doing today she's been at code.org for just about a year uh and she is going let's give her a warm Round of Applause and welcome Miss mantha Schwarz welcome Sam how are you doing hi everybody I'm doing so well so excited to be here can you tell tell us a little bit about what it means to be a product manager and what you do at code.org yeah so I'm a product manager at code.org um and I help create all of the products and things that you would experience if you went to code.org and you saw the things that were on there I'm not exactly a software engineer but instead what I do is I work with our amazing team of software Engineers to make sure that we're building products and activities and lessons that are going to be fun and engaging for kids all over the world and lucky for all of you thank you Sam she created dance party Airi Edition so she's got all the inside knowledge anything you ever wanted to know about a Edition she'll share with you and we'll get started today yeah super happy to help um so excited to be here as Tanya mentioned um I'm a product manager here I was really excited to be able to work on something to incorporate teaching both coding and artificial intelligence allinone super fun activity and I'm excited to walk through it and share it with you today um so I'm going to share my screen and we're gonna start on code.org I'm G to share it in the chat here if you want to follow along um and we are going to start by going and seeing what's new on code.org which is going to take us to this coded dance party which we're super excited about and then we're going to be able to start dance party AI Edition in order to get us hyped up we're going to see some of this um dancing and action um and I'm going to share my screen and we can watch this video together a bit hi my name is mural cby and I'm a dancer software developer and creator of illuminate computer science relates to creativity in numerous ways immeasurable really I mean once you have the ability to write software you can put ideas into anything I do it with light suits there's so much you can do once you have the tools to write software and it's the possibilities are really endless over the next hour you're going to get started with computer science and artificial intelligence by coding your own dance party we've assembled some hip music and a team of great dancers for you to play with well I don't know about you but I'm super excited to get started to create our dance party together we're going to start on level one pick our age and when we come on here we're going to read the instructions um we'll start off with adding a block to create our dancer and code new dance move so that's super cool I'm excited to get that started um I see up here some songs that we have um if I want to hear what Harry Styles as it was sounds like I can come over here and press the play button I'm do that we can listen to some tunes nice I think I'm going to change the song I don't know if you can see it on Zoom but when I click this song I can pick some other options um so I'm going to click Born This Way by Lady Gaga and hear what that sounds like all right I'm super excited to create a dance party to borne this way um this call out here is telling me to start here on this red block so I'm going to start by making a cat at the center and I'm going to see what happens when I make the cat it starts weing pretty cool starts my dance party but I want to have the cat do something different I'm gonna have move over this purple block and have my cat do um maybe I want him to do the floss so let's see what happens when I'm telling my cat to do the floss oh my God so that's super exciting my cat did the floss um what if I want cats aren't really my thing um what if I want to instead make a sloth I'll have the sloth come here and see if it's going to do the floss oh no the sloth didn't do the floss like the cat did but it's telling me up here that I have to make sure that my dancer selected is the same one that's in the dance move so here I'm saying to make a new sloth but I guess I have to tell the sloth here that I want it to do the floss let's see what happens now see if this sloth will do the floss for me oh yeah yay we complet completed the first puzzle awesome I'm going to move on to the next level and see what dance party a has in store for me hi my name is hen and I'm head of the music search platform at Amazon I lead the team at Amazon music that helps you find your favorite song we use Advanced computer technology like artificial intelligence to make sure when you need music recommendations we give you the perfect match artificial intelligence or AI is a computer program that works like human brains it takes a lot of data learns patterns from the data and makes decisions based on what it has learned AI is always AI is super cool and as waen told us it takes a ton of information and makes decisions based on what it has learned in the past to create something new for the future so I'm excited to see how we're going to be using AI in our dance party um our little AI bot in the instructions is telling us that AI can help us create fun and visual effects for our dance party so what I'm going to do is I'm going to connect this AI generate effect block and then click the block to see what's going to happen so I have this new AI block and when I click the middle a little pop comes on and it asks me to choose three emojis um the song that I have here on the side is Calvin Harris's summer which I think summer reminds me of flowers and rainbows and ice cream is what I think of when I think of summer so those are the three emojis that I picked and I'm gon to ask AI to generate a new effect for me and I can see here AI is going through and finding the best effect based on the emojis that I gave it up here and it thinks that this is the best effect for my emoji pretty cool I love it I love the rainbows I love all the stars coming out I think it's going to fit perfectly um this is the effect that AI generated but if I wanted to look a little bit deeper I could also see the code that AI generated so it set the foreground effect to rainbows and it set the background effect to Sky in Starburst super cool so here I'm going to use the effect and see it in my dance party wow okay awesome it already showed up in the corner here I'll make that a little bit bigger and now let's run it and see what our dance party looks like so far and I Met You in summer to my heart sound yay oh I love that I think that fits so so perfectly with the song a great background I'm going to continue to the next the next one where they're asking me to use AI to generate a new effect for a different song so the song that it picked here is lizo to be loved I'm gonna see if I can pick another one um you can't I don't think you can see my choices here but I have a ton of different options here to pick from um and I'm GNA pick imagine dragon's Thunder and we can listen to what that sounds like just a young with the quick F I was up loose I Dreaming things nice okay I'm excited to create a moose dance party with thunder I'm gonna also connect the AI generate effect block again and I'm GNA go through the AI experience but with some different inputs so what does thunder remind me of I think this kind of cyclon guy um maybe the music and the light bulb I don't know light and thunder kind of remind me of the same thing so I'm going to generate a new effect here and AI is going through all of the different possible effects that it could generate but it didn't pick and this is the final one that it picked oh that is so cool it's pink and it's got these lights going and I think it is very cool we saw similar lights in our last background if you're curious about why AI decided to pick the one that it picked what you can do is you can come over to this graph on the side and it will show you which emojis contributed to the decision so here this kind of Starburst and lights was really strongly associated with this Cyclone Emoji it didn't have so much with the music emoji but it also had a strong effect with the light Emoji I think probably because of those stage lights that you see so I'm going to go back and I want to see if there are other things that AI is going to generate with these same inputs from there I can click the regenerate option which the AI will go through and find a different effect that it also thinks would match my Emojis so this is the Emoji that it picked um really or this is the background that I picked based on my Emojis I think this fits a little bit better with what I was imagining it's some different colors but it still has the same stage lights and and I'm going to use the effect awesome from here I'm going to click play and let's see our dance party in action I was uptight want to let loose I was dreaming a bigger things want to leave my own life behind so we passed that level and now we're going to move on to level five and we're going to watch a bit of the next video how do you think AI Works can it read your mind is it magic is it randomly guessing actually AI knows quite a lot AI looks at billions of data points and finds associations between words with some simple math concepts applied billions of times it calculates the strength between those associations then AI uses what it learned in order to make decisions on what to generate for you my team uses AI to look for associations between songs and artists to make sure Amazon music is recommending the best next song sometimes those decisions aren't the same ones you would make because AI is making associations based on billions of data points imagine a sunset what color do you see if you ask this questions to billions of people you would get many different answers when you choose three emojis so like quen just told us sometimes AI makes decisions on what it's learned but it may not be the same decisions that you would make like you may not have picked those stage lights in the last one like AI did so what we're going to do is we're going to see what we can do to customize the things that AI created so before we picked someone picked these options the I man the wave the Sparkle and this is the effect that AI created what we can do if just say you know we don't really love what AI did we can either regenerate like I showed you on the last screen where you can take the same inputs and see if it will generate a new output so we can see that oh nice so it generated this and what we can also do is we can go over to the code Tab and instead of just using the effect directly we can go and customize this code by using Code so when I click use code these two new blocks that AI generated are going to show up in my workspace and here I can customize the to be the exact option that I want so let's just say that I really like the snow and I really like the rain but I don't really like this pink color i instead want a darker color what I can do is I can come in here and I can pick a darker color like ocean where I get a more blue color and then I can see what that would look like like butter like criminal undercover like trouble breing into your heart like that nice awesome so that is how we can change what AI created and make it personalized for exactly what we want AI creates a great starting point for us but it may not always be exactly what want so we can use the starting point that AI gave us and then customize it to be exactly what we want now I'm going to show hi I'm Hannah and I'm a software engineer at code.org choreographers give dancers directions on exactly when to do a dance move in dance party you'll use code to direct your dancers to move when you want them to so how do you do this this think of a situation where you do something like press a doorbell and then something else happens the doorbell rings when coding your dance party you can use events to make your program respond to a key you press for ex nice so we are going to use events to make our program more interactive with the things that we're doing so on this next level if you're trying it out along with us um we are going to be able to control our duck and our dog based on the different keys and on these green event blocks it's going to tell the duck and the dog what to do when we do something so I'm going to press run and then I'll click some of these buttons and we'll see what happens did you notice that when I clicked the left left key the duck did a dab and when I clicked the right key the dog did a star that's because we program these events to have the different icons and dancers do different things based on the events that we clicked the next few levels of dance party AI are working on creating your own events So based on the buttons that you want to click you can either have the dancers do something you can potentially change the background you can do a whole bunch of things um but I'm going to skip to the last level to create kind of a final dance party based on everything that we've learned so here we're on level 10 it starts us with this cool effect based that AI picked based on rainbows and party hat and sparkles it also has 12 cats in a circle and we've made a moose at the center of our screen and let's run and see kind of what this sounds like nice I think that we can work to make this more exciting and interactive um because we're on the last level the song is going to continue going for until the song ends for the whole two minutes so you won't be cut off short you'll be able to play with your dance party and do your dance party for the whole song so let's work together um I think I'm going to create a when up is pressed event so when up is pressed I think I'm gonna want my moose to do so I'm going to want my moose here in the center to do a a slide awesome so here I've done when up is pressed my moose is going to do a slide so let's try it let's try and see what happens when I press up nice so if you saw my moose did when I press up my moose did a cool slide action I'm going to create another event maybe when down is pressed when down is pressed I think I want my cats in the circle to do something so I'm going to come over here and put in a new purple event and I want my cats that are around in the circle I want my cats to do a clap when I click down so let's see how that looks Ro all my life surrounded by couples all the time I guess I should so I'm super excited my mouse my my moose can now slide and my cats can now clap and the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use this slightly different event block that we learn about in levels eight and nine that we skipped but what this does is it allows us to at a certain measure so at two measures of the song it's going to do something so what I'm going to have it do is I'm going to have it change the background at two measures so we'll go through the generate effect This song reminds me of Sparkles and the hearts and the Disco so we'll see what AI generates One Last Time For Us oh my gosh perfect I love it so I'm G to use this effect and I'm going to be able to press up and see my mouse my moose move and press press down and see my cats move and then I'm going to watch at measure two the background will change for me R all my life surrounded my all the time I guess I should take it and that is my dance party that I created which is super exciting um I could keep playing with this for the next hour um but I'll let you guys all keep going and try all of these different cool things that you can do um with your dance party and I'm super excited to see what you all create thanks Sam that was awesome you you saying that makes me kind of want uh do we have a mouse character we should add a mouse character that'd be really cute do you have a favorite character H my favorite character is the Unicorn so I'm gonna add a new unicorn to this dance party so you can see what they look like and I'm going to add them add them to the right yay unicorn there you go now he's got a friend that's my favorite character and I'm gonna I'll have the Unicorn do something give them something to do the Unicorn would do a Bend when I click up now I hope that's romantic all my life surrounded by couples all the time I guess I should take it as nice I love it the Unicorn is my favorite that's great that's even better um do you have any goto dance moves when you get on the dance floor that is a good question I I will say that I'm a big fan of the floss um because it's easy and I'm not so coordinated so I'm able to do that pretty easily um I love the floss and I love a I love a good sprinkler everyone knows what that is yes classic classic sprinkler that's always a crowd pleaser we do have a question from Miss Teresa bian Ami and Pine Hill School Sherborn Massachusetts you touched on this a little bit but when did you know that you wanted a career in computer science and what sparked your interest so like I mentioned earlier I had to take computer science as like a required class in college and I was not so interested in taking it but I really loved all of the assignments that we had to do specifically that I was able to tell the computer what to do and if the computer was doing something wrong it was because I was telling it to do something wrong and that process of going through and trying to find out exactly what was wrong and like problem solve and troubleshoot in real time was so fun for me to like see like see something happen and then not have it happen exactly the right way and then go through and try and see what was wrong I really loved and I thought was super cool and then as I was looking for careers I felt like being in computer science was something that I really enjoyed doing in school and I was like how do I get to solve these kind of problems and have fun and have these fun conversations in my real world job and I was able to join the computer science field and I haven't looked back since and it's been so fun speaking of looking back what about looking forward what's coming next at c.org what are you excited about one of the things that I'm really excited about obviously um other than dance party AI Edition is me and the team are working on a new incubator project called project beats which allows you to create music on code.org site so we just created a dance party which is super fun but we're now create working on something that will allow you to use code to create your own songs and your own music everyone can go check that out if you go to code.org and do another hour of code after you've created your dance party and we also invite you to learn about AI you can go to ARF code.com and check out our learn how AI work series and if you have any other questions please do submit it thank you Sam for your time and walking us through that and I hope everyone has a great rest of your hour code week let us know how it went celebrate show us your pictures show us your dance moves and tag us with hashar of code we'd love to see what you create thank you everyone for joining and thank you Sam bye everyone thank you bye
