00:00 - Hi, my name is Helena,
and I'm a public health scientist.
00:04 - This means I study
how diseases spread in populations.
00:08 - What I love about public health
is that it brings together
00:11 - my love for computer science and data
to make an impact on people
00:15 - in a positive way.
00:18 - Scientists use the power of
computer science all the time.
00:22 - We use computer simulations
to understand the spread of new viruses.
00:27 - A simulation is a computer model
of a process or a system.
00:32 - Simulations are a great way
to learn things
00:35 - that can be hard
to observe in the real world.
00:38 - They help scientists
solve problems and test
00:41 - new ideas safely and efficiently.
00:45 - This graph represents
the amount of people infected.
00:48 - In this case,
we want to flatten the curve.
00:51 - Flattening the curve means that we slow
the rate of people getting sick.
00:55 - That buys health professionals
more time to get people vaccinated
00:59 - and to save more lives.
01:01 - We also
01:02 - want to help scientists
and doctors get relevant data
01:05 - as they collaborate to create vaccines
and work on new treatments.
01:10 - In today's lesson, we'll visit
a fictional place called Monster Town,
01:14 - where a virus outbreak
is about to happen.
01:17 - We'll be using computer science
to understand
01:20 - how quickly a virus can spread
and what can be done to slow it down
01:25 - so that all the monsters can get healthy
again.
01:28 - We'll ask the questions
How quickly will the virus spread?
01:33 - What can we and Dr.
01:35 - Monster do to combat and contain
the virus?
01:39 - You'll experiment with a
few different interventions
01:42 - like masks, crowds and vaccines.
01:47 - You might already know the answers,
but take a closer look.
01:51 - Run your simulation multiple times.
01:54 - What do you notice?
