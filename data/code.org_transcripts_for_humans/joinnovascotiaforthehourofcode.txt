00:11 - my first computer was a generic
00:14 - xt computer
00:15 - and i remember the big decision when i
00:17 - bought that computer is whether or not i
00:19 - would buy a computer with a hard drive
00:20 - it was only 20 megabytes in those days
00:23 - that was huge
00:26 - the hour code is a global initiative
00:29 - intended to encourage students of all
00:31 - age groups to
00:33 - look at computer coding computers
00:35 - programming and to try to demystify
00:38 - exactly what programming is
00:41 - the hour of code is a worldwide event
00:45 - trying to engage as many students as
00:47 - they can to participate in programming
00:50 - code
00:51 - it's important to give opportunities to
00:53 - the students to open up their eyes to
00:56 - something very different very new but
00:58 - yet at the same time make them excited
01:00 - about it
01:01 - it's for all levels i mean there's
01:03 - students in kindergarten that do this
01:04 - and then there's students in high school
01:05 - that do this
01:07 - they don't often have the chance to have
01:08 - the freedom to get in there and kind of
01:11 - play around with computers in the way
01:12 - that they want to in a way that's
01:13 - engaging when they get frustrated they
01:14 - call me over and they say i don't know
01:16 - how to do this and i say i don't know
01:18 - either let's do it together and it's a
01:20 - great great piece for kind of those
01:21 - connections that we build together
01:24 - what is the hour of code
01:25 - it's a chance to see that there was
01:27 - something behind that screen now there's
01:30 - a language that exists and that they get
01:32 - the opportunity to
01:33 - work with that language
01:41 - when i see the the kids sitting in front
01:43 - of the screen it's important for them
01:45 - because they're learning how to problem
01:46 - solve they're learning how to
01:48 - troubleshoot they're learning to
01:49 - persevere in this day and age of instant
01:52 - gratification i think that it's a good
01:54 - skill to have
01:56 - they're
01:57 - basically not even aware of all of the
01:59 - math and science skills that they're
02:01 - using and they're having fun doing it
02:04 - the ability for them to take that
02:06 - problem solving the critical thinking
02:08 - and then apply it to not just school
02:09 - subjects but like everyday life
02:11 - those pieces are crucial this is a great
02:13 - way for them to build confidence they're
02:15 - able to take it much further than just
02:17 - the computer they came in first thing
02:19 - this morning and said miss fader we did
02:21 - 60 lines of code last night and that
02:23 - shows me that they are
02:25 - taking the initiative on their own
02:30 - it's a new way of learning
02:41 - you
