00:02 - can y'all hear me there on the line
00:07 - i think i've muted everyone actually
00:09 - let's see i'll unmute you
00:11 - can use that a thumbs up you can hear me
00:13 - yeah yeah i'll get you
00:15 - thank you so welcome everybody my name
00:17 - is melissa jones and i'm a community
00:20 - manager here at code.org i'm excited to
00:22 - welcome you to our october monthly
00:24 - meeting for the cs fundamentals
00:26 - curriculum which is our k-5 curriculum
00:28 - courses one through four
00:30 - um tonight laura klein unfortunately
00:32 - couldn't join us she had a conflicting
00:33 - meeting but i'm very excited to um share
00:36 - her updates with you um we're also
00:38 - joined by kiki protzman our program
00:39 - manager for cs fundamentals and our
00:41 - special guest maria litvin who is a high
00:44 - school teacher and a k-5 affiliate in
00:45 - massachusetts maria has some really
00:48 - exciting and challenging um problems to
00:50 - share with us i think you guys will all
00:52 - be interested in
00:54 - so our goals tonight um first and
00:56 - foremost as usual the goal of these
00:58 - calls is to connect as a community and
01:00 - to help give you information and an
01:02 - opportunity to um
01:05 - foreign bond and to meet other teachers
01:07 - who are teaching the same curriculum as
01:08 - you
01:09 - tonight we're going to explore some
01:10 - opportunities to challenge your k5
01:12 - students um that maria is going to be
01:14 - sharing with us and then later kiki is
01:16 - going to be discussing strategies for
01:18 - modifying the cs fundamentals curriculum
01:20 - to meet your student needs whether your
01:21 - students are advanced if your students
01:23 - are struggling
01:24 - she's going to help you figure out how
01:26 - to do that we'll have some time at the
01:27 - end for questions concerns and feedback
01:29 - for the group and some exciting
01:31 - announcements about our code
01:33 - so just to get started if this is your
01:35 - first time using blue jeans please be
01:37 - aware that we can um you can see us and
01:40 - you can hear us but we can't see you
01:42 - unless you have your microphone and your
01:44 - um webcam on um so sit back relax enjoy
01:48 - the show
01:49 - if you do have something that you'd like
01:50 - to add there's a chat window right above
01:52 - you that you can go ahead and click on
01:53 - and that's a great place to introduce
01:55 - yourself to put a question for the
01:57 - presenter feedback
01:59 - share a link anything that you'd like to
02:01 - share the chat has a great place to do
02:02 - that then later when we have discussion
02:04 - time you can activate your microphone on
02:07 - your webcam by clicking just below your
02:08 - picture and then we will be able to hear
02:11 - you and see you and when we get to that
02:13 - point of the agenda i will explain more
02:14 - about how to do that
02:17 - before we dive into tonight's agenda i
02:18 - just wanted to call your attention to
02:20 - the fact that code.org recently real uh
02:23 - released rather the results of our
02:26 - 2014-2015 program evaluation um so for
02:29 - the past year actually longer than a
02:31 - year
02:32 - since the beginning of code.org we've
02:34 - been studying our impact and studying
02:36 - the results of our programs
02:38 - and over the last year 2014 to 2015 we
02:41 - actually saw a huge number of students
02:43 - and teachers that we reached through our
02:45 - efforts with a high degree of
02:46 - satisfaction and some really interesting
02:49 - findings around effectiveness cost per
02:52 - teacher cost per student and
02:55 - scale and reach so i really encourage
02:57 - you if you haven't had a chance to take
02:58 - a look to go to code.org about flash
03:01 - evaluation and take a look at our
03:03 - results and then give us feedback um
03:05 - where are we doing well where can we
03:07 - improve
03:08 - we really value the community and we
03:10 - value your input
03:13 - and then also just to say thank you to
03:14 - all of you who are out there teaching cs
03:16 - fundamentals every day who are using
03:18 - courses one through four leading
03:19 - unplugged lessons stretching yourself
03:21 - outside of your comfort zone we really
03:24 - appreciate the teachers that are using
03:26 - our curriculum and giving us feedback
03:27 - and helping us to make it better
03:30 - what i'm going to do now is introduce
03:31 - you to a phenomenal teacher that we're
03:33 - very excited to have tonight maria
03:35 - lippman maria is a code.org k5 affiliate
03:38 - from andover massachusetts and she's
03:40 - also a high school teacher maria is
03:42 - going to share with you some really
03:43 - interesting ideas for how you can
03:44 - stretch your computer science curriculum
03:47 - in your
03:48 - grades three through five curriculum so
03:50 - marie i'll hand it over to you
03:53 - thank you melissa hi everybody
03:55 - uh i'm maria again as melissa said i
03:58 - teach
03:59 - math and computer science in high school
04:02 - it's phillips academy and dover
04:03 - massachusetts
04:05 - and
04:07 - as a kodoturg affiliate and also a
04:09 - grandma of a couple of kids who are
04:12 - grandkids a six-year-old and
04:13 - nine-year-old
04:16 - my husband and i started writing uh
04:18 - computer contest questions for the
04:21 - little kids
04:22 - and the continental math mathematics
04:25 - league is organization
04:27 - that uh has a contest in mathematics and
04:30 - other subjects for over 35 years
04:34 - and they heard all the
04:37 - um information coming from everywhere
04:39 - with code.org
04:42 - and heidi uh
04:44 - explaining and
04:45 - promoting computer science and they
04:47 - asked my husband and me to write the
04:50 - contest
04:51 - for the young kids for computer science
04:54 - um and so that's what we're doing and i
04:58 - wanted to share with you these contest
05:00 - questions
05:01 - uh and uh so you will see and then you
05:04 - will see them they're also available
05:07 - for you to
05:09 - use with your
05:11 - elementary school kids
05:13 - let's go to the next slide
05:17 - so
05:18 - the contest itself is uh consists of
05:21 - three meets one in january one in
05:23 - february one in march
05:25 - each it has six questions
05:28 - for 30 minutes
05:30 - and it's completely unplugged
05:32 - students don't need a computer to do
05:34 - their problems
05:36 - uh and what is interesting that we tried
05:38 - it with students who are
05:41 - have no programming experience and
05:42 - they're able to do it
05:44 - uh but of course students who've done
05:47 - some puzzles or code.work puzzles from
05:49 - studio.org
05:51 - they are
05:52 - doing uh
05:54 - better because they uh already seen
05:56 - different kinds of puzzles and uh they
05:59 - can see patterns better
06:01 - so the teachers receive these questions
06:03 - and answers and solutions are in advance
06:08 - and administered contests close to the
06:10 - specified time one in january one in
06:12 - february and one in march
06:15 - let's take a look at the next
06:17 - slide
06:19 - and the
06:20 - teacher grades the work because they
06:22 - have all the answers and they send the
06:25 - top six answers to
06:27 - uh cml
06:29 - uh and then cml determines uh the best
06:33 - uh the winners for individual meets and
06:36 - also for the whole contest
06:39 - what is interesting is that
06:41 - uh
06:42 - a teacher like you can have all students
06:45 - in grades three to five to participate
06:47 - and have these interesting questions
06:50 - and then uh just take six of these
06:52 - scores that are the best and send those
06:55 - scores
06:57 - and you can mix the a team could be
06:59 - consists of
07:00 - third fourth and fifth graders together
07:04 - but if you have a separate teams one for
07:06 - third graders one for fourth graders one
07:08 - for fifth graders then the third graders
07:11 - don't need to solve as many puzzles
07:13 - and to to consider it
07:16 - you know because they'll be graded
07:17 - against other third graders
07:19 - and they will do better
07:22 - and uh
07:23 - cml sends medals and they have send
07:26 - certificates and it's always very lovely
07:28 - at the end kids are many kids are
07:31 - rewarded
07:32 - for the experience
07:34 - but uh yeah
07:36 - and then uh the the best teams uh have
07:39 - regional and
07:41 - recognition of national recognition
07:44 - yeah let's take a look at the next slide
07:49 - so this
07:50 - question is
07:51 - written in python programming language
07:54 - and even though
07:56 - students don't know the language but
07:59 - when they read it the description
08:02 - then they can figure it out it basically
08:05 - says
08:06 - that
08:07 - take
08:08 - a number from the user
08:10 - and then uh if that number greater than
08:13 - five then print the number that's less
08:15 - than
08:17 - five less than it
08:18 - and otherwise print one and so it's the
08:22 - explanation is given and kids with a
08:25 - can figure that one out that's one
08:27 - example let's take a look at the next
08:30 - the next slide so this one's uh this
08:33 - slider look as you see if you did uh
08:36 - some
08:37 - kudo torque puzzles especially graph
08:39 - paper programming you see
08:43 - or some online puzzles amaze these are
08:46 - kind of similar this one has a it's
08:48 - called pink painter and she's a
08:50 - programmer robot and she moves up down
08:54 - left right and she can paint and so kit
08:57 - as you see in a program that is written
08:59 - there are a couple of question marks and
09:02 - so students starting at the start
09:04 - position have to figure out if they go
09:07 - up and then to the right
09:09 - then they
09:10 - paint
09:11 - and then at some point you see their
09:12 - question marks and they need to figure
09:14 - out what
09:16 - operation goes there what command goes
09:18 - there
09:19 - so it is accessible of course for them
09:22 - take a look at another kind of problem
09:24 - the next one
09:26 - so these problems are interesting um as
09:30 - you see right now it's kind of clear
09:32 - that
09:33 - all
09:34 - cards on the left of the divider
09:37 - have some feature that cards on to the
09:40 - right of the divider don't have
09:44 - and
09:46 - then on the bottom we have five pictures
09:49 - and kids need to figure out which ones
09:51 - of which three
09:52 - out of those on the bottom belong on the
09:56 - left side
09:58 - now you might think that that it's very
10:00 - straightforward
10:02 - because all the left
10:04 - uh pictures have a
10:07 - darkened triangle and the ones on the
10:09 - right don't have it but actually these
10:11 - slides were not reproduced exactly
10:14 - uh and when you go to the
10:17 - the the slides that from pdf file you
10:20 - would see there were also like
10:23 - circles and they were
10:25 - there were more on this picture so it
10:27 - was harder to pick up the pattern
10:29 - but even this one is very nice for the
10:32 - beginner kids to figure out
10:34 - what's going on
10:36 - yep let's take a look at the next
10:40 - slide
10:41 - so um
10:42 - these 18 contest questions there's six
10:46 - in each meets six times three is
10:48 - eighteen
10:49 - are
10:50 - for last year are located as you see
10:52 - where they are at skyler.com
10:56 - uh and uh you can it's they're good to
10:59 - use
11:00 - with kids who for example finish some of
11:03 - your puzzles
11:05 - you don't want
11:07 - them to move ahead in a different stage
11:10 - because you want to do an unplugged
11:11 - lesson
11:12 - so you can give them these enrichment
11:14 - problems
11:16 - and have them solve those
11:18 - uh
11:20 - and and then together go with the rest
11:23 - of the kids to the next uh stage or next
11:25 - unplugged activity with you
11:28 - and here's a link to register for the
11:30 - upcoming year
11:32 - uh and uh
11:34 - yeah
11:35 - so there are two two places to register
11:38 - either directly skylea.com or uh
11:42 - at the
11:44 - dml
11:45 - continental math league
11:47 - yep and for the next puzzle you see i
11:49 - wanted to mention for the next slide
11:52 - we see that born with problems the one
11:54 - with the patterns on the left and on the
11:56 - right this is really the whole series of
11:59 - questions with all kids like
12:03 - and they are of increasing difficulty
12:06 - uh mikhail wangardt was a russian
12:08 - computer scientist and one of the
12:11 - pioneers of
12:12 - ai and machine learning and he was
12:15 - trying to get computer to recognize the
12:17 - patterns
12:19 - and so he
12:20 - started with many of these puzzles and
12:22 - then they were so popular that many
12:25 - other people started writing their own
12:27 - puzzles
12:28 - and people keep adding new puzzles
12:31 - and on the next slide you will see
12:35 - that let's take a look this is uh the
12:37 - first slide that is the first blunder
12:39 - problem
12:40 - and i tried it with my granddaughter who
12:43 - was four
12:44 - and she figured it out pretty quickly
12:48 - and of course we have our students in
12:49 - kindergarten
12:51 - and then the second puzzle was harder
12:53 - and third puzzle harder but they start
12:55 - very nicely very simply
12:59 - and
13:01 - yeah
13:02 - now let's take a look at the next
13:05 - slide in the next slide it says that
13:08 - there's an index of these problems there
13:10 - are almost 300 problems
13:12 - and they will compiled and one after
13:15 - another and you can solve them on a
13:16 - computer and also on an ipad and you can
13:19 - very nicely slide from one to the next
13:22 - the kid with the kids
13:24 - and also you can design your own uh
13:27 - blonder problems as well
13:28 - and with gary and i design one for this
13:33 - year for the upcoming year out of three
13:36 - contests one of them will again have a
13:39 - blunder problem
13:41 - uh yes i think that's pretty much it
13:43 - let's just see i think that's
13:45 - uh just the last thing that's my email
13:48 - if you'd like to email me and uh
13:53 - to answer any questions
13:54 - about either one good problems or about
13:58 - the continental matly contest
14:00 - so if you have questions
14:03 - yeah
14:04 - thank you
14:05 - thank you so much maria it's wonderful
14:07 - to see these ideas for how to push our
14:09 - students um further beyond these
14:12 - fundamentals if you have questions for
14:14 - maria please do put them in the chat pod
14:16 - maria do you know how to um look and see
14:18 - if there are questions there for you
14:20 - um and then after you're watching this
14:22 - video later on and i have questions from
14:23 - maria i'm sure she'd love to hear from
14:25 - you but then
14:26 - pd.co.org
14:28 - next i'm going to hand it over to kiki
14:29 - who's going to continue talking a little
14:31 - bit about how you can differentiate the
14:32 - cs fundamentals curriculum for your
14:34 - students kiki
14:38 - yeah differentiation is a big deal in
14:40 - the classroom and
14:42 - especially in computer science because
14:45 - we get to this place where
14:47 - we
14:48 - uh
14:50 - expect to be in lockstep with curriculum
14:53 - like every kid should be at every place
14:55 - at the same time but when you're doing
14:57 - computer science especially when you're
14:59 - doing computer science online
15:02 - the self-guided tutorial nature allows
15:05 - you to let go of that a little bit so we
15:08 - could go to the next slide
15:11 - and it might be there it just isn't
15:13 - refreshing for me there we go
15:15 - so
15:16 - there are some things that you can do
15:18 - when you're using cs fundamentals to
15:20 - give each of the children in your class
15:23 - a really
15:24 - uh good experience and one of those
15:26 - things is not to hold them back a puzzle
15:29 - at a time so even just allowing a few
15:33 - puzzles worth of flexibility is good uh
15:36 - like if you're walking down the street
15:37 - with a youngster you might be able to
15:39 - say okay you can run ahead but you got
15:40 - to stop at the street stop the street
15:42 - and wait for us to get back to you
15:44 - that's a good technique to use for some
15:46 - of your class if you have kids that want
15:48 - to run ahead
15:49 - let them to a certain extent and then
15:52 - say when you get to this puzzle
15:54 - i want you to start walking around the
15:56 - classroom and seeing if anyone needs
15:58 - help or i want you to start being an
16:00 - advisor in some way so that you can help
16:02 - the other kids that haven't got it yet
16:05 - similarly
16:07 - there will be kids that are further back
16:10 - than the other students and what you
16:12 - have to do as a teacher is figure out
16:15 - how far back you're comfortable letting
16:17 - them be
16:18 - before you send someone over to help
16:20 - them now i'm not necessarily talking
16:22 - about going over and helping them
16:24 - yourself
16:25 - because a student gets more out of
16:27 - figuring out another problem with
16:29 - another student than they do having the
16:31 - teacher go over and solve it for them
16:34 - so
16:35 - you can you can start to get this gap in
16:37 - puzzles that's going to widen and
16:39 - shorten depending on how difficult
16:41 - things are
16:43 - also if you look here uh you actually
16:46 - can't see my screen because you're
16:47 - looking at the slides but if you look at
16:48 - the image at the top
16:50 - you'll see that for every concept we
16:52 - have multiple stages so we have the
16:55 - unplugged lesson that's getting loopy
16:57 - and then we have three following stages
17:00 - of
17:01 - loops
17:02 - now it is possible that you're going to
17:05 - go through all three stages of loops
17:07 - with your class but if you have a
17:09 - student that's really struggling
17:11 - rather than pull the rug out from under
17:13 - them and say okay well you didn't finish
17:16 - this this one let's move on to the next
17:17 - one
17:18 - it's possible to let those struggling
17:20 - students continue with
17:23 - may's loops
17:24 - until you're confident that they get it
17:27 - even if the rest of the class has moved
17:29 - on to artist loops
17:31 - and as a teacher if you don't have time
17:33 - to do all those stages of loops
17:35 - then you can just pick a couple
17:38 - and do those really well versus trying
17:40 - to rush through all of them
17:42 - now you might notice that at the end
17:44 - there are a few levels that are circled
17:46 - in blue and those are assessment levels
17:49 - so even if
17:51 - you only get halfway through the rest of
17:53 - the puzzles you can then skip over to
17:56 - the assessment levels and make sure that
17:58 - the students are getting it
18:01 - some kids may not finish a stage and
18:04 - that's fine there are several puzzles at
18:06 - the end of every stage that are meant to
18:08 - just stretch them and challenge their
18:11 - abilities so if they only get towards
18:13 - get past the stuff that they need to get
18:16 - through
18:16 - to understand the concept that's
18:19 - perfectly okay
18:21 - and then another option is to have
18:23 - some pre-approved things for students to
18:26 - do
18:27 - if they get to the end so if your
18:29 - students have gone all the way through
18:30 - the stage you've got five students who
18:32 - are done and there's 20 minutes of class
18:34 - left
18:35 - and you need to figure out something to
18:36 - do with them they've already gone around
18:38 - and walked and tried to help their their
18:40 - friends
18:41 - another thing that you can do is have
18:43 - links
18:45 - that you know ahead of time it's okay
18:46 - for them to go to and whether that is a
18:49 - play lab link so something still within
18:52 - cs fundamentals where they can spread
18:55 - their wings and try some creativity and
18:57 - mess with things that they might not
18:59 - know yet but they'll be able to learn by
19:01 - doing
19:03 - that's perfectly cool or send them over
19:05 - to code.org
19:07 - learn
19:07 - which is where a bunch of the big hits
19:09 - from the hour of code end up so the
19:12 - programs that have had huge success in
19:15 - roping kids in as far as entertainment
19:17 - level
19:18 - we'll put those over in code.org learn
19:21 - and the kids can go through and play
19:23 - with some other types of puzzles and
19:27 - by doing that you allow this flexibility
19:29 - and this uh engagement where the
19:32 - struggling kids don't feel like oh i'm
19:34 - holding everybody up and they're gonna
19:36 - just fast forward me because i can't get
19:38 - it and everybody needs to move along so
19:40 - we get rid of that frustration and then
19:42 - on the other side we get rid of the
19:44 - frustration of oh man i'm already done
19:46 - i'm so bored what do i do
19:49 - and so now you can keep your whole class
19:51 - happy instead of just teaching to that
19:54 - middle third
19:57 - with
19:58 - that in mind um talking about some
20:01 - special puzzles i'm going to go ahead
20:03 - and go to the next slide and give you
20:05 - all a preview of something
20:07 - so this is something that we just
20:09 - decided to put out just for you who are
20:11 - watching this we're not going to be
20:13 - advertising it widely because it's not
20:15 - something that's going to stick around
20:16 - it's not going to become part of our
20:17 - curriculum it's just something special
20:19 - for you for taking your time to to come
20:22 - here and watch the webinar so
20:25 - uh right this is a screenshot of one of
20:27 - our halloween puzzles
20:30 - and uh it's not quite live yet it's
20:33 - still being tested it'll be released
20:35 - tomorrow or the day after and you'll be
20:37 - able to find it at studio.co.org
20:41 - s
20:43 - special series and there are three
20:46 - puzzles in this series and i'm going to
20:48 - quickly take you through them so let me
20:50 - share my screen
20:53 - and let's see if it will let me share
20:55 - firefox here
20:57 - so i'm going to assume you can see this
20:59 - and i'm going to proceed forward as if
21:02 - you can see this
21:03 - uh so here is
21:05 - the special level that i had the screen
21:07 - shot of this is actually the second
21:09 - level
21:10 - and
21:12 - oh i see a chat message so i just want
21:14 - to make sure oh but if i switch over
21:15 - there you'll be able to see that too
21:18 - okay so if so if there is a problem
21:19 - please send me your microphone and go
21:21 - ahead and tell me but
21:23 - you're great we can see you everything's
21:24 - awesome
21:25 - okay thank you
21:27 - so here we go we've got this and
21:30 - this is just asking you to fill up the
21:33 - sky with stars
21:35 - and here we've actually done the
21:36 - majority of the coding for you there's
21:38 - just a few random integer blocks to drop
21:40 - around
21:41 - now you'll notice we don't go through
21:44 - and tell you what all of these are we
21:46 - don't say hey here's how you use this
21:49 - block this is all meant to be
21:51 - self-exploration and it's all meant to
21:53 - be just a good time to play and and
21:55 - doodle around here so we have stars
21:59 - let's put between five and seven points
22:02 - on our star
22:03 - let's make them between 50 and 75 pixels
22:07 - long
22:08 - and then we'll jump forward between oh
22:11 - you know what that might be big let's
22:12 - put that in here how far we jump between
22:14 - each star
22:16 - and then the length of our star and
22:18 - you'll see that it says to repeat this
22:20 - zero times which isn't going to make a
22:21 - very interesting drawing
22:23 - so we can start by repeating it three
22:25 - times and see what happens and
22:28 - we can run that and we get a nice little
22:31 - it's kind of almost drawing a star
22:33 - within a star but it doesn't really do
22:35 - very much
22:36 - so then what happens if we do
22:41 - thanks and then your kids can share
22:43 - these and put them in their
22:46 - their gallery just the same as they can
22:48 - with any other artist drawing
22:50 - so now i'm going to move through and i'm
22:52 - going to do 20 times repeat
22:55 - and it takes a little while to draw
22:56 - stars so i probably won't let it keep
22:58 - going
22:59 - but you'll see that you get a much more
23:01 - interesting drawing by doing this more
23:03 - times and the kids can play with
23:05 - anything they can mess with any of the
23:07 - parameter numbers
23:08 - and it's all free play so there's not
23:11 - going to be a right answer and a wrong
23:12 - answer they can just play with it and
23:14 - whatever they end up with they end up
23:16 - with
23:18 - the first one is a ghost
23:21 - so we have
23:23 - just a very nice simple warm up here
23:26 - and you'll notice we give no starting
23:28 - code so they have to figure out how to
23:30 - make the eyes of the ghost
23:32 - and we give them all of the functions
23:35 - that they need to do that and more so if
23:37 - they wanted to do eyes on the ghost and
23:38 - then give it a pinwheel mouth they're
23:41 - more than welcome to do that
23:43 - and then we end up with an artist level
23:45 - and this just says program the artist to
23:47 - design a face for your jack-o-lantern so
23:50 - you can go through and draw a
23:52 - jack-o-lantern any way you want and then
23:54 - just save it to your gallery share it
23:56 - with your friends let your friends remix
23:58 - it and do more things with it and it's
24:00 - just kind of a fun
24:03 - a
24:04 - way to get your students re-energized as
24:07 - far as artist goes
24:10 - so now i'm gonna
24:11 - try and pop back over here
24:14 - and stop sharing my screen
24:18 - and
24:20 - there we go
24:29 - sorry took me a minute to get myself off
24:31 - view there because i was
24:32 - switching screens around but kiki's
24:34 - super cool so much fun i know that a lot
24:37 - of folks were excited in the chat pod
24:38 - when they saw these levels um
24:42 - again they're not live right now but
24:44 - they will be live tomorrow or the next
24:46 - day and if you follow a teach code on
24:48 - twitter we'll announce when it's live or
24:50 - you can check out our blog the url is uh
24:52 - behind me but it's teacherblog.cod.org
24:55 - um and if you like these let us know um
24:57 - tell us on twitter tell us on the
24:58 - teacher blog you know we have lots of
25:01 - creative ideas and if you use things
25:02 - like this in your classroom we'd love to
25:04 - hear it
25:05 - um great so thanks a lot kiki and any
25:07 - questions or comments or feedback for
25:09 - kiki please feel free to leave in the
25:12 - chat pod i'm just going to move forward
25:14 - with some program updates from laura um
25:17 - and then we will have some time for
25:18 - discussion at the end
25:20 - so um
25:22 - on the theme of differentiation and how
25:24 - you can push yourself and push your
25:26 - students i'm just a reminder that the
25:28 - hour of code is coming we've had almost
25:30 - 50 000 educators around the world sign
25:33 - up this year already to host an hour of
25:36 - code and many of you probably have done
25:39 - hour of code in past years or signed up
25:42 - for this year and this is just a really
25:44 - exciting way to
25:46 - build awareness in your community about
25:48 - computer science get kids excited get
25:50 - teachers and parents and community
25:52 - members excited so really um you know
25:56 - eager to see what you all come up with
25:58 - this year and how you plan your hours of
26:01 - code this year
26:03 - i'm going to just talk you through a
26:04 - couple details that are specific to this
26:06 - year and if you have questions about our
26:08 - code you can definitely ask us on
26:10 - twitter or you can go to hourofco.com
26:13 - and we can answer them there
26:15 - so we've just announced this week that
26:17 - every educator who signs up to host an
26:20 - hour of code
26:21 - is going to receive a 10 gift card to
26:24 - amazon.com itunes or the windows store
26:26 - as a thank you gift so all you have to
26:28 - do is go to hourofcode.com sign up say
26:30 - you're going to host an hour of code and
26:32 - you'll get a 10 thank you gift
26:34 - i hope that everybody has a chance to do
26:36 - that
26:37 - keep in mind also out of everyone that
26:39 - signs up and every organizer that says
26:41 - they're going to host an event
26:43 - one school in each u.s state including
26:46 - washington d.c will win 10 000 worth of
26:49 - technology for their school so these
26:51 - prizes are you know icing on the cake
26:53 - the hour of code is fun enough on its
26:55 - own but it's also nice to know that
26:57 - there's this incentive there
26:59 - um also i'm really excited this year to
27:01 - share with you guys we've been working
27:03 - really hard to develop some new teacher
27:05 - resources
27:06 - we know that there are a lot of folks
27:08 - who've done the hour of code now for two
27:10 - or three years and they're ready to step
27:11 - up their game and take it to another
27:13 - level
27:14 - and we wanted to make that easier for
27:16 - you this year so we've updated our hour
27:18 - of code teacher page with six easy steps
27:20 - to get started so if you or someone in
27:22 - your building has never done it before
27:24 - and you want to make it easy for them
27:26 - the how-to guide should be much clearer
27:28 - now we also have a template lesson plan
27:30 - that you can use to create your own hour
27:32 - of code lesson plan and we're actually
27:34 - collecting those this year so if you
27:36 - develop a lesson plan that works in the
27:38 - english class or geography class for
27:40 - hour of code share those and we'd love
27:42 - to be able to share them with their
27:43 - network
27:44 - we have a really cool slide deck that
27:46 - has some best practices from past hour
27:48 - of code teachers you can find that on
27:50 - the teacher resources page um and we're
27:52 - hosting two webinars coming up one in
27:54 - november and one in december a similar
27:56 - format to this kind of a webinar but
27:59 - we'll be presenting the first one's
28:00 - called educator's guide to the hour of
28:02 - code and that will explain how you can
28:04 - get up and running with the hour of code
28:05 - and give you some ideas for what you can
28:07 - do in your classroom um so we'd love to
28:10 - see you on that one the the webinar that
28:11 - we're doing in december is called sneak
28:14 - peek 2015 tutorials and that's when
28:16 - we'll be talking to you about our new
28:17 - and exciting tutorials that we're
28:19 - developing for this year those are going
28:21 - to be available on november 11th
28:24 - so that's them in my hour of code
28:25 - announcements and i wanted to just open
28:27 - it up for questions now before you move
28:29 - on let me check into the chat pod if
28:31 - anyone has a question or comment or
28:34 - something that you would like to share
28:36 - please do put in the chat pod now or you
28:38 - can unmute yourself and share with the
28:40 - group
28:42 - let's see so kim asks is it too late to
28:45 - still register for the hour of code ten
28:46 - thousand dollar prize i don't believe so
28:48 - i think that if you are signed up as an
28:50 - organizer i think you're registered um
28:52 - but i will check it hour of code.com and
28:54 - i'll double check on the deadline for
28:56 - you as well kim i'm pretty sure it's
28:58 - still open for registration
29:02 - are there any other um
29:03 - questions or feedback today our theme
29:06 - was really around differentiation and
29:08 - how you
29:08 - keep the cs fundamentals curriculum
29:11 - exciting for your students so we'd love
29:12 - to hear
29:13 - any strategies you all have for that
29:27 - of course if you have any feedback or
29:28 - ideas we always love to hear it on
29:30 - twitter you can tweet at us at teach
29:32 - code
29:33 - um keep in mind that we're going to be
29:34 - having these monthly meetings on the
29:36 - third tuesday of every month so our next
29:38 - meeting will be in november 17th
29:40 - and um kiki and i will be here along
29:42 - with laura and another special guest to
29:44 - share with you great strategies that you
29:46 - can use in your k5 classroom keep in
29:48 - mind that all of our events are listed
29:50 - at code.org educate slash events and you
29:52 - can register for those that interest you
29:54 - so that you can receive a reminder
29:56 - and also a recording if you missed the
29:58 - event
29:59 - and then also keep in mind as i said we
30:01 - would love to continue this conversation
30:03 - about differentiation and hour of code
30:05 - on twitter
30:06 - you can tweet us at teach code you can
30:08 - also um take a look at our tumblr blog
30:11 - teacherblog.cod.org that's where we're
30:12 - going to publish those halloween puzzles
30:14 - tomorrow if you're looking for them and
30:16 - we also have forums.code.org which is
30:18 - our online professional learning
30:19 - community where you can post questions
30:21 - and get answers from other teachers in
30:22 - the community
30:24 - um so that's all we have for you today i
30:26 - want to thank you all so much for
30:27 - joining us i'm going to be posting this

30:42 - thanks kiki thanks mariah

Cleaned transcript:

can y'all hear me there on the line i think i've muted everyone actually let's see i'll unmute you can use that a thumbs up you can hear me yeah yeah i'll get you thank you so welcome everybody my name is melissa jones and i'm a community manager here at code.org i'm excited to welcome you to our october monthly meeting for the cs fundamentals curriculum which is our k5 curriculum courses one through four um tonight laura klein unfortunately couldn't join us she had a conflicting meeting but i'm very excited to um share her updates with you um we're also joined by kiki protzman our program manager for cs fundamentals and our special guest maria litvin who is a high school teacher and a k5 affiliate in massachusetts maria has some really exciting and challenging um problems to share with us i think you guys will all be interested in so our goals tonight um first and foremost as usual the goal of these calls is to connect as a community and to help give you information and an opportunity to um foreign bond and to meet other teachers who are teaching the same curriculum as you tonight we're going to explore some opportunities to challenge your k5 students um that maria is going to be sharing with us and then later kiki is going to be discussing strategies for modifying the cs fundamentals curriculum to meet your student needs whether your students are advanced if your students are struggling she's going to help you figure out how to do that we'll have some time at the end for questions concerns and feedback for the group and some exciting announcements about our code so just to get started if this is your first time using blue jeans please be aware that we can um you can see us and you can hear us but we can't see you unless you have your microphone and your um webcam on um so sit back relax enjoy the show if you do have something that you'd like to add there's a chat window right above you that you can go ahead and click on and that's a great place to introduce yourself to put a question for the presenter feedback share a link anything that you'd like to share the chat has a great place to do that then later when we have discussion time you can activate your microphone on your webcam by clicking just below your picture and then we will be able to hear you and see you and when we get to that point of the agenda i will explain more about how to do that before we dive into tonight's agenda i just wanted to call your attention to the fact that code.org recently real uh released rather the results of our 20142015 program evaluation um so for the past year actually longer than a year since the beginning of code.org we've been studying our impact and studying the results of our programs and over the last year 2014 to 2015 we actually saw a huge number of students and teachers that we reached through our efforts with a high degree of satisfaction and some really interesting findings around effectiveness cost per teacher cost per student and scale and reach so i really encourage you if you haven't had a chance to take a look to go to code.org about flash evaluation and take a look at our results and then give us feedback um where are we doing well where can we improve we really value the community and we value your input and then also just to say thank you to all of you who are out there teaching cs fundamentals every day who are using courses one through four leading unplugged lessons stretching yourself outside of your comfort zone we really appreciate the teachers that are using our curriculum and giving us feedback and helping us to make it better what i'm going to do now is introduce you to a phenomenal teacher that we're very excited to have tonight maria lippman maria is a code.org k5 affiliate from andover massachusetts and she's also a high school teacher maria is going to share with you some really interesting ideas for how you can stretch your computer science curriculum in your grades three through five curriculum so marie i'll hand it over to you thank you melissa hi everybody uh i'm maria again as melissa said i teach math and computer science in high school it's phillips academy and dover massachusetts and as a kodoturg affiliate and also a grandma of a couple of kids who are grandkids a sixyearold and nineyearold my husband and i started writing uh computer contest questions for the little kids and the continental math mathematics league is organization that uh has a contest in mathematics and other subjects for over 35 years and they heard all the um information coming from everywhere with code.org and heidi uh explaining and promoting computer science and they asked my husband and me to write the contest for the young kids for computer science um and so that's what we're doing and i wanted to share with you these contest questions uh and uh so you will see and then you will see them they're also available for you to use with your elementary school kids let's go to the next slide so the contest itself is uh consists of three meets one in january one in february one in march each it has six questions for 30 minutes and it's completely unplugged students don't need a computer to do their problems uh and what is interesting that we tried it with students who are have no programming experience and they're able to do it uh but of course students who've done some puzzles or code.work puzzles from studio.org they are doing uh better because they uh already seen different kinds of puzzles and uh they can see patterns better so the teachers receive these questions and answers and solutions are in advance and administered contests close to the specified time one in january one in february and one in march let's take a look at the next slide and the teacher grades the work because they have all the answers and they send the top six answers to uh cml uh and then cml determines uh the best uh the winners for individual meets and also for the whole contest what is interesting is that uh a teacher like you can have all students in grades three to five to participate and have these interesting questions and then uh just take six of these scores that are the best and send those scores and you can mix the a team could be consists of third fourth and fifth graders together but if you have a separate teams one for third graders one for fourth graders one for fifth graders then the third graders don't need to solve as many puzzles and to to consider it you know because they'll be graded against other third graders and they will do better and uh cml sends medals and they have send certificates and it's always very lovely at the end kids are many kids are rewarded for the experience but uh yeah and then uh the the best teams uh have regional and recognition of national recognition yeah let's take a look at the next slide so this question is written in python programming language and even though students don't know the language but when they read it the description then they can figure it out it basically says that take a number from the user and then uh if that number greater than five then print the number that's less than five less than it and otherwise print one and so it's the explanation is given and kids with a can figure that one out that's one example let's take a look at the next the next slide so this one's uh this slider look as you see if you did uh some kudo torque puzzles especially graph paper programming you see or some online puzzles amaze these are kind of similar this one has a it's called pink painter and she's a programmer robot and she moves up down left right and she can paint and so kit as you see in a program that is written there are a couple of question marks and so students starting at the start position have to figure out if they go up and then to the right then they paint and then at some point you see their question marks and they need to figure out what operation goes there what command goes there so it is accessible of course for them take a look at another kind of problem the next one so these problems are interesting um as you see right now it's kind of clear that all cards on the left of the divider have some feature that cards on to the right of the divider don't have and then on the bottom we have five pictures and kids need to figure out which ones of which three out of those on the bottom belong on the left side now you might think that that it's very straightforward because all the left uh pictures have a darkened triangle and the ones on the right don't have it but actually these slides were not reproduced exactly uh and when you go to the the the slides that from pdf file you would see there were also like circles and they were there were more on this picture so it was harder to pick up the pattern but even this one is very nice for the beginner kids to figure out what's going on yep let's take a look at the next slide so um these 18 contest questions there's six in each meets six times three is eighteen are for last year are located as you see where they are at skyler.com uh and uh you can it's they're good to use with kids who for example finish some of your puzzles you don't want them to move ahead in a different stage because you want to do an unplugged lesson so you can give them these enrichment problems and have them solve those uh and and then together go with the rest of the kids to the next uh stage or next unplugged activity with you and here's a link to register for the upcoming year uh and uh yeah so there are two two places to register either directly skylea.com or uh at the dml continental math league yep and for the next puzzle you see i wanted to mention for the next slide we see that born with problems the one with the patterns on the left and on the right this is really the whole series of questions with all kids like and they are of increasing difficulty uh mikhail wangardt was a russian computer scientist and one of the pioneers of ai and machine learning and he was trying to get computer to recognize the patterns and so he started with many of these puzzles and then they were so popular that many other people started writing their own puzzles and people keep adding new puzzles and on the next slide you will see that let's take a look this is uh the first slide that is the first blunder problem and i tried it with my granddaughter who was four and she figured it out pretty quickly and of course we have our students in kindergarten and then the second puzzle was harder and third puzzle harder but they start very nicely very simply and yeah now let's take a look at the next slide in the next slide it says that there's an index of these problems there are almost 300 problems and they will compiled and one after another and you can solve them on a computer and also on an ipad and you can very nicely slide from one to the next the kid with the kids and also you can design your own uh blonder problems as well and with gary and i design one for this year for the upcoming year out of three contests one of them will again have a blunder problem uh yes i think that's pretty much it let's just see i think that's uh just the last thing that's my email if you'd like to email me and uh to answer any questions about either one good problems or about the continental matly contest so if you have questions yeah thank you thank you so much maria it's wonderful to see these ideas for how to push our students um further beyond these fundamentals if you have questions for maria please do put them in the chat pod maria do you know how to um look and see if there are questions there for you um and then after you're watching this video later on and i have questions from maria i'm sure she'd love to hear from you but then pd.co.org next i'm going to hand it over to kiki who's going to continue talking a little bit about how you can differentiate the cs fundamentals curriculum for your students kiki yeah differentiation is a big deal in the classroom and especially in computer science because we get to this place where we uh expect to be in lockstep with curriculum like every kid should be at every place at the same time but when you're doing computer science especially when you're doing computer science online the selfguided tutorial nature allows you to let go of that a little bit so we could go to the next slide and it might be there it just isn't refreshing for me there we go so there are some things that you can do when you're using cs fundamentals to give each of the children in your class a really uh good experience and one of those things is not to hold them back a puzzle at a time so even just allowing a few puzzles worth of flexibility is good uh like if you're walking down the street with a youngster you might be able to say okay you can run ahead but you got to stop at the street stop the street and wait for us to get back to you that's a good technique to use for some of your class if you have kids that want to run ahead let them to a certain extent and then say when you get to this puzzle i want you to start walking around the classroom and seeing if anyone needs help or i want you to start being an advisor in some way so that you can help the other kids that haven't got it yet similarly there will be kids that are further back than the other students and what you have to do as a teacher is figure out how far back you're comfortable letting them be before you send someone over to help them now i'm not necessarily talking about going over and helping them yourself because a student gets more out of figuring out another problem with another student than they do having the teacher go over and solve it for them so you can you can start to get this gap in puzzles that's going to widen and shorten depending on how difficult things are also if you look here uh you actually can't see my screen because you're looking at the slides but if you look at the image at the top you'll see that for every concept we have multiple stages so we have the unplugged lesson that's getting loopy and then we have three following stages of loops now it is possible that you're going to go through all three stages of loops with your class but if you have a student that's really struggling rather than pull the rug out from under them and say okay well you didn't finish this this one let's move on to the next one it's possible to let those struggling students continue with may's loops until you're confident that they get it even if the rest of the class has moved on to artist loops and as a teacher if you don't have time to do all those stages of loops then you can just pick a couple and do those really well versus trying to rush through all of them now you might notice that at the end there are a few levels that are circled in blue and those are assessment levels so even if you only get halfway through the rest of the puzzles you can then skip over to the assessment levels and make sure that the students are getting it some kids may not finish a stage and that's fine there are several puzzles at the end of every stage that are meant to just stretch them and challenge their abilities so if they only get towards get past the stuff that they need to get through to understand the concept that's perfectly okay and then another option is to have some preapproved things for students to do if they get to the end so if your students have gone all the way through the stage you've got five students who are done and there's 20 minutes of class left and you need to figure out something to do with them they've already gone around and walked and tried to help their their friends another thing that you can do is have links that you know ahead of time it's okay for them to go to and whether that is a play lab link so something still within cs fundamentals where they can spread their wings and try some creativity and mess with things that they might not know yet but they'll be able to learn by doing that's perfectly cool or send them over to code.org learn which is where a bunch of the big hits from the hour of code end up so the programs that have had huge success in roping kids in as far as entertainment level we'll put those over in code.org learn and the kids can go through and play with some other types of puzzles and by doing that you allow this flexibility and this uh engagement where the struggling kids don't feel like oh i'm holding everybody up and they're gonna just fast forward me because i can't get it and everybody needs to move along so we get rid of that frustration and then on the other side we get rid of the frustration of oh man i'm already done i'm so bored what do i do and so now you can keep your whole class happy instead of just teaching to that middle third with that in mind um talking about some special puzzles i'm going to go ahead and go to the next slide and give you all a preview of something so this is something that we just decided to put out just for you who are watching this we're not going to be advertising it widely because it's not something that's going to stick around it's not going to become part of our curriculum it's just something special for you for taking your time to to come here and watch the webinar so uh right this is a screenshot of one of our halloween puzzles and uh it's not quite live yet it's still being tested it'll be released tomorrow or the day after and you'll be able to find it at studio.co.org s special series and there are three puzzles in this series and i'm going to quickly take you through them so let me share my screen and let's see if it will let me share firefox here so i'm going to assume you can see this and i'm going to proceed forward as if you can see this uh so here is the special level that i had the screen shot of this is actually the second level and oh i see a chat message so i just want to make sure oh but if i switch over there you'll be able to see that too okay so if so if there is a problem please send me your microphone and go ahead and tell me but you're great we can see you everything's awesome okay thank you so here we go we've got this and this is just asking you to fill up the sky with stars and here we've actually done the majority of the coding for you there's just a few random integer blocks to drop around now you'll notice we don't go through and tell you what all of these are we don't say hey here's how you use this block this is all meant to be selfexploration and it's all meant to be just a good time to play and and doodle around here so we have stars let's put between five and seven points on our star let's make them between 50 and 75 pixels long and then we'll jump forward between oh you know what that might be big let's put that in here how far we jump between each star and then the length of our star and you'll see that it says to repeat this zero times which isn't going to make a very interesting drawing so we can start by repeating it three times and see what happens and we can run that and we get a nice little it's kind of almost drawing a star within a star but it doesn't really do very much so then what happens if we do thanks and then your kids can share these and put them in their their gallery just the same as they can with any other artist drawing so now i'm going to move through and i'm going to do 20 times repeat and it takes a little while to draw stars so i probably won't let it keep going but you'll see that you get a much more interesting drawing by doing this more times and the kids can play with anything they can mess with any of the parameter numbers and it's all free play so there's not going to be a right answer and a wrong answer they can just play with it and whatever they end up with they end up with the first one is a ghost so we have just a very nice simple warm up here and you'll notice we give no starting code so they have to figure out how to make the eyes of the ghost and we give them all of the functions that they need to do that and more so if they wanted to do eyes on the ghost and then give it a pinwheel mouth they're more than welcome to do that and then we end up with an artist level and this just says program the artist to design a face for your jackolantern so you can go through and draw a jackolantern any way you want and then just save it to your gallery share it with your friends let your friends remix it and do more things with it and it's just kind of a fun a way to get your students reenergized as far as artist goes so now i'm gonna try and pop back over here and stop sharing my screen and there we go sorry took me a minute to get myself off view there because i was switching screens around but kiki's super cool so much fun i know that a lot of folks were excited in the chat pod when they saw these levels um again they're not live right now but they will be live tomorrow or the next day and if you follow a teach code on twitter we'll announce when it's live or you can check out our blog the url is uh behind me but it's teacherblog.cod.org um and if you like these let us know um tell us on twitter tell us on the teacher blog you know we have lots of creative ideas and if you use things like this in your classroom we'd love to hear it um great so thanks a lot kiki and any questions or comments or feedback for kiki please feel free to leave in the chat pod i'm just going to move forward with some program updates from laura um and then we will have some time for discussion at the end so um on the theme of differentiation and how you can push yourself and push your students i'm just a reminder that the hour of code is coming we've had almost 50 000 educators around the world sign up this year already to host an hour of code and many of you probably have done hour of code in past years or signed up for this year and this is just a really exciting way to build awareness in your community about computer science get kids excited get teachers and parents and community members excited so really um you know eager to see what you all come up with this year and how you plan your hours of code this year i'm going to just talk you through a couple details that are specific to this year and if you have questions about our code you can definitely ask us on twitter or you can go to hourofco.com and we can answer them there so we've just announced this week that every educator who signs up to host an hour of code is going to receive a 10 gift card to amazon.com itunes or the windows store as a thank you gift so all you have to do is go to hourofcode.com sign up say you're going to host an hour of code and you'll get a 10 thank you gift i hope that everybody has a chance to do that keep in mind also out of everyone that signs up and every organizer that says they're going to host an event one school in each u.s state including washington d.c will win 10 000 worth of technology for their school so these prizes are you know icing on the cake the hour of code is fun enough on its own but it's also nice to know that there's this incentive there um also i'm really excited this year to share with you guys we've been working really hard to develop some new teacher resources we know that there are a lot of folks who've done the hour of code now for two or three years and they're ready to step up their game and take it to another level and we wanted to make that easier for you this year so we've updated our hour of code teacher page with six easy steps to get started so if you or someone in your building has never done it before and you want to make it easy for them the howto guide should be much clearer now we also have a template lesson plan that you can use to create your own hour of code lesson plan and we're actually collecting those this year so if you develop a lesson plan that works in the english class or geography class for hour of code share those and we'd love to be able to share them with their network we have a really cool slide deck that has some best practices from past hour of code teachers you can find that on the teacher resources page um and we're hosting two webinars coming up one in november and one in december a similar format to this kind of a webinar but we'll be presenting the first one's called educator's guide to the hour of code and that will explain how you can get up and running with the hour of code and give you some ideas for what you can do in your classroom um so we'd love to see you on that one the the webinar that we're doing in december is called sneak peek 2015 tutorials and that's when we'll be talking to you about our new and exciting tutorials that we're developing for this year those are going to be available on november 11th so that's them in my hour of code announcements and i wanted to just open it up for questions now before you move on let me check into the chat pod if anyone has a question or comment or something that you would like to share please do put in the chat pod now or you can unmute yourself and share with the group let's see so kim asks is it too late to still register for the hour of code ten thousand dollar prize i don't believe so i think that if you are signed up as an organizer i think you're registered um but i will check it hour of code.com and i'll double check on the deadline for you as well kim i'm pretty sure it's still open for registration are there any other um questions or feedback today our theme was really around differentiation and how you keep the cs fundamentals curriculum exciting for your students so we'd love to hear any strategies you all have for that of course if you have any feedback or ideas we always love to hear it on twitter you can tweet at us at teach code um keep in mind that we're going to be having these monthly meetings on the third tuesday of every month so our next meeting will be in november 17th and um kiki and i will be here along with laura and another special guest to share with you great strategies that you can use in your k5 classroom keep in mind that all of our events are listed at code.org educate slash events and you can register for those that interest you so that you can receive a reminder and also a recording if you missed the event and then also keep in mind as i said we would love to continue this conversation about differentiation and hour of code on twitter you can tweet us at teach code you can also um take a look at our tumblr blog teacherblog.cod.org that's where we're going to publish those halloween puzzles tomorrow if you're looking for them and we also have forums.code.org which is our online professional learning community where you can post questions and get answers from other teachers in the community um so that's all we have for you today i want to thank you all so much for joining us i'm going to be posting this recording shortly for anybody who missed part of the presentation and we hope to see you all soon coming coming months if you have further questions feel free to add them to the chat pod or hit us up on twitter thank you bye everyone thanks kiki thanks mariah
