00:03 - hi I'm Anthony B I'm 16 and I'm a junior
00:08 - at phlips exitor Academy so I'm working
00:10 - with my dad on pencil code I did the um
00:13 - I did the whole blocks to texts and text
00:15 - to blocks component of it droplet helps
00:18 - you get from block programming to text
00:20 - programming and also to edit programs
00:22 - that other people have written in text
00:23 - in blocks if you're not ready for it cuz
00:25 - you can go the other way too the thing
00:26 - about programming is it's actually a
00:28 - community of people a community real
00:30 - people that have interesting ideas that
00:31 - are always making a lot of interesting
00:33 - things and when you learn programming
00:36 - when you learn the craft of programming
00:37 - you actually become part of that
00:38 - community so I think it's uh it's
00:40 - important to to see what other people
00:42 - are doing my advice is always that
00:45 - programming is primarily a creative
00:47 - prise that it's more like art than like
00:50 - math most of the things you do when
00:51 - you're just starting out are not really
00:53 - going to be solving problems they're
00:54 - just kind of for fun um and so you
00:56 - should just do the things that are for
00:58 - fun um and you'll learn things along the
01:03 - way
