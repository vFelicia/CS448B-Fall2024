00:00 - I want to share a few words about our
00:03 - Collective need to reignite the movement
00:05 - for computer science because we've had
00:07 - now three years of a hunkering down
00:10 - through school closures and economic
00:13 - challenges and during the last two years
00:16 - it has not been easy to tell schools
00:18 - that it's time to teach computer science
00:20 - almost anybody doing this work has been
00:22 - like yeah we want to do that but we also
00:25 - need to like figure out how to deal with
00:26 - covet and masks and school closures and
00:29 - zoom and all these other things and that
00:32 - was this new school year begins for all
00:34 - of us that care about the movement for
00:36 - growing computer science in schools one
00:38 - of our top challenges is to make sure
00:40 - administrators leaders School leaders
00:43 - teachers classrooms reignites the
00:46 - interest in teaching computer science in
00:48 - every school and to every child and this
00:51 - is not easy because schools still have
00:53 - so many challenges just trying to reopen
00:56 - dealing with teacher shortages and
00:58 - getting the system back going again
01:01 - I want to talk briefly about something
01:03 - we did this past July that just shows
01:05 - how potent and Powerful the interest in
01:08 - computer science is not only in this
01:10 - country in the United States but in a
01:12 - way that I think has Global resonance
01:15 - back in January the national Governors
01:18 - Association which basically hosts the
01:21 - annual Gathering of the 50 United States
01:24 - Governors decided under the leadership
01:26 - of Arkansas governor ASA Hutchinson to
01:28 - to create a Governor's compact to come
01:31 - together to collectively make a
01:33 - statement in support of computer science
01:34 - and when that happened we had code.org
01:37 - decided if the governors are going to do
01:39 - this we need to bring the private sector
01:41 - as well to get corporate leaders and
01:43 - non-profit leaders to come together with
01:45 - our government leaders to all say that
01:47 - computer science is important for every
01:49 - child and you know I started recruiting
01:52 - folks from the tech companies and so we
01:54 - we eventually and unsurprisingly got the
01:57 - leaders of the largest tech companies
01:59 - whether it's Apple Microsoft Google and
02:01 - Amazon Facebook and many many many other
02:04 - technology companies to all collectively
02:07 - sign a statement but what was most
02:09 - unique was what we came together when
02:11 - this when this finally launched was not
02:14 - only the technology companies but the
02:16 - largest companies in every single sector
02:19 - of Industry whether it's the largest
02:21 - Airlines the largest phone companies
02:24 - coffee companies like Starbucks shoe
02:27 - companies like Nike Walgreens UPS
02:30 - Walmart you name it all came together
02:33 - behind the idea that computer science
02:35 - needs to be part of the curriculum and
02:38 - not only did these employers
02:39 - representing millions and millions of
02:41 - jobs agreed to to come behind this
02:44 - non-profits and non-profit leaders from
02:47 - the College Board to Khan Academy and
02:50 - also the two largest teacher unions in
02:52 - the country came behind the same
02:54 - statement and at
02:57 - and then the next day 50 Governors 45
03:00 - State Governors plus five territories
03:02 - collectively also signed a statement
03:04 - basically saying that in the United
03:06 - States we need to move to a world where
03:09 - computer science is available and every
03:11 - student in every school has the
03:13 - opportunity to learn computer science
03:15 - and this Collective coming together of
03:18 - Business Leaders non-profit leaders
03:20 - government leaders when you sue billion
03:24 - billionaires and unions coming together
03:26 - tech companies who are competitors
03:28 - coming together and groups from every
03:31 - Walk of Life and then Democrat and
03:33 - Republican Governors coming together
03:35 - we showed that computer science is
03:37 - important and we also showed that the
03:40 - United States of America can act United
03:42 - on an issue that is important to our
03:45 - future and what happened is not only did
03:48 - we make this statement every one of
03:50 - these CEOs then tweeted this statement
03:52 - creating a global awareness and all
03:54 - around the world other people said why
03:56 - isn't our country doing this too and
03:59 - this shows that the movement to teach
04:00 - computer science is important and it's
04:02 - important globally it is something we
04:05 - all care about here and as we think
04:07 - about basically the bounce back after
04:09 - the pandemic it's on all of us to share
04:12 - that excitement and to reignite interest
04:14 - in this movement
04:16 - the computer science education movement
04:18 - did not have its best last two years
04:20 - it's been hard because almost everything
04:22 - in education didn't have its best last
04:24 - two years but the rest of this decade
04:26 - are going to be the best years for
04:28 - computer science when we look back at
04:31 - the end of this decade I'm quite
04:32 - confident that we will have reached the
04:34 - points where in the United States every
04:37 - single student has access to computer
04:39 - science in their schools and in Most
04:41 - states it will be mandatory for high
04:43 - school graduation and since there are so
04:45 - many Global computer science leaders
04:47 - here I expect that as we do that in this
04:49 - country many many other countries will
04:51 - be doing the same thing some of them
04:53 - ahead of the United States some of them
04:55 - behind the United States but our goal by
04:57 - the end of this decade should be to have
04:59 - at least 50 countries where every
05:02 - student has access and every student is
05:04 - learning computer science as part of a
05:07 - requirement for high school graduation
05:08 - and so I'm so excited to welcome you
05:11 - here today I I want to let us get along
05:14 - with the agenda we have a packed agenda
05:15 - with some amazing speakers thank you for
05:18 - being here thank you for everything you
05:20 - all do behind this movement for computer
05:22 - science for every student
05:25 - I next want to introduce Lisa Dr Lisa
05:28 - milankovic from Broward County Broward
05:30 - county is the first school district in
05:33 - the United States to adopt computer
05:35 - science in every school and they are the
05:38 - sixth largest District Dr milankovic has
05:41 - been this stem and computer science
05:43 - supervisor and a partner for code.org
05:45 - since our very first year give her a
05:48 - warm Round of Applause and thank you so
05:50 - much
05:57 - I want to welcome you to thank you first
05:59 - of all good morning
06:03 - I am the supervisor of stem and computer
06:04 - science in the applied learning
06:06 - Department with all the other electives
06:08 - but we're more than an elective in
06:11 - computer science and I'll share a little
06:13 - bit of information about that Broward
06:14 - County Public Schools is the nation's
06:17 - sixth largest District
06:19 - and through Partnerships both internal
06:21 - within the district large district and
06:24 - external we have grown computer science
06:26 - from 66 students that took the AP test
06:29 - in 2012.
06:32 - and and very unsuccessful failure of an
06:35 - NSF proposal to try to bring computer
06:37 - science across the whole District
06:39 - to a community-wide culture shift that
06:41 - now supports computer science for all
06:44 - and thanks in part a big part to the
06:47 - partnership in 2013 of code.org coming
06:49 - to our district and kind of saying that
06:52 - they wanted to do everything that the
06:53 - failure of an NSF proposal was going to
06:56 - do and more
06:58 - and then internal collaboration across
07:00 - many departments in Broward schools
07:01 - through CTE and learning departments and
07:05 - I.T and a bunch of different departments
07:07 - have worked on this and our schools
07:09 - itself getting the administration on
07:11 - board
07:12 - and the community with our stem
07:13 - ecosystem and our business Community who
07:16 - volunteers for hour of code and be and
07:19 - along with other days in the classroom
07:21 - and have hackathons and enrichment
07:24 - activities so students know how do they
07:26 - can apply their computer science we have
07:28 - reached thousands of teachers now
07:30 - and their students and I think yesterday
07:32 - when we looked in Tableau we found out
07:34 - that we were reaching more than a
07:35 - hundred thousand students have been
07:37 - reached by our teachers over the years
07:40 - [Applause]
07:44 - and we couldn't do that without the
07:46 - support of code.org and the National
07:48 - Science Foundation in partnership with
07:50 - our research Partners at University of
07:52 - Chicago University of Florida MIT and
07:54 - digital promise and prior support we've
07:57 - received from Google
07:58 - and the current funding from the state
08:00 - of Florida and of course code.org we've
08:02 - been able to sustain and grow computer
08:04 - science beyond what is typically thought
08:05 - of as CS teachers because we're still at
08:08 - a hundred thousand students not reaching
08:10 - all
08:11 - over 266 000 students in our district
08:15 - we have now trained media Specialists
08:17 - music and art and PE teachers to be
08:19 - computer science teachers as well PE
08:21 - teachers are making fitbits out of micro
08:23 - bits and other wearable devices and
08:25 - having fun with it
08:27 - students are creating with computer
08:29 - science social studies teachers ELA
08:31 - teachers are emphasizing sympathy and
08:33 - computer science for social good through
08:35 - learning about artificial intelligence
08:37 - and digital citizenship and why that's
08:39 - important in ethics
08:40 - and we have initial training for over 2
08:44 - 000 teachers we have 14 000 teachers to
08:46 - go
08:48 - so still working on that and now every
08:51 - student has the opportunity to learn and
08:53 - apply computer science to solve problems
08:55 - so we're getting there but we're not
08:57 - quite there yet and we welcome you to
08:59 - Broward County and to Sunny Fort
09:01 - Lauderdale beach and enjoy your time
09:02 - here
09:03 - I want to start with who's at CS edcon
09:09 - we have
09:11 - 350 participants this year
09:15 - this year we have 50 over 50 people from
09:20 - outside the U.S representing
09:23 - 32 countries
09:25 - countries such as Spain Brazil Chile
09:29 - Thailand Kazakhstan Maldives and Myanmar
09:33 - from the U.S we have 48 states
09:35 - represented including 25 from Florida
09:39 - plus DC the U.S Virgin Islands and
09:43 - Puerto Rico and actually I wanted to
09:44 - mention that unfortunately some of our
09:47 - um participants participants from Puerto
09:49 - Rico couldn't attend because obviously
09:51 - the impact of the hurricane uh this
09:54 - session is actually going to be recorded
09:56 - and put on YouTube later so just to our
09:59 - Puerto Rican colleagues you know our
10:01 - hearts are with you we're thinking about
10:02 - you we miss you
10:04 - [Applause]
10:11 - so many people here are involved in
10:14 - leading District regional state or
10:16 - national initiatives what we brought
10:18 - together at CS edcon are really the the
10:20 - movers and shakers All Around the World
10:22 - in terms of Computer Science Education
10:24 - there are over 200 CEOs directors vice
10:27 - presidents principals superintendents
10:30 - and 150 State Education Agency staff
10:33 - local Education Agency staff Regional
10:36 - staff researchers leaders of non-profits
10:39 - and Industry Representatives
10:42 - the most special thing about CS edcon
10:44 - are the people and so I want to start
10:47 - out by talking about some of these
10:49 - people and introducing them they don't
10:51 - know that their pictures are about to
10:53 - show up on these slides
10:55 - so we'll start out with zomira May
10:58 - zamira is an education specialist for

12:02 - a corn is the person to talk to if
12:04 - you're going to be training thousands of
12:06 - teachers over the next couple of years
12:08 - because they've done that in Thailand
12:10 - um in Thailand if you don't know they
12:12 - require computer science every single
12:14 - year every single grade
12:16 - and pecoran had to lead that effort to
12:18 - train all those teachers
12:21 - dimitro zagavrovni is the director
12:24 - general for digital transformation at
12:26 - the Ministry of Education and science of

13:41 - whether academic or physical
13:43 - disabilities
13:44 - these are just some of the people I want
13:47 - you to meet as you walk the hallways and
13:50 - the sessions at CS edcon I could go on
13:53 - and on and pick lots of different people
13:54 - but that's why we have a networking
13:56 - session later today as well as a
13:59 - reception this evening
14:01 - I did want to give a special shout out
14:04 - to all of our state superintendents
14:06 - commissioners of Public Instruction and
14:08 - secretaries of Education in attendance
14:10 - today let's give them a round of
14:11 - applause
14:18 - getting 12 State Chiefs on stage for any
14:23 - issue let alone computer science is a
14:26 - very special thing we are delighted to
14:29 - have you all here today
14:31 - now I'd like to introduce you to Sean
14:33 - Roberts code.org vice president of
14:37 - government Affairs Sean
14:43 - thanks
14:45 - thank you Pat and uh welcome to the
14:48 - state of computer science I am so glad
14:51 - that this report is here this year it's
14:53 - really a foundational part of what we do
14:55 - at code.org and we're grateful for the
14:57 - partners we have in supporting us I'm
15:00 - going to actually ask you to do
15:01 - something a little bit different from
15:03 - maybe other talks you're at and please
15:05 - take out your phones
15:06 - um you can take them out uh both because
15:10 - we're going to need them here in just a
15:12 - few moments but also there's like
15:15 - 30 chance I might fall off the end of
15:17 - the stage with the lights here and that
15:19 - would make a great Tick Tock so feel
15:21 - free to take them out for that
15:23 - also as you're taking pictures you know
15:24 - feel free I'll give you a couple poses
15:26 - here to get started this is me making a
15:28 - real Salient point on the state of
15:30 - computer science
15:37 - here's me dealing with a Heckler in the
15:38 - front row
15:40 - [Music]
15:42 - all right
15:46 - um okay as I said uh great to be here
15:48 - great to talk about the state of Cs
15:50 - report uh with you all this year
15:54 - um very glad to have uh the partners we
15:56 - we do we've seen tremendous growth in in
15:59 - state policy in making computer science
16:01 - a requirement for graduation and this
16:04 - year's report addresses some of those
16:05 - early results we've seen and provide
16:07 - some recommendation and guidance around
16:08 - it so I'm going to get into that a
16:10 - little bit before we move on to our
16:11 - co-authors who are also joining me up
16:13 - here but first I want to thank everyone
16:16 - who made this report possible including
16:19 - all of you the work you do in your
16:20 - communities and districts and states
16:22 - the state of computer science is a
16:24 - collaborative effort between us at
16:26 - code.org the computer science Teachers
16:28 - Association and expanding Computing
16:30 - education Pathways this year's report
16:33 - was made possible by cognizant and our
16:35 - supporters of Computer Science Education
16:38 - please give those organizations uh
16:47 - this is the sixth year of the state of
16:49 - Cs report and one of the things we
16:52 - wanted to do is take a step back and
16:54 - reframe the foundational nature of
16:56 - computer science
16:57 - looking back we've come an extremely
16:59 - long way in the past five years so in
17:02 - 2017 just seven states across the U.S
17:06 - had standards for Computer Science
17:08 - Education just seven
17:10 - five years later 43 states have
17:13 - standards for Computer Science Education
17:20 - it's hard to believe and beyond that
17:24 - 27 States now require schools to teach
17:28 - computer science
17:29 - think about that for a second yeah
17:34 - five years ago only seven states even
17:37 - defined computer science
17:39 - now we're at a point where the majority
17:41 - of States think it's so important that
17:43 - it has to be taught in their schools
17:46 - let's take a moment to celebrate that
17:48 - how about a hand for our students
17:49 - parents teachers principals districts
17:52 - and state that have made this possible
17:58 - and let's spread the word about this
18:00 - let's get this going so there's a QR
18:01 - code this is where you can use your
18:03 - phone
18:04 - and if you can scan the code and let's
18:07 - help spread the word about this
18:08 - milestone in the state of Cs report in
18:11 - your communities and nationally
18:13 - so if you have Twitter take out your
18:15 - phone it'll lead you to a tweet that you
18:18 - can retweet and we can let people know
18:20 - that the majority of States now require
18:22 - computer science in their schools
18:25 - if this is possible to achieve in five
18:27 - years so as we talked about you know we
18:29 - had seven states that defined computer
18:31 - science and now we're at the majority of
18:33 - States requiring it in their schools if
18:36 - we could accomplish that in five years
18:38 - I'm really excited to see what the next
18:40 - five years could bring
18:42 - stronger scores and reading and math
18:45 - as we know that computer science
18:47 - correlates with better test scores and
18:49 - reading and Math and Science and dozens
18:52 - of Studies have shown
18:55 - what if every high school student in the
18:57 - country had a fundamental understanding
18:59 - of how the algorithms that influence and
19:02 - are shaping their lives every day are
19:04 - working
19:06 - unfortunately
19:08 - not every student has that opportunity
19:10 - today
19:12 - we have more schools than ever offering
19:14 - computer science courses but is it
19:17 - really Equitable access when only 32
19:19 - percent of our students are young women
19:23 - this trend also continues at the
19:25 - post-secondary level as well
19:27 - more CS degrees are being awarded than
19:29 - ever but women share of those degrees
19:31 - are increasing only incrementally
19:34 - and this continues post-graduation too
19:37 - at the current rate it would take over
19:38 - 100 years for computing jobs to achieve
19:41 - balanced gender representation
19:43 - of course this isn't just about tech
19:45 - jobs it's the foundational nature of
19:47 - computer science that students will need
19:48 - to thrive regardless of their future
19:50 - courses of study or their careers
19:53 - but it starts in our schools certainly
19:55 - and the work you all do
19:58 - what if there was a way we could
19:59 - accelerate that growth
20:01 - well these states have
20:04 - South Carolina Maryland and Mississippi
20:06 - are the only states in the country to
20:09 - have achieved above 40 percent
20:11 - participation by young women in computer
20:13 - science courses
20:21 - how have they done that
20:23 - well you might guess they each have some
20:26 - form of requirement for computer science
20:29 - Maryland and Mississippi have computer
20:31 - science or technology requirements and
20:34 - most of those courses above 90 percent
20:35 - of those courses are computer science
20:38 - South Carolina instituted their
20:40 - graduation requirement and had more
20:42 - young women take a computer science
20:44 - course this year than North Carolina
20:46 - Florida Alabama and Georgia combined
20:49 - they're about the same number of young
20:51 - women taking a computer science course
20:53 - this year in South Carolina than there
20:55 - are in the entire state of Texas Texas
20:58 - is a population of about 30 million
21:00 - South Carolina is about 5 million
21:08 - and what's more is a funny thing
21:10 - happening in South Carolina after the
21:13 - computer science graduation requirement
21:15 - went into effect graduation rates have
21:17 - actually gone up
21:20 - eliminating gender disparities in high
21:22 - school computer science access is no
21:25 - longer a 20-year incremental issue where
21:28 - hopefully we'll make progress and we
21:29 - won't plateau and we'll see small
21:31 - step-by-step progress
21:33 - it's achievable in five years
21:36 - as these states have shown
21:38 - computer science is necessary
21:40 - it engages students and their academics
21:42 - and supports learning in other subjects
21:46 - that's what we want out of graduation
21:48 - requirements
21:50 - and states are recognizing this
21:52 - five states across the country now
21:54 - require students to take computer
21:56 - science for graduation
21:58 - Tennessee Nebraska and Arkansas all pass
22:00 - theirs recently and those states are
22:02 - scheduled to begin implementing over the
22:04 - next few years when they'll join South
22:06 - Carolina and Nevada at a point where
22:09 - every student will learn computer
22:11 - science
22:12 - we'll have more sessions and discussions
22:14 - on this over the next few days to talk
22:16 - about what we've seen in these states
22:18 - we'll hear from some of these states
22:19 - we'll hear from students and their
22:21 - experience and why computer science
22:24 - makes sense as a graduation requirement
22:27 - policy makers Advocates and education
22:30 - leaders have to make this a priority
22:31 - though
22:32 - see computer science is a graduation
22:34 - requirement isn't an ending that's not
22:36 - the end goal like we get there in these
22:38 - states and then we're done as I'm sure
22:40 - these states will tell you
22:42 - but it's a beginning step toward
22:43 - ensuring students have the foundational
22:46 - skills that they'll need
22:48 - it's a responsibility that's up to all
22:50 - of us
22:51 - and of course this isn't possible
22:53 - without teachers in the classroom it
22:55 - being a beginning then it's going to be
22:57 - up to teachers and we're going to rely
22:58 - on teachers to continue to make sure
23:00 - students are getting high quality
23:02 - Computer Science Education instruction
23:03 - that's why we're honored to co-author
23:06 - the report with the computer science
23:08 - Teachers Association so please join me
23:10 - in welcoming one of my fellow co-authors
23:12 - Jake Baskin executive director of the
23:15 - computer science Teachers Association
23:25 - I owe someone a drink tonight
23:29 - um thanks Sean thanks for setting the
23:32 - stage for that and welcoming amount
23:33 - welcoming me on stage and before I jump
23:35 - in I want to just take a second and give
23:37 - a shout out to past csta board member
23:40 - Janice Mack
23:42 - although her term on the board just came
23:44 - to an end in July she's continued to
23:46 - serve our organization by Leading our
23:48 - contributions to this report over the
23:50 - last several months so I just want to
23:52 - say a huge thank you to Janice for all
23:54 - of your work on this report let's give
23:56 - her a round of applause
24:03 - now Sean you've made a pretty compelling
24:06 - case for the impact of States
24:08 - implementing a graduation requirement
24:09 - it's really clear to me from the data
24:12 - that you've shown and what we see in the
24:13 - report that these states have seen a
24:15 - dramatic shift in who takes at least one
24:18 - computer science course and especially a
24:21 - shift in how young women and non-binary
24:23 - students engage in CS
24:25 - but before everyone in this room walks
24:28 - away thinking this is going to be easy
24:30 - I'll just make it CS graduation
24:31 - requirement next year
24:33 - I want to take a moment and recognize
24:35 - that none of these changes would be
24:37 - possible without one key group
24:39 - the amazing computer science teachers
24:41 - that bring these courses to life
24:51 - in fact at csta we know from our reach
24:54 - to the teacher census that among
24:56 - computer science teachers there's strong
24:58 - support for states to enact graduation
25:01 - requirements when implemented
25:03 - thoughtfully and that thoughtfully part
25:05 - is important here
25:07 - from this year's report we know that
25:09 - still only 53 percent of schools offer
25:12 - even one foundational computer science
25:14 - course
25:15 - and just 5.6 percent of students took a
25:18 - computer science course last year
25:21 - in order to make graduation requirements
25:23 - a reality
25:24 - we're going to need to see those numbers
25:25 - change dramatically
25:28 - and states are going to need to get
25:29 - serious about investing in teacher
25:31 - development with an eye towards career
25:34 - long support
25:36 - in fact we've been talking a lot about
25:38 - South Carolina this morning and at csta
25:41 - we're really proud of the work we've
25:43 - done with our South Carolina chapter the
25:46 - Department of Education and the Citadel
25:49 - to support teachers with an annual cspd
25:52 - week event for the past three years
25:54 - where each summer hundreds of teachers
25:56 - have come together to learn not only how
25:59 - to start teaching CS
26:01 - but to continue to deepen their
26:03 - understanding of how to teach equitably
26:05 - and inclusively in the Cs classroom year
26:08 - after year
26:11 - and as everyone in this room begins to
26:13 - plan for things like graduation
26:15 - requirements or other new policies in
26:17 - your state I want you to know that csta
26:20 - is here to help with keyword resources
26:22 - that all policy makers and state
26:25 - department staff should be aware of
26:28 - beyond the work we do directly with
26:30 - teachers in every one of your States
26:32 - we have brought the community together
26:34 - to define the characteristics of high
26:37 - quality Computer Science teaching
26:39 - through the csta standards for CS
26:41 - teachers
26:42 - we have a regularly updated list of
26:44 - accredited professional development
26:46 - providers and opportunities that support
26:48 - teachers in meeting these standards and
26:51 - working towards implementing high
26:53 - quality inclusive and Equitable Computer
26:55 - Science teaching in their classrooms and
26:58 - we verified curricular alignments to the
27:00 - csta standards for K-12 computer science
27:02 - which nearly everyone in this room has
27:04 - used as the base for your own state
27:06 - standards for CS
27:09 - all of these tools are key to ensuring
27:11 - that when CS graduation requirements are
27:14 - implemented
27:15 - they don't become just another computer
27:17 - science class in name only
27:20 - and making sure that your students your
27:21 - teachers are receiving the high quality
27:23 - support that they and their students
27:25 - deserve
27:28 - because at the end of the day as I said
27:30 - to start this teachers are the key to
27:32 - making sure that all students not only
27:34 - have access to but are engaging in and
27:37 - succeeding in a foundational K-12 CS
27:40 - education and I for one cannot wait to
27:43 - welcome the next wave of computer
27:45 - science teachers to our world's largest
27:47 - computer science department
27:49 - so next I'm looking forward to turning
27:52 - it over to Josh Childs from esep to
27:54 - share a little bit more about some
27:55 - specific State policy Trends thanks
27:57 - everyone
27:57 - [Applause]
28:05 - thank you Jake yo someone else to drink
28:09 - uh before I begin talking about uh
28:11 - policy Trends I want to give a special
28:13 - shout out to Dr Carol Fletcher and Sarah
28:16 - Dunn part of our esep team that have
28:19 - helped lead the efforts around producing
28:21 - the reports so thank you to very much
28:22 - for the efforts you did in this
28:27 - so there's a lot to be excited about
28:29 - there's a lot of positivity moving in
28:32 - States and there's some current policy
28:34 - Trends I want to talk about that I think
28:36 - can help lead us over the next few days
28:37 - in an incoming year upcoming year when
28:40 - it comes to Computer Science Education
28:43 - so let's look about back over the last
28:44 - five years
28:46 - since 2017 we've seen increases in
28:48 - things such as state level funding for
28:51 - computer science
28:52 - increases in state plans for K-12
28:55 - computer science
28:56 - and most importantly high schools
28:58 - requiring to provide Computer Science
29:00 - Education in five years the work of
29:04 - State leaders District level leaders
29:06 - Community efforts families have led to
29:09 - these increases that we are seeing
29:11 - across the country today that's
29:13 - something to be excited about but some
29:16 - that deserves a round of applause not
29:17 - now
29:20 - and why I say not now is the work is not
29:23 - done there's more work that needs to
29:26 - that is required and more states that we
29:28 - have to see increase efforts around
29:31 - computer science education and hopefully
29:33 - that will be our goal over the next year
29:35 - and years to come
29:37 - so I want to highlight two states
29:38 - Kentucky for one Kentucky in the house
29:42 - there we go I'm sorry
29:44 - not in the house and Pat's house my
29:46 - apologies and Pat's house
29:48 - so Kentucky centering equity
29:51 - producing uh uh our annual report that
29:55 - measures the Equitable outcomes and
29:57 - participation of students in computer
29:59 - science education to see where they're
30:01 - missing the mark and seeing what needs
30:03 - to be done to provide resources and
30:06 - strategies to see improvements and
30:08 - increases in computer science education
30:09 - participation
30:11 - and then Louisiana Louisiana where you
30:13 - at
30:15 - there we go there we go let the good
30:16 - times roll Louisiana
30:19 - that's Double Down efforts and provided
30:21 - recommendations around professional
30:23 - development of teachers
30:25 - and thinking about ways in which again
30:27 - how do we increase access and
30:29 - participation of our students in
30:31 - computer science education these are
30:33 - just two states that are in the report
30:35 - that you can learn from and see what
30:37 - they've done over the last year to see
30:40 - how they've thought about increasing
30:42 - access and participation pure science
30:46 - and then how do we learn from States
30:47 - like Indiana that have done marvelous
30:50 - jobs around implementation and thinking
30:53 - about ways in which they can get 91 of
30:55 - their students to attend at least a high
30:58 - school attend who attended high school
30:59 - that offers a foundational uh computer
31:02 - science course so how do we learn from
31:04 - one another how do we learn from other
31:07 - states when it comes to improving
31:10 - Computer Science Education
31:13 - even there are important questions that
31:14 - we need to ask as we move forward in
31:16 - this work
31:17 - and so I have four of them here from a
31:20 - cape framework that we've used over the
31:22 - last several years to think about how do
31:23 - we Center and move in Equitable ways so
31:27 - that students all students no matter
31:29 - background
31:31 - no more the family they come from no
31:33 - matter what their communities are that
31:36 - they can also have the opportunities
31:39 - to experience what can come from
31:41 - Computer Science Education questions
31:43 - like do districts in all areas have the
31:45 - resources to offer CS to train and
31:48 - certify teachers
31:49 - and what would that look like
31:52 - RCS courses offered in low-income
31:55 - schools at similar rates to other
31:57 - schools are we doing enough
31:59 - to make sure that everyone has access
32:03 - which subgroups are underrepresented in
32:05 - our CS courses who's missing
32:09 - there are opportunities that exist there
32:11 - and how we flip the narrative not from a
32:13 - deficit perspective of these students
32:15 - but how do we think about the
32:16 - opportunities they provide by attending
32:18 - and being part of our CS classrooms
32:20 - and finally how does the quality
32:23 - instruction differ
32:24 - across subgroups of students and how
32:27 - does that affect learning
32:29 - and speaking from a state level
32:31 - perspective
32:32 - how do we equip and Empower our state
32:35 - leaders invested in our state houses
32:38 - or state Departments of Education to
32:39 - continue to support and dive in and
32:42 - provide resources around CS education
32:45 - there's a lot to be excited about
32:46 - there's also a lot more work to do and I
32:50 - hope you'll join all of us in helping
32:51 - move this work forward thank you
32:56 - thanks
33:00 - please reach out to us if with any
33:03 - questions about the report as you're
33:04 - going through uh thank you for your
33:06 - support of computer science please share
33:08 - the report far and wide hard copies are
33:11 - available if you didn't get one already
33:13 - hard copies are available out by
33:15 - registration so please pick one up if
33:17 - you haven't received one this year's
33:19 - report reflects continued progress in
33:21 - computer science education through the
33:23 - work and support of teachers as we heard
33:26 - from Jake and an advancing State
33:28 - policies as we heard from Josh it also
33:30 - provides us with a sobering reminder of
33:33 - how far we have to go
33:35 - but thanks to the leading States in
33:37 - computer science we know that our shared
33:39 - vision of every student in every school
33:42 - having the opportunity to learn computer
33:44 - science is not wishful thinking decades
33:47 - from now
33:48 - we do however have to act on that
33:50 - opportunity and that time is now thank
33:53 - you all
33:54 - [Applause]
33:57 - I want to introduce to the stage Dr
34:00 - Christina Grant
34:01 - the state superintendent of education
34:04 - for Washington D.C
34:07 - good morning
34:09 - oh we can do better than that good
34:11 - morning
34:13 - too many Educators in the room to not
34:15 - have a good good morning I bring you
34:17 - greetings from the nation's capital
34:19 - Washington DC uh it is I'm geeked out to
34:23 - be here because it is always a joy as a
34:25 - state chief to be able to celebrate one
34:28 - of your schools and
34:30 - um there's an amazing story that I hope
34:32 - you hear more about this school but the
34:34 - joy of my morning is to tell you about
34:36 - one of my students and so Quran Owens
34:40 - has attended D.C public schools his
34:42 - entire life
34:44 - he's an honor roll student he's one of
34:47 - 540 Scholars from Southeast DC who has
34:51 - chosen to enroll in a public charter
34:54 - school digital Pioneers Academy remember
34:57 - that name thunders in the room remember
34:59 - that name
35:01 - anyone who wants to move to DC remember
35:03 - that name but the important part of the
35:07 - school is that is explicitly focused on
35:10 - computer science and computer science
35:12 - education
35:13 - Quran and his classmates are by Design
35:16 - Pioneers they embody the spirit of the
35:20 - school the spirit of our values in
35:22 - Washington DC and they are forging a
35:25 - path for Computer Science Education that
35:28 - will transform their Futures transform
35:30 - our district and transform the world
35:33 - digital Pioneers Academy is
35:35 - unapologetically committed to ensuring
35:39 - our students are prepared for college
35:41 - that they are grounded in high quality
35:43 - instructions in computer science and
35:46 - that they receive an entire whole
35:49 - rounded education for all of their
35:51 - students please join me send him a lot
35:55 - of love this is very hard for adults to
35:57 - do and so one could imagine that he may
36:00 - be a little nervous but please welcome
36:02 - to the stage digital Pioneers Academy's
36:05 - founding scholar Quran Owens
36:11 - you got this
36:14 - [Applause]
36:39 - uh
36:44 - good morning
36:47 - I'm Karan Owens from Southeast
36:49 - Washington DC
36:51 - I'm the oldest of my siblings and love
36:53 - attending digital Pioneers Academy
36:55 - because of the schools Computer Science
36:57 - Focus in our caring teachers I enjoy
36:59 - creating and building and quoting an
37:02 - anime
37:03 - when I graduate from DPA I want to earn
37:06 - a full scholarship to a top 10 school
37:07 - for Esports and prepare for a career as
37:10 - a coder I also want to volunteer as a
37:13 - mentor to Young students in computer
37:14 - science and create virtual reality
37:16 - experiences like Dungeons and Dragons
37:19 - I am very excited to introduce our
37:22 - school founder and leader Michelle
37:23 - Ashton the thing I appreciate most about
37:26 - Miss Ashton is that she really knows me
37:28 - and cares about my growth and happiness
37:30 - I am grateful to go to a school where I
37:33 - feel known loved and respected which is
37:35 - a key part of our culture
37:37 - my experience is that DPA is a school
37:40 - that really lives its values which are
37:42 - accountability growth ownership optimism
37:45 - Innovation and empathy
37:48 - performance as an open Digital Pioneers
37:51 - Academy in 2018 she spent over two
37:53 - decades working to improve Urban
37:55 - education across the country most
37:57 - recently as CEO of the Newark Charter
37:59 - School fund Miss Ashton graduated from
38:02 - William and Mary College and began her
38:04 - career as a special education teacher in
38:07 - my hometown of southeast Washington DC
38:10 - she also understands what it means to be
38:12 - a middle school student firsthand
38:14 - she is the parent of twin sixth graders
38:17 - please welcome my principal Ms Ashton
38:20 - [Applause]
38:23 - Quran a round of applause
38:25 - [Applause]
38:31 - my heart is so warm thank you Quran
38:35 - good morning everyone
38:37 - I am so excited to be here at Cs edcon
38:42 - and to get this opportunity to speak to
38:45 - a room full of Educators and policy
38:48 - leaders who share my passion for
38:51 - computer science and education
38:54 - at my school we send snaps if something
38:57 - I say resonates with you if I start
38:59 - struggling up here you can send me some
39:01 - magic I'll take all the magic all the
39:03 - snaps
39:05 - my journey
39:07 - um to founding a computer science
39:09 - focused School began way back when I was
39:13 - growing up in New Jersey I met my New
39:16 - Jersey people I think they were back
39:17 - here woohoo
39:20 - any Eagles fans Fly Eagles Fly okay okay
39:24 - so I'm focused I'm focused all right
39:26 - so one of the pivotal moments in my life
39:30 - happened in a small conference room at
39:33 - my elementary school
39:36 - the principal had convened a little
39:38 - meeting to share the news that my sister
39:41 - and I had failed the school year
39:44 - and we would need to repeat the grade
39:48 - to this day I remember the look of anger
39:52 - in my mom's eyes
39:55 - this did not happen in third or fourth
39:58 - grade
39:59 - my identical twin sister and I were in
40:04 - kindergarten
40:06 - yes and you won't know anything about
40:10 - kindergarten kids are not supposed to
40:13 - fail kindergarten
40:16 - I must have just colored Outside the
40:18 - Lines or broke all the rules I'm still
40:21 - kind of doing that but anyway
40:23 - failing kindergarten impacted my
40:26 - direction and my career in two very
40:29 - important ways
40:31 - the first is it exposed me to school
40:34 - choice
40:35 - I believe that parents should have a
40:37 - choice and if you look at my resume
40:39 - you'll see that I'm the crazy Charter
40:41 - School person and I want to just tell
40:44 - you right now there are some good
40:46 - charter schools and there are some bad
40:48 - charter schools there are some good
40:50 - traditional public schools and there are
40:52 - some bad traditional Public Schools what
40:55 - I know is our parents want Great Schools
40:58 - regardless of the title and the name
41:01 - but once my mom learned that they plan
41:04 - to hold my sister and I back she
41:07 - searched and worked diligently to until
41:10 - she found another school that would meet
41:12 - our needs my parents knew the school
41:15 - what we were assigned to was not a good
41:18 - fit
41:19 - and they had the agency or maybe the
41:23 - audacity and they knew they had the
41:26 - agency to find something better for
41:28 - their children
41:29 - I believe that every family and every
41:33 - scholar deserves that
41:35 - in Washington DC students have that
41:39 - choice more than half of our students
41:41 - who attend Polk School are either
41:43 - enrolled in a traditional public school
41:45 - or a public charter school for Charter
41:48 - Schools they apply and they are they get
41:51 - in through a lottery
41:53 - every family and every scholar deserves
41:56 - this opportunity
41:59 - the second impact failing kindergarten
42:02 - had on me it is that it is it forever
42:05 - altered the perception I had of myself
42:08 - at an early age I was told that I was
42:12 - not smart
42:13 - a school that creates that feeling in a
42:17 - child is it a school that any child
42:20 - should attend
42:22 - I would never want my own children Duke
42:25 - and Dylan who are twins starting Middle
42:27 - School to have this experience and if it
42:31 - is not acceptable for my kids it is not
42:34 - acceptable for anyone's kids
42:37 - in case you are wondering spoiler alert
42:40 - I turned out okay
42:44 - in fact my sister and I found our way
42:48 - through Elementary School we were
42:50 - successful in school and Athletics we
42:53 - were both the first African-American
42:55 - women soccer players at the College of
42:57 - William and Mary
42:59 - yes
43:03 - she I went on to grad school at William
43:06 - Mary she went on to grad school at
43:08 - Harvard so I think back to that
43:10 - kindergarten teacher I know her name I
43:13 - have a picture I haven't hunted her down
43:14 - yet she just made a mistake we all fail
43:16 - sometimes and in fact I graduated from
43:20 - college and I got my first job as a
43:23 - special education teacher at Ian beers
43:25 - Elementary right in Washington DC
43:29 - but after teaching I spent 15 years
43:32 - working for various roles in leadership
43:34 - all across the country including the CEO
43:36 - of the Newark Charter School fund but my
43:39 - family moved back to Washington DC in
43:43 - 2016 to be closer to family
43:45 - but professionally I wasn't exactly sure
43:48 - what I would do next
43:51 - and this is where computer science
43:53 - enters my life
43:56 - one day I promise you I read one article
44:00 - about how Innovation is changing the
44:03 - world economy in ways that were
44:05 - unimaginable a decade ago this fourth
44:09 - Industrial Revolution based on
44:11 - technological advances in artificial
44:14 - intelligence robotics biotechnology in
44:17 - which transforming how we live and how
44:19 - we work today and how our children live
44:23 - and how they will work in the future
44:25 - in DC I read that there were 10
44:30 - 000 vacancies for High-Tech high-paying
44:33 - jobs in the metro area
44:36 - that would pay a salary of over a
44:38 - hundred thousand dollars
44:41 - that's real money y'all
44:44 - and to put that salary in perspective at
44:47 - our school 98 of our Scholars are
44:51 - eligible for free and reduced lunch
44:53 - to qualify in D.C a family of four has
44:57 - to make less than fifty one thousand
44:59 - dollars
45:01 - these aren't just jobs these are careers
45:04 - and they are careers that can break the
45:07 - cycle of poverty and build generational
45:10 - wealth an opportunity that black and
45:12 - brown families have not had due to years
45:16 - of systemic racism and oppression
45:19 - this realization
45:22 - fundamentally shifted my perspective
45:25 - about the importance of computer science
45:27 - education for students especially for
45:31 - low income and working-class Families I
45:35 - now believe that computer science should
45:39 - be a course that begins as early as
45:42 - Elementary School it's snap if you agree
45:45 - because I think this is the room that
45:46 - agrees
45:47 - it should be a core subject like math
45:51 - and eoa snap if you agree
45:55 - it should be a core class not just an
45:58 - elective snap if you agree
46:01 - it should be a core class not just an
46:05 - after-school program snap if you agree
46:09 - it should be a high school graduation
46:13 - requirement snap if you agree
46:16 - a computer science education should not
46:20 - be for just kids who attend affluent
46:22 - private schools or Suburban schools
46:25 - it should be for all students CS for all
46:32 - for real snap if you agree
46:37 - as in many of our nation cities in DC
46:40 - there is a huge gap between those who
46:43 - are prepared for this rapidly evolving
46:45 - economy and those who are not
46:48 - digital Pioneers Academy operates in one
46:51 - of the most under-resourced communities
46:54 - in Washington DC in Ward 7 and 8. the
46:59 - unemployment rate in these areas was
47:01 - nearly three times the national average
47:04 - in only 1 in 10 adults have attained a
47:08 - college degree
47:11 - I think this is similar for many cities
47:13 - across the country
47:15 - but for me I find myself grappling with
47:18 - this dichotomy
47:20 - incredible career opportunities for
47:23 - young people in our city
47:25 - and many many young people in my city
47:28 - who look like me who are not being
47:31 - adequately educated for these jobs and
47:34 - these opportunities
47:35 - that did not sit well with me at all
47:40 - it actually didn't just sit poorly it
47:43 - felt like a call to action
47:46 - every child in DC should have the
47:50 - opportunity to pursue one of these
47:53 - high-paying high demand jobs and have
47:56 - the schooling to prepare them to excel
47:58 - at one of those jobs
48:00 - so what was I going to do about it
48:04 - I fought back to my own experience my
48:07 - parents were able to find the right
48:08 - school for my sister and I to Excel and
48:11 - to be prepared to do whatever career we
48:15 - hope to pursue
48:17 - every parent should have the ability to
48:21 - do that for their child snap if you
48:23 - agree
48:25 - okay so here I was it was 2017 and the
48:31 - idea for digital Pioneers Academy was
48:33 - born in the months after that I
48:36 - developed a 500 page yes 500 page
48:41 - Charter application that outlined this
48:44 - vision for a computer science immersion
48:47 - school where every child would take
48:50 - computer science and we adopted a
48:52 - curriculum that emphasized computational
48:55 - thinking skills like problem solving
48:58 - collaboration and critical thinking
49:00 - we had this amazing Mission around
49:03 - developing the next generation of
49:06 - innovators but I needed to Define
49:08 - innovation we came up with this
49:11 - innovators think thoughtfully creatively
49:15 - and critically about solving complex
49:18 - problems and this is a complex problems
49:22 - problem and there were three things that
49:25 - we needed to do to figure out how we
49:28 - were going to offer our kids from
49:31 - Southeast Washington DC a rigorous
49:33 - computer science experience
49:36 - Talent curriculum and culture
49:41 - on Talent we needed a strategy to
49:44 - recruit retain and train our best
49:47 - teachers when I developed the idea of
49:50 - DPA at that time there were there were
49:53 - no schools that I could find that
49:55 - required computer science as a core part
49:57 - of the program and a story I always tell
50:01 - is I actually went to csta that's where
50:04 - I met Pat and I was looking for all the
50:07 - computer science teachers I was going to
50:10 - steal them from all of your places I was
50:13 - gonna lure them to to DC to have helped
50:16 - found the school that we were going to
50:18 - change the world
50:20 - and guess what I found
50:22 - a whole bunch of Math teachers science
50:25 - teachers social studies teachers who
50:28 - love computer science and we're teaching
50:29 - and learning computer science along with
50:32 - our Scholars and I thought man
50:35 - this is a real problem
50:38 - and it's a tremendous opportunity
50:42 - the Second Challenge we had was
50:44 - curriculum
50:45 - we had to bag borrow and steal from the
50:49 - best because that's what innovators do
50:52 - so we decided early on that we were not
50:56 - going to be curriculum experts while we
50:58 - navigate the founding of a CS immersion
51:01 - school we would let co.org and code HS
51:04 - and others figure out the curriculum
51:06 - page
51:07 - in fact we decide to partner with
51:10 - Republic in in Tennessee and we use
51:13 - code.org to supplement our Middle School
51:16 - rigorous curriculum
51:18 - Fifth Third piece and this is really
51:21 - important
51:22 - we had to figure out the culture
51:25 - we had to live our values of empathy and
51:29 - growth at DPA when we say growth we mean
51:34 - fat ass
51:36 - play along with me failure and
51:39 - difficulty is opportunity for growth and
51:42 - feedback fat ass that's what we mean
51:46 - you fail a lot in computer science we
51:49 - had to get our Scholars with the right
51:51 - mindset that failing and failing forward
51:54 - is what great computer scientists do our
51:58 - value on empathy was around creating
52:00 - this known love respected community
52:03 - our Scholars had to feel safe to take
52:07 - risks and to share their ideas
52:10 - we are trying to change history and
52:12 - prove that all kids but particularly
52:15 - kids from the most under-resourced parts
52:17 - of our city can be the next generation
52:21 - of innovators that they can change the
52:24 - face of Technology with 83 percent of
52:28 - our Tech Executives being white we have
52:30 - to do more if we are going to change
52:33 - that data our kids have to feel
52:35 - confident they have to feel safe they
52:39 - have to believe that they can be
52:41 - computer scientists you have to create a
52:44 - school that feels that the biggest
52:47 - obstacle to taking computer science then
52:50 - isn't just our teachers teaching
52:52 - computer science it includes this aspect
52:55 - this confidence and this opportunity
52:59 - students have to believe that they can
53:01 - have these jobs
53:03 - this goes for students of color women
53:05 - students in rural communities and
53:08 - under-resourced communities everyone a
53:11 - school that focuses on computer science
53:14 - tries to bridge all of these gaps
53:18 - at the end of the day we believe that
53:21 - DPA is proving that a school like ours
53:25 - should exist for all Scholars but
53:29 - particularly for those who come for our
53:31 - utmost under resource communities okay I
53:35 - have just a couple more points if this
53:37 - is great you can blame Pat if it's bad
53:41 - you can blame Pat too so I'm just going
53:43 - to say this is his house
53:44 - my last point
53:46 - so going back to when I prepared to open
53:49 - DPA I visited various elementary schools
53:52 - to share with students and parents about
53:54 - our school and our mission to develop
53:57 - the next generation of innovators I
54:00 - distinctly remember visiting Ketchum
54:02 - Elementary and meeting Quran and his mom
54:04 - who's here with us today as they were
54:07 - considering yes give a shout out to
54:08 - Quran and his mom
54:13 - I also happy with me two of my Scholars
54:16 - Ms Fields and Jasmine are here as well
54:19 - [Applause]
54:22 - when I talk to them about computer
54:24 - science and coding and Robotics quran's
54:26 - mom said to me this is the perfect
54:29 - school for my son DPA represented a new
54:33 - school choice option for Quran and
54:35 - students in the area one that was
54:38 - focused on computer science had smaller
54:40 - classes and is committed to a culture of
54:43 - every scholar and every staff feeling
54:46 - known loved and respected
54:49 - we opened our doors with 120 scholars in
54:52 - Fall of 2018. our incredible team of
54:56 - Educators and leaders had dedicated
54:58 - themselves to our students and having
55:01 - them be creators in this digital world
55:03 - not just consumers we may have students
55:07 - who will contribute to technology
55:08 - needing to send people to Mars sitting
55:11 - in Miss Harding's class right now
55:14 - I firmly believe that I have Scholars
55:18 - who will become household names
55:21 - founding the next Dell or apple or next
55:25 - Google or the next Tick Tock or SnapChat
55:27 - they are they are at digital Pioneers
55:30 - Academy I believe it I had the faith
55:34 - that these dreams are becoming a reality
55:36 - because I know that providing our
55:39 - Scholars an opportunity that most
55:41 - students in this country unfortunately
55:43 - aren't receiving which is why as a
55:47 - country we have to shift for computer
55:50 - science for all
55:52 - for real
55:54 - the idea of computer science and you
55:57 - won't you guys may agree with this or
55:58 - not but this is what I talk to folks who
56:00 - don't know computer science this is they
56:03 - say it is so daunting but in 2020 as
56:07 - some of the data shared there were only
56:09 - 423 exams that were taken for AP
56:13 - Computer Science in high school students
56:15 - in DC
56:16 - we have 120 students per grade if 100 of
56:22 - our Scholars take the AP Computer
56:24 - Science exam before they leave High
56:26 - School which is our goal we would
56:28 - increase those numbers by 25 percent
56:32 - this goal and this reality is very close
56:36 - we can do it but part of what makes this
56:40 - goal seem so daunting is what people
56:43 - think about computer science instruction
56:46 - they imagine an intensive boot camp
56:48 - coding classes and it feels very Out Of
56:51 - Reach I'm here to tell you that in the
56:54 - Middle School level computer science is
56:57 - very accessible we don't have dedicated
57:00 - computer science teachers at DPA our
57:03 - Math teachers teach math and computer
57:06 - science and they incorporate
57:08 - project-based learning into the concepts
57:10 - of the curriculum the teachers love it
57:13 - and so do our Scholars we start early
57:16 - because it's helpful to think of
57:18 - computer science as a foreign language
57:20 - the malleability of our Scholars young
57:22 - brains means that earlier you introduce
57:25 - the material the stickier it becomes you
57:27 - don't expect students to become fluent
57:29 - in Spanish with just four years of high
57:31 - school Spanish but if you immerse them
57:34 - in it they will when they are young they
57:36 - that's another story entirely
57:39 - and here's a brutal facts in high school
57:42 - it is different we cannot expect our
57:45 - algebra and geometry teachers to teach
57:48 - computer science you need a certified
57:50 - computer science teacher at least
57:52 - someone with industry experience who
57:55 - knows the content and to get real with
57:58 - this group the biggest challenge we face
58:00 - in DPA and not not at DPA but across the
58:04 - country is expanding the number of
58:06 - computer science teachers and as we all
58:09 - know we have a K-12 teacher shortage
58:11 - alone this shortage is even more acute
58:15 - for computer science teachers and at DPA
58:18 - we put out all the stops to recruit the
58:21 - best and brightest to teach computer
58:22 - science I'm at a policy expert but I
58:26 - know this I'll leave the details to you
58:28 - in this audience to figure out how do we
58:31 - get more teachers to teach computer
58:33 - science but you did give me the mic so
58:36 - I'm going to take this opportunity to
58:38 - share a cup couple ideas that I have
58:41 - first we must embark on a national
58:44 - initiative where tech companies lend us
58:48 - their employees in public schools for a
58:51 - year or two if you give me a Google
58:54 - engineer for two years who gets to keep
58:57 - his nice Google salary and I get to turn
59:00 - I I then get to have them teach with our
59:04 - teachers share their knowledge to
59:07 - improve our teacher capacity that would
59:09 - help us
59:10 - second we do need to dedicate more
59:13 - resources to Computer Science Education
59:15 - the federal government state departments
59:17 - and cities need to provide grants to
59:20 - help build the entire Talent pipeline
59:22 - from high school teachers to Tech
59:24 - Teacher prep providers at the school
59:27 - level we have to experiment with signing
59:29 - bonus higher pay and other Financial
59:32 - ways to lower computer science teachers
59:35 - into public schools I think teaching is
59:38 - the world's most fulfilling and
59:40 - meaningful profession but if we are
59:42 - going to compete with tech companies for
59:44 - a small pool of talent we are going to
59:48 - lose and with that here's my last Point
59:50 - hold on
59:51 - before I leave you I want to bring you
59:54 - back to what really matters and that is
59:57 - our students do you have my uh picture
60:00 - perfect
60:01 - and I want to remind you why I believe
60:04 - so strongly in computer science as the
60:07 - ticket to the 21st century indulge me
60:11 - for a minute
60:12 - these are our founders
60:15 - this is our last day of our end of our
60:17 - first year these Scholars are the future
60:21 - of technology they are the future of
60:24 - innovation and right now they are with
60:27 - us today but back at home there's a
60:30 - scholar that you know there's a school
60:32 - that you know there's a community I need
60:34 - you to put them on your shoulder today
60:36 - as you go through this conference
60:39 - because they need you to be bold they
60:41 - need you to dream big and they need you
60:43 - to break all the rules
60:46 - one last question
60:48 - how many of you raise your hand know of
60:52 - Jeff Bezos anybody know of Jeff Bezos oh
60:55 - okay okay I heard that how many of you
60:59 - guys though keep your head raised I
61:00 - can't really see you but I I can hear
61:02 - you uh how many of you guys know Elon
61:05 - Musk anybody okay hands are raised all
61:08 - right all right here we go
61:09 - how many of you have heard of David
61:12 - Stewart
61:14 - anybody
61:16 - no that's exactly what I thought David
61:19 - Stewart is the CEO of worldwide
61:22 - technology and he is the second richest
61:25 - black man in America
61:27 - he was born in poverty in the segregated
61:30 - South and now he is worth
61:33 - six billion I said billion dollars
61:38 - he should be a household name and yet as
61:41 - I just proved he had he wasn't I want
61:44 - students like Quran to become a world
61:47 - last coder I want students like Jasmine
61:49 - to develop advances in space travel I
61:52 - want students like Samaya Ballard to be
61:54 - Forbes 30 under 30. and at digital
61:58 - Pioneers Academy you will find
62:00 - classrooms where teachers are are not
62:02 - they're not speaking at the podium like
62:03 - me I'm thanks for indulging me but in
62:06 - our classrooms you will see teachers
62:07 - serving as coaches and guides and
62:10 - students doing authentic work so on that
62:13 - note I want you all to commit to keeping
62:16 - those Scholars on your shoulder as you
62:19 - network as we have happy hour as we
62:21 - figure out how to make CS for all for
62:24 - real and I want to and challenge you to
62:26 - do two things
62:28 - computer science should be a graduation
62:31 - requirement for all kids snap if you
62:34 - agree
62:37 - and here's my last challenge I bought my
62:40 - Scholars and our parents here we have to
62:42 - have parents as partners in this effort
62:45 - to bring CS for all for real it is a
62:49 - great start I mean I actually can't
62:51 - believe all these State Chiefs are here
62:52 - today you guys literally run the whole
62:54 - country uh it is the idea that you all
62:58 - are here on this topic of Cs you all
63:02 - have such a tremendous opportunity and I
63:05 - challenge you to keep the scholars at
63:07 - your on your shoulder but to network to
63:09 - know that you're not by yourself we can
63:12 - do this see all CS for all for real
63:16 - thank you
63:21 - foreign
63:25 - [Applause]
63:35 - [Applause]
63:40 - thank you for that glimpse into uh a
63:43 - beautiful future that's actually now we
63:45 - hope that there are more schools like
63:47 - digital Pioneers Academy there are more
63:49 - kids like Jasmine and Quran uh more
63:53 - parents like their parents who chose to
63:55 - send their schools to digital Pioneers
63:57 - Academy and obviously more folks like
63:59 - you we have some time for a couple
64:02 - questions we have some mic Runners so if
64:04 - you have a question about like what it
64:06 - looks like for all students to learn
64:08 - computer science year after year after
64:09 - year please ask a question
64:12 - um and unfortunately the lights are
64:15 - right in my eyes
64:16 - uh but uh if our micrunners could put
64:20 - their hands up and yeah and if you have
64:22 - a question you can put your hand up when
64:24 - you when you have when you have a
64:25 - question please just quickly introduce
64:27 - yourself and then ask your question
64:29 - hi Becky ash from Tennessee and what a
64:33 - wonderful idea and culture you've
64:36 - created I wonder if you could
64:39 - um mind read for just a moment with your
64:41 - teachers for us how do you think they
64:44 - would describe their biggest challenge
64:45 - at working at a school like that and
64:48 - what are some of the things that you've
64:49 - done to help them address those
64:52 - great question so let's get let's keep
64:56 - it real
64:57 - running schools and being a teacher is
65:00 - hard work it is hard work pre-pandemic
65:05 - and it is even tougher post pandemic I
65:10 - actually serve as the principal now and
65:12 - I um I ask this question to our teachers
65:14 - all all the time
65:17 - I would I would actually say the biggest
65:19 - challenge
65:21 - um is is ongoing professional
65:23 - development specifically related to CS
65:25 - but our model and this is where I want
65:28 - to dispel some of the myths because at
65:30 - middle school it is way more accessible
65:32 - High School very different our teachers
65:35 - collaborate but what we tell them at the
65:37 - middle school level is its Project based
65:39 - as long as you do the project before the
65:42 - kids you can fail forward with them so
65:44 - it's a learning experience that you
65:46 - don't have to be the expert at and that
65:49 - mentality and mindset are our teachers
65:52 - really really
65:54 - um address and and I think it makes it
65:56 - easier the second thing that makes it
65:58 - easier is they are collaborating
66:00 - um what I have found is that CS teachers
66:03 - doing it by themselves is what makes it
66:06 - really really hard at our Middle School
66:08 - level they collaborate across the grade
66:10 - so it's like wait how did you figure
66:12 - this out I remember our first year a
66:14 - teacher I mean she was running around
66:15 - the building she's like how do I unlock
66:16 - this code and she was so frustrated she
66:18 - went to teachers she actually went to
66:20 - the kids and they figured it out so I
66:22 - think it's the mindset of collaboration
66:25 - not doing it by yourself but teaching is
66:27 - really really hard I think the obstacle
66:30 - for maybe for maybe for others is
66:33 - actually making sure that there is time
66:35 - and space to play these are all like
66:37 - regular teacher challenges time and
66:39 - space to plan and to to collaborate
66:42 - um I think that would that if I if I
66:45 - could uh you know shut the school down
66:46 - for a week and say you have time to
66:48 - collaborate plan and talk to other
66:50 - people that would give our teachers a
66:53 - huge boost of confidence and time and
66:55 - really get them to be excited to teach
66:57 - and tackle the curriculum but you know
66:59 - teaching is hard kids bring all I mean I
67:03 - know this parents send their very best
67:05 - kids to us they they really do
67:08 - and some days it's a lot tougher so I
67:12 - personally don't think teaching computer
67:13 - science is not the challenge just
67:16 - general teaching is a challenge thank
67:18 - you Michelle
67:20 - uh we have time for one more question
67:22 - out there
67:24 - is there another question out there
67:27 - I can't see I just I just see two Bright
67:31 - Lights
67:32 - okay uh right over here okay one more
67:35 - question uh my name is Ben I come from
67:37 - uh Sioux Falls South Dakota
67:39 - and so Upper Midwest right
67:42 - um I'm an informal science educator and
67:44 - so like I go out to the classroom and
67:45 - talk to kids about science but like how
67:48 - do you how do you keep your teachers
67:49 - engaged with that sort of community you
67:51 - said that like a Google engineer should
67:53 - loan you their or Google send an
67:55 - engineer for a couple of years at a time
67:57 - right but how do you keep your teachers
67:58 - engaged with the people that are coding
68:00 - other than watching videos that they
68:02 - might produce for online content
68:05 - so if I hear this right you're saying
68:07 - that they have access but they may not
68:10 - actually feel like authentically engaged
68:14 - and passionate and committed is that
68:15 - right yeah
68:16 - you know I think for us at our school we
68:21 - always always communicate the why
68:24 - um if the why for us is about being
68:27 - Unapologetic college prep and computer
68:30 - science and for us computer science is
68:33 - about we want our Scholars to have the
68:36 - technical skills we want them to create
68:38 - apps in games and websites and do all
68:41 - the things that coders do and we want
68:44 - them to have the computational thinking
68:46 - skills around problem solving
68:49 - communication and collaboration and so I
68:51 - think when you explain for us doing the
68:55 - curriculum doing our work isn't just
68:57 - about okay teach computer science
68:58 - because it's a requirement it's because
69:00 - we want our Scholars to be on the path
69:02 - to College and Career and these are the
69:05 - skills that are really going to break
69:07 - the cycle of poverty they're going to
69:09 - allow our Scholars to be their very best
69:12 - whatever it is and again one more thing
69:14 - I interviewed a hundred high school kids
69:17 - before I opened the school and what they
69:21 - said to me is yeah yeah we hear you on
69:23 - those high paying high demand jobs we
69:25 - want those too but we want to do what we
69:29 - want to do
69:30 - we want to be a doctor a lawyer a
69:34 - veterinarian and so I think for us as
69:37 - Educators we have to explain the why we
69:40 - have to make the connection that these
69:42 - are skills that you are going to need
69:43 - regardless of any passion any career you
69:47 - have and I think for our Educators when
69:50 - you're we are throwing so much at them I
69:52 - mean and I'm I'm guilty of it as well
69:54 - it's like you got to do attendance you
69:56 - got to call the parents you got to do a
69:57 - sunshine heat calls you got to teach
69:58 - computer science I think for us we
70:01 - always want to be grounded in our why we
70:03 - want to listen to to show empathy to be
70:06 - able to support them but at the end of
70:08 - the day it's about being Unapologetic in
70:11 - your why being Unapologetic about what
70:13 - it means for kids and it's not just
70:15 - computer science because it's a high
70:17 - school requirement although it should be
70:18 - it is because we want our kids to have
70:21 - access to College and Career and
70:23 - opportunities let's give a round floss
70:26 - the mache okay thank you that was
70:28 - awesome

Cleaned transcript:

I want to share a few words about our Collective need to reignite the movement for computer science because we've had now three years of a hunkering down through school closures and economic challenges and during the last two years it has not been easy to tell schools that it's time to teach computer science almost anybody doing this work has been like yeah we want to do that but we also need to like figure out how to deal with covet and masks and school closures and zoom and all these other things and that was this new school year begins for all of us that care about the movement for growing computer science in schools one of our top challenges is to make sure administrators leaders School leaders teachers classrooms reignites the interest in teaching computer science in every school and to every child and this is not easy because schools still have so many challenges just trying to reopen dealing with teacher shortages and getting the system back going again I want to talk briefly about something we did this past July that just shows how potent and Powerful the interest in computer science is not only in this country in the United States but in a way that I think has Global resonance back in January the national Governors Association which basically hosts the annual Gathering of the 50 United States Governors decided under the leadership of Arkansas governor ASA Hutchinson to to create a Governor's compact to come together to collectively make a statement in support of computer science and when that happened we had code.org decided if the governors are going to do this we need to bring the private sector as well to get corporate leaders and nonprofit leaders to come together with our government leaders to all say that computer science is important for every child and you know I started recruiting folks from the tech companies and so we we eventually and unsurprisingly got the leaders of the largest tech companies whether it's Apple Microsoft Google and Amazon Facebook and many many many other technology companies to all collectively sign a statement but what was most unique was what we came together when this when this finally launched was not only the technology companies but the largest companies in every single sector of Industry whether it's the largest Airlines the largest phone companies coffee companies like Starbucks shoe companies like Nike Walgreens UPS Walmart you name it all came together behind the idea that computer science needs to be part of the curriculum and not only did these employers representing millions and millions of jobs agreed to to come behind this nonprofits and nonprofit leaders from the College Board to Khan Academy and also the two largest teacher unions in the country came behind the same statement and at and then the next day 50 Governors 45 State Governors plus five territories collectively also signed a statement basically saying that in the United States we need to move to a world where computer science is available and every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science and this Collective coming together of Business Leaders nonprofit leaders government leaders when you sue billion billionaires and unions coming together tech companies who are competitors coming together and groups from every Walk of Life and then Democrat and Republican Governors coming together we showed that computer science is important and we also showed that the United States of America can act United on an issue that is important to our future and what happened is not only did we make this statement every one of these CEOs then tweeted this statement creating a global awareness and all around the world other people said why isn't our country doing this too and this shows that the movement to teach computer science is important and it's important globally it is something we all care about here and as we think about basically the bounce back after the pandemic it's on all of us to share that excitement and to reignite interest in this movement the computer science education movement did not have its best last two years it's been hard because almost everything in education didn't have its best last two years but the rest of this decade are going to be the best years for computer science when we look back at the end of this decade I'm quite confident that we will have reached the points where in the United States every single student has access to computer science in their schools and in Most states it will be mandatory for high school graduation and since there are so many Global computer science leaders here I expect that as we do that in this country many many other countries will be doing the same thing some of them ahead of the United States some of them behind the United States but our goal by the end of this decade should be to have at least 50 countries where every student has access and every student is learning computer science as part of a requirement for high school graduation and so I'm so excited to welcome you here today I I want to let us get along with the agenda we have a packed agenda with some amazing speakers thank you for being here thank you for everything you all do behind this movement for computer science for every student I next want to introduce Lisa Dr Lisa milankovic from Broward County Broward county is the first school district in the United States to adopt computer science in every school and they are the sixth largest District Dr milankovic has been this stem and computer science supervisor and a partner for code.org since our very first year give her a warm Round of Applause and thank you so much I want to welcome you to thank you first of all good morning I am the supervisor of stem and computer science in the applied learning Department with all the other electives but we're more than an elective in computer science and I'll share a little bit of information about that Broward County Public Schools is the nation's sixth largest District and through Partnerships both internal within the district large district and external we have grown computer science from 66 students that took the AP test in 2012. and and very unsuccessful failure of an NSF proposal to try to bring computer science across the whole District to a communitywide culture shift that now supports computer science for all and thanks in part a big part to the partnership in 2013 of code.org coming to our district and kind of saying that they wanted to do everything that the failure of an NSF proposal was going to do and more and then internal collaboration across many departments in Broward schools through CTE and learning departments and I.T and a bunch of different departments have worked on this and our schools itself getting the administration on board and the community with our stem ecosystem and our business Community who volunteers for hour of code and be and along with other days in the classroom and have hackathons and enrichment activities so students know how do they can apply their computer science we have reached thousands of teachers now and their students and I think yesterday when we looked in Tableau we found out that we were reaching more than a hundred thousand students have been reached by our teachers over the years and we couldn't do that without the support of code.org and the National Science Foundation in partnership with our research Partners at University of Chicago University of Florida MIT and digital promise and prior support we've received from Google and the current funding from the state of Florida and of course code.org we've been able to sustain and grow computer science beyond what is typically thought of as CS teachers because we're still at a hundred thousand students not reaching all over 266 000 students in our district we have now trained media Specialists music and art and PE teachers to be computer science teachers as well PE teachers are making fitbits out of micro bits and other wearable devices and having fun with it students are creating with computer science social studies teachers ELA teachers are emphasizing sympathy and computer science for social good through learning about artificial intelligence and digital citizenship and why that's important in ethics and we have initial training for over 2 000 teachers we have 14 000 teachers to go so still working on that and now every student has the opportunity to learn and apply computer science to solve problems so we're getting there but we're not quite there yet and we welcome you to Broward County and to Sunny Fort Lauderdale beach and enjoy your time here I want to start with who's at CS edcon we have 350 participants this year this year we have 50 over 50 people from outside the U.S representing 32 countries countries such as Spain Brazil Chile Thailand Kazakhstan Maldives and Myanmar from the U.S we have 48 states represented including 25 from Florida plus DC the U.S Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and actually I wanted to mention that unfortunately some of our um participants participants from Puerto Rico couldn't attend because obviously the impact of the hurricane uh this session is actually going to be recorded and put on YouTube later so just to our Puerto Rican colleagues you know our hearts are with you we're thinking about you we miss you so many people here are involved in leading District regional state or national initiatives what we brought together at CS edcon are really the the movers and shakers All Around the World in terms of Computer Science Education there are over 200 CEOs directors vice presidents principals superintendents and 150 State Education Agency staff local Education Agency staff Regional staff researchers leaders of nonprofits and Industry Representatives the most special thing about CS edcon are the people and so I want to start out by talking about some of these people and introducing them they don't know that their pictures are about to show up on these slides so we'll start out with zomira May zamira is an education specialist for UNESCO and she'll be moderating a panel on computer science efforts around the world Alan Antoine is the associate director for mathematics and computer science at the Rice University Office of stem engagement Anton will be leading a conversation session on how to increase the participation of black teachers and students Lauren marzillo is an associate professor at Georgia State Lawrence is going to talk about how to teach CS to all preservice education students preservice education teachers Shauna young is the executive director for the scratch Foundation you you all have heard of scratch right she's the executive director for the scratch foundation and we'll be talking about emerging Tech Trends and Innovations in computer science foreign is the associate director of technology and Innovation at actsorn in Thailand a corn is the person to talk to if you're going to be training thousands of teachers over the next couple of years because they've done that in Thailand um in Thailand if you don't know they require computer science every single year every single grade and pecoran had to lead that effort to train all those teachers dimitro zagavrovni is the director general for digital transformation at the Ministry of Education and science of Ukraine talk to dimitro about expanding Computer Science Education in very trying times and dimitro wherever you are out there you know our hearts definitely go out to you and the people of Ukraine during this time so we are so delighted to have you here dimitro will actually be speaking a little bit about uh uh the work in Ukraine uh tomorrow is the global correct coordinator for Africa code week and we'll be talking about raising awareness for computer science across the continent Diana gilhouse is a research fellow at the center for security and emerging technology at Georgetown University and we'll be talking about the workforce and education landscape for AI and cyber security Kathy deerenwater is the chief program officer for the American Indian science and engineering Society and we'll be talking about CS education for indigenous learners and last but not least Maya Israel is an associate professor at the University of Florida and we'll be talking about making CS more inclusive for all students with disabilities whether academic or physical disabilities these are just some of the people I want you to meet as you walk the hallways and the sessions at CS edcon I could go on and on and pick lots of different people but that's why we have a networking session later today as well as a reception this evening I did want to give a special shout out to all of our state superintendents commissioners of Public Instruction and secretaries of Education in attendance today let's give them a round of applause getting 12 State Chiefs on stage for any issue let alone computer science is a very special thing we are delighted to have you all here today now I'd like to introduce you to Sean Roberts code.org vice president of government Affairs Sean thanks thank you Pat and uh welcome to the state of computer science I am so glad that this report is here this year it's really a foundational part of what we do at code.org and we're grateful for the partners we have in supporting us I'm going to actually ask you to do something a little bit different from maybe other talks you're at and please take out your phones um you can take them out uh both because we're going to need them here in just a few moments but also there's like 30 chance I might fall off the end of the stage with the lights here and that would make a great Tick Tock so feel free to take them out for that also as you're taking pictures you know feel free I'll give you a couple poses here to get started this is me making a real Salient point on the state of computer science here's me dealing with a Heckler in the front row all right um okay as I said uh great to be here great to talk about the state of Cs report uh with you all this year um very glad to have uh the partners we we do we've seen tremendous growth in in state policy in making computer science a requirement for graduation and this year's report addresses some of those early results we've seen and provide some recommendation and guidance around it so I'm going to get into that a little bit before we move on to our coauthors who are also joining me up here but first I want to thank everyone who made this report possible including all of you the work you do in your communities and districts and states the state of computer science is a collaborative effort between us at code.org the computer science Teachers Association and expanding Computing education Pathways this year's report was made possible by cognizant and our supporters of Computer Science Education please give those organizations uh this is the sixth year of the state of Cs report and one of the things we wanted to do is take a step back and reframe the foundational nature of computer science looking back we've come an extremely long way in the past five years so in 2017 just seven states across the U.S had standards for Computer Science Education just seven five years later 43 states have standards for Computer Science Education it's hard to believe and beyond that 27 States now require schools to teach computer science think about that for a second yeah five years ago only seven states even defined computer science now we're at a point where the majority of States think it's so important that it has to be taught in their schools let's take a moment to celebrate that how about a hand for our students parents teachers principals districts and state that have made this possible and let's spread the word about this let's get this going so there's a QR code this is where you can use your phone and if you can scan the code and let's help spread the word about this milestone in the state of Cs report in your communities and nationally so if you have Twitter take out your phone it'll lead you to a tweet that you can retweet and we can let people know that the majority of States now require computer science in their schools if this is possible to achieve in five years so as we talked about you know we had seven states that defined computer science and now we're at the majority of States requiring it in their schools if we could accomplish that in five years I'm really excited to see what the next five years could bring stronger scores and reading and math as we know that computer science correlates with better test scores and reading and Math and Science and dozens of Studies have shown what if every high school student in the country had a fundamental understanding of how the algorithms that influence and are shaping their lives every day are working unfortunately not every student has that opportunity today we have more schools than ever offering computer science courses but is it really Equitable access when only 32 percent of our students are young women this trend also continues at the postsecondary level as well more CS degrees are being awarded than ever but women share of those degrees are increasing only incrementally and this continues postgraduation too at the current rate it would take over 100 years for computing jobs to achieve balanced gender representation of course this isn't just about tech jobs it's the foundational nature of computer science that students will need to thrive regardless of their future courses of study or their careers but it starts in our schools certainly and the work you all do what if there was a way we could accelerate that growth well these states have South Carolina Maryland and Mississippi are the only states in the country to have achieved above 40 percent participation by young women in computer science courses how have they done that well you might guess they each have some form of requirement for computer science Maryland and Mississippi have computer science or technology requirements and most of those courses above 90 percent of those courses are computer science South Carolina instituted their graduation requirement and had more young women take a computer science course this year than North Carolina Florida Alabama and Georgia combined they're about the same number of young women taking a computer science course this year in South Carolina than there are in the entire state of Texas Texas is a population of about 30 million South Carolina is about 5 million and what's more is a funny thing happening in South Carolina after the computer science graduation requirement went into effect graduation rates have actually gone up eliminating gender disparities in high school computer science access is no longer a 20year incremental issue where hopefully we'll make progress and we won't plateau and we'll see small stepbystep progress it's achievable in five years as these states have shown computer science is necessary it engages students and their academics and supports learning in other subjects that's what we want out of graduation requirements and states are recognizing this five states across the country now require students to take computer science for graduation Tennessee Nebraska and Arkansas all pass theirs recently and those states are scheduled to begin implementing over the next few years when they'll join South Carolina and Nevada at a point where every student will learn computer science we'll have more sessions and discussions on this over the next few days to talk about what we've seen in these states we'll hear from some of these states we'll hear from students and their experience and why computer science makes sense as a graduation requirement policy makers Advocates and education leaders have to make this a priority though see computer science is a graduation requirement isn't an ending that's not the end goal like we get there in these states and then we're done as I'm sure these states will tell you but it's a beginning step toward ensuring students have the foundational skills that they'll need it's a responsibility that's up to all of us and of course this isn't possible without teachers in the classroom it being a beginning then it's going to be up to teachers and we're going to rely on teachers to continue to make sure students are getting high quality Computer Science Education instruction that's why we're honored to coauthor the report with the computer science Teachers Association so please join me in welcoming one of my fellow coauthors Jake Baskin executive director of the computer science Teachers Association I owe someone a drink tonight um thanks Sean thanks for setting the stage for that and welcoming amount welcoming me on stage and before I jump in I want to just take a second and give a shout out to past csta board member Janice Mack although her term on the board just came to an end in July she's continued to serve our organization by Leading our contributions to this report over the last several months so I just want to say a huge thank you to Janice for all of your work on this report let's give her a round of applause now Sean you've made a pretty compelling case for the impact of States implementing a graduation requirement it's really clear to me from the data that you've shown and what we see in the report that these states have seen a dramatic shift in who takes at least one computer science course and especially a shift in how young women and nonbinary students engage in CS but before everyone in this room walks away thinking this is going to be easy I'll just make it CS graduation requirement next year I want to take a moment and recognize that none of these changes would be possible without one key group the amazing computer science teachers that bring these courses to life in fact at csta we know from our reach to the teacher census that among computer science teachers there's strong support for states to enact graduation requirements when implemented thoughtfully and that thoughtfully part is important here from this year's report we know that still only 53 percent of schools offer even one foundational computer science course and just 5.6 percent of students took a computer science course last year in order to make graduation requirements a reality we're going to need to see those numbers change dramatically and states are going to need to get serious about investing in teacher development with an eye towards career long support in fact we've been talking a lot about South Carolina this morning and at csta we're really proud of the work we've done with our South Carolina chapter the Department of Education and the Citadel to support teachers with an annual cspd week event for the past three years where each summer hundreds of teachers have come together to learn not only how to start teaching CS but to continue to deepen their understanding of how to teach equitably and inclusively in the Cs classroom year after year and as everyone in this room begins to plan for things like graduation requirements or other new policies in your state I want you to know that csta is here to help with keyword resources that all policy makers and state department staff should be aware of beyond the work we do directly with teachers in every one of your States we have brought the community together to define the characteristics of high quality Computer Science teaching through the csta standards for CS teachers we have a regularly updated list of accredited professional development providers and opportunities that support teachers in meeting these standards and working towards implementing high quality inclusive and Equitable Computer Science teaching in their classrooms and we verified curricular alignments to the csta standards for K12 computer science which nearly everyone in this room has used as the base for your own state standards for CS all of these tools are key to ensuring that when CS graduation requirements are implemented they don't become just another computer science class in name only and making sure that your students your teachers are receiving the high quality support that they and their students deserve because at the end of the day as I said to start this teachers are the key to making sure that all students not only have access to but are engaging in and succeeding in a foundational K12 CS education and I for one cannot wait to welcome the next wave of computer science teachers to our world's largest computer science department so next I'm looking forward to turning it over to Josh Childs from esep to share a little bit more about some specific State policy Trends thanks everyone thank you Jake yo someone else to drink uh before I begin talking about uh policy Trends I want to give a special shout out to Dr Carol Fletcher and Sarah Dunn part of our esep team that have helped lead the efforts around producing the reports so thank you to very much for the efforts you did in this so there's a lot to be excited about there's a lot of positivity moving in States and there's some current policy Trends I want to talk about that I think can help lead us over the next few days in an incoming year upcoming year when it comes to Computer Science Education so let's look about back over the last five years since 2017 we've seen increases in things such as state level funding for computer science increases in state plans for K12 computer science and most importantly high schools requiring to provide Computer Science Education in five years the work of State leaders District level leaders Community efforts families have led to these increases that we are seeing across the country today that's something to be excited about but some that deserves a round of applause not now and why I say not now is the work is not done there's more work that needs to that is required and more states that we have to see increase efforts around computer science education and hopefully that will be our goal over the next year and years to come so I want to highlight two states Kentucky for one Kentucky in the house there we go I'm sorry not in the house and Pat's house my apologies and Pat's house so Kentucky centering equity producing uh uh our annual report that measures the Equitable outcomes and participation of students in computer science education to see where they're missing the mark and seeing what needs to be done to provide resources and strategies to see improvements and increases in computer science education participation and then Louisiana Louisiana where you at there we go there we go let the good times roll Louisiana that's Double Down efforts and provided recommendations around professional development of teachers and thinking about ways in which again how do we increase access and participation of our students in computer science education these are just two states that are in the report that you can learn from and see what they've done over the last year to see how they've thought about increasing access and participation pure science and then how do we learn from States like Indiana that have done marvelous jobs around implementation and thinking about ways in which they can get 91 of their students to attend at least a high school attend who attended high school that offers a foundational uh computer science course so how do we learn from one another how do we learn from other states when it comes to improving Computer Science Education even there are important questions that we need to ask as we move forward in this work and so I have four of them here from a cape framework that we've used over the last several years to think about how do we Center and move in Equitable ways so that students all students no matter background no more the family they come from no matter what their communities are that they can also have the opportunities to experience what can come from Computer Science Education questions like do districts in all areas have the resources to offer CS to train and certify teachers and what would that look like RCS courses offered in lowincome schools at similar rates to other schools are we doing enough to make sure that everyone has access which subgroups are underrepresented in our CS courses who's missing there are opportunities that exist there and how we flip the narrative not from a deficit perspective of these students but how do we think about the opportunities they provide by attending and being part of our CS classrooms and finally how does the quality instruction differ across subgroups of students and how does that affect learning and speaking from a state level perspective how do we equip and Empower our state leaders invested in our state houses or state Departments of Education to continue to support and dive in and provide resources around CS education there's a lot to be excited about there's also a lot more work to do and I hope you'll join all of us in helping move this work forward thank you thanks please reach out to us if with any questions about the report as you're going through uh thank you for your support of computer science please share the report far and wide hard copies are available if you didn't get one already hard copies are available out by registration so please pick one up if you haven't received one this year's report reflects continued progress in computer science education through the work and support of teachers as we heard from Jake and an advancing State policies as we heard from Josh it also provides us with a sobering reminder of how far we have to go but thanks to the leading States in computer science we know that our shared vision of every student in every school having the opportunity to learn computer science is not wishful thinking decades from now we do however have to act on that opportunity and that time is now thank you all I want to introduce to the stage Dr Christina Grant the state superintendent of education for Washington D.C good morning oh we can do better than that good morning too many Educators in the room to not have a good good morning I bring you greetings from the nation's capital Washington DC uh it is I'm geeked out to be here because it is always a joy as a state chief to be able to celebrate one of your schools and um there's an amazing story that I hope you hear more about this school but the joy of my morning is to tell you about one of my students and so Quran Owens has attended D.C public schools his entire life he's an honor roll student he's one of 540 Scholars from Southeast DC who has chosen to enroll in a public charter school digital Pioneers Academy remember that name thunders in the room remember that name anyone who wants to move to DC remember that name but the important part of the school is that is explicitly focused on computer science and computer science education Quran and his classmates are by Design Pioneers they embody the spirit of the school the spirit of our values in Washington DC and they are forging a path for Computer Science Education that will transform their Futures transform our district and transform the world digital Pioneers Academy is unapologetically committed to ensuring our students are prepared for college that they are grounded in high quality instructions in computer science and that they receive an entire whole rounded education for all of their students please join me send him a lot of love this is very hard for adults to do and so one could imagine that he may be a little nervous but please welcome to the stage digital Pioneers Academy's founding scholar Quran Owens you got this uh good morning I'm Karan Owens from Southeast Washington DC I'm the oldest of my siblings and love attending digital Pioneers Academy because of the schools Computer Science Focus in our caring teachers I enjoy creating and building and quoting an anime when I graduate from DPA I want to earn a full scholarship to a top 10 school for Esports and prepare for a career as a coder I also want to volunteer as a mentor to Young students in computer science and create virtual reality experiences like Dungeons and Dragons I am very excited to introduce our school founder and leader Michelle Ashton the thing I appreciate most about Miss Ashton is that she really knows me and cares about my growth and happiness I am grateful to go to a school where I feel known loved and respected which is a key part of our culture my experience is that DPA is a school that really lives its values which are accountability growth ownership optimism Innovation and empathy performance as an open Digital Pioneers Academy in 2018 she spent over two decades working to improve Urban education across the country most recently as CEO of the Newark Charter School fund Miss Ashton graduated from William and Mary College and began her career as a special education teacher in my hometown of southeast Washington DC she also understands what it means to be a middle school student firsthand she is the parent of twin sixth graders please welcome my principal Ms Ashton Quran a round of applause my heart is so warm thank you Quran good morning everyone I am so excited to be here at Cs edcon and to get this opportunity to speak to a room full of Educators and policy leaders who share my passion for computer science and education at my school we send snaps if something I say resonates with you if I start struggling up here you can send me some magic I'll take all the magic all the snaps my journey um to founding a computer science focused School began way back when I was growing up in New Jersey I met my New Jersey people I think they were back here woohoo any Eagles fans Fly Eagles Fly okay okay so I'm focused I'm focused all right so one of the pivotal moments in my life happened in a small conference room at my elementary school the principal had convened a little meeting to share the news that my sister and I had failed the school year and we would need to repeat the grade to this day I remember the look of anger in my mom's eyes this did not happen in third or fourth grade my identical twin sister and I were in kindergarten yes and you won't know anything about kindergarten kids are not supposed to fail kindergarten I must have just colored Outside the Lines or broke all the rules I'm still kind of doing that but anyway failing kindergarten impacted my direction and my career in two very important ways the first is it exposed me to school choice I believe that parents should have a choice and if you look at my resume you'll see that I'm the crazy Charter School person and I want to just tell you right now there are some good charter schools and there are some bad charter schools there are some good traditional public schools and there are some bad traditional Public Schools what I know is our parents want Great Schools regardless of the title and the name but once my mom learned that they plan to hold my sister and I back she searched and worked diligently to until she found another school that would meet our needs my parents knew the school what we were assigned to was not a good fit and they had the agency or maybe the audacity and they knew they had the agency to find something better for their children I believe that every family and every scholar deserves that in Washington DC students have that choice more than half of our students who attend Polk School are either enrolled in a traditional public school or a public charter school for Charter Schools they apply and they are they get in through a lottery every family and every scholar deserves this opportunity the second impact failing kindergarten had on me it is that it is it forever altered the perception I had of myself at an early age I was told that I was not smart a school that creates that feeling in a child is it a school that any child should attend I would never want my own children Duke and Dylan who are twins starting Middle School to have this experience and if it is not acceptable for my kids it is not acceptable for anyone's kids in case you are wondering spoiler alert I turned out okay in fact my sister and I found our way through Elementary School we were successful in school and Athletics we were both the first AfricanAmerican women soccer players at the College of William and Mary yes she I went on to grad school at William Mary she went on to grad school at Harvard so I think back to that kindergarten teacher I know her name I have a picture I haven't hunted her down yet she just made a mistake we all fail sometimes and in fact I graduated from college and I got my first job as a special education teacher at Ian beers Elementary right in Washington DC but after teaching I spent 15 years working for various roles in leadership all across the country including the CEO of the Newark Charter School fund but my family moved back to Washington DC in 2016 to be closer to family but professionally I wasn't exactly sure what I would do next and this is where computer science enters my life one day I promise you I read one article about how Innovation is changing the world economy in ways that were unimaginable a decade ago this fourth Industrial Revolution based on technological advances in artificial intelligence robotics biotechnology in which transforming how we live and how we work today and how our children live and how they will work in the future in DC I read that there were 10 000 vacancies for HighTech highpaying jobs in the metro area that would pay a salary of over a hundred thousand dollars that's real money y'all and to put that salary in perspective at our school 98 of our Scholars are eligible for free and reduced lunch to qualify in D.C a family of four has to make less than fifty one thousand dollars these aren't just jobs these are careers and they are careers that can break the cycle of poverty and build generational wealth an opportunity that black and brown families have not had due to years of systemic racism and oppression this realization fundamentally shifted my perspective about the importance of computer science education for students especially for low income and workingclass Families I now believe that computer science should be a course that begins as early as Elementary School it's snap if you agree because I think this is the room that agrees it should be a core subject like math and eoa snap if you agree it should be a core class not just an elective snap if you agree it should be a core class not just an afterschool program snap if you agree it should be a high school graduation requirement snap if you agree a computer science education should not be for just kids who attend affluent private schools or Suburban schools it should be for all students CS for all for real snap if you agree as in many of our nation cities in DC there is a huge gap between those who are prepared for this rapidly evolving economy and those who are not digital Pioneers Academy operates in one of the most underresourced communities in Washington DC in Ward 7 and 8. the unemployment rate in these areas was nearly three times the national average in only 1 in 10 adults have attained a college degree I think this is similar for many cities across the country but for me I find myself grappling with this dichotomy incredible career opportunities for young people in our city and many many young people in my city who look like me who are not being adequately educated for these jobs and these opportunities that did not sit well with me at all it actually didn't just sit poorly it felt like a call to action every child in DC should have the opportunity to pursue one of these highpaying high demand jobs and have the schooling to prepare them to excel at one of those jobs so what was I going to do about it I fought back to my own experience my parents were able to find the right school for my sister and I to Excel and to be prepared to do whatever career we hope to pursue every parent should have the ability to do that for their child snap if you agree okay so here I was it was 2017 and the idea for digital Pioneers Academy was born in the months after that I developed a 500 page yes 500 page Charter application that outlined this vision for a computer science immersion school where every child would take computer science and we adopted a curriculum that emphasized computational thinking skills like problem solving collaboration and critical thinking we had this amazing Mission around developing the next generation of innovators but I needed to Define innovation we came up with this innovators think thoughtfully creatively and critically about solving complex problems and this is a complex problems problem and there were three things that we needed to do to figure out how we were going to offer our kids from Southeast Washington DC a rigorous computer science experience Talent curriculum and culture on Talent we needed a strategy to recruit retain and train our best teachers when I developed the idea of DPA at that time there were there were no schools that I could find that required computer science as a core part of the program and a story I always tell is I actually went to csta that's where I met Pat and I was looking for all the computer science teachers I was going to steal them from all of your places I was gonna lure them to to DC to have helped found the school that we were going to change the world and guess what I found a whole bunch of Math teachers science teachers social studies teachers who love computer science and we're teaching and learning computer science along with our Scholars and I thought man this is a real problem and it's a tremendous opportunity the Second Challenge we had was curriculum we had to bag borrow and steal from the best because that's what innovators do so we decided early on that we were not going to be curriculum experts while we navigate the founding of a CS immersion school we would let co.org and code HS and others figure out the curriculum page in fact we decide to partner with Republic in in Tennessee and we use code.org to supplement our Middle School rigorous curriculum Fifth Third piece and this is really important we had to figure out the culture we had to live our values of empathy and growth at DPA when we say growth we mean fat ass play along with me failure and difficulty is opportunity for growth and feedback fat ass that's what we mean you fail a lot in computer science we had to get our Scholars with the right mindset that failing and failing forward is what great computer scientists do our value on empathy was around creating this known love respected community our Scholars had to feel safe to take risks and to share their ideas we are trying to change history and prove that all kids but particularly kids from the most underresourced parts of our city can be the next generation of innovators that they can change the face of Technology with 83 percent of our Tech Executives being white we have to do more if we are going to change that data our kids have to feel confident they have to feel safe they have to believe that they can be computer scientists you have to create a school that feels that the biggest obstacle to taking computer science then isn't just our teachers teaching computer science it includes this aspect this confidence and this opportunity students have to believe that they can have these jobs this goes for students of color women students in rural communities and underresourced communities everyone a school that focuses on computer science tries to bridge all of these gaps at the end of the day we believe that DPA is proving that a school like ours should exist for all Scholars but particularly for those who come for our utmost under resource communities okay I have just a couple more points if this is great you can blame Pat if it's bad you can blame Pat too so I'm just going to say this is his house my last point so going back to when I prepared to open DPA I visited various elementary schools to share with students and parents about our school and our mission to develop the next generation of innovators I distinctly remember visiting Ketchum Elementary and meeting Quran and his mom who's here with us today as they were considering yes give a shout out to Quran and his mom I also happy with me two of my Scholars Ms Fields and Jasmine are here as well when I talk to them about computer science and coding and Robotics quran's mom said to me this is the perfect school for my son DPA represented a new school choice option for Quran and students in the area one that was focused on computer science had smaller classes and is committed to a culture of every scholar and every staff feeling known loved and respected we opened our doors with 120 scholars in Fall of 2018. our incredible team of Educators and leaders had dedicated themselves to our students and having them be creators in this digital world not just consumers we may have students who will contribute to technology needing to send people to Mars sitting in Miss Harding's class right now I firmly believe that I have Scholars who will become household names founding the next Dell or apple or next Google or the next Tick Tock or SnapChat they are they are at digital Pioneers Academy I believe it I had the faith that these dreams are becoming a reality because I know that providing our Scholars an opportunity that most students in this country unfortunately aren't receiving which is why as a country we have to shift for computer science for all for real the idea of computer science and you won't you guys may agree with this or not but this is what I talk to folks who don't know computer science this is they say it is so daunting but in 2020 as some of the data shared there were only 423 exams that were taken for AP Computer Science in high school students in DC we have 120 students per grade if 100 of our Scholars take the AP Computer Science exam before they leave High School which is our goal we would increase those numbers by 25 percent this goal and this reality is very close we can do it but part of what makes this goal seem so daunting is what people think about computer science instruction they imagine an intensive boot camp coding classes and it feels very Out Of Reach I'm here to tell you that in the Middle School level computer science is very accessible we don't have dedicated computer science teachers at DPA our Math teachers teach math and computer science and they incorporate projectbased learning into the concepts of the curriculum the teachers love it and so do our Scholars we start early because it's helpful to think of computer science as a foreign language the malleability of our Scholars young brains means that earlier you introduce the material the stickier it becomes you don't expect students to become fluent in Spanish with just four years of high school Spanish but if you immerse them in it they will when they are young they that's another story entirely and here's a brutal facts in high school it is different we cannot expect our algebra and geometry teachers to teach computer science you need a certified computer science teacher at least someone with industry experience who knows the content and to get real with this group the biggest challenge we face in DPA and not not at DPA but across the country is expanding the number of computer science teachers and as we all know we have a K12 teacher shortage alone this shortage is even more acute for computer science teachers and at DPA we put out all the stops to recruit the best and brightest to teach computer science I'm at a policy expert but I know this I'll leave the details to you in this audience to figure out how do we get more teachers to teach computer science but you did give me the mic so I'm going to take this opportunity to share a cup couple ideas that I have first we must embark on a national initiative where tech companies lend us their employees in public schools for a year or two if you give me a Google engineer for two years who gets to keep his nice Google salary and I get to turn I I then get to have them teach with our teachers share their knowledge to improve our teacher capacity that would help us second we do need to dedicate more resources to Computer Science Education the federal government state departments and cities need to provide grants to help build the entire Talent pipeline from high school teachers to Tech Teacher prep providers at the school level we have to experiment with signing bonus higher pay and other Financial ways to lower computer science teachers into public schools I think teaching is the world's most fulfilling and meaningful profession but if we are going to compete with tech companies for a small pool of talent we are going to lose and with that here's my last Point hold on before I leave you I want to bring you back to what really matters and that is our students do you have my uh picture perfect and I want to remind you why I believe so strongly in computer science as the ticket to the 21st century indulge me for a minute these are our founders this is our last day of our end of our first year these Scholars are the future of technology they are the future of innovation and right now they are with us today but back at home there's a scholar that you know there's a school that you know there's a community I need you to put them on your shoulder today as you go through this conference because they need you to be bold they need you to dream big and they need you to break all the rules one last question how many of you raise your hand know of Jeff Bezos anybody know of Jeff Bezos oh okay okay I heard that how many of you guys though keep your head raised I can't really see you but I I can hear you uh how many of you guys know Elon Musk anybody okay hands are raised all right all right here we go how many of you have heard of David Stewart anybody no that's exactly what I thought David Stewart is the CEO of worldwide technology and he is the second richest black man in America he was born in poverty in the segregated South and now he is worth six billion I said billion dollars he should be a household name and yet as I just proved he had he wasn't I want students like Quran to become a world last coder I want students like Jasmine to develop advances in space travel I want students like Samaya Ballard to be Forbes 30 under 30. and at digital Pioneers Academy you will find classrooms where teachers are are not they're not speaking at the podium like me I'm thanks for indulging me but in our classrooms you will see teachers serving as coaches and guides and students doing authentic work so on that note I want you all to commit to keeping those Scholars on your shoulder as you network as we have happy hour as we figure out how to make CS for all for real and I want to and challenge you to do two things computer science should be a graduation requirement for all kids snap if you agree and here's my last challenge I bought my Scholars and our parents here we have to have parents as partners in this effort to bring CS for all for real it is a great start I mean I actually can't believe all these State Chiefs are here today you guys literally run the whole country uh it is the idea that you all are here on this topic of Cs you all have such a tremendous opportunity and I challenge you to keep the scholars at your on your shoulder but to network to know that you're not by yourself we can do this see all CS for all for real thank you foreign thank you for that glimpse into uh a beautiful future that's actually now we hope that there are more schools like digital Pioneers Academy there are more kids like Jasmine and Quran uh more parents like their parents who chose to send their schools to digital Pioneers Academy and obviously more folks like you we have some time for a couple questions we have some mic Runners so if you have a question about like what it looks like for all students to learn computer science year after year after year please ask a question um and unfortunately the lights are right in my eyes uh but uh if our micrunners could put their hands up and yeah and if you have a question you can put your hand up when you when you have when you have a question please just quickly introduce yourself and then ask your question hi Becky ash from Tennessee and what a wonderful idea and culture you've created I wonder if you could um mind read for just a moment with your teachers for us how do you think they would describe their biggest challenge at working at a school like that and what are some of the things that you've done to help them address those great question so let's get let's keep it real running schools and being a teacher is hard work it is hard work prepandemic and it is even tougher post pandemic I actually serve as the principal now and I um I ask this question to our teachers all all the time I would I would actually say the biggest challenge um is is ongoing professional development specifically related to CS but our model and this is where I want to dispel some of the myths because at middle school it is way more accessible High School very different our teachers collaborate but what we tell them at the middle school level is its Project based as long as you do the project before the kids you can fail forward with them so it's a learning experience that you don't have to be the expert at and that mentality and mindset are our teachers really really um address and and I think it makes it easier the second thing that makes it easier is they are collaborating um what I have found is that CS teachers doing it by themselves is what makes it really really hard at our Middle School level they collaborate across the grade so it's like wait how did you figure this out I remember our first year a teacher I mean she was running around the building she's like how do I unlock this code and she was so frustrated she went to teachers she actually went to the kids and they figured it out so I think it's the mindset of collaboration not doing it by yourself but teaching is really really hard I think the obstacle for maybe for maybe for others is actually making sure that there is time and space to play these are all like regular teacher challenges time and space to plan and to to collaborate um I think that would that if I if I could uh you know shut the school down for a week and say you have time to collaborate plan and talk to other people that would give our teachers a huge boost of confidence and time and really get them to be excited to teach and tackle the curriculum but you know teaching is hard kids bring all I mean I know this parents send their very best kids to us they they really do and some days it's a lot tougher so I personally don't think teaching computer science is not the challenge just general teaching is a challenge thank you Michelle uh we have time for one more question out there is there another question out there I can't see I just I just see two Bright Lights okay uh right over here okay one more question uh my name is Ben I come from uh Sioux Falls South Dakota and so Upper Midwest right um I'm an informal science educator and so like I go out to the classroom and talk to kids about science but like how do you how do you keep your teachers engaged with that sort of community you said that like a Google engineer should loan you their or Google send an engineer for a couple of years at a time right but how do you keep your teachers engaged with the people that are coding other than watching videos that they might produce for online content so if I hear this right you're saying that they have access but they may not actually feel like authentically engaged and passionate and committed is that right yeah you know I think for us at our school we always always communicate the why um if the why for us is about being Unapologetic college prep and computer science and for us computer science is about we want our Scholars to have the technical skills we want them to create apps in games and websites and do all the things that coders do and we want them to have the computational thinking skills around problem solving communication and collaboration and so I think when you explain for us doing the curriculum doing our work isn't just about okay teach computer science because it's a requirement it's because we want our Scholars to be on the path to College and Career and these are the skills that are really going to break the cycle of poverty they're going to allow our Scholars to be their very best whatever it is and again one more thing I interviewed a hundred high school kids before I opened the school and what they said to me is yeah yeah we hear you on those high paying high demand jobs we want those too but we want to do what we want to do we want to be a doctor a lawyer a veterinarian and so I think for us as Educators we have to explain the why we have to make the connection that these are skills that you are going to need regardless of any passion any career you have and I think for our Educators when you're we are throwing so much at them I mean and I'm I'm guilty of it as well it's like you got to do attendance you got to call the parents you got to do a sunshine heat calls you got to teach computer science I think for us we always want to be grounded in our why we want to listen to to show empathy to be able to support them but at the end of the day it's about being Unapologetic in your why being Unapologetic about what it means for kids and it's not just computer science because it's a high school requirement although it should be it is because we want our kids to have access to College and Career and opportunities let's give a round floss the mache okay thank you that was awesome
