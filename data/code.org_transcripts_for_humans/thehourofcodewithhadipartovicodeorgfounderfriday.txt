00:00 - how did you get so interested to make a
00:02 - whole company um that's a great question
00:05 - and it's so great to see the classroom
00:07 - from Maine in elementary school hi
00:09 - everybody so how did I decide to start a
00:12 - company at code.org didn't start out as
00:15 - a big sort of effort to start a company
00:18 - add it started out really just as a
00:20 - hobby frankly I just thought people
00:22 - should learn computer science and this
00:24 - is something that should be done in
00:25 - every school but before making into a
00:27 - company I decided I'd just like a video
00:30 - and say this is important and that video
00:32 - ended up being very very popular at at
00:36 - least for somebody who had never done
00:38 - some type this before that video got
00:40 - seen by 13 million people and 10,000
00:43 - teachers said we want this in our
00:44 - classrooms and at the time I didn't have
00:47 - a company I just had a video but once
00:49 - 10,000 teachers wanted it that really is
00:52 - what inspired me to start what really is
00:54 - today's code or I've decided if 10,000
00:56 - teachers want this in their classrooms
00:57 - somebody should spend the time to make
01:00 - the right courses and to help bring
01:02 - something to the teachers so the
01:05 - teachers who decided to to bring
01:06 - computer sizes their classrooms was
01:08 - really what inspired me to start code
01:10 - argh all right Kim do can you ask a
01:15 - question from your classroom yes hi hi
01:20 - no mirrors gone okay so your name hello
01:23 - I'm normal hi MA okay I'm in fourth
01:30 - grade what state to relive it then i
01:34 - live in the united states specifically
01:37 - new jersey okay my mom which of the
01:43 - puzzles are you most proud of um you
01:48 - know we've made so many different
01:49 - tutorials and activities at code.org is
01:52 - it's hard to pick which ones are my
01:53 - favorites I was awesome to that are
01:56 - really like David's one is the Star Wars
01:58 - tutorial that we released last year that
02:00 - the reason I like that so much as the
02:02 - star wars was one of my favorite things
02:04 - growing up and actually when I was
02:06 - growing up I didn't have access to watch
02:08 - the movies because western movies
02:10 - weren't even available where I was
02:12 - living in
02:13 - Middle East but I i had read books about
02:17 - the movies and i was so excited when i
02:19 - came to america to actually watch these
02:20 - movies that I'd read about and so now 30
02:24 - years later getting a chance to build a
02:25 - tutorial with the team that made Star
02:28 - Wars to you know drive around r2d2 with
02:31 - the code you wrote was one of my
02:32 - favorite things to make and it's really
02:34 - fun to play my second other really
02:37 - favorite thing we've built is a tool
02:38 - called apt lab and that's designed for
02:40 - slightly older kids who've already
02:42 - started learning some coding all but if
02:45 - you get good from doing the iris code i
02:46 - highly recommend checking out applab it
02:49 - let's see Miss relapse and put on your
02:51 - phone and make all sorts of things with
02:53 - its pad so it's not really a puzzle or
02:56 - that doesn't feel as much like a game
02:58 - it's like the course but it's really
03:00 - shows off with optical coating and being
03:03 - able to make whatever you want to make
03:06 - all right add next classroom and can you
03:11 - unmute yourself yes and by the way I
03:17 - want to apologize to the folks streaming
03:19 - on youtube I had a little bit of trouble
03:21 - starting the broadcaster's now about 50
03:24 - different classrooms that are watching
03:26 - us but they can't ask questions at so
03:29 - thank you for for bearing with me
03:31 - patiently while we got this started all
03:33 - right go ahead hi I'm Audrey and I'm
03:37 - from his manifest classroom and from
03:40 - elementary school and we were wondering
03:43 - if you were familiar with Ada Lovelace
03:46 - yes I am familiar with Ada Lovelace and
03:48 - there's a really interesting story about
03:50 - this M Ada Lovelace is one of the very
03:53 - first computer programmers and what's
03:56 - interesting about her first of all is
03:58 - that for birthdays I think in two days
03:59 - so add I mean she's long past but today
04:04 - we're celebrating the birthday of grace
04:06 - hopper who is one of the most famous
04:08 - computer scientists from the 1940s Ada
04:10 - Lovelace lived in the 1800s and she is
04:15 - one of the first computer programmers
04:16 - wrote a computer program before
04:18 - computers existed and the reason that's
04:20 - relevant is because computers
04:22 - programming and computer science isn't
04:24 - just about making apps and technology is
04:27 - also about
04:27 - problem solving and and AB she was
04:30 - basically creating algorithms and
04:32 - writing code without an actual computer
04:34 - she just had the idea of what a computer
04:37 - could do and she was writing the code
04:38 - for that and she's one of the most
04:40 - famous computer scientists of all time I
04:42 - also personally think it's cool that the
04:44 - first known computer programmer was a
04:46 - woman because as you may or may not know
04:49 - today most computer programmers among
04:51 - adults are men and that's something
04:54 - code.org and the hour of code is totally
04:56 - going to change you know if you look at
04:58 - who's coding in elementary schools it's
05:00 - almost 5050 boys and girls because girls
05:03 - can do it just as well as boys and I
05:05 - hope you decide to go coding beyond just
05:08 - this classroom at when you get older in
05:10 - middle school in high school do you
05:13 - think you would have been drenched do I
05:15 - think what you think you would have been
05:17 - friends with Ada Lovelace I think I
05:19 - would have been friends of Ada Lovelace
05:21 - if I was alive maybe I might have been
05:23 - em or if she was alive right now I
05:26 - definitely would want to be friends with
05:27 - her thank you all right Amy I'm meeting
05:37 - your classroom Amy actually you need to
05:45 - unmute its to ask a question
05:54 - okay my name is Valerie and I'm from
05:58 - Falmouth Elementary School in fifth
06:01 - grade my question is how many hours a
06:03 - day do you code how many hours of day
06:07 - two I code I don't code every day or in
06:11 - ours because you know right now I run a
06:13 - company now that is doing this work so
06:15 - you know the coding that I do is more
06:18 - effectively trying our own tutorials to
06:20 - make sure that they're they're good
06:21 - enough and making sure that they work
06:23 - the way I'd like them to but the actual
06:25 - website we have I'm not the chief coder
06:29 - we actually have a team of people
06:30 - there's actually 25 people at code.org
06:32 - that are either designing curriculum and
06:35 - courses or they're building the website
06:37 - and actually implementing things like
06:40 - that you know the minecraft tutorial it
06:42 - that you may have played or the our apt
06:44 - lab courses or everything else on korg
06:47 - but you know i started coding when i was
06:50 - 10 and I've never stopped so it's one of
06:51 - my favorite things to do but I
06:53 - unfortunate i'll do it all the time I've
06:55 - made a lot of apps with our little
06:56 - applab tool though and I love playing
07:00 - with all the hour of code tutorials I
07:02 - just made it my own he's the minecraft
07:04 - designer recently have you guys tried
07:06 - the new minecraft designer that came out
07:08 - this just as past few weeks my favorite
07:15 - thing about that is that you can change
07:16 - what the different characters can do so
07:19 - you can make sheep and chicken that go
07:21 - chase after zombies so make sure if you
07:23 - try to use that you you use you know one
07:26 - of the best things about coding is that
07:27 - you can change the rules you know in the
07:30 - real world there's all sorts of rules
07:31 - when you're coding you can kind of
07:33 - design whatever you want and make up
07:35 - your own rules and that's part of what
07:37 - we want to do with the minecraft
07:38 - designer which is to let you you know do
07:41 - whatever you want with in Minecraft the
07:43 - Sheep can not have wool you can you know
07:46 - shear the sheep and instead get diamonds
07:49 - out of them and the chickens can lay
07:50 - gold and they're zombies and creepers
07:53 - can attack each other and you can do
07:55 - whatever you want with it thank you Amy
08:00 - alright Justin the ad is your classroom
08:03 - have a question yes yes how do you do on
08:06 - decade okay
08:08 - those are the computers you can see them
08:09 - out there hi dad um sorry guys from
08:22 - we're from stuff sorry I didn't hear
08:32 - what you said oh yes I it should be
08:38 - worse it like it's like on your laptop
08:40 - right so I can hear you now can you just
08:42 - say again where you from sorry we don't
08:43 - okay we're from the South Florida like
08:46 - Broward County the question was about
08:49 - like were there any hiccups in like
08:52 - making code organ the hour of code so
08:55 - big in like you know so the spread of
09:01 - the hour of code has been just beyond my
09:04 - wildest dreams I should first say so you
09:07 - know when it started at the idea we
09:10 - first launched with was basically saying
09:12 - let's see if we can get 10 million
09:14 - students to try an hour of code and that
09:16 - was just a ridiculous goal to upset for
09:18 - an organization that was basically
09:20 - weekly we were five people and said we
09:22 - can get 10 million people to do this and
09:24 - the reason it got so big is just because
09:26 - it's such a good idea and so it's an
09:29 - idea that has been spread because
09:30 - teachers parents celebrities politicians
09:34 - athletes actors tech companies everybody
09:37 - likes the idea and that that alone has
09:39 - make it spread to the point that we
09:41 - started pushing for 10 million we've had
09:43 - at least 100 million students do the
09:45 - hour of code by far the biggest hiccups
09:48 - we've had is making the website be able
09:52 - to handle all the coding that happens in
09:54 - fact this is the first year that the
09:56 - code.org website has had no technical
09:58 - issues with the amount of sort of
10:00 - traffic we get each year the hour of
10:02 - code is bigger than the year before and
10:03 - it's a struggle to estimate how much
10:06 - we're going to need to you know how much
10:09 - how much visitors and how many users we
10:11 - need to be ready for you know it's hard
10:13 - to run a website that has a lot of
10:14 - people visiting it but it's especially
10:16 - hard when they're not just visiting it
10:19 - for to look at one web page what to look
10:21 - at
10:21 - 30 different web pages in a row over the
10:23 - course of an hour you know sort peak
10:27 - moments will have many hundreds of
10:29 - thousands of people on their exact same
10:30 - page using it so we had to do a number
10:32 - of things we had to disable saving your
10:35 - progress if you have a login just so we
10:37 - don't so that piece of our website
10:39 - doesn't need to stay up so if people can
10:40 - see the pages now making that work has
10:43 - been by father to gets hiccup other than
10:46 - that the hour of code is just in fact my
10:47 - job is a dream job getting to come up
10:50 - with this idea that is being used in
10:51 - countries most people have never even
10:53 - heard of and in cities I've never heard
10:55 - of her visited knowing that people
10:56 - everywhere are doing it it's literally
10:59 - the coolest thing in the world to have
11:01 - an idea that you have spread that far
11:03 - and wide and it's become literally part
11:05 - of the education system in so many
11:07 - countries and the really the message
11:09 - from that I'd say is that if you have a
11:12 - good idea it can get really big so I
11:14 - highly urge you to not be not limit your
11:17 - dreams and if you have dreams of doing
11:19 - something big coding in computer science
11:22 - or by far the best way to get something
11:24 - that spreads across the world there's no
11:26 - other field in which you can come up
11:28 - with an idea build something and then
11:30 - three years later see a hundred million
11:32 - people using it and all the largest tech
11:35 - companies started that way you know
11:37 - we're not a billion-dollar tech company
11:39 - but we're that one of the largest
11:40 - education companies and we're only three
11:42 - years old and about 60 people and so
11:46 - it's incredible the amount of world
11:47 - change you can have with a small number
11:49 - of people with a good idea but also with
11:51 - computer science thanks for your
11:54 - question take them alright last question
11:57 - Shane do you want to ask can you see you
12:14 - can you see me yes I can see here hi
12:19 - Michael hi I'm Michael here at mira loma
12:22 - middle school I'm an eighth grader in
12:24 - California and my question is do you
12:26 - think mainstreaming coding will affect
12:28 - people's used on computer science yeah
12:32 - computers
12:33 - I just so much more mainstream now than
12:35 - it used to be at you know when I was in
12:38 - school computer science was the geekiest
12:40 - thing in the world you wouldn't want to
12:41 - go around telling anybody that you a lot
12:43 - of code basically you know to be cool
12:46 - you needed to play sports and to just
12:49 - say that you coded was the most uncool
12:51 - thing you could imagine and nobody
12:53 - really wanted to know you know you just
12:55 - it was not the best way to be sort of
12:58 - making friends and being popular these
13:00 - days computer science is quite cool the
13:02 - President of the United States has worn
13:04 - a coat or hat and has written a line of
13:06 - code just that earlier this week that
13:08 - Prime Minister of Canada did it I assume
13:11 - you guys are I hope you guys have seen
13:13 - the video that we launched just a few
13:15 - days ago with people raging from Kobe
13:17 - Bryant to Serena Williams to name our to
13:20 - marcelo sergio ramos draymond Green
13:24 - Carmelo Anthony Alana beard suit to bird
13:28 - all these athletes coding and saying
13:30 - it's important so I'm pretty sure we've
13:33 - made coding in computer science
13:34 - mainstream already at really the one
13:37 - question is can we add can we get the
13:41 - education system to teach it it's now
13:44 - the point that everybody wants this to
13:45 - be taught and everybody wants it to be
13:47 - learned but it's hard to change schools
13:49 - America's schools and the world schools
13:51 - have existed for hundreds of years
13:53 - teaching the same thing but our world
13:55 - has really changed with computers and
13:57 - software and our education system hasn't
13:59 - changed quickly enough that starts with
14:02 - the hour of code but we need schools to
14:04 - be teaching hundreds of hours of code
14:06 - just like they teach math and history
14:08 - and science and that's going to be
14:10 - taking a longer time but I'm sure we can
14:12 - do it um one last question mrs. e from
14:17 - Tolton I guess I didn't call on you and
14:19 - that's a yes thank you so much hello my
14:29 - name is Marcus Moreland I'm from Chicago
14:31 - and this is Gus is Delta Kappa and I was
14:34 - accent ah how old would you you started
14:37 - come at right sort of the curtain hora
14:41 - doridori code that would oh right
14:47 - forty-year-old right now actually I
14:49 - think we're in for the board or a few
14:51 - weeks ago add em code.org started about
14:53 - three years ago so I was add I was
14:55 - between 40 and 41 when I started Korg
14:58 - had code.org seems like a really big
15:01 - thing and it is the fact that you know
15:02 - 100 million students have used our
15:04 - courses had but it's a really young
15:07 - company it's three years old as a
15:08 - company and there's about you know it
15:11 - started out the first hour of code there
15:12 - was only 13 of us and we kicked off this
15:15 - thing that reached 20 million students
15:17 - there's now 60 of us and we do a lot lot
15:20 - more than the hour of code we're
15:22 - training teachers in every major city in
15:24 - the country we're helping changing laws
15:26 - at the state level and we're creating
15:29 - the most popular courses used in
15:30 - computer science worldwide but the whole
15:33 - thing is only three years old and only
15:35 - 60 people have and you know it's it's I
15:39 - guess it's been amazing to have
15:41 - something that reaches that far and wide
15:43 - and I need to get going but i want to
15:46 - say some closing words expressed
15:47 - especially for the Oh somebody just
15:50 - asked me if I could take a YouTube
15:52 - question at so you hold on just one
15:56 - second i'll take one YouTube question
15:59 - when you ask what's the question
16:09 - give me one second to get a question
16:10 - from the YouTube audience all right I
16:14 - have a question from Heather Womack does
16:16 - everything electric have to have code
16:20 - and this is from first and second
16:22 - graders courses for mrs. Womack's
16:24 - classroom and this is from Lago Vista
16:26 - Elementary School in Lago Vista Texas
16:29 - does everything electric have to have
16:31 - code no it doesn't everything electric
16:34 - needs to have electricity so light bulbs
16:36 - don't have code you know fans don't have
16:39 - code today most refrigerators don't have
16:42 - code but really anything that wants to
16:45 - be smart and by when I say smart I mean
16:49 - you give it some information it does
16:50 - something differently depending on the
16:51 - information can become more smart with
16:54 - code so for example light bulbs can
16:56 - become more smart with code so a light
16:58 - bulb can turn on when it knows that
17:00 - there's somebody in the room and it can
17:02 - turn off when there's nobody in the room
17:04 - or a fan can turn on when it knows that
17:07 - you're there and that it's hot out or a
17:10 - refrigerator can tell you when you're
17:12 - out of eggs and that you need to buy
17:14 - more eggs so it's not that everything
17:16 - electric should have code it's more that
17:19 - everything electric can have code and
17:21 - you can make it smarter and have it do
17:23 - more for you all right I'm going to get
17:25 - going I just want to say thank you so
17:26 - much to all of the teachers worldwide
17:29 - and especially in the United States for
17:31 - helping bring the hour of code to so
17:33 - many classrooms it's been an amazing
17:35 - week and also at just the hour of code
17:38 - is just the start we've reached 300
17:41 - million hours done across the entire
17:43 - globe but we need every school worldwide
17:46 - to teach computer science beyond one
17:48 - hour every one of you doing this as
17:50 - students please make sure to go tell
17:52 - your parents today that you learned some
17:54 - code in class most of your parents never
17:56 - got a chance to do this when they were
17:58 - in school tell them what it's about and
18:00 - ask your school to teach more computer
18:02 - science beyond just one hour thank you
18:04 - so much especially to the teachers give
18:07 - a round of applause to your teachers
18:08 - folks
18:15 - thank you baba

Cleaned transcript:

how did you get so interested to make a whole company um that's a great question and it's so great to see the classroom from Maine in elementary school hi everybody so how did I decide to start a company at code.org didn't start out as a big sort of effort to start a company add it started out really just as a hobby frankly I just thought people should learn computer science and this is something that should be done in every school but before making into a company I decided I'd just like a video and say this is important and that video ended up being very very popular at at least for somebody who had never done some type this before that video got seen by 13 million people and 10,000 teachers said we want this in our classrooms and at the time I didn't have a company I just had a video but once 10,000 teachers wanted it that really is what inspired me to start what really is today's code or I've decided if 10,000 teachers want this in their classrooms somebody should spend the time to make the right courses and to help bring something to the teachers so the teachers who decided to to bring computer sizes their classrooms was really what inspired me to start code argh all right Kim do can you ask a question from your classroom yes hi hi no mirrors gone okay so your name hello I'm normal hi MA okay I'm in fourth grade what state to relive it then i live in the united states specifically new jersey okay my mom which of the puzzles are you most proud of um you know we've made so many different tutorials and activities at code.org is it's hard to pick which ones are my favorites I was awesome to that are really like David's one is the Star Wars tutorial that we released last year that the reason I like that so much as the star wars was one of my favorite things growing up and actually when I was growing up I didn't have access to watch the movies because western movies weren't even available where I was living in Middle East but I i had read books about the movies and i was so excited when i came to america to actually watch these movies that I'd read about and so now 30 years later getting a chance to build a tutorial with the team that made Star Wars to you know drive around r2d2 with the code you wrote was one of my favorite things to make and it's really fun to play my second other really favorite thing we've built is a tool called apt lab and that's designed for slightly older kids who've already started learning some coding all but if you get good from doing the iris code i highly recommend checking out applab it let's see Miss relapse and put on your phone and make all sorts of things with its pad so it's not really a puzzle or that doesn't feel as much like a game it's like the course but it's really shows off with optical coating and being able to make whatever you want to make all right add next classroom and can you unmute yourself yes and by the way I want to apologize to the folks streaming on youtube I had a little bit of trouble starting the broadcaster's now about 50 different classrooms that are watching us but they can't ask questions at so thank you for for bearing with me patiently while we got this started all right go ahead hi I'm Audrey and I'm from his manifest classroom and from elementary school and we were wondering if you were familiar with Ada Lovelace yes I am familiar with Ada Lovelace and there's a really interesting story about this M Ada Lovelace is one of the very first computer programmers and what's interesting about her first of all is that for birthdays I think in two days so add I mean she's long past but today we're celebrating the birthday of grace hopper who is one of the most famous computer scientists from the 1940s Ada Lovelace lived in the 1800s and she is one of the first computer programmers wrote a computer program before computers existed and the reason that's relevant is because computers programming and computer science isn't just about making apps and technology is also about problem solving and and AB she was basically creating algorithms and writing code without an actual computer she just had the idea of what a computer could do and she was writing the code for that and she's one of the most famous computer scientists of all time I also personally think it's cool that the first known computer programmer was a woman because as you may or may not know today most computer programmers among adults are men and that's something code.org and the hour of code is totally going to change you know if you look at who's coding in elementary schools it's almost 5050 boys and girls because girls can do it just as well as boys and I hope you decide to go coding beyond just this classroom at when you get older in middle school in high school do you think you would have been drenched do I think what you think you would have been friends with Ada Lovelace I think I would have been friends of Ada Lovelace if I was alive maybe I might have been em or if she was alive right now I definitely would want to be friends with her thank you all right Amy I'm meeting your classroom Amy actually you need to unmute its to ask a question okay my name is Valerie and I'm from Falmouth Elementary School in fifth grade my question is how many hours a day do you code how many hours of day two I code I don't code every day or in ours because you know right now I run a company now that is doing this work so you know the coding that I do is more effectively trying our own tutorials to make sure that they're they're good enough and making sure that they work the way I'd like them to but the actual website we have I'm not the chief coder we actually have a team of people there's actually 25 people at code.org that are either designing curriculum and courses or they're building the website and actually implementing things like that you know the minecraft tutorial it that you may have played or the our apt lab courses or everything else on korg but you know i started coding when i was 10 and I've never stopped so it's one of my favorite things to do but I unfortunate i'll do it all the time I've made a lot of apps with our little applab tool though and I love playing with all the hour of code tutorials I just made it my own he's the minecraft designer recently have you guys tried the new minecraft designer that came out this just as past few weeks my favorite thing about that is that you can change what the different characters can do so you can make sheep and chicken that go chase after zombies so make sure if you try to use that you you use you know one of the best things about coding is that you can change the rules you know in the real world there's all sorts of rules when you're coding you can kind of design whatever you want and make up your own rules and that's part of what we want to do with the minecraft designer which is to let you you know do whatever you want with in Minecraft the Sheep can not have wool you can you know shear the sheep and instead get diamonds out of them and the chickens can lay gold and they're zombies and creepers can attack each other and you can do whatever you want with it thank you Amy alright Justin the ad is your classroom have a question yes yes how do you do on decade okay those are the computers you can see them out there hi dad um sorry guys from we're from stuff sorry I didn't hear what you said oh yes I it should be worse it like it's like on your laptop right so I can hear you now can you just say again where you from sorry we don't okay we're from the South Florida like Broward County the question was about like were there any hiccups in like making code organ the hour of code so big in like you know so the spread of the hour of code has been just beyond my wildest dreams I should first say so you know when it started at the idea we first launched with was basically saying let's see if we can get 10 million students to try an hour of code and that was just a ridiculous goal to upset for an organization that was basically weekly we were five people and said we can get 10 million people to do this and the reason it got so big is just because it's such a good idea and so it's an idea that has been spread because teachers parents celebrities politicians athletes actors tech companies everybody likes the idea and that that alone has make it spread to the point that we started pushing for 10 million we've had at least 100 million students do the hour of code by far the biggest hiccups we've had is making the website be able to handle all the coding that happens in fact this is the first year that the code.org website has had no technical issues with the amount of sort of traffic we get each year the hour of code is bigger than the year before and it's a struggle to estimate how much we're going to need to you know how much how much visitors and how many users we need to be ready for you know it's hard to run a website that has a lot of people visiting it but it's especially hard when they're not just visiting it for to look at one web page what to look at 30 different web pages in a row over the course of an hour you know sort peak moments will have many hundreds of thousands of people on their exact same page using it so we had to do a number of things we had to disable saving your progress if you have a login just so we don't so that piece of our website doesn't need to stay up so if people can see the pages now making that work has been by father to gets hiccup other than that the hour of code is just in fact my job is a dream job getting to come up with this idea that is being used in countries most people have never even heard of and in cities I've never heard of her visited knowing that people everywhere are doing it it's literally the coolest thing in the world to have an idea that you have spread that far and wide and it's become literally part of the education system in so many countries and the really the message from that I'd say is that if you have a good idea it can get really big so I highly urge you to not be not limit your dreams and if you have dreams of doing something big coding in computer science or by far the best way to get something that spreads across the world there's no other field in which you can come up with an idea build something and then three years later see a hundred million people using it and all the largest tech companies started that way you know we're not a billiondollar tech company but we're that one of the largest education companies and we're only three years old and about 60 people and so it's incredible the amount of world change you can have with a small number of people with a good idea but also with computer science thanks for your question take them alright last question Shane do you want to ask can you see you can you see me yes I can see here hi Michael hi I'm Michael here at mira loma middle school I'm an eighth grader in California and my question is do you think mainstreaming coding will affect people's used on computer science yeah computers I just so much more mainstream now than it used to be at you know when I was in school computer science was the geekiest thing in the world you wouldn't want to go around telling anybody that you a lot of code basically you know to be cool you needed to play sports and to just say that you coded was the most uncool thing you could imagine and nobody really wanted to know you know you just it was not the best way to be sort of making friends and being popular these days computer science is quite cool the President of the United States has worn a coat or hat and has written a line of code just that earlier this week that Prime Minister of Canada did it I assume you guys are I hope you guys have seen the video that we launched just a few days ago with people raging from Kobe Bryant to Serena Williams to name our to marcelo sergio ramos draymond Green Carmelo Anthony Alana beard suit to bird all these athletes coding and saying it's important so I'm pretty sure we've made coding in computer science mainstream already at really the one question is can we add can we get the education system to teach it it's now the point that everybody wants this to be taught and everybody wants it to be learned but it's hard to change schools America's schools and the world schools have existed for hundreds of years teaching the same thing but our world has really changed with computers and software and our education system hasn't changed quickly enough that starts with the hour of code but we need schools to be teaching hundreds of hours of code just like they teach math and history and science and that's going to be taking a longer time but I'm sure we can do it um one last question mrs. e from Tolton I guess I didn't call on you and that's a yes thank you so much hello my name is Marcus Moreland I'm from Chicago and this is Gus is Delta Kappa and I was accent ah how old would you you started come at right sort of the curtain hora doridori code that would oh right fortyyearold right now actually I think we're in for the board or a few weeks ago add em code.org started about three years ago so I was add I was between 40 and 41 when I started Korg had code.org seems like a really big thing and it is the fact that you know 100 million students have used our courses had but it's a really young company it's three years old as a company and there's about you know it started out the first hour of code there was only 13 of us and we kicked off this thing that reached 20 million students there's now 60 of us and we do a lot lot more than the hour of code we're training teachers in every major city in the country we're helping changing laws at the state level and we're creating the most popular courses used in computer science worldwide but the whole thing is only three years old and only 60 people have and you know it's it's I guess it's been amazing to have something that reaches that far and wide and I need to get going but i want to say some closing words expressed especially for the Oh somebody just asked me if I could take a YouTube question at so you hold on just one second i'll take one YouTube question when you ask what's the question give me one second to get a question from the YouTube audience all right I have a question from Heather Womack does everything electric have to have code and this is from first and second graders courses for mrs. Womack's classroom and this is from Lago Vista Elementary School in Lago Vista Texas does everything electric have to have code no it doesn't everything electric needs to have electricity so light bulbs don't have code you know fans don't have code today most refrigerators don't have code but really anything that wants to be smart and by when I say smart I mean you give it some information it does something differently depending on the information can become more smart with code so for example light bulbs can become more smart with code so a light bulb can turn on when it knows that there's somebody in the room and it can turn off when there's nobody in the room or a fan can turn on when it knows that you're there and that it's hot out or a refrigerator can tell you when you're out of eggs and that you need to buy more eggs so it's not that everything electric should have code it's more that everything electric can have code and you can make it smarter and have it do more for you all right I'm going to get going I just want to say thank you so much to all of the teachers worldwide and especially in the United States for helping bring the hour of code to so many classrooms it's been an amazing week and also at just the hour of code is just the start we've reached 300 million hours done across the entire globe but we need every school worldwide to teach computer science beyond one hour every one of you doing this as students please make sure to go tell your parents today that you learned some code in class most of your parents never got a chance to do this when they were in school tell them what it's about and ask your school to teach more computer science beyond just one hour thank you so much especially to the teachers give a round of applause to your teachers folks thank you baba
