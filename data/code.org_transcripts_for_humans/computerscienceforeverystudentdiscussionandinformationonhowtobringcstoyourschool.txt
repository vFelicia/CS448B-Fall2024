00:00 - good morning and afternoon to all that
00:02 - have joined us today to discuss why
00:04 - computer science is for every school
00:07 - every classroom and every student i am
00:10 - jackie smalls the chief programs officer
00:12 - for code.org and will be serving as your
00:15 - moderator for today's presentation we
00:17 - want your participation today so we're
00:19 - going to take a quick poll we want to
00:21 - know who is in the audience are you an
00:24 - administrator teacher student parent or
00:27 - joining us in another role to learn more
00:29 - about computer science
00:33 - while you take a minute to answer the
00:35 - poll please note
00:37 - we will be moderating the q a encourage
00:40 - you to ask questions throughout the
00:41 - presentation
00:51 - give everyone a few seconds to take see
00:53 - what our results are
00:58 - well great we have 44 that are teachers
01:01 - we have 20 percent about 20 that are
01:03 - administrators we have some parents we
01:05 - have some students we have others that
01:07 - have joined us so thank you so much
01:10 - i'd like to get started by first

03:17 - and served as an advisor to well-known
03:19 - tech companies but his main focus is
03:22 - code.org code.org has established
03:25 - computer science classes reaching 30
03:27 - percent of u.s students created the most
03:30 - broadly used curriculum platform for
03:32 - k-12 computer science and launched the
03:35 - global hour of code movement that has
03:37 - reached hundreds of millions of students
03:39 - spanning every country in the world
03:42 - heidi's family lives in seattle
03:43 - washington and isn't spare in his spare

03:59 - have you with us secretary duncan uh
04:02 - where are you visiting us from right now
04:04 - i i assume you're at home after the
04:06 - pandemic uh where are you situated
04:09 - yeah plea please call me already you
04:11 - know better than that and now yeah home
04:13 - in chicago and lived two blocks from
04:15 - where i grew up so it's good to be back

04:19 - oh great well i'm in seattle uh
04:21 - i'm excited uh to hopefully get to the
04:24 - near end of the the shutdowns from this
04:26 - pandemic
04:27 - i got my second shot just about a week
04:30 - ago so
04:31 - i'm i feel like a free man and i hope
04:34 - you've gotten vaccinated too as well i
04:35 - don't know if
04:36 - you have the chance yet but yeah no we
04:38 - have our family's uh been vaccinated so
04:41 - we're real lucky we were sick in
04:42 - november and hit our family pretty hard
04:44 - and we're
04:45 - we've lost like many folks we've lost
04:47 - you know friends to to the to to the
04:49 - pandemic to cobia so we are
04:52 - very very lucky and grateful to be on
04:54 - the other side of this and just want to
04:55 - see the country get to the other side of
04:57 - this as quickly as we can
05:00 - yeah i'm extremely hopeful that we're
05:03 - at the beginning of the end um would you
05:06 - like to share a few comments about you
05:07 - know just how the pandemic has impacted
05:09 - education and for all the teachers and
05:11 - administrators in the audience thoughts
05:13 - on basically the reopening of schools
05:14 - and what we can expect to see coming up
05:17 - soon
05:18 - well that's not a small topic i'll try
05:20 - and be brief first i just um
05:23 - so you know to educators to parents to
05:25 - students
05:26 - really just want to say how profoundly
05:29 - sorry i am and i'm always very honest
05:31 - for better or worse i've said repeatedly
05:33 - that i think this
05:34 - pandemic morphed from a natural disaster
05:36 - to a man-made catastrophe
05:39 - and other nations because they listened
05:40 - to science because they took it
05:42 - seriously recovered much more rapidly
05:44 - much more quickly than we did
05:47 - and the loss of life here has been
05:49 - absolutely staggering
05:51 - for our educators the loss of learning
05:53 - time
05:54 - loss of a chance to be in physical
05:56 - schools
05:57 - uh for parents the stress of trying to
05:59 - do homeschooling for a year for students
06:02 - you know i've you know we have a high
06:04 - school son and a daughter a freshman in
06:06 - college
06:08 - like so many you know millions of
06:09 - families across the country just to have
06:10 - our our children
06:12 - lose that chance just to be kids and to
06:15 - uh
06:16 - and to be proximate to each other and to
06:17 - have some fun and to play and just have
06:19 - normal social human human interactions
06:23 - just desperately sorry i also want to
06:26 - say how unbelievably inspired i am by
06:29 - how hard educators and parents and
06:31 - students
06:32 - worked throughout this there was no
06:34 - playbook nobody prepped for this at any
06:36 - time in their their life we haven't had
06:38 - anything like this obviously in this
06:39 - century
06:40 - and so to see people roll up their
06:42 - sleeves and work so hard
06:44 - on every aspect of this yes academically
06:46 - but students social emotional needs i i
06:50 - participated in a weekly call starting
06:52 - last march so far from you know
06:53 - basically over a year
06:55 - to make sure food was being distributed
06:57 - through through uh through schools and
07:00 - just herculean heroic efforts they are
07:02 - our schools aren't just place of
07:04 - learning their social safety nets and to
07:05 - see just not just students but families
07:08 - in the community being fed um during a
07:11 - desperately difficult time
07:13 - again beyond inspiring and i think the
07:15 - challenge for us all all now highlighted
07:17 - outside of people is that for me the
07:19 - goal is not to go back to quote unquote
07:21 - normal because normal didn't serve tens
07:23 - of millions of kids well enough and so
07:26 - how do we you know reimagine how do we
07:28 - rethink education in many many different
07:30 - ways we can get into a few of those ways
07:32 - now but it really is a chance to
07:34 - to create a system that is more
07:36 - equitable and fair and just and gives
07:39 - every child a chance to fulfill their
07:41 - extraordinary academic and social
07:42 - potential so a difficult time but also a
07:45 - time of hope for me of creativity and
07:49 - the final thing i'll say that if nothing
07:50 - else i think our children have learned
07:52 - how interconnected we are
07:54 - how important science is
07:56 - how if our family is okay but if our
07:58 - neighbors family isn't uh then none of
08:00 - us are okay
08:02 - and for for the many things i think we
08:04 - as adults haven't done well
08:06 - uh my hope is that our young people for
08:08 - the next 30 40 50 years will lead our
08:10 - country in a very bet in a different way
08:13 - and honestly a better way and uh won't
08:15 - take our democracy for for granted ever
08:17 - and won't take our public health or
08:19 - education for granted ever
08:21 - and um if they can take the very
08:23 - difficult lessons of the pandemic
08:25 - forward um the next couple decades could
08:28 - actually be a pretty remarkable time in
08:29 - the united states
08:31 - yeah among the things that i think about
08:33 - the bright spots is just how much
08:36 - technology has helped people cope you
08:38 - know 100 years ago during the
08:41 - you know the the last major pandemic
08:43 - people didn't have zoom they didn't have
08:45 - the internet any of the things we take
08:47 - for granted uh you know i have kids who
08:49 - are
08:50 - uh 14 12 and and seven and my
08:52 - seven-year-old he was in first grade has
08:55 - now become an expert zoom student uh but
08:58 - not only he's learned how to use zoom
09:00 - he's also learned how to schedule his
09:02 - life because you know instead of being
09:04 - in one classroom he has to click two
09:06 - different
09:07 - links and things like that
09:09 - and he's like on top of his own schedule
09:11 - which my other kids didn't
09:13 - learn that when they were in first grade
09:14 - so this is forced them to learn new
09:16 - skills
09:17 - and really our teachers and
09:19 - administrators all around the country
09:20 - and even all around the world have
09:22 - embraced
09:23 - technology in a way that schools haven't
09:25 - before you know for the last 10 20 years
09:28 - people have been talking about what are
09:29 - ways technology can help education uh
09:32 - and everybody basically had a rapid
09:34 - rapid like all right we have to figure
09:35 - it all out right now um you know whether
09:38 - it's video
09:39 - conferencing or scheduling or live q a
09:41 - or quizzes or things like that just all
09:44 - the different ways teachers have figured
09:45 - out creatively how to engage their
09:47 - students
09:48 - and you know one of the beauties of
09:50 - american education is there's no sort of
09:52 - central plan for these things teachers
09:54 - everywhere came up with their own
09:56 - solutions creatively and that's it's
09:59 - wonderful to to see the different ways
10:00 - they've done that
10:02 - for the work of code.org one of the
10:04 - things that's critical now as we think
10:05 - about the reopening is how to frame that
10:08 - you know we're entering a new world and
10:10 - in that new world computer science is
10:12 - much more important than it's ever been
10:14 - uh and you know aside from all the
10:16 - things we need to teach students at you
10:18 - know the work of code.org is around
10:20 - teaching computer science
10:22 - just like we teach math just like we
10:24 - teach english or regular science or
10:26 - history or foreign languages you know
10:28 - we're in the 21st century now
10:31 - and all the problems our communities are
10:34 - the human race is going to need to solve
10:36 - are going to be technical problems or
10:38 - problems that we can solve with
10:39 - technology
10:41 - and it's important for our schools as
10:43 - they've adapted all these
10:44 - new technical skills during the pandemic
10:46 - to figure out all right how do we
10:48 - move beyond just teaching with
10:49 - technology but teaching about technology
10:53 - teaching about the way these things are
10:54 - built about how to create them
10:57 - and so on uh and that's one of the
10:58 - things that i think uh
11:00 - it's a real opportunity for america uh
11:03 - but it's also an opportunity we need to
11:05 - deliberately act on it's not just going
11:07 - to happen naturally if we go back to the
11:08 - old normal the old normal most schools
11:11 - don't teach computer science because
11:12 - it's sort of this special subject that
11:14 - you don't think is for every student and
11:16 - that's one of the things i'm hopeful
11:17 - that this country can sort of add into
11:20 - the curriculum as we as we reopen
11:23 - you know i just appreciate your
11:24 - leadership and tenacity so much what
11:26 - code.org has done is uh
11:28 - pretty spectacular
11:30 - and it's it's um
11:32 - it's almost like everything in our
11:33 - society we think about the pandemic we
11:35 - think about
11:36 - issues of racial justice or racial
11:39 - injustice lack thereof
11:41 - and technology as you have lived as you
11:44 - know better than anyone is an absolute
11:46 - game changer if our students are are
11:48 - confident and fluent and company you
11:50 - know can solve problems um they're going
11:53 - to have a world of opportunity ahead of
11:54 - them
11:55 - and if they don't then they're going to
11:57 - really struggle we know a wildly
11:59 - disproportionate number of the jobs of
12:01 - the future are going to involve you know
12:03 - technical literacy and
12:05 - it's a thing where it can either this is
12:08 - really up to us
12:09 - it can either be the great equalizer
12:13 - or it can exacerbate the divide between
12:15 - the halves and the have nots so there's
12:18 - nothing for me inherently feel good or
12:20 - bad about it
12:23 - the world is going that in that way and
12:25 - i think we have not just a an
12:27 - educational
12:28 - um
12:30 - but a moral uh
12:32 - necessity
12:33 - uh to make sure all of our children
12:36 - have access to these skills and access
12:39 - these opportunities to learn and as you
12:41 - probably found the hard way too often in
12:42 - education we move a little bit at a
12:44 - glacier-like speed you know we don't
12:46 - adapt quickly and as you said the
12:49 - pandemic for better or worse is forced
12:50 - us to think differently and to to teach
12:53 - differently and the idea that children
12:55 - can only learn something in a physical
12:57 - building you know six or seven hours a
12:59 - day
13:00 - you know nine you know nine months out
13:02 - of the year five five five days a week
13:04 - that doesn't make any sense anymore our
13:05 - children have to be able to learn
13:06 - anything they want anytime anywhere any
13:08 - place 24 7. having access to technology
13:11 - and wi-fi and internet devices is so
13:14 - critically important but if we think
13:16 - reading is important and we know it is
13:18 - if we think mathematics is important we
13:20 - know it is um computer science
13:23 - is the new literacy it's the new
13:25 - currency and i just want all of our
13:28 - children
13:29 - to have access to that and let me clear
13:31 - to have access to it at an early age
13:33 - not uh you know high school is great but
13:35 - that's a little late in the game if we
13:36 - start much much earlier than that when
13:38 - when we know students can uh children
13:40 - can absorb uh so so much and so i just
13:43 - appreciate the extraordinary progress
13:45 - that you and cordaro have have had on
13:48 - how much you have spurred
13:51 - change from the outside i think it's
13:53 - incumbent of upon also you know in the
13:55 - education world um to really embrace
13:58 - this
13:59 - uh now
14:00 - and make this the norm not the exception
14:02 - for kids and to do it again with a real
14:05 - equity lens that i want to make sure
14:06 - children here in chicago in the inner
14:08 - city and children um in appalachia and
14:12 - children on native american reservations
14:14 - um all have access all have access and
14:17 - have access to the great content and
14:19 - great curriculum and great teachers and
14:21 - great technology
14:23 - and if we do that
14:25 - i would say talent is much more evenly
14:26 - spread than opportunity our goal is to
14:28 - have opportunity to meet that talent
14:30 - whatever it is and it's everywhere and
14:32 - that's that's the job ahead of us that's
14:34 - the job ahead of us yep the sad thing is
14:36 - only about a half
14:38 - half of us schools teach computer
14:39 - science and half of them don't and if
14:41 - you look at the ones that do teach it
14:43 - it's the schools that are wealthier the
14:45 - schools that have less diversity among
14:47 - their student populations
14:48 - schools that are mostly in the suburbs
14:50 - rather than the cities are rural and
14:51 - those are the problems that we're trying
14:53 - to to tackle as well
14:55 - jackie's going to come back and she has
14:57 - some folks who are going to ask us
14:59 - questions as we
15:00 - continue the conversation so we're going
15:02 - to have
15:03 - i think three people joining us
15:06 - thanks so much hoddy yes we have some
15:08 - special guests representing the voice of
15:10 - students teachers and administrators
15:13 - so i'll start with some introductions
15:15 - first i'll start with miles mac
15:17 - miles is a graduating senior honor who's
15:20 - an honor student as well at patrick
15:22 - taylor science and technology academy in
15:24 - louisiana he has grown up loving stem
15:26 - and plans to major in mechanical
15:28 - engineering with a minor in computer
15:31 - science he has participated in summer
15:33 - stem programs at mit and us irvine
15:36 - working on artificial intelligence
15:39 - machine learning and programming
15:41 - projects
15:42 - miles is very busy
15:44 - and he's ready to take on the world so
15:46 - we welcome miles we also welcome athena
15:48 - talk athena is navajo from two grey
15:51 - hills new mexico which is one which is
15:53 - on the navajo reservation she is
15:56 - currently teaching ap computer science
15:58 - principles at bond wilson technical
16:00 - center
16:01 - and finally we have mr milo mc mcminn a
16:05 - second generation new mexican educator
16:07 - who works at central consolidated school
16:09 - district which serves over 6 000
16:11 - students on and off the navajo nation
16:15 - milo is the founding principal of bonn
16:17 - wilson technical center and early
16:19 - college high school cte academy that
16:22 - offers school high school students
16:24 - industry-based learning in mechatronics
16:27 - computer science and engineering
16:28 - pre-nursing culinary arts welding
16:31 - construction and industrial maintenance
16:34 - welcome miles athena and milo
16:38 - and i believe miles has the first
16:40 - question he'd like to ask
16:46 - hello everybody um i'm really into
16:49 - computer science but many of my friends
16:51 - aren't sure if they want to pursue a
16:53 - career in it so um my question is
16:55 - secretary duncan and heidi um what would
16:57 - you say to students who are on the fence
16:59 - about pursuing a career in computer
17:02 - science how do you start off follow your
17:05 - lead miles thanks for your leadership
17:08 - uh sure well you know if you have
17:10 - friends who are thinking they don't want
17:11 - to they're not sure about a career in
17:13 - computer science the question is
17:15 - any career you want to go into whether
17:17 - it's marketing or design these are all
17:20 - increasingly technical fields if one of
17:22 - your friends wants to become a doctor or
17:24 - a nurse everything about healthcare is
17:26 - being changed by computer science even
17:28 - if you want to become a farmer the
17:30 - future of farming is self-driving
17:32 - tractors
17:33 - you know and farmers increasingly need
17:35 - to actually code their tractors or debug
17:38 - their tractors most people don't realize
17:39 - is how much even something is as
17:42 - traditional or considered the old school
17:45 - is farming has become a technical field
17:48 - and then also computer science helps
17:49 - develop the mind so you know why are we
17:52 - teaching math it's not because you want
17:53 - to pursue a career in math but every
17:56 - student learns math because it helps
17:58 - develop your thinking skills and the
17:59 - same thing is true of computer science
18:01 - just as much
18:03 - yeah just a couple quick thoughts that
18:05 - for me the goal is not to tell everybody
18:07 - this is what they have to do for their
18:08 - career we all have different interests
18:10 - and passions what i want to make sure is
18:12 - that your friends aren't locked out of
18:14 - these possibilities and again i'm going
18:16 - to keep coming back to the lack of
18:18 - equity across our country in everything
18:21 - you know health care
18:22 - criminal justice and yes education
18:26 - is real
18:27 - and so i just want to make sure that
18:28 - your friends have a chance to decide
18:31 - whether or not
18:32 - this is what they want to devote their
18:34 - life to and at the end of the day you
18:36 - know what's the nature of work going
18:38 - forward the nature of work we don't know
18:40 - the jobs you know what job are you gonna
18:41 - hold probably exists yet you know i'm
18:43 - not smart enough to know what that's
18:44 - gonna look like what i do know is the
18:46 - nature of work is gonna be around
18:47 - solving problems that our ability to
18:49 - solve problems to work together um to
18:52 - work in diverse teams to work not just
18:54 - domestically but internationally
18:57 - that's going to be best to define who's
18:59 - successful and who's not and if you have
19:01 - those skills i consider you know
19:03 - computer science to be integral to be
19:05 - critical to that you have those skills
19:07 - you're going to be able to do really
19:08 - well for yourself for your family for
19:10 - your community if you don't have those
19:12 - skills you're going to be on the outside
19:14 - looking in and that's pretty scary and
19:16 - so for me it's never about telling
19:18 - anyone what they have to do or what they
19:19 - must do it's exposure let them know what
19:22 - those careers look like what what does
19:24 - those salaries look like it's hard to
19:26 - imagine doing something you've never
19:28 - seen before
19:29 - and so you know that's what i think what
19:31 - hotties you know devote his life to and
19:32 - other folks is to making sure that a
19:35 - hundred percent of our students not just
19:37 - the privilege not just the wealthy not
19:38 - just the affluent not just the white but
19:40 - all of our students have a chance to
19:42 - make this decision for themselves
19:50 - great i think i'm next thank you for
19:52 - having me here uh my question is
19:54 - i'm lucky enough to be in a school that
19:56 - offers computer science but many schools
19:59 - in my region and area both on and off
20:01 - the navajo nation don't have that
20:02 - opportunity how can principals really
20:05 - promote computer science in their
20:06 - schools both at the district level state
20:08 - level and the national level
20:11 - so this is a you know this is a great
20:12 - question if if a school
20:14 - doesn't teach computer science or if
20:16 - your school
20:17 - teaches some computer science but wants
20:19 - to teach more i think almost every
20:21 - school in the country has an opportunity
20:22 - to expand its offerings lots of schools
20:24 - teach sort of an introductory class but
20:27 - don't teach ap level computer science uh
20:30 - and whether you have cs or not
20:33 - the top questions schools ask are first
20:35 - of all what is the budget for teaching
20:37 - it but then most importantly who is
20:38 - going to teach it because if your school
20:40 - doesn't have a computer science
20:42 - teacher you know you look around which
20:45 - one of us is going to teach this class
20:46 - schools don't have a budget to hire a
20:48 - new teacher
20:49 - and the work that code.org does more
20:51 - than anything else is
20:53 - professional development of existing
20:55 - teachers
20:56 - so that your history teacher your math
20:58 - teacher your science teacher even your
21:00 - art teacher can go through a
21:02 - professional learning program and
21:03 - actually become a computer science
21:05 - teacher
21:06 - using the code.org program
21:08 - and this is something you know
21:10 - that's available in every single state
21:12 - and in in most regions it's completely
21:14 - free of charge to the school
21:16 - especially high need schools we offer
21:18 - scholarships for teachers to go through
21:20 - the professional learning program so
21:22 - they can basically
21:24 - effectively on code.org's dime or rather
21:26 - thanks to the generous donors that have
21:28 - supported our work
21:29 - we will train the the the teachers in
21:32 - your school
21:34 - the hard thing for an administrator like
21:35 - yourself is also making sure to put room
21:38 - for it in the schedule you know so for
21:40 - example at a high school level you need
21:42 - to open up a slot in the master schedule
21:44 - you know for for at least one computer
21:46 - science class and if you open up that
21:48 - slots i guarantee you students will sign
21:50 - up for it or if your school teaches
21:52 - introductory cs if you open up an ap
21:55 - class ap computer science has become the
21:57 - fastest growing field in the history of
21:59 - the college board ap program it's
22:01 - because students actually really want
22:03 - this stuff and and most administrators
22:05 - don't realize the students demand for
22:07 - this because students know that this is
22:09 - the future and if you say we're adding
22:11 - this course they sign up in much larger
22:13 - numbers than people expect
22:15 - but the first step is getting a teacher
22:17 - to go through the training program uh
22:19 - and you know code.org training program
22:21 - the professional learning program is is
22:23 - i think one of the best ways to start
22:24 - especially because for almost for most
22:27 - schools we make it free thanks to the
22:28 - scholarships we provide
22:31 - yeah did i hear your it showed that your
22:33 - school is an early college school is
22:34 - that correct yeah we are partnering with
22:37 - navajo technical university we had a
22:39 - meeting here yesterday and they said hi
22:41 - to you arnie so
22:42 - i wanted to share that welcome with you
22:44 - as well
22:45 - yeah first of all i'm just a huge fan of
22:47 - early college programs you know high
22:48 - school diploma is critical but i think
22:50 - it's almost not quite enough
22:53 - important but not sufficient i'd love to
22:54 - see every child graduating every student
22:56 - graduating with some college credits in
22:59 - their back pocket um or industry
23:01 - certification or both and the college
23:03 - exposure and you know just appreciate
23:05 - you so appreciate so much you're working
23:07 - on navajo in navajo nation and all of
23:09 - our children deserve a world-class
23:10 - education but no one no one deserves it
23:12 - more than our native children
23:14 - communities and the chance to take a
23:16 - college class
23:18 - is not just for the high flyers it can
23:19 - be for students who are thinking about
23:21 - dropping out or thinking just college
23:22 - isn't for them that they don't they
23:24 - don't know anyone they've never had a
23:25 - family member go to college and to
23:27 - have that experience and start to think
23:29 - well i can belong on a campus and i can
23:31 - succeed with college-level work again
23:33 - just it's not just the academic learning
23:36 - sort of the mindset the mind shift
23:38 - and uh really opening up the the world
23:40 - of possibilities so one just a huge fan
23:43 - um thanks for working the community that
23:45 - deserves the best
23:47 - in terms of how do we expand this to
23:49 - other schools
23:50 - um for better or worse you know today in
23:52 - this day and age
23:54 - you sort of say who do people listen to
23:55 - they listen to their peers
23:57 - so i love hottie hotties and amazing
23:58 - salesmen but honestly most principals
24:01 - might listen to you before they listen
24:02 - to him or listen to me and not they
24:05 - don't already have a full-time job but
24:06 - the more you're talking to your peers
24:08 - that's who people trust these days the
24:09 - more you're talking to your colleagues
24:11 - letting them know um the training is
24:13 - important and it's really interesting
24:15 - how he says about sort of opening up a
24:16 - slot and so this to me is just a really
24:19 - critical point i don't want to blow
24:20 - through it
24:21 - you know computer science
24:23 - can be in some places like a
24:24 - quote-unquote extracurricular but i
24:26 - don't think it's an extracurricular it's
24:28 - essential it's got to be in in the in
24:30 - the core
24:31 - and that again has to become the norm so
24:34 - figuring that out i know there's some
24:36 - you know technical issues and scheduling
24:38 - issues
24:39 - but where that doesn't happen when it
24:40 - gets pushed to the side or somehow
24:42 - pushed out then our students don't don't
24:45 - have access
24:46 - and then i think and not again everyone
24:48 - might not agree with this but
24:49 - if we can't get a teacher at every
24:52 - school tomorrow which we know is going
24:54 - to take some time
24:55 - could we have a teacher at one school
24:57 - teach students at three or four or five
24:59 - high schools or 10 high schools frankly
25:03 - or 20 and that's again that's a bit of a
25:05 - controversial idea but i don't want to
25:08 - wait and more importantly i don't want
25:09 - our students to wait
25:11 - a year or two or five years until those
25:13 - teachers get trained and let's just
25:15 - provide that access now you know
25:17 - obviously using technology virtually
25:19 - we're better at that than we've ever
25:20 - been
25:21 - and uh where we have expertise um
25:24 - whether it's on a native american
25:25 - reservation or not on a reservation um
25:28 - let's make sure
25:30 - our students have access sooner than
25:32 - later and just encourage folks to think
25:34 - to think a little differently and think
25:35 - a little creatively there
25:40 - great thank you my next question is kind
25:42 - of a mix of those i i really believe
25:44 - that computer science is essential and
25:46 - then it should be part of core
25:47 - instruction you know same with math
25:49 - science history and and social studies
25:51 - but one thing i hear from from
25:53 - colleagues is how can we integrate uh
25:55 - computer science when we're dealing with
25:56 - standardized testing and kids still need
25:58 - to learn the basics and we need to focus
26:00 - on that what would you tell
26:01 - administrators who say that
26:04 - yeah so this is a it's a very very
26:06 - legitimate question a hard one and i
26:08 - just think we have to it's a
26:11 - it's a tough one to sort of you know
26:13 - talk through but we have to stop pitting
26:15 - this thing against it against something
26:17 - else
26:18 - and it's got to be
26:20 - we have all these debates in education
26:21 - and 99 of the time for me it's not
26:24 - either or it's both and so we need math
26:27 - and computer science
26:29 - we need language arts and we need
26:31 - foreign languages i would add we need
26:32 - financial literacy and if we're serious
26:35 - about giving our children a chance to
26:36 - build positive futures for themselves
26:39 - is not one is more important than the
26:41 - other i would argue that many of these
26:44 - skills reinforce each other
26:46 - if you're more interested if computer
26:48 - science sparks your interest that might
26:50 - help you do a little bit better in
26:51 - english potentially or in algebra and it
26:54 - gives you a reason to be excited about
26:55 - going to school each day and that's
26:56 - going to be a different you know
26:58 - a different subject or a different you
27:00 - know
27:01 - our class for every child but adding
27:03 - this into the mix
27:05 - many many you know our students a lot
27:07 - more fluent often with technology than
27:10 - we are as adults we're meeting them
27:12 - where they are
27:13 - and i promise you is it's you know if we
27:16 - want to see more young people be
27:17 - successful if we want to continue to
27:19 - reduce high school dropout rates which
27:21 - are still too high if we want more young
27:23 - people not just to graduate from high
27:24 - school but going to some learning um
27:27 - beyond college and start to build
27:29 - positive lives for themselves there's
27:30 - never one answer we have to do 20 things
27:32 - well but one of those things one of
27:35 - those strategies has to be access to
27:37 - this extraordinary word world of
27:39 - technology and computer science in all
27:41 - the world of opportunities that are
27:42 - available to our students if they're
27:44 - successful there for the rest of their
27:46 - lives
27:48 - one of the questions i get a lot and
27:50 - actually many of the panelists or many
27:51 - of the attendees have asked is whether
27:53 - computer science should be required for
27:55 - graduation uh you know because you're
27:57 - asking how do schools deal with this
28:00 - when they're struggling to teach the
28:01 - basics i firmly believe computer science
28:04 - is one of the basics you know if you
28:06 - were to start a school from scratch
28:07 - today and there was no education system
28:09 - there wasn't 200 years of curriculum
28:12 - from the past and you're just deciding
28:14 - what should students in the 21st century
28:17 - learn to prepare them for life how many
28:19 - years of what subject there's no way
28:21 - you'd say zero computer science whereas
28:23 - that's what most schools in this country
28:25 - teach because they're basically teaching
28:27 - what they taught last year and the year
28:28 - before and a hundred years before
28:31 - but this but it takes a mental change to
28:33 - think this is one of the basics and and
28:35 - there's many states where they're
28:36 - actually already making that mental
28:38 - change arkansas just passed a law saying
28:40 - computer science is going to be a
28:42 - requirement for high school graduation
28:44 - in south carolina and in nevada in both
28:48 - of those states it's also required for
28:49 - every study students to study
28:51 - as part of their k-12 experience
28:54 - and i'm pretty sure that if you think 10
28:55 - years out this is going to be mandatory
28:57 - at least at some level for students just
28:59 - as basic preparation but it's going to
29:02 - take us time to get there
29:04 - i think athena and miles have two more
29:07 - questions because we all we also want to
29:08 - get to the segment where we say how do
29:10 - you do this and how do you
29:12 - ensure that computer science is in your
29:14 - school so we're going to make sure that
29:15 - athena is able to answer her question
29:17 - and miles will end with yours
29:20 - okay hi everyone so my question is you
29:22 - know thinking you know integrating
29:24 - computer science with everything how do
29:26 - we get
29:27 - students engaged you know students that
29:29 - might not necessarily think
29:32 - that computer science is for them
29:34 - you know sometimes we get students
29:36 - placed in computer science that
29:38 - don't know anything about it and they
29:40 - don't
29:41 - they immediately want to change classes
29:42 - because
29:43 - they don't think they can do it
29:48 - i i'd love to answer this one you know
29:51 - as adults it's often you know adults
29:53 - mostly are intimidated by technology uh
29:56 - it's sort of like oh this scary new
29:58 - thing they want to use an app but they
29:59 - don't want to you know learning about
30:01 - the insides of stuff
30:03 - is not something we all learned when we
30:06 - were growing up so as adults people
30:07 - think computer science is like calculus
30:09 - it's like rocket science it's like for
30:11 - the more advanced kids for the kids
30:14 - they're so at home with the technology
30:16 - and the best way to engage them is with
30:18 - the creativity instead of saying we're
30:20 - going to learn computer science it's
30:22 - asking them what would you like to
30:24 - create what game would you like to
30:25 - create what app would you like to create
30:27 - what website would you like to create
30:29 - and that makes it a lot more like art
30:31 - class or like music class where it's
30:33 - more playing and creating and at every
30:36 - age even among adults creating is what
30:38 - drives people you know once you decide
30:41 - you want to make an app or make a game
30:44 - then you're the learning is really just
30:46 - about a means to an end rather than you
30:48 - know this thing that you have to learn
30:50 - because school told you that you need to
30:51 - do it
30:52 - i also would say you know when i when i
30:54 - first studied computer science when i
30:56 - was a kid it was very math oriented so
30:58 - it's like we were writing the code to
31:00 - calculate the fibonacci sequence of
31:02 - numbers whereas in today's day and age
31:05 - computer science is about changing the
31:06 - world and the next generation is going
31:08 - to need to tackle so many world problems
31:11 - whether it's
31:12 - you know things like climate change
31:14 - cleaning the oceans global poverty
31:16 - gender equality
31:17 - curing diseases and every one of these
31:20 - problems we're going to need to solve
31:21 - using technology so telling students
31:24 - that the reason to learn this class
31:26 - isn't just for the creativity but it's
31:28 - to be part of that next generation of
31:29 - problem solvers
31:31 - i think is very very motivating for our
31:33 - youngest learners
31:37 - amen
31:39 - thank you
31:40 - miles we have time for your question and
31:42 - then we'll conclude this segment
31:45 - okay so my last question has to do with
31:47 - diversity so we know that computer
31:49 - science is dominated by predominantly
31:51 - white and asian men
31:53 - so um i guess my question to you guys is
31:55 - how do you think we should go about
31:58 - integrating computer science with women
32:00 - um black latinx and other people of
32:02 - color in the field
32:05 - yeah i mean that's the right
32:07 - you know maybe most important question
32:08 - to to start and end with and for me
32:11 - this is not a self-correcting problem
32:14 - and if we don't intentionally try and
32:16 - close that access i don't talk about
32:18 - achievement gaps i talk about
32:19 - opportunity gaps if we don't close that
32:21 - opportunity gap you're going to see that
32:23 - divide
32:24 - grow it's going to get worse and worse
32:26 - and so this to be has to it's all
32:28 - exposure exposure exposure it's
32:31 - committing to those young people in
32:32 - those communities early it's not waiting
32:35 - to high school so what are we doing with
32:36 - our third and fourth and fifth graders
32:38 - to have these conversations
32:40 - mentorships uh job shadowing again
32:43 - physically virtually whatever just being
32:45 - exposed to this world i i'll just say
32:47 - what i said before
32:49 - talent is everywhere opportunity is not
32:52 - and if we just sit back and take who
32:54 - comes our way we're going to continue to
32:56 - be you know white male you know
32:58 - dominated and that's not what the world
33:01 - looks like now that's not bringing out
33:02 - the the genius that exists everywhere
33:05 - across our country and so we have to
33:08 - very intentionally go to under
33:10 - represented underserved disadvantaged
33:13 - marginalized whatever you want to call
33:14 - those schools those communities we all
33:16 - know where they are we know who they are
33:18 - we have to go and intentionally create
33:20 - opportunity when it doesn't exist and i
33:23 - promise you if we do that that talent
33:25 - will more than meet us halfway but
33:27 - that's on us that's not on the kids
33:29 - that's on us as adults to make that
33:31 - effort
33:32 - and hold ourselves accountable for doing
33:34 - that
33:35 - this problem is very near and dear to my
33:37 - heart having basically spent my career
33:39 - in the tech industry it's an industry
33:40 - that is
33:41 - uh basically dominated by white and
33:43 - asian men
33:45 - and
33:46 - addressing that isn't just something we
33:48 - could do in k through 12 as those
33:49 - basically diversity issues and
33:51 - inclusivity issues in k-12 in university
33:55 - and in the corporate workforce
33:57 - but as k-12 educators which are the
33:59 - audience here primarily are teachers and
34:01 - administrators we have a major role to
34:03 - play
34:04 - access is for sure a big part of it it's
34:07 - depressing that a student who is black
34:10 - is almost half as likely to have
34:12 - computer science offered in their school
34:14 - than a student who's white that makes no
34:16 - sense at all in the united states of
34:18 - america that's also why for the schools
34:20 - that don't teach computer science where
34:22 - especially for schools with highly
34:24 - diverse
34:25 - populations code.org makes scholarships
34:27 - available for the teachers to learn how
34:29 - to teach it and any administrator on
34:31 - this on this
34:32 - video call that if you're in a school
34:34 - that doesn't teach computer science
34:36 - please have your teachers sign up for a
34:37 - professional learning program
34:39 - but
34:40 - access is the first step actually
34:42 - getting enrollment is important
34:44 - encouraging students that you don't
34:45 - expect administrators actually changing
34:48 - their mindset to stop thinking you know
34:50 - as administrators people often
34:53 - or teachers
34:54 - put their stereotypes out there in the
34:56 - world because we live in a world of
34:58 - stereotypes and if you imagine who's a
35:00 - computer science student if you don't
35:02 - imagine a student like miles mackey you
35:04 - might not you know give that opportunity
35:06 - to everybody and teachers can do their
35:08 - own effort to draw students into this
35:10 - class
35:11 - and besides enrollment once the student
35:13 - is in the class the feeling of inclusion
35:16 - in that class is also important as well
35:17 - if you feel like you're the one kid
35:19 - who's different if you're the only girl
35:21 - in a classroom full of boys where you
35:23 - know the teacher needs to spend effort
35:25 - to make sure every student knows you
35:27 - belong in this field and that's so
35:29 - important that sense of belonging
35:31 - is is lacking for a lot of students who
35:33 - don't see themselves as future computer
35:35 - scientists
35:36 - but i firmly believe this is a problem
35:38 - that we can change and k through 12
35:40 - education can change if you look at the
35:42 - numbers the number of young women and
35:44 - the number of black or latino students
35:47 - in computer science have grown 10 times
35:49 - 10-fold increase in the last eight years
35:52 - through the work of not only code.org
35:53 - but many other
35:55 - organizations like ours
35:56 - we're not we're no we're near balanced
35:59 - representation but we can see that this
36:01 - 10x growth is happening because of the
36:02 - work of educators and that's one of the
36:04 - most inspiring stu stories in in america
36:07 - today with all the problems in our
36:08 - country the work that teachers are doing
36:11 - to bring diversity into computer science
36:13 - education has been a huge success
36:18 - jack do you think we're out of time with
36:20 - secretary duncan
36:23 - yes we are so i want to thank you um
36:26 - secretary duncan hottie miles athena and
36:29 - milo for the conversation and thoughtful
36:31 - insight my takeaway from listening to
36:33 - you all is there's a call to action to
36:35 - do our part i think we heard that let's
36:37 - do our part and provide an opportunity
36:39 - for students to learn computer science
36:41 - administrators please consider how
36:43 - computer science be part of your school
36:44 - and teachers learn more about our
36:46 - professional learning program which
36:47 - you'll hear in a few minutes but i want
36:49 - to thank you all again
36:51 - for spending time with us and having
36:52 - this conversation thank you so much i
36:55 - invite everyone to visit code.org your
36:57 - school where you can learn more about
36:59 - our professional learning program but
37:01 - we're going to talk about that in our
37:03 - next segment so i'm excited to tag team
37:06 - with my colleague alana aaron alana is
37:09 - an educator who spent 13 years as a
37:11 - teacher and district administrator at
37:13 - the new york city department of
37:15 - education where she was most recently
37:17 - worked where she most recently worked on
37:18 - the district's computer science for all
37:21 - initiative alana is the director of our
37:23 - outreach team i'll turn it over to you
37:24 - alana
37:28 - thanks so much for the intro jackie i'm
37:31 - thrilled to have the opportunity to
37:33 - share a bit about our professional
37:34 - learning program with everyone here
37:36 - today what jackie didn't tell you
37:39 - is that i am a living testimonial that
37:41 - new to cs teachers can teach code.org
37:44 - courses
37:46 - i picked up the curriculum and taught it
37:48 - to my fifth grade students in new york
37:50 - city without ever having taken a
37:52 - computer science course myself so if i
37:55 - can do it
37:56 - you can do it that's to the teachers on
37:57 - the call
37:59 - and now at code.org i have the
38:01 - opportunity to
38:03 - help schools and districts nationally
38:05 - bring computer science to their students
38:07 - so let me begin with the code.org vision
38:11 - our vision is that every student in
38:13 - every school should have the opportunity
38:15 - to take a high quality computer science
38:17 - class we believe that by reaching
38:19 - underrepresented racial and ethnic
38:20 - groups like cody and arne were just
38:22 - talking about
38:24 - and young women we can both increase
38:27 - equity and opportunity and help take one
38:29 - important step toward increasing
38:32 - diversity in cs so miles thanks for
38:34 - setting us up nicely with your question
38:37 - one strategy
38:39 - we employ to help us achieve our mission
38:42 - is
38:43 - providing free open source curriculum
38:47 - as well as professional learning
38:48 - opportunities for teachers
38:51 - to date more than a hundred thousand
38:53 - teachers in kindergarten through 12th
38:55 - grade classrooms
38:57 - have gone through the code.org
38:59 - professional learning program to prepare
39:01 - to teach computer science
39:05 - so what do we offer our k-12 pathway
39:09 - includes
39:10 - cs fundamentals for elementary school
39:13 - teachers
39:14 - we offer two workshops for elementary
39:16 - teachers an introductory workshop for
39:19 - new to cs teachers
39:21 - and a deep dive workshop for teachers
39:23 - who have started implementing the cs
39:25 - fundamentals curriculum in their
39:27 - classrooms
39:30 - for middle and early high school
39:32 - teachers we offer cs discoveries an
39:34 - introductory computer science course
39:36 - that empowers students in grades 6
39:38 - through 10
39:39 - to create authentic artifacts and engage
39:42 - with computer science as a medium for
39:44 - creativity communication problem solving
39:47 - and of course fun
39:50 - for high school teachers we offer cs
39:52 - principals a higher level introductory
39:55 - course that introduces foundational
39:57 - concepts of computer science while
39:59 - challenging students to explore how
40:01 - computing and technology can impact the
40:04 - world
40:05 - this course can be taught as an advanced
40:07 - placement or ap course or as a non-ap
40:11 - course
40:12 - and i'm excited to share that we are
40:14 - currently developing
40:16 - a computer science
40:18 - a course
40:20 - which is recommended for any high school
40:22 - student who wishes to continue their
40:24 - computer science education after
40:26 - completing an introductory course like
40:28 - cs discoveries or cs principles
40:31 - we will launch this course in 2022 the
40:34 - code.org csa course builds upon
40:37 - structures introduced in csp
40:40 - are in cs principles excuse me and we
40:42 - believe this course will be accessible
40:44 - to students who have traditionally been
40:45 - underrepresented in computer science
40:52 - like csp csa can be offered as an ap
40:55 - course or as a non-ap course check out
40:57 - this growth from code.org and everyone
40:59 - else working to support computer science
41:01 - education
41:02 - i love the direction these graphs are
41:04 - going but we still have a ways to go we
41:06 - are still only up to 25 female and 20
41:10 - underrepresented groups
41:12 - taking an ap cs exam
41:17 - this is where our regional partner
41:19 - network comes in we've partnered with
41:21 - just under 60 organizations nationally
41:24 - including non-profits universities and
41:27 - government agencies who offer our
41:29 - professional learning programs locally
41:31 - to teachers in their regions
41:36 - there are many advantages to this model
41:39 - including local staff and facilitators
41:42 - in each region
41:43 - for professional development who can
41:44 - support new to cs teachers locally
41:47 - throughout the school year
41:48 - and provide resources for new districts
41:51 - and schools interested in adopting a
41:53 - computer science program
41:57 - a common barrier for schools and
41:59 - districts wanting to adopt computer
42:01 - science is
42:02 - funding of course
42:04 - in most regions
42:06 - scholarships are available for teachers
42:08 - who meet the scholarship criteria
42:11 - but we want to tell you about another
42:12 - opportunity sr funding
42:16 - since march of 2020 the federal
42:18 - government has provided state and local
42:21 - education agencies with 195 billion
42:24 - dollars in emergency relief funds to
42:26 - help address kobit 19's impact on
42:28 - elementary and secondary schools this
42:31 - funding comes from the recently signed
42:33 - 1.9 trillion dollar american rescue plan
42:37 - and two previous covid19 relief bills
42:39 - enacted in march and december of 2020.
42:42 - these funds can be used to support
42:44 - computer science locally in various ways
42:46 - and we hope your school or district will
42:49 - take advantage
42:51 - um i believe eric is going to put some
42:54 - links for you to access in the chat so
42:57 - that you can look into this
42:59 - and without further ado
43:02 - i'd like to introduce three of our
43:04 - amazing regional partner program
43:06 - managers to talk about the work they're
43:08 - doing locally in their respective
43:09 - regions
43:12 - first i'd like to introduce cheryl bobo
43:15 - cheryl's an educator with 35 years of
43:17 - teaching and leadership roles in alaska
43:20 - and is currently working with the alaska
43:22 - staff development network to expand
43:24 - computer science in alaska's urban and
43:26 - rural schools
43:28 - by creating professional learning
43:29 - opportunities for teachers and admin
43:32 - she enjoys the unique opportunities that
43:34 - come with working with students
43:36 - educators and admin across
43:38 - the vast state of alaska
43:42 - next we have larry nguyen
43:45 - who is the cs program manager for the my
43:47 - stem network and grand valley state
43:49 - university and supports cs
43:51 - implementation across the state of
43:53 - michigan
43:54 - welcome larry and last but not least we
43:57 - have paige prescott paige is with the cs
43:59 - alliance where she works to expand cs
44:01 - education in new mexico through a
44:03 - multi-pronged approach that includes
44:05 - teacher professional learning and policy
44:08 - at the district and state level
44:11 - welcome paige
44:13 - so i'm going to kick off our panel
44:16 - with a question for all three of you um
44:20 - paige let's start with you
44:22 - what makes a strong computer science
44:24 - program and what can one do to make
44:27 - computer science sustainable
44:29 - in their school district and or state
44:34 - hi everyone and thank you um it's a
44:36 - great question that i think about often
44:38 - and one of the things is i try and think
44:40 - about where is it most fragile and
44:44 - one of those is maybe that the teacher
44:47 - hasn't yet gotten trained in the school
44:49 - or the district and so providing that
44:52 - professional learning
44:54 - and making sure that that teacher once
44:56 - they do get some training feels
44:58 - supported and so then
45:01 - where else do they need support and
45:03 - maybe we want to think about the
45:05 - district level or the principal level
45:07 - and you know in the case of
45:10 - in the prior segment with athena as a
45:13 - computer science teacher and her
45:14 - administrator milo she has support and
45:17 - so she is um
45:19 - she knows that she has a network that
45:21 - she can tap into other computer science
45:23 - teachers through code.org and then also
45:25 - her principal is supporting her so does
45:29 - milo as a principal need some support is
45:31 - that a fragile area and so i try and
45:33 - think about it in an ecosystem level you
45:36 - know that all levels have some
45:38 - connection and feel supported and the
45:40 - other thing is that i try and keep
45:42 - computer science um
45:44 - thinking it very positive like make it
45:47 - fun make it inclusive and to keep that
45:50 - together more carrots and less sticks um
45:52 - when it comes to computer science
45:54 - and the last thing that i try and do is
45:57 - whenever i talk to anybody in a
45:59 - community especially anyone connected to
46:02 - computers uh to education i ask the
46:04 - question
46:07 - what are you doing to support computer
46:08 - science so that could be a school board
46:10 - member it could be an educator it could
46:12 - be a principal um it could be just maybe
46:16 - a volunteer in the community that is
46:18 - connected to
46:20 - the school or with the parents
46:23 - what are they doing to support and just
46:25 - by using that term like computer science
46:27 - education it alerts them that oh they
46:29 - should be doing something so then it
46:31 - gives the opportunity for them to either
46:34 - ask me more questions or to ask
46:36 - questions of the
46:37 - the constituents that i'm trying to get
46:39 - them to
46:40 - interact with which is mainly the
46:42 - schools um and then also make sure that
46:45 - students know about opportunities as
46:47 - well and to ask that as well like how
46:50 - are you getting involved in computer
46:51 - science oh well maybe i should and then
46:54 - they can feel um a part of that
46:56 - community that we're building and my
46:58 - metaphor uh is really right now
47:01 - deepening the bench because um one of
47:03 - the things that i want is i want
47:06 - teachers to have colleagues uh that they
47:08 - can connect or connect with and that you
47:10 - know it takes away that fragility where
47:12 - it's not dependent on one single person
47:14 - and their passion but that there's maybe
47:17 - if that teacher uh moves into a
47:19 - different position that there's another
47:21 - person in that building that can take on
47:23 - teaching computer science
47:26 - or maybe that there's other principles
47:28 - that understand the systemic
47:30 - ways that they can
47:32 - support computer science in their
47:33 - district and so that's what we want to
47:36 - do is just make it as pervasive as
47:38 - possible as inclusive and as possible
47:40 - and as positive as possible thank you
47:44 - thanks so much paige larry do you have
47:46 - anything to add on that
47:48 - yeah it's actually uh thank you for
47:50 - having me it's a perfect segue to to my
47:53 - thought with this building a strong
47:55 - cs program
47:56 - um
47:57 - it's easy to have one teacher be a
48:00 - shining star within a district and
48:01 - invest in that teacher and you have an
48:04 - awesome program but what happens when
48:07 - that teacher decides to retire or
48:09 - happens to take on another position
48:11 - and who's going to take up that mantle
48:14 - and so if you really want a strong cs
48:16 - program in your district you have to
48:19 - invest in it as a school district in a
48:21 - community and say
48:22 - we are going to be a part of this it's
48:24 - going to be part of our school
48:25 - improvement plan we're going to be doing
48:28 - we're going to be thinking about this is
48:29 - all our planning processes
48:31 - we're going to be thinking about
48:32 - multiple instructors doing this work and
48:35 - so that way it's not linchpin on one
48:37 - instructor and that it's
48:40 - the entire district has a plan to move
48:43 - this forward and not just that one
48:44 - person
48:45 - and so that's that to me is that the
48:47 - huge piece trying to strengthen it
48:49 - within the district
48:52 - thanks larry and cheryl
48:55 - um anything to add from alaska
48:57 - yeah i i want to say yes and all of the
49:00 - above they did a great job in kind of
49:04 - prototyping what what we're all thinking
49:06 - about one of the things that i wanted to
49:07 - add that's really important especially
49:09 - in a vast place like alaska is the
49:11 - unique relationships and
49:13 - i believe that building the
49:15 - relationships with the department of ed
49:18 - the university superintendents
49:19 - principals teachers counselors and
49:22 - community i try my very best to
49:25 - educate the community also to the value
49:28 - of what this will bring to their
49:29 - community but um developing
49:32 - giants reaching out to individual um
49:35 - districts or schools and talking about
49:37 - their strategic plan and and how i read
49:39 - their strategic plan and how this
49:41 - absolutely fills so many of their little
49:43 - points
49:44 - and um awareness dispelling
49:47 - misconceptions is really important
49:49 - uh video production is not computer
49:52 - science per se it's
49:54 - more in liter digital literacy and
49:57 - lastly i want to say that culturally
50:00 - for like many of the small communities
50:02 - it's
50:03 - providing careers and job opportunities
50:05 - in their own local communities good
50:07 - paying jobs where they can stay in their
50:09 - communities and help care for their
50:11 - elders without leaving and having to go
50:13 - to california or anchorage to take you
50:15 - know get jobs they can stay home and
50:17 - take care of their elders so
50:19 - um it's it's multi-pronged but it's
50:23 - it's got to be relationships and it's
50:24 - got to be individualized
50:28 - thanks cheryl speaking of relationships
50:31 - i think we'd be remiss to not
50:32 - acknowledge the impact of covid19
50:36 - on our schools and as a result on the
50:38 - work we're doing to achieve our shared
50:41 - mission
50:42 - um so
50:43 - what impacts has coveid19 had on the
50:46 - professional learning program in your
50:48 - region cheryl i'll
50:51 - send this one back to you
50:52 - yeah i'm glad to answer this it's a
50:54 - great question and
50:56 - after the panic you know settled down a
50:58 - little bit and the
51:01 - chaos brings opportunity and we had a
51:03 - lot of chaos in alaska trying to figure
51:05 - out kids didn't have internet there was
51:08 - a lot of things going on but we were
51:10 - able to in our csf program increase it
51:13 - to
51:14 - 48 of 54 schools have participated in
51:17 - training now and it's because
51:19 - equity has rose to the top and we're
51:22 - offering it all virtual anyone in alaska
51:24 - no matter where you sit if you're
51:26 - sitting in your car if you're sitting in
51:28 - your school or the school lounge or
51:30 - wherever you're able to connect with
51:33 - professional development now so i think
51:36 - that um
51:37 - it has increased equity across the state
51:39 - of alaska
51:40 - way more than
51:41 - tenfold that's i'll just keep it that
51:43 - short but we have been able to reach a
51:45 - lot more and we always wanted to go
51:46 - virtual because of our big state so um
51:51 - you know there's some good things that
51:52 - do come out of bad things
51:55 - thanks cheryl
51:57 - larry would you like to add
51:59 - yeah so i can
52:00 - the way i would approach this is
52:03 - the pandemic has benefited at least the
52:06 - professional learning aspect has
52:07 - benefited our rural areas
52:09 - um i can speak to our upper peninsula in
52:12 - michigan it's it's six to eight hours to
52:14 - go from one end to the other and to ask
52:17 - teachers to meet
52:19 - and for professional learning is very
52:20 - difficult it's taxing and so by
52:23 - providing this virtually now
52:25 - we are able to to reach those areas of
52:27 - our state that geographically was
52:29 - difficult to reach
52:31 - and it also suits the folks that
52:34 - they got families at home they can't
52:36 - travel long distance they can't spend
52:38 - that time and so overall just having
52:40 - both virtual and face-to-face now uh
52:44 - just supports the equity for our
52:45 - teachers
52:48 - thanks i see
52:50 - some some trends across your states
52:53 - page would you like to talk about the
52:55 - effects in new mexico
52:57 - well one of the things is um that it
53:00 - really lit a fire under the equity and
53:03 - access of broadband
53:05 - so we just ended a legislative session
53:08 - and there's a lot of
53:11 - investment that will be made in that
53:15 - need
53:16 - that became just
53:17 - it was always there but now it became
53:20 - through this past year just so obvious
53:22 - how important
53:24 - access to internet was
53:26 - and so hopefully we can see some changes
53:28 - that are going to happen in new mexico
53:30 - but also um across the country
53:32 - that will allow our rural students um
53:35 - and our urban students to have uh access
53:37 - to great
53:38 - high-speed internet going forward for
53:40 - their education
53:43 - thanks so much
53:44 - um we are getting close to time but i
53:48 - have one last question for the three of
53:49 - you
53:50 - um
53:51 - i wish we had more time but in our final
53:54 - minutes what are two words of advice
53:56 - you'd give our audience and what can the
53:58 - folks here do as soon as tomorrow or
54:01 - next week to start growing a cs program
54:04 - in their school or district or region um
54:08 - try to keep it to like
54:10 - 15 to 30 seconds each please
54:13 - let's start with
54:15 - you paige
54:17 - so one of the questions i i mentioned it
54:19 - earlier ask the question what are you
54:20 - doing to computer uh to support computer
54:22 - science education or to be involved in
54:24 - computer science education so just by
54:27 - asking that question
54:28 - you get that conversation and that
54:30 - engagement
54:32 - and my
54:33 - two words are
54:35 - community and depth so building a
54:37 - community of educators and people
54:39 - connected to computer science education
54:42 - and then giving the depth of that
54:43 - experience thanks
54:46 - thanks so much
54:47 - how about you cheryl two words
54:50 - of advice um two words of advice i i my
54:54 - big words are
54:56 - flexibility and listening be flexible
54:58 - and meet them where they are not what
55:01 - you plan to give them but what they need
55:04 - and listening carefully to your
55:05 - community to your parents to the
55:08 - teachers um you can help them with their
55:10 - challenges
55:13 - thank you and larry to close us out
55:16 - yeah so my two words are directed to
55:18 - school districts and that's invest in
55:20 - culture and so if if you really want to
55:23 - have that strong cs program within your
55:25 - school you have to invest within your
55:27 - teachers within your planning process
55:29 - within your school improvement process
55:31 - you have to build a culture
55:33 - around cs if you wanted to survive
55:36 - within your district
55:40 - larry cheryl and paige thank you so much
55:43 - for joining us and for all the work you
55:45 - and your organizations are doing for the
55:46 - students of alaska michigan and new
55:48 - mexico we really appreciate your
55:50 - partnership
55:51 - um
55:52 - and
55:53 - here we are despite the amazing work our
55:56 - partners are doing on the ground and all
55:58 - the progress we're seeing the truth of
56:00 - the matter is that most schools still
56:02 - don't teach computer science so please
56:06 - join the movement if you're a teacher
56:08 - visit code.org
56:11 - your school like jackie shared earlier
56:13 - to apply now and after this webinar
56:16 - please tell a teacher friend to apply as
56:17 - well
56:18 - parents contact your child's schools to
56:22 - advocate for a computer science program
56:25 - and if you're an administrator
56:28 - connect with your local regional partner
56:30 - you can reach them through this link
56:33 - that
56:34 - will be in the chat as well bitly
56:36 - backslash contact my rp
56:41 - to connect with your local partner to
56:43 - find out what offerings are available in

Cleaned transcript:

good morning and afternoon to all that have joined us today to discuss why computer science is for every school every classroom and every student i am jackie smalls the chief programs officer for code.org and will be serving as your moderator for today's presentation we want your participation today so we're going to take a quick poll we want to know who is in the audience are you an administrator teacher student parent or joining us in another role to learn more about computer science while you take a minute to answer the poll please note we will be moderating the q a encourage you to ask questions throughout the presentation give everyone a few seconds to take see what our results are well great we have 44 that are teachers we have 20 percent about 20 that are administrators we have some parents we have some students we have others that have joined us so thank you so much i'd like to get started by first introducing our former secretary of education arne duncan secretary duncan was u.s was the u.s secretary of education from january 2009 through december 2015. as part of the obama administration beforehand duncan served as chief executive officer of chicago public schools from 2000 and i don't have that i'm so sorry but until 2008 duncan won praise for uniting the city's stakeholders behind an education agenda that included opening 100 new schools expanding after school summer learning early childhood and college access programs dramatically boosting the caliber of teachers and building publicprivate partnerships around a variety of education initiatives he currently leaves leeds chicago cred a nonprofit trying to achieve a transformative reduction in gun violence in chicago he also manages the partner he's a managing partner at emerson collective an organization dedicated to removing barriers so people can live to their full potential secretary duncan graduated magnum laude from harvard university in 1987 majoring in sociology welcome secretary duncan thank you so much for being here i would also like to introduce our ceo and founder hadi partovi hadi partovi is a tech entrepreneur and investor and ceo of the education profit code.org born in tehran hadi grew up during the iran iraq war where he taught himself to code at home after immigrating to the united states he spent his summers working as a software engineer to help pay his way through college upon graduating from harvard university with a master's in computer science heidi pursued a career in tech starting at microsoft where he rose to executive ranks he has founded multiple startups and served as an advisor to wellknown tech companies but his main focus is code.org code.org has established computer science classes reaching 30 percent of u.s students created the most broadly used curriculum platform for k12 computer science and launched the global hour of code movement that has reached hundreds of millions of students spanning every country in the world heidi's family lives in seattle washington and isn't spare in his spare time which we all don't think he has much of but in his spare time he enjoys skiing water sports playing music and playing word games thank you for joining us hottie thank you so much it's it's an honor to have you with us secretary duncan uh where are you visiting us from right now i i assume you're at home after the pandemic uh where are you situated yeah plea please call me already you know better than that and now yeah home in chicago and lived two blocks from where i grew up so it's good to be back home on the south side oh great well i'm in seattle uh i'm excited uh to hopefully get to the near end of the the shutdowns from this pandemic i got my second shot just about a week ago so i'm i feel like a free man and i hope you've gotten vaccinated too as well i don't know if you have the chance yet but yeah no we have our family's uh been vaccinated so we're real lucky we were sick in november and hit our family pretty hard and we're we've lost like many folks we've lost you know friends to to the to to the pandemic to cobia so we are very very lucky and grateful to be on the other side of this and just want to see the country get to the other side of this as quickly as we can yeah i'm extremely hopeful that we're at the beginning of the end um would you like to share a few comments about you know just how the pandemic has impacted education and for all the teachers and administrators in the audience thoughts on basically the reopening of schools and what we can expect to see coming up soon well that's not a small topic i'll try and be brief first i just um so you know to educators to parents to students really just want to say how profoundly sorry i am and i'm always very honest for better or worse i've said repeatedly that i think this pandemic morphed from a natural disaster to a manmade catastrophe and other nations because they listened to science because they took it seriously recovered much more rapidly much more quickly than we did and the loss of life here has been absolutely staggering for our educators the loss of learning time loss of a chance to be in physical schools uh for parents the stress of trying to do homeschooling for a year for students you know i've you know we have a high school son and a daughter a freshman in college like so many you know millions of families across the country just to have our our children lose that chance just to be kids and to uh and to be proximate to each other and to have some fun and to play and just have normal social human human interactions just desperately sorry i also want to say how unbelievably inspired i am by how hard educators and parents and students worked throughout this there was no playbook nobody prepped for this at any time in their their life we haven't had anything like this obviously in this century and so to see people roll up their sleeves and work so hard on every aspect of this yes academically but students social emotional needs i i participated in a weekly call starting last march so far from you know basically over a year to make sure food was being distributed through through uh through schools and just herculean heroic efforts they are our schools aren't just place of learning their social safety nets and to see just not just students but families in the community being fed um during a desperately difficult time again beyond inspiring and i think the challenge for us all all now highlighted outside of people is that for me the goal is not to go back to quote unquote normal because normal didn't serve tens of millions of kids well enough and so how do we you know reimagine how do we rethink education in many many different ways we can get into a few of those ways now but it really is a chance to to create a system that is more equitable and fair and just and gives every child a chance to fulfill their extraordinary academic and social potential so a difficult time but also a time of hope for me of creativity and the final thing i'll say that if nothing else i think our children have learned how interconnected we are how important science is how if our family is okay but if our neighbors family isn't uh then none of us are okay and for for the many things i think we as adults haven't done well uh my hope is that our young people for the next 30 40 50 years will lead our country in a very bet in a different way and honestly a better way and uh won't take our democracy for for granted ever and won't take our public health or education for granted ever and um if they can take the very difficult lessons of the pandemic forward um the next couple decades could actually be a pretty remarkable time in the united states yeah among the things that i think about the bright spots is just how much technology has helped people cope you know 100 years ago during the you know the the last major pandemic people didn't have zoom they didn't have the internet any of the things we take for granted uh you know i have kids who are uh 14 12 and and seven and my sevenyearold he was in first grade has now become an expert zoom student uh but not only he's learned how to use zoom he's also learned how to schedule his life because you know instead of being in one classroom he has to click two different links and things like that and he's like on top of his own schedule which my other kids didn't learn that when they were in first grade so this is forced them to learn new skills and really our teachers and administrators all around the country and even all around the world have embraced technology in a way that schools haven't before you know for the last 10 20 years people have been talking about what are ways technology can help education uh and everybody basically had a rapid rapid like all right we have to figure it all out right now um you know whether it's video conferencing or scheduling or live q a or quizzes or things like that just all the different ways teachers have figured out creatively how to engage their students and you know one of the beauties of american education is there's no sort of central plan for these things teachers everywhere came up with their own solutions creatively and that's it's wonderful to to see the different ways they've done that for the work of code.org one of the things that's critical now as we think about the reopening is how to frame that you know we're entering a new world and in that new world computer science is much more important than it's ever been uh and you know aside from all the things we need to teach students at you know the work of code.org is around teaching computer science just like we teach math just like we teach english or regular science or history or foreign languages you know we're in the 21st century now and all the problems our communities are the human race is going to need to solve are going to be technical problems or problems that we can solve with technology and it's important for our schools as they've adapted all these new technical skills during the pandemic to figure out all right how do we move beyond just teaching with technology but teaching about technology teaching about the way these things are built about how to create them and so on uh and that's one of the things that i think uh it's a real opportunity for america uh but it's also an opportunity we need to deliberately act on it's not just going to happen naturally if we go back to the old normal the old normal most schools don't teach computer science because it's sort of this special subject that you don't think is for every student and that's one of the things i'm hopeful that this country can sort of add into the curriculum as we as we reopen you know i just appreciate your leadership and tenacity so much what code.org has done is uh pretty spectacular and it's it's um it's almost like everything in our society we think about the pandemic we think about issues of racial justice or racial injustice lack thereof and technology as you have lived as you know better than anyone is an absolute game changer if our students are are confident and fluent and company you know can solve problems um they're going to have a world of opportunity ahead of them and if they don't then they're going to really struggle we know a wildly disproportionate number of the jobs of the future are going to involve you know technical literacy and it's a thing where it can either this is really up to us it can either be the great equalizer or it can exacerbate the divide between the halves and the have nots so there's nothing for me inherently feel good or bad about it the world is going that in that way and i think we have not just a an educational um but a moral uh necessity uh to make sure all of our children have access to these skills and access these opportunities to learn and as you probably found the hard way too often in education we move a little bit at a glacierlike speed you know we don't adapt quickly and as you said the pandemic for better or worse is forced us to think differently and to to teach differently and the idea that children can only learn something in a physical building you know six or seven hours a day you know nine you know nine months out of the year five five five days a week that doesn't make any sense anymore our children have to be able to learn anything they want anytime anywhere any place 24 7. having access to technology and wifi and internet devices is so critically important but if we think reading is important and we know it is if we think mathematics is important we know it is um computer science is the new literacy it's the new currency and i just want all of our children to have access to that and let me clear to have access to it at an early age not uh you know high school is great but that's a little late in the game if we start much much earlier than that when when we know students can uh children can absorb uh so so much and so i just appreciate the extraordinary progress that you and cordaro have have had on how much you have spurred change from the outside i think it's incumbent of upon also you know in the education world um to really embrace this uh now and make this the norm not the exception for kids and to do it again with a real equity lens that i want to make sure children here in chicago in the inner city and children um in appalachia and children on native american reservations um all have access all have access and have access to the great content and great curriculum and great teachers and great technology and if we do that i would say talent is much more evenly spread than opportunity our goal is to have opportunity to meet that talent whatever it is and it's everywhere and that's that's the job ahead of us that's the job ahead of us yep the sad thing is only about a half half of us schools teach computer science and half of them don't and if you look at the ones that do teach it it's the schools that are wealthier the schools that have less diversity among their student populations schools that are mostly in the suburbs rather than the cities are rural and those are the problems that we're trying to to tackle as well jackie's going to come back and she has some folks who are going to ask us questions as we continue the conversation so we're going to have i think three people joining us thanks so much hoddy yes we have some special guests representing the voice of students teachers and administrators so i'll start with some introductions first i'll start with miles mac miles is a graduating senior honor who's an honor student as well at patrick taylor science and technology academy in louisiana he has grown up loving stem and plans to major in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science he has participated in summer stem programs at mit and us irvine working on artificial intelligence machine learning and programming projects miles is very busy and he's ready to take on the world so we welcome miles we also welcome athena talk athena is navajo from two grey hills new mexico which is one which is on the navajo reservation she is currently teaching ap computer science principles at bond wilson technical center and finally we have mr milo mc mcminn a second generation new mexican educator who works at central consolidated school district which serves over 6 000 students on and off the navajo nation milo is the founding principal of bonn wilson technical center and early college high school cte academy that offers school high school students industrybased learning in mechatronics computer science and engineering prenursing culinary arts welding construction and industrial maintenance welcome miles athena and milo and i believe miles has the first question he'd like to ask hello everybody um i'm really into computer science but many of my friends aren't sure if they want to pursue a career in it so um my question is secretary duncan and heidi um what would you say to students who are on the fence about pursuing a career in computer science how do you start off follow your lead miles thanks for your leadership uh sure well you know if you have friends who are thinking they don't want to they're not sure about a career in computer science the question is any career you want to go into whether it's marketing or design these are all increasingly technical fields if one of your friends wants to become a doctor or a nurse everything about healthcare is being changed by computer science even if you want to become a farmer the future of farming is selfdriving tractors you know and farmers increasingly need to actually code their tractors or debug their tractors most people don't realize is how much even something is as traditional or considered the old school is farming has become a technical field and then also computer science helps develop the mind so you know why are we teaching math it's not because you want to pursue a career in math but every student learns math because it helps develop your thinking skills and the same thing is true of computer science just as much yeah just a couple quick thoughts that for me the goal is not to tell everybody this is what they have to do for their career we all have different interests and passions what i want to make sure is that your friends aren't locked out of these possibilities and again i'm going to keep coming back to the lack of equity across our country in everything you know health care criminal justice and yes education is real and so i just want to make sure that your friends have a chance to decide whether or not this is what they want to devote their life to and at the end of the day you know what's the nature of work going forward the nature of work we don't know the jobs you know what job are you gonna hold probably exists yet you know i'm not smart enough to know what that's gonna look like what i do know is the nature of work is gonna be around solving problems that our ability to solve problems to work together um to work in diverse teams to work not just domestically but internationally that's going to be best to define who's successful and who's not and if you have those skills i consider you know computer science to be integral to be critical to that you have those skills you're going to be able to do really well for yourself for your family for your community if you don't have those skills you're going to be on the outside looking in and that's pretty scary and so for me it's never about telling anyone what they have to do or what they must do it's exposure let them know what those careers look like what what does those salaries look like it's hard to imagine doing something you've never seen before and so you know that's what i think what hotties you know devote his life to and other folks is to making sure that a hundred percent of our students not just the privilege not just the wealthy not just the affluent not just the white but all of our students have a chance to make this decision for themselves great i think i'm next thank you for having me here uh my question is i'm lucky enough to be in a school that offers computer science but many schools in my region and area both on and off the navajo nation don't have that opportunity how can principals really promote computer science in their schools both at the district level state level and the national level so this is a you know this is a great question if if a school doesn't teach computer science or if your school teaches some computer science but wants to teach more i think almost every school in the country has an opportunity to expand its offerings lots of schools teach sort of an introductory class but don't teach ap level computer science uh and whether you have cs or not the top questions schools ask are first of all what is the budget for teaching it but then most importantly who is going to teach it because if your school doesn't have a computer science teacher you know you look around which one of us is going to teach this class schools don't have a budget to hire a new teacher and the work that code.org does more than anything else is professional development of existing teachers so that your history teacher your math teacher your science teacher even your art teacher can go through a professional learning program and actually become a computer science teacher using the code.org program and this is something you know that's available in every single state and in in most regions it's completely free of charge to the school especially high need schools we offer scholarships for teachers to go through the professional learning program so they can basically effectively on code.org's dime or rather thanks to the generous donors that have supported our work we will train the the the teachers in your school the hard thing for an administrator like yourself is also making sure to put room for it in the schedule you know so for example at a high school level you need to open up a slot in the master schedule you know for for at least one computer science class and if you open up that slots i guarantee you students will sign up for it or if your school teaches introductory cs if you open up an ap class ap computer science has become the fastest growing field in the history of the college board ap program it's because students actually really want this stuff and and most administrators don't realize the students demand for this because students know that this is the future and if you say we're adding this course they sign up in much larger numbers than people expect but the first step is getting a teacher to go through the training program uh and you know code.org training program the professional learning program is is i think one of the best ways to start especially because for almost for most schools we make it free thanks to the scholarships we provide yeah did i hear your it showed that your school is an early college school is that correct yeah we are partnering with navajo technical university we had a meeting here yesterday and they said hi to you arnie so i wanted to share that welcome with you as well yeah first of all i'm just a huge fan of early college programs you know high school diploma is critical but i think it's almost not quite enough important but not sufficient i'd love to see every child graduating every student graduating with some college credits in their back pocket um or industry certification or both and the college exposure and you know just appreciate you so appreciate so much you're working on navajo in navajo nation and all of our children deserve a worldclass education but no one no one deserves it more than our native children communities and the chance to take a college class is not just for the high flyers it can be for students who are thinking about dropping out or thinking just college isn't for them that they don't they don't know anyone they've never had a family member go to college and to have that experience and start to think well i can belong on a campus and i can succeed with collegelevel work again just it's not just the academic learning sort of the mindset the mind shift and uh really opening up the the world of possibilities so one just a huge fan um thanks for working the community that deserves the best in terms of how do we expand this to other schools um for better or worse you know today in this day and age you sort of say who do people listen to they listen to their peers so i love hottie hotties and amazing salesmen but honestly most principals might listen to you before they listen to him or listen to me and not they don't already have a fulltime job but the more you're talking to your peers that's who people trust these days the more you're talking to your colleagues letting them know um the training is important and it's really interesting how he says about sort of opening up a slot and so this to me is just a really critical point i don't want to blow through it you know computer science can be in some places like a quoteunquote extracurricular but i don't think it's an extracurricular it's essential it's got to be in in the in the core and that again has to become the norm so figuring that out i know there's some you know technical issues and scheduling issues but where that doesn't happen when it gets pushed to the side or somehow pushed out then our students don't don't have access and then i think and not again everyone might not agree with this but if we can't get a teacher at every school tomorrow which we know is going to take some time could we have a teacher at one school teach students at three or four or five high schools or 10 high schools frankly or 20 and that's again that's a bit of a controversial idea but i don't want to wait and more importantly i don't want our students to wait a year or two or five years until those teachers get trained and let's just provide that access now you know obviously using technology virtually we're better at that than we've ever been and uh where we have expertise um whether it's on a native american reservation or not on a reservation um let's make sure our students have access sooner than later and just encourage folks to think to think a little differently and think a little creatively there great thank you my next question is kind of a mix of those i i really believe that computer science is essential and then it should be part of core instruction you know same with math science history and and social studies but one thing i hear from from colleagues is how can we integrate uh computer science when we're dealing with standardized testing and kids still need to learn the basics and we need to focus on that what would you tell administrators who say that yeah so this is a it's a very very legitimate question a hard one and i just think we have to it's a it's a tough one to sort of you know talk through but we have to stop pitting this thing against it against something else and it's got to be we have all these debates in education and 99 of the time for me it's not either or it's both and so we need math and computer science we need language arts and we need foreign languages i would add we need financial literacy and if we're serious about giving our children a chance to build positive futures for themselves is not one is more important than the other i would argue that many of these skills reinforce each other if you're more interested if computer science sparks your interest that might help you do a little bit better in english potentially or in algebra and it gives you a reason to be excited about going to school each day and that's going to be a different you know a different subject or a different you know our class for every child but adding this into the mix many many you know our students a lot more fluent often with technology than we are as adults we're meeting them where they are and i promise you is it's you know if we want to see more young people be successful if we want to continue to reduce high school dropout rates which are still too high if we want more young people not just to graduate from high school but going to some learning um beyond college and start to build positive lives for themselves there's never one answer we have to do 20 things well but one of those things one of those strategies has to be access to this extraordinary word world of technology and computer science in all the world of opportunities that are available to our students if they're successful there for the rest of their lives one of the questions i get a lot and actually many of the panelists or many of the attendees have asked is whether computer science should be required for graduation uh you know because you're asking how do schools deal with this when they're struggling to teach the basics i firmly believe computer science is one of the basics you know if you were to start a school from scratch today and there was no education system there wasn't 200 years of curriculum from the past and you're just deciding what should students in the 21st century learn to prepare them for life how many years of what subject there's no way you'd say zero computer science whereas that's what most schools in this country teach because they're basically teaching what they taught last year and the year before and a hundred years before but this but it takes a mental change to think this is one of the basics and and there's many states where they're actually already making that mental change arkansas just passed a law saying computer science is going to be a requirement for high school graduation in south carolina and in nevada in both of those states it's also required for every study students to study as part of their k12 experience and i'm pretty sure that if you think 10 years out this is going to be mandatory at least at some level for students just as basic preparation but it's going to take us time to get there i think athena and miles have two more questions because we all we also want to get to the segment where we say how do you do this and how do you ensure that computer science is in your school so we're going to make sure that athena is able to answer her question and miles will end with yours okay hi everyone so my question is you know thinking you know integrating computer science with everything how do we get students engaged you know students that might not necessarily think that computer science is for them you know sometimes we get students placed in computer science that don't know anything about it and they don't they immediately want to change classes because they don't think they can do it i i'd love to answer this one you know as adults it's often you know adults mostly are intimidated by technology uh it's sort of like oh this scary new thing they want to use an app but they don't want to you know learning about the insides of stuff is not something we all learned when we were growing up so as adults people think computer science is like calculus it's like rocket science it's like for the more advanced kids for the kids they're so at home with the technology and the best way to engage them is with the creativity instead of saying we're going to learn computer science it's asking them what would you like to create what game would you like to create what app would you like to create what website would you like to create and that makes it a lot more like art class or like music class where it's more playing and creating and at every age even among adults creating is what drives people you know once you decide you want to make an app or make a game then you're the learning is really just about a means to an end rather than you know this thing that you have to learn because school told you that you need to do it i also would say you know when i when i first studied computer science when i was a kid it was very math oriented so it's like we were writing the code to calculate the fibonacci sequence of numbers whereas in today's day and age computer science is about changing the world and the next generation is going to need to tackle so many world problems whether it's you know things like climate change cleaning the oceans global poverty gender equality curing diseases and every one of these problems we're going to need to solve using technology so telling students that the reason to learn this class isn't just for the creativity but it's to be part of that next generation of problem solvers i think is very very motivating for our youngest learners amen thank you miles we have time for your question and then we'll conclude this segment okay so my last question has to do with diversity so we know that computer science is dominated by predominantly white and asian men so um i guess my question to you guys is how do you think we should go about integrating computer science with women um black latinx and other people of color in the field yeah i mean that's the right you know maybe most important question to to start and end with and for me this is not a selfcorrecting problem and if we don't intentionally try and close that access i don't talk about achievement gaps i talk about opportunity gaps if we don't close that opportunity gap you're going to see that divide grow it's going to get worse and worse and so this to be has to it's all exposure exposure exposure it's committing to those young people in those communities early it's not waiting to high school so what are we doing with our third and fourth and fifth graders to have these conversations mentorships uh job shadowing again physically virtually whatever just being exposed to this world i i'll just say what i said before talent is everywhere opportunity is not and if we just sit back and take who comes our way we're going to continue to be you know white male you know dominated and that's not what the world looks like now that's not bringing out the the genius that exists everywhere across our country and so we have to very intentionally go to under represented underserved disadvantaged marginalized whatever you want to call those schools those communities we all know where they are we know who they are we have to go and intentionally create opportunity when it doesn't exist and i promise you if we do that that talent will more than meet us halfway but that's on us that's not on the kids that's on us as adults to make that effort and hold ourselves accountable for doing that this problem is very near and dear to my heart having basically spent my career in the tech industry it's an industry that is uh basically dominated by white and asian men and addressing that isn't just something we could do in k through 12 as those basically diversity issues and inclusivity issues in k12 in university and in the corporate workforce but as k12 educators which are the audience here primarily are teachers and administrators we have a major role to play access is for sure a big part of it it's depressing that a student who is black is almost half as likely to have computer science offered in their school than a student who's white that makes no sense at all in the united states of america that's also why for the schools that don't teach computer science where especially for schools with highly diverse populations code.org makes scholarships available for the teachers to learn how to teach it and any administrator on this on this video call that if you're in a school that doesn't teach computer science please have your teachers sign up for a professional learning program but access is the first step actually getting enrollment is important encouraging students that you don't expect administrators actually changing their mindset to stop thinking you know as administrators people often or teachers put their stereotypes out there in the world because we live in a world of stereotypes and if you imagine who's a computer science student if you don't imagine a student like miles mackey you might not you know give that opportunity to everybody and teachers can do their own effort to draw students into this class and besides enrollment once the student is in the class the feeling of inclusion in that class is also important as well if you feel like you're the one kid who's different if you're the only girl in a classroom full of boys where you know the teacher needs to spend effort to make sure every student knows you belong in this field and that's so important that sense of belonging is is lacking for a lot of students who don't see themselves as future computer scientists but i firmly believe this is a problem that we can change and k through 12 education can change if you look at the numbers the number of young women and the number of black or latino students in computer science have grown 10 times 10fold increase in the last eight years through the work of not only code.org but many other organizations like ours we're not we're no we're near balanced representation but we can see that this 10x growth is happening because of the work of educators and that's one of the most inspiring stu stories in in america today with all the problems in our country the work that teachers are doing to bring diversity into computer science education has been a huge success jack do you think we're out of time with secretary duncan yes we are so i want to thank you um secretary duncan hottie miles athena and milo for the conversation and thoughtful insight my takeaway from listening to you all is there's a call to action to do our part i think we heard that let's do our part and provide an opportunity for students to learn computer science administrators please consider how computer science be part of your school and teachers learn more about our professional learning program which you'll hear in a few minutes but i want to thank you all again for spending time with us and having this conversation thank you so much i invite everyone to visit code.org your school where you can learn more about our professional learning program but we're going to talk about that in our next segment so i'm excited to tag team with my colleague alana aaron alana is an educator who spent 13 years as a teacher and district administrator at the new york city department of education where she was most recently worked where she most recently worked on the district's computer science for all initiative alana is the director of our outreach team i'll turn it over to you alana thanks so much for the intro jackie i'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share a bit about our professional learning program with everyone here today what jackie didn't tell you is that i am a living testimonial that new to cs teachers can teach code.org courses i picked up the curriculum and taught it to my fifth grade students in new york city without ever having taken a computer science course myself so if i can do it you can do it that's to the teachers on the call and now at code.org i have the opportunity to help schools and districts nationally bring computer science to their students so let me begin with the code.org vision our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to take a high quality computer science class we believe that by reaching underrepresented racial and ethnic groups like cody and arne were just talking about and young women we can both increase equity and opportunity and help take one important step toward increasing diversity in cs so miles thanks for setting us up nicely with your question one strategy we employ to help us achieve our mission is providing free open source curriculum as well as professional learning opportunities for teachers to date more than a hundred thousand teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms have gone through the code.org professional learning program to prepare to teach computer science so what do we offer our k12 pathway includes cs fundamentals for elementary school teachers we offer two workshops for elementary teachers an introductory workshop for new to cs teachers and a deep dive workshop for teachers who have started implementing the cs fundamentals curriculum in their classrooms for middle and early high school teachers we offer cs discoveries an introductory computer science course that empowers students in grades 6 through 10 to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science as a medium for creativity communication problem solving and of course fun for high school teachers we offer cs principals a higher level introductory course that introduces foundational concepts of computer science while challenging students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world this course can be taught as an advanced placement or ap course or as a nonap course and i'm excited to share that we are currently developing a computer science a course which is recommended for any high school student who wishes to continue their computer science education after completing an introductory course like cs discoveries or cs principles we will launch this course in 2022 the code.org csa course builds upon structures introduced in csp are in cs principles excuse me and we believe this course will be accessible to students who have traditionally been underrepresented in computer science like csp csa can be offered as an ap course or as a nonap course check out this growth from code.org and everyone else working to support computer science education i love the direction these graphs are going but we still have a ways to go we are still only up to 25 female and 20 underrepresented groups taking an ap cs exam this is where our regional partner network comes in we've partnered with just under 60 organizations nationally including nonprofits universities and government agencies who offer our professional learning programs locally to teachers in their regions there are many advantages to this model including local staff and facilitators in each region for professional development who can support new to cs teachers locally throughout the school year and provide resources for new districts and schools interested in adopting a computer science program a common barrier for schools and districts wanting to adopt computer science is funding of course in most regions scholarships are available for teachers who meet the scholarship criteria but we want to tell you about another opportunity sr funding since march of 2020 the federal government has provided state and local education agencies with 195 billion dollars in emergency relief funds to help address kobit 19's impact on elementary and secondary schools this funding comes from the recently signed 1.9 trillion dollar american rescue plan and two previous covid19 relief bills enacted in march and december of 2020. these funds can be used to support computer science locally in various ways and we hope your school or district will take advantage um i believe eric is going to put some links for you to access in the chat so that you can look into this and without further ado i'd like to introduce three of our amazing regional partner program managers to talk about the work they're doing locally in their respective regions first i'd like to introduce cheryl bobo cheryl's an educator with 35 years of teaching and leadership roles in alaska and is currently working with the alaska staff development network to expand computer science in alaska's urban and rural schools by creating professional learning opportunities for teachers and admin she enjoys the unique opportunities that come with working with students educators and admin across the vast state of alaska next we have larry nguyen who is the cs program manager for the my stem network and grand valley state university and supports cs implementation across the state of michigan welcome larry and last but not least we have paige prescott paige is with the cs alliance where she works to expand cs education in new mexico through a multipronged approach that includes teacher professional learning and policy at the district and state level welcome paige so i'm going to kick off our panel with a question for all three of you um paige let's start with you what makes a strong computer science program and what can one do to make computer science sustainable in their school district and or state hi everyone and thank you um it's a great question that i think about often and one of the things is i try and think about where is it most fragile and one of those is maybe that the teacher hasn't yet gotten trained in the school or the district and so providing that professional learning and making sure that that teacher once they do get some training feels supported and so then where else do they need support and maybe we want to think about the district level or the principal level and you know in the case of in the prior segment with athena as a computer science teacher and her administrator milo she has support and so she is um she knows that she has a network that she can tap into other computer science teachers through code.org and then also her principal is supporting her so does milo as a principal need some support is that a fragile area and so i try and think about it in an ecosystem level you know that all levels have some connection and feel supported and the other thing is that i try and keep computer science um thinking it very positive like make it fun make it inclusive and to keep that together more carrots and less sticks um when it comes to computer science and the last thing that i try and do is whenever i talk to anybody in a community especially anyone connected to computers uh to education i ask the question what are you doing to support computer science so that could be a school board member it could be an educator it could be a principal um it could be just maybe a volunteer in the community that is connected to the school or with the parents what are they doing to support and just by using that term like computer science education it alerts them that oh they should be doing something so then it gives the opportunity for them to either ask me more questions or to ask questions of the the constituents that i'm trying to get them to interact with which is mainly the schools um and then also make sure that students know about opportunities as well and to ask that as well like how are you getting involved in computer science oh well maybe i should and then they can feel um a part of that community that we're building and my metaphor uh is really right now deepening the bench because um one of the things that i want is i want teachers to have colleagues uh that they can connect or connect with and that you know it takes away that fragility where it's not dependent on one single person and their passion but that there's maybe if that teacher uh moves into a different position that there's another person in that building that can take on teaching computer science or maybe that there's other principles that understand the systemic ways that they can support computer science in their district and so that's what we want to do is just make it as pervasive as possible as inclusive and as possible and as positive as possible thank you thanks so much paige larry do you have anything to add on that yeah it's actually uh thank you for having me it's a perfect segue to to my thought with this building a strong cs program um it's easy to have one teacher be a shining star within a district and invest in that teacher and you have an awesome program but what happens when that teacher decides to retire or happens to take on another position and who's going to take up that mantle and so if you really want a strong cs program in your district you have to invest in it as a school district in a community and say we are going to be a part of this it's going to be part of our school improvement plan we're going to be doing we're going to be thinking about this is all our planning processes we're going to be thinking about multiple instructors doing this work and so that way it's not linchpin on one instructor and that it's the entire district has a plan to move this forward and not just that one person and so that's that to me is that the huge piece trying to strengthen it within the district thanks larry and cheryl um anything to add from alaska yeah i i want to say yes and all of the above they did a great job in kind of prototyping what what we're all thinking about one of the things that i wanted to add that's really important especially in a vast place like alaska is the unique relationships and i believe that building the relationships with the department of ed the university superintendents principals teachers counselors and community i try my very best to educate the community also to the value of what this will bring to their community but um developing giants reaching out to individual um districts or schools and talking about their strategic plan and and how i read their strategic plan and how this absolutely fills so many of their little points and um awareness dispelling misconceptions is really important uh video production is not computer science per se it's more in liter digital literacy and lastly i want to say that culturally for like many of the small communities it's providing careers and job opportunities in their own local communities good paying jobs where they can stay in their communities and help care for their elders without leaving and having to go to california or anchorage to take you know get jobs they can stay home and take care of their elders so um it's it's multipronged but it's it's got to be relationships and it's got to be individualized thanks cheryl speaking of relationships i think we'd be remiss to not acknowledge the impact of covid19 on our schools and as a result on the work we're doing to achieve our shared mission um so what impacts has coveid19 had on the professional learning program in your region cheryl i'll send this one back to you yeah i'm glad to answer this it's a great question and after the panic you know settled down a little bit and the chaos brings opportunity and we had a lot of chaos in alaska trying to figure out kids didn't have internet there was a lot of things going on but we were able to in our csf program increase it to 48 of 54 schools have participated in training now and it's because equity has rose to the top and we're offering it all virtual anyone in alaska no matter where you sit if you're sitting in your car if you're sitting in your school or the school lounge or wherever you're able to connect with professional development now so i think that um it has increased equity across the state of alaska way more than tenfold that's i'll just keep it that short but we have been able to reach a lot more and we always wanted to go virtual because of our big state so um you know there's some good things that do come out of bad things thanks cheryl larry would you like to add yeah so i can the way i would approach this is the pandemic has benefited at least the professional learning aspect has benefited our rural areas um i can speak to our upper peninsula in michigan it's it's six to eight hours to go from one end to the other and to ask teachers to meet and for professional learning is very difficult it's taxing and so by providing this virtually now we are able to to reach those areas of our state that geographically was difficult to reach and it also suits the folks that they got families at home they can't travel long distance they can't spend that time and so overall just having both virtual and facetoface now uh just supports the equity for our teachers thanks i see some some trends across your states page would you like to talk about the effects in new mexico well one of the things is um that it really lit a fire under the equity and access of broadband so we just ended a legislative session and there's a lot of investment that will be made in that need that became just it was always there but now it became through this past year just so obvious how important access to internet was and so hopefully we can see some changes that are going to happen in new mexico but also um across the country that will allow our rural students um and our urban students to have uh access to great highspeed internet going forward for their education thanks so much um we are getting close to time but i have one last question for the three of you um i wish we had more time but in our final minutes what are two words of advice you'd give our audience and what can the folks here do as soon as tomorrow or next week to start growing a cs program in their school or district or region um try to keep it to like 15 to 30 seconds each please let's start with you paige so one of the questions i i mentioned it earlier ask the question what are you doing to computer uh to support computer science education or to be involved in computer science education so just by asking that question you get that conversation and that engagement and my two words are community and depth so building a community of educators and people connected to computer science education and then giving the depth of that experience thanks thanks so much how about you cheryl two words of advice um two words of advice i i my big words are flexibility and listening be flexible and meet them where they are not what you plan to give them but what they need and listening carefully to your community to your parents to the teachers um you can help them with their challenges thank you and larry to close us out yeah so my two words are directed to school districts and that's invest in culture and so if if you really want to have that strong cs program within your school you have to invest within your teachers within your planning process within your school improvement process you have to build a culture around cs if you wanted to survive within your district larry cheryl and paige thank you so much for joining us and for all the work you and your organizations are doing for the students of alaska michigan and new mexico we really appreciate your partnership um and here we are despite the amazing work our partners are doing on the ground and all the progress we're seeing the truth of the matter is that most schools still don't teach computer science so please join the movement if you're a teacher visit code.org your school like jackie shared earlier to apply now and after this webinar please tell a teacher friend to apply as well parents contact your child's schools to advocate for a computer science program and if you're an administrator connect with your local regional partner you can reach them through this link that will be in the chat as well bitly backslash contact my rp to connect with your local partner to find out what offerings are available in your region and with that we want to say thank you so much for joining us today we hope you can get started with something you learned here today in your region tomorrow so thanks so much for being here with us and one other note you'll receive a survey link so please make sure to participate in the survey we want to hear your feedback and we thank everyone for joining us today we know you will join the movement to ensure all schools all classrooms and all students have access to computer science thank you so much have a good rest of the day everyone
