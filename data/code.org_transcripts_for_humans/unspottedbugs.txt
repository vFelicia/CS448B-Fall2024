00:08 - She runs the biggest bug hunting company in

00:16 - Early this morning, something unexpected happened!
00:20 - Someone left the door to the bug room open
and a swarm of pesky bugs escaped into the
00:24 - city, right before the big talent program.
00:27 - "That's why I hired you!"
00:30 - Jasmine said to JD.
00:31 - "If we don't collect all of the bugs by three
o'clock, the program will be ruined!"
00:36 - "This should be easy," JD said, looking around.
00:40 - "I see a few here, and few over there."
00:43 - "Oh, those are only the spotted bugs," Jasmine
said.
00:49 - "Those bugs are easy to get under control.
00:52 - It's the unspotted bugs that cause the most
trouble."
00:56 - "Unspotted bugs are harder to find.
00:59 - They hide where you don't expect them and
make things worse and worse until it seems
01:05 - like nothing works at all."
01:07 - "Oh no!" shouted JD.
01:09 - "How will we ever get them all in time to
save the program?"
01:13 - "Don't worry, I'll teach you a trick for
spotting an unspotted bug."
01:20 - "First, you have to know where it's not."
01:22 - "Take a walk down the street.
01:25 - Does everything work at the first step?"
01:28 - "Does everything work at the second step?
01:30 - How about the third?"
01:32 - "Trace your trail step-by-step until something
goes wrong."
01:37 - "That's where the bug is hiding!"
01:40 - "Now that you know where it is, spot the bug!
01:44 - Give it a name and say it out loud.
01:46 - As soon as you do, magic happens."
01:49 - "The bug has been spotted!
01:55 - Now we can undo the trouble that the bug has
caused."
01:59 - "Hurry, Jasmine!
02:00 - It's almost three o'clock!"
02:01 - "We're still missing one big bug," Jasmine
said.
02:05 - "But my jar is full!
02:07 - You'll have to find it on your own."
02:10 - "JD stepped nervously out onto the sidewalk.
02:14 - "First, you have you know where it's not,"
he whispered to himself.
02:19 - "Does everything work at the first step?
02:22 - Yes."
02:23 - "Does everything work at the second step?
02:27 - Yes."
02:28 - "How about the third?
02:30 - No!"
02:31 - "Now that I know where the bug is, I need
to spot the bug!"
02:35 - "Give it a name.
02:37 - Say it out loud."
02:39 - "The bug is making the light not work, so
I'll call it Sparky."
02:42 - "It worked!
02:44 - I've spotted the bug!
02:47 - Now I can remove the bug and fix the trouble
it caused.
02:50 - Just in time for the talent program!"
02:53 - JD has made Jasmine so proud.
02:56 - Now the whole town knows that when things go wrong,
02:59 - it's time to put the Debuggers to work!
03:03 - The End!
