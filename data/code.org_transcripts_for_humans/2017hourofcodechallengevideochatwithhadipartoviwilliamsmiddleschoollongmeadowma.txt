00:00 - thank you everyone for taking the time
00:01 - out of your day to
00:03 - to chat with us and i'm really excited
00:05 - to
00:06 - uh introduce you all to code.org ceo and
00:09 - founder hattie partovey
00:13 - [Applause]
00:16 - hi everybody
00:18 - we are so excited that you reached out
00:20 - to us all because of something that nico
00:22 - warren posted and we tweeted at you so
00:26 - thank you so much
00:27 - just in case i don't have an opportunity
00:29 - to say that
00:30 - our first speaker is someone that you
00:33 - actually liked one of her comments this
00:36 - is megan baker hi megan
00:39 - hi
00:40 - oh yes i loved your comment i didn't
00:42 - just like it
00:45 - i love the hour of code so much one
00:48 - weekend at my house i was doing it for
00:50 - two hours and was really disappointed
00:52 - when i accidentally deleted a code i was
00:55 - working really hard
00:56 - when i grow up i would like to work for
00:59 - nasa and i'm sure i will be doing some
01:01 - kind of programming or engineering that
01:04 - is why i love code.org i never really
01:06 - had a connection with other subjects
01:08 - like i do with coding
01:10 - thank you for creating code.org and
01:13 - sharing it with many schools so i could
01:15 - learn
01:17 - that is so awesome and by the way i've
01:18 - already shared that with so many people
01:20 - uh
01:21 - not just my wife and kids but i even
01:23 - posted it on my linkedin profile
01:26 - thank you for that comment it totally
01:28 - made my week to read that last week
01:31 - awesome thank you thank you
01:36 - [Applause]
01:38 - hi my name is darby fazio and my
01:40 - question is um what made you interested
01:41 - in computer science first
01:44 - sure what grade are you in are you are
01:45 - you're all in seventh grade aren't you
01:47 - i'm in eighth grade you're in eighth
01:48 - grade okay um so i had a really unusual
01:52 - introduction to coding and computer
01:54 - science i grew up in
01:56 - iran in the middle east during a war
01:59 - which is pretty much the worst
02:01 - kind of place you want to raise a child
02:03 - our neighborhood was literally getting
02:05 - bombed
02:06 - every other night so we spent most of
02:08 - our nights in the basement just holding
02:09 - our ears uh hoping our house wouldn't
02:11 - get uh destroyed by the bombings um so
02:14 - in that atmosphere my dad one day
02:17 - brought home a computer
02:18 - and he he said this has no apps and no
02:21 - games and no software on it but here's a
02:23 - book and if you teach yourself coding
02:26 - and he helped me get started as well he
02:28 - said you can write your own apps in your
02:30 - own games
02:31 - and basically i had nothing else good to
02:33 - do at the time so it was my escape from
02:35 - a really really tough uh childhood um
02:39 - but then when i came to the united
02:40 - states as an immigrant i was 12 years
02:42 - old and
02:43 - i was really good at coding because
02:45 - that's pretty much the only thing i'd
02:46 - spent a lot of my childhood doing so by
02:48 - the time i was even 14 or 15 years old i
02:51 - started getting summer jobs at tech
02:53 - companies
02:54 - it wasn't even legal to be working yet
02:56 - but that's how i had made my money to
02:58 - help pay for school in college
03:00 - thank you
03:04 - um hello
03:06 - i think what you're doing is noble and
03:08 - it's not every day that you see someone
03:09 - giving something fun and cool to do for
03:12 - free to students and encourage them
03:13 - nowhere
03:15 - um
03:17 - hi you're welcome
03:20 - hi my name is victoria rossi and my
03:22 - question is what were some reasons for
03:24 - creating code.org
03:27 - hi uh so the reason i started code.org
03:29 - is because
03:30 - you know like i mentioned i started
03:32 - learning to code because of my dad most
03:34 - kids are not going to learn to code from
03:35 - their mom or their dad
03:37 - and
03:37 - when i started which was like in the
03:39 - 1980s computers were sort of a
03:42 - new sort of thing and they were kind of
03:43 - a novelty to own your own computer these
03:46 - days computers and software everywhere
03:48 - they're
03:49 - in your phones in your pocket in your
03:51 - cars every phone call you make is going
03:52 - through a computer pretty much
03:54 - everything whether it's from
03:55 - entertainment from to commerce to
03:57 - communications transportation even
03:59 - agriculture is being changed because of
04:01 - software and yet most schools don't
04:03 - teach computer science
04:05 - and i just thought that computer science
04:07 - is in the 21st century as important as
04:10 - all the other math and science and
04:12 - history and literature and all the
04:13 - things we learn in school
04:15 - it's just as important to learn how the
04:17 - world of technology works so my vision
04:19 - was that every school should teach
04:20 - computer science so that every kid can
04:22 - have the basic exposure that i have the
04:24 - good luck of having
04:27 - okay thank you
04:30 - hi my name is tina lee i appreciate that
04:33 - code.org offers another subject that
04:35 - allows students to express their
04:37 - creativity and it's something students
04:38 - can do in their free time unlike math or
04:40 - history
04:42 - thank you
04:43 - you're welcome math and history are cool
04:45 - too but uh thank you
04:49 - i'm back
04:51 - okay emily
04:55 - hi i'm emily shot i'm in eighth grade um
04:57 - my question for you is what new things
04:59 - are you looking forward to adding to
05:00 - code
05:02 - um well there's so many things we're
05:04 - looking forward to but
05:06 - my personal passion is to
05:08 - teach more about artificial intelligence
05:10 - and machine learning
05:12 - which is
05:13 - one of the things that is completely
05:15 - going to change the world of software
05:16 - and technology in the next 10 years it's
05:18 - already changing it
05:20 - and you hear about artificial
05:21 - intelligence
05:23 - that's not going to be like you know
05:25 - at least not in the next 10 years we're
05:26 - not going to have robots that have their
05:28 - own brains and know how to just you know
05:30 - act like humans like you see in the
05:32 - movies but what we are going to have is
05:34 - computer systems that
05:35 - learn how to do things that you think
05:37 - only humans can do
05:38 - you know already computers can recognize
05:40 - your voice or recognize
05:42 - images or recognize handwriting
05:45 - soon computers are going to be driving
05:47 - cars
05:48 - there's so many things that basically
05:50 - are human tasks that are going to be
05:51 - done by software and understanding how
05:53 - that works
05:54 - learning how to harness that and also
05:56 - understanding the social implications of
05:58 - that are i think one of the most
05:59 - important things to put in code.org
06:02 - now that's for older kids i think for
06:04 - the younger kids that's another question
06:08 - hi my name is julia paquette i want to
06:10 - thank you i think it's very cool and
06:12 - smart to create a website to get people
06:14 - into coding and opening up many more
06:16 - opportunities for the future and what
06:18 - they want to do thank you very much
06:23 - hi my name is maria tassie and i was
06:25 - wondering if you expected that code.org
06:27 - would be so popular
06:29 - uh never in a million years would i've
06:31 - imagined that this would be so popular
06:33 - um just to give a sense of context it's
06:35 - just been
06:37 - less than five years since the idea came
06:39 - about for the hour of code
06:41 - and you know it's just an idea that i
06:43 - had standing in my kitchen
06:46 - at that time code.org was i think three
06:48 - or maybe five people uh
06:50 - and
06:51 - you know basically the idea was let's
06:52 - get every school in the world to try an
06:54 - hour of code which is a pretty big dream
06:56 - to envision uh we're now at the point
06:58 - where the hour of code has been done
07:00 - almost 600 million times
07:03 - almost two out of every 10 students in
07:04 - the entire planet have done it
07:06 - the majority of all students in the
07:08 - united states have tried the hour of
07:09 - code
07:10 - one-fourth of all of america's students
07:12 - have an account on code.org so no
07:13 - there's no way i would have imagined
07:16 - that fast of growth um
07:18 - what we're doing is basically one of the
07:20 - fastest growing or maybe the fastest
07:22 - growing thing
07:23 - in the history of education so
07:26 - that wasn't my i mean that was obviously
07:27 - a hope but i didn't think it would
07:29 - actually be possible and actually it's a
07:31 - really good
07:32 - lesson which is that
07:33 - in today's world of technology dreaming
07:35 - big is a good idea the bigger you dream
07:38 - at the the more opportunity i think you
07:40 - have
07:41 - and technology is so amazing because it
07:43 - lets you create something that spreads
07:45 - not just across your neighborhood or
07:47 - community but but globally as well
07:50 - thank you
07:55 - hello and good afternoon my name is
07:57 - zhang hao lee
07:58 - and i'm in 7th grade
08:01 - i have a comment for you
08:03 - i like
08:04 - how you feel that coding and technology
08:06 - will be important in the near future i
08:08 - agree that having an education and
08:09 - technology is important
08:12 - thank you i agree as well
08:19 - hello my name is um eileen mcdonald i
08:22 - was wondering did anyone ever doubt you
08:24 - along the way
08:26 - uh hi eileen yes uh well first of all i
08:29 - doubted myself along the way which is
08:30 - probably the most common form of doubt
08:33 - uh it's
08:34 - nobody starts something and
08:36 - automatically knows it's going to be
08:37 - successful and the the person who most
08:39 - doubts an entrepreneur's success is the
08:42 - entrepreneur themself uh pretty much any
08:44 - successful person you look at they're
08:46 - also the number one person who doubted
08:48 - themselves um
08:50 - but
08:51 - the the type of doubt i heard the most
08:54 - is people saying that schools never
08:56 - change uh and they basically people said
08:59 - don't start this as an effort to do this
09:00 - in school try to do it after school or
09:03 - in summer camps like coding should go in
09:05 - these other places because regular
09:06 - school will never teach computer science
09:09 - and really the reason we've been
09:10 - successful has been because of hundreds
09:13 - of thousands of teachers
09:14 - like miss galarani who've decided that
09:16 - this is important enough to put in their
09:17 - classrooms
09:19 - so you should all give her thanks and a
09:20 - round of applause because she's one of
09:23 - almost a million teachers who've begun
09:24 - teaching coding in their classrooms and
09:26 - what we've done couldn't have been
09:27 - possible without teachers like her
09:31 - [Applause]
09:36 - [Music]
09:38 - hi my name is mia santiago it's really
09:41 - amazing to me that you
09:44 - that you created courses in a simple way
09:46 - that teaches coding
09:48 - thank you very much that was basically
09:50 - our goal so
09:52 - we're happy that it worked
09:54 - hello my name is ananya ball super mania
09:57 - could you please tell me what your
09:59 - advice is to kids who wish to pursue a
10:01 - career in computer science
10:04 - um
10:06 - sure
10:06 - the first thing i'd say is the reason we
10:08 - teach computer science as part of school
10:11 - or the reason why code.org is that it
10:13 - isn't just so you pursue a career in it
10:15 - whether you want to become a lawyer or a
10:17 - doctor or a nurse or a scientist or a
10:19 - farmer it's helpful to learn computer
10:22 - science at no matter what you want to go
10:24 - into
10:25 - if you want to get a career in computer
10:27 - science i'd say a couple things it gets
10:29 - harder at you know in sixth and seventh
10:31 - and eighth grade it's much easier by the
10:33 - time you get to
10:34 - university it's not
10:36 - nearly as fun you know you aren't
10:38 - playing with minecraft or angry birds uh
10:40 - you're you're doing more serious stuff
10:42 - so sticking with it through the
10:44 - challenges as probably the top advice
10:46 - i'd give
10:48 - and then the other thing i'd say is that
10:50 - the world of technology is increasingly
10:52 - giving people
10:54 - unique levels of power that they haven't
10:56 - had before and it's really important to
10:57 - learn the other subjects as well
11:00 - you know the humanities and the things
11:02 - that basically help us
11:04 - understand society better because we
11:06 - shouldn't be building technology for
11:08 - technology's sake and learning things
11:10 - like history
11:11 - helps us understand how to use
11:13 - technology in ways that are good for the
11:14 - world
11:15 - not in ways that are bad
11:18 - thank you and you're welcome
11:24 - hi my name is maddie busalari i'm in 8th
11:26 - grade and i just wanted to thank you for
11:28 - creating code it really educated me on
11:30 - objectives within technology and coding
11:33 - thank you maddie
11:40 - hi my name is teddy haney could you
11:42 - please tell me why you find it important
11:43 - to teach students about computer science
11:46 - sure um
11:48 - i don't want to be too repetitive but
11:50 - actually the reason i already said is
11:52 - because i think computer science is
11:54 - changing everything around in the world
11:56 - around us and so it's just as relevant
11:58 - as learning biology or chemistry and
12:00 - learning about how atoms work or how
12:02 - you know your your body and living
12:04 - organisms work technologies
12:06 - is impacting our world just as much
12:09 - but there's actually
12:10 - two other reasons i think we should be
12:12 - teaching computer science in schools
12:15 - one reason is because a lot of the
12:16 - things that we're teaching are old and
12:18 - outdated and might not be useful anymore
12:21 - and meanwhile one of the most useful
12:23 - things happening in the world is
12:24 - technology
12:26 - and then the second is to make school
12:27 - more fun uh you know computer science
12:30 - and coding is creative
12:32 - and when i was learning computer science
12:33 - nobody thought this was the fun thing
12:35 - for students to do they thought it was
12:36 - like the super gigi thing for just the
12:38 - nerds to do um but these days we hear
12:41 - regularly from from students and from
12:43 - teachers that coding is among the most
12:45 - fun classes and something that kids want
12:47 - to do because of their creativity
12:49 - and so one of the reasons to teach
12:50 - computer science is to make school more
12:52 - engaging so students like it more
12:55 - thank you
12:59 - you all are so organized
13:02 - hi my name is tucker silva i'm
13:03 - interested to hear what you think the
13:05 - benefits are of coding
13:08 - um there's so many benefits
13:11 - but i think the creativity and the
13:13 - ability to make something out of nothing
13:14 - is the most important benefit
13:17 - you know there's very few other skills
13:20 - you can learn where you can start from
13:22 - almost nothing and then just go on the
13:23 - internet and then create something and
13:25 - whether you create it just for yourself
13:26 - or whether you created for your family
13:28 - or for your small business or you create
13:30 - something that you can sell or use to
13:32 - change the world
13:34 - the opportunities are limitless people
13:36 - are using coding for detecting diseases
13:39 - for
13:40 - sending emergency blood transfusion to
13:42 - to villages in africa to
13:45 - all the way to trading stocks on the
13:47 - stock market or first making snapchat
13:49 - filters there's such a wide range of
13:51 - things you could do with it
13:53 - whether for entertainment or for for
13:55 - helping change the world or for making
13:56 - money um so it's kind of a superpower
13:59 - thank you
14:07 - good afternoon my name is robbie rivosa
14:10 - and i was wondering when you learned
14:11 - code was it always your plan to teach
14:13 - code somehow or did an experience make
14:15 - you want to teach
14:17 - um it was definitely not my plan i
14:19 - started learning when i was about your
14:21 - age
14:22 - so i didn't really have any sort of
14:23 - plans i just was having fun and
14:26 - you know going about my life doing
14:27 - whatever felt right at the time
14:30 - so i'm sure most of you don't already
14:32 - plan what you're going to do when you're
14:33 - 40 years old and i'm 40 now so it took a
14:35 - long time to get here but as i was
14:38 - growing up i had such so much success in
14:41 - my career everything i ended up doing
14:43 - because of my technical background i
14:44 - felt i had a leg up on people and
14:47 - meanwhile all the companies i worked at
14:50 - or the companies that i
14:51 - helped along the way through my career
14:53 - everybody struggled to find great
14:55 - software engineers and coders there's
14:57 - just not that many of them in the world
14:58 - and i remember thinking like why is it
15:00 - this thing that i'm doing that pays so
15:02 - much money if you get do it as a job why
15:04 - is it so hard to find people who know
15:05 - these skills
15:07 - and then i realize it's because our
15:08 - schools aren't teaching and that's when
15:09 - i decided i wanted to
15:11 - help solve that problem and
15:13 - effectively become a teacher
15:15 - thank you
15:21 - hi my name is danny shay i was curious
15:23 - as to where you were a software engineer
15:27 - hi danny
15:28 - well i started
15:30 - my first job was actually at mit
15:33 - at the university in cambridge
15:34 - massachusetts
15:35 - it was
15:36 - one of my first coding summer jobs and i
15:38 - it wasn't actually legal for me to work
15:40 - then because i was i think either 14 or
15:42 - 15 so i was kind of getting paid under
15:44 - the table um my first full-time job was
15:47 - at microsoft
15:49 - which is the company that i actually
15:50 - worked on the early versions of the
15:52 - windows operating system
15:54 - so
15:55 - it's in seattle which is where i live
15:57 - right now
15:58 - thank you
16:06 - hello my name is will cosgrove and uh
16:08 - the question i wanted to ask you was do
16:11 - you remember a specific moment when you
16:13 - just fell in love with coding
16:15 - i will um
16:17 - yeah for me the specific moment i fell
16:20 - in love with coding was learning how to
16:22 - make
16:23 - recursive fractals with computer
16:24 - graphics so um you know little images
16:28 - that if you look inside then there's the
16:29 - images inside the image and it's inside
16:31 - the images inside the image and it goes
16:33 - on forever
16:35 - which you know making something like
16:36 - that is almost impossible to do by hand
16:39 - to make it perfect but with a computer
16:40 - you can make it in fact if you look
16:43 - behind me there's a whole bunch of
16:45 - pictures that students make using the
16:46 - code.org artist
16:49 - these are pictures made by young kids
16:52 - um
16:53 - but this one was made by me
16:55 - um which is a recursive fractal if you
16:58 - can see it's a little tree that each
17:00 - branch of the tree is a little tree and
17:02 - each branch of the tree is a little tree
17:04 - and it takes only about 10 lines of code
17:06 - to make that
17:07 - but it's something that you couldn't do
17:08 - by hand
17:10 - and that's what made me fall in love
17:11 - with coding
17:12 - thank you very much
17:23 - hi my name is emerson bernardi could you
17:25 - please tell me what degree you got in
17:26 - college that helped you prepare for what
17:27 - you were doing now
17:29 - wait can you repeat it can i tell you
17:30 - what what
17:32 - what degree you got in college that
17:33 - helped you prepare for what you were
17:34 - doing now
17:36 - the degree i got was in computer science
17:38 - uh and it's funny because we're called
17:40 - code.org but we're really about helping
17:42 - schools teach computer science
17:45 - and computer science isn't just about
17:46 - coding it's about learning how computers
17:49 - work uh how their operating system works
17:51 - how the internet works uh it's about
17:54 - learning how to analyze data how machine
17:56 - learning impacts things cyber security
17:58 - and how to keep computer systems safe
18:00 - but coding and computer programming is a
18:02 - big big part of it
18:04 - it's right now one of the most sought
18:05 - after university degrees um and more
18:08 - students than ever before trying to
18:10 - learn computer science because uh it's
18:12 - such an important field
18:14 - thank you
18:15 - you're welcome
18:19 - hi and good afternoon my name is cecilia
18:21 - allen tuck do you think that code.org is
18:24 - making a difference in young kids
18:26 - um yes i definitely think code.org is
18:30 - making a difference in young kids uh you
18:32 - know it's just amazing to see so many of
18:34 - you here uh lined up to even talk about
18:36 - it but you know we're we're at the point
18:37 - where globally over one out of ten
18:40 - students on the planet have tried coding
18:42 - on code.org
18:44 - and that doesn't mean
18:45 - all 150 million of them are going to
18:47 - become coders one day but
18:49 - i know just from watching my own kids at
18:52 - trico.org for the first time even when
18:54 - we made the very very first drag and
18:56 - drop thing to make the first angry bird
18:57 - go to the pig
18:59 - i know the reaction that they have
19:02 - using it they're like oh my god this
19:03 - works now i can build on it
19:06 - i think it teaches
19:07 - not just coding but it teaches
19:09 - creativity and optimism
19:11 - and it helps students feel like they're
19:13 - in control of creating something rather
19:15 - than just answering multiple choice
19:16 - questions
19:18 - and for that i think more than anything
19:19 - else is is one of the greatest impacts
19:21 - we're going to have on the
19:22 - world i think it's nice that you started
19:25 - a website to teach kids how to code that
19:28 - is free to use and i'm really glad that
19:30 - i'm fortunate enough to use it because
19:32 - it makes you think of solutions to
19:34 - problems that you may never thought you
19:36 - could have solved so thank you thank you
19:41 - [Music]
19:43 - and this is our last one
19:46 - hi i'm alejandra figueroa mr partovi in
19:48 - 10 to 20 years do you believe that
19:50 - computer science will become as
19:52 - important as math and science
19:54 - that's a great question alejandro
19:57 - i think
19:58 - computer science is already as important
20:00 - as math or science uh it's just a
20:03 - question of how long does it take for
20:04 - the school system
20:05 - to to
20:06 - basically recognize that
20:08 - and the reason i think it's just as
20:10 - important
20:11 - is
20:12 - you know the reason we teach math isn't
20:14 - because everybody needs to become a
20:15 - mathematician it's because it helps you
20:17 - get a sense of you know first of all how
20:20 - numbers work and how they interrelate
20:21 - but it also teaches you critical
20:23 - thinking skills and it is foundational
20:25 - to so many other fields of study
20:27 - and computer science is just as
20:29 - foundational to so many fields of study
20:32 - you know whether you want to become
20:34 - you know math is important because you
20:36 - need it if you want to become a
20:37 - physicist if you want to become an
20:38 - engineer if you want to work on the
20:40 - stock market if you want to work in
20:42 - health insurance if you want to become a
20:44 - doctor there's so many fields that that
20:46 - rely on math and increasingly the same
20:48 - thing is true about computer science as
20:50 - well
20:51 - the latest innovations in almost every
20:53 - field of study are driven by computer
20:56 - science and in every single industry uh
20:58 - the the fastest moving things involve
21:00 - computer science you know that if in
21:03 - farming
21:04 - the most important changes that are
21:05 - happening or dr are tractors that are
21:07 - driving themselves or
21:10 - ai driven devices that monitor the crops
21:13 - using computer vision uh you know in in
21:17 - making cars every single car maker is
21:19 - trying to figure out how to make their
21:20 - cars self-driving using systems that
21:22 - automatically drive the car
21:24 - there's almost no field you can think of
21:26 - where the latest greatest stuff isn't
21:28 - being done using computer science so i
21:29 - would say it's already as important as
21:31 - math and science
21:32 - thank you
21:36 - well that's all the questions we have
21:37 - for you today and we cannot thank you
21:40 - enough for giving us us this great
21:42 - opportunity to chat with you today i
21:44 - know we went over our allotted time and
21:46 - i appreciate that your time is really
21:48 - important so thank you
21:50 - thank you it was super fun
21:54 - please everybody give another round of
21:56 - applause to ms galirani and all of your
21:58 - teachers for being able to thank you
22:06 - thank you and have a great rest of your
22:08 - day

Cleaned transcript:

thank you everyone for taking the time out of your day to to chat with us and i'm really excited to uh introduce you all to code.org ceo and founder hattie partovey hi everybody we are so excited that you reached out to us all because of something that nico warren posted and we tweeted at you so thank you so much just in case i don't have an opportunity to say that our first speaker is someone that you actually liked one of her comments this is megan baker hi megan hi oh yes i loved your comment i didn't just like it i love the hour of code so much one weekend at my house i was doing it for two hours and was really disappointed when i accidentally deleted a code i was working really hard when i grow up i would like to work for nasa and i'm sure i will be doing some kind of programming or engineering that is why i love code.org i never really had a connection with other subjects like i do with coding thank you for creating code.org and sharing it with many schools so i could learn that is so awesome and by the way i've already shared that with so many people uh not just my wife and kids but i even posted it on my linkedin profile thank you for that comment it totally made my week to read that last week awesome thank you thank you hi my name is darby fazio and my question is um what made you interested in computer science first sure what grade are you in are you are you're all in seventh grade aren't you i'm in eighth grade you're in eighth grade okay um so i had a really unusual introduction to coding and computer science i grew up in iran in the middle east during a war which is pretty much the worst kind of place you want to raise a child our neighborhood was literally getting bombed every other night so we spent most of our nights in the basement just holding our ears uh hoping our house wouldn't get uh destroyed by the bombings um so in that atmosphere my dad one day brought home a computer and he he said this has no apps and no games and no software on it but here's a book and if you teach yourself coding and he helped me get started as well he said you can write your own apps in your own games and basically i had nothing else good to do at the time so it was my escape from a really really tough uh childhood um but then when i came to the united states as an immigrant i was 12 years old and i was really good at coding because that's pretty much the only thing i'd spent a lot of my childhood doing so by the time i was even 14 or 15 years old i started getting summer jobs at tech companies it wasn't even legal to be working yet but that's how i had made my money to help pay for school in college thank you um hello i think what you're doing is noble and it's not every day that you see someone giving something fun and cool to do for free to students and encourage them nowhere um hi you're welcome hi my name is victoria rossi and my question is what were some reasons for creating code.org hi uh so the reason i started code.org is because you know like i mentioned i started learning to code because of my dad most kids are not going to learn to code from their mom or their dad and when i started which was like in the 1980s computers were sort of a new sort of thing and they were kind of a novelty to own your own computer these days computers and software everywhere they're in your phones in your pocket in your cars every phone call you make is going through a computer pretty much everything whether it's from entertainment from to commerce to communications transportation even agriculture is being changed because of software and yet most schools don't teach computer science and i just thought that computer science is in the 21st century as important as all the other math and science and history and literature and all the things we learn in school it's just as important to learn how the world of technology works so my vision was that every school should teach computer science so that every kid can have the basic exposure that i have the good luck of having okay thank you hi my name is tina lee i appreciate that code.org offers another subject that allows students to express their creativity and it's something students can do in their free time unlike math or history thank you you're welcome math and history are cool too but uh thank you i'm back okay emily hi i'm emily shot i'm in eighth grade um my question for you is what new things are you looking forward to adding to code um well there's so many things we're looking forward to but my personal passion is to teach more about artificial intelligence and machine learning which is one of the things that is completely going to change the world of software and technology in the next 10 years it's already changing it and you hear about artificial intelligence that's not going to be like you know at least not in the next 10 years we're not going to have robots that have their own brains and know how to just you know act like humans like you see in the movies but what we are going to have is computer systems that learn how to do things that you think only humans can do you know already computers can recognize your voice or recognize images or recognize handwriting soon computers are going to be driving cars there's so many things that basically are human tasks that are going to be done by software and understanding how that works learning how to harness that and also understanding the social implications of that are i think one of the most important things to put in code.org now that's for older kids i think for the younger kids that's another question hi my name is julia paquette i want to thank you i think it's very cool and smart to create a website to get people into coding and opening up many more opportunities for the future and what they want to do thank you very much hi my name is maria tassie and i was wondering if you expected that code.org would be so popular uh never in a million years would i've imagined that this would be so popular um just to give a sense of context it's just been less than five years since the idea came about for the hour of code and you know it's just an idea that i had standing in my kitchen at that time code.org was i think three or maybe five people uh and you know basically the idea was let's get every school in the world to try an hour of code which is a pretty big dream to envision uh we're now at the point where the hour of code has been done almost 600 million times almost two out of every 10 students in the entire planet have done it the majority of all students in the united states have tried the hour of code onefourth of all of america's students have an account on code.org so no there's no way i would have imagined that fast of growth um what we're doing is basically one of the fastest growing or maybe the fastest growing thing in the history of education so that wasn't my i mean that was obviously a hope but i didn't think it would actually be possible and actually it's a really good lesson which is that in today's world of technology dreaming big is a good idea the bigger you dream at the the more opportunity i think you have and technology is so amazing because it lets you create something that spreads not just across your neighborhood or community but but globally as well thank you hello and good afternoon my name is zhang hao lee and i'm in 7th grade i have a comment for you i like how you feel that coding and technology will be important in the near future i agree that having an education and technology is important thank you i agree as well hello my name is um eileen mcdonald i was wondering did anyone ever doubt you along the way uh hi eileen yes uh well first of all i doubted myself along the way which is probably the most common form of doubt uh it's nobody starts something and automatically knows it's going to be successful and the the person who most doubts an entrepreneur's success is the entrepreneur themself uh pretty much any successful person you look at they're also the number one person who doubted themselves um but the the type of doubt i heard the most is people saying that schools never change uh and they basically people said don't start this as an effort to do this in school try to do it after school or in summer camps like coding should go in these other places because regular school will never teach computer science and really the reason we've been successful has been because of hundreds of thousands of teachers like miss galarani who've decided that this is important enough to put in their classrooms so you should all give her thanks and a round of applause because she's one of almost a million teachers who've begun teaching coding in their classrooms and what we've done couldn't have been possible without teachers like her hi my name is mia santiago it's really amazing to me that you that you created courses in a simple way that teaches coding thank you very much that was basically our goal so we're happy that it worked hello my name is ananya ball super mania could you please tell me what your advice is to kids who wish to pursue a career in computer science um sure the first thing i'd say is the reason we teach computer science as part of school or the reason why code.org is that it isn't just so you pursue a career in it whether you want to become a lawyer or a doctor or a nurse or a scientist or a farmer it's helpful to learn computer science at no matter what you want to go into if you want to get a career in computer science i'd say a couple things it gets harder at you know in sixth and seventh and eighth grade it's much easier by the time you get to university it's not nearly as fun you know you aren't playing with minecraft or angry birds uh you're you're doing more serious stuff so sticking with it through the challenges as probably the top advice i'd give and then the other thing i'd say is that the world of technology is increasingly giving people unique levels of power that they haven't had before and it's really important to learn the other subjects as well you know the humanities and the things that basically help us understand society better because we shouldn't be building technology for technology's sake and learning things like history helps us understand how to use technology in ways that are good for the world not in ways that are bad thank you and you're welcome hi my name is maddie busalari i'm in 8th grade and i just wanted to thank you for creating code it really educated me on objectives within technology and coding thank you maddie hi my name is teddy haney could you please tell me why you find it important to teach students about computer science sure um i don't want to be too repetitive but actually the reason i already said is because i think computer science is changing everything around in the world around us and so it's just as relevant as learning biology or chemistry and learning about how atoms work or how you know your your body and living organisms work technologies is impacting our world just as much but there's actually two other reasons i think we should be teaching computer science in schools one reason is because a lot of the things that we're teaching are old and outdated and might not be useful anymore and meanwhile one of the most useful things happening in the world is technology and then the second is to make school more fun uh you know computer science and coding is creative and when i was learning computer science nobody thought this was the fun thing for students to do they thought it was like the super gigi thing for just the nerds to do um but these days we hear regularly from from students and from teachers that coding is among the most fun classes and something that kids want to do because of their creativity and so one of the reasons to teach computer science is to make school more engaging so students like it more thank you you all are so organized hi my name is tucker silva i'm interested to hear what you think the benefits are of coding um there's so many benefits but i think the creativity and the ability to make something out of nothing is the most important benefit you know there's very few other skills you can learn where you can start from almost nothing and then just go on the internet and then create something and whether you create it just for yourself or whether you created for your family or for your small business or you create something that you can sell or use to change the world the opportunities are limitless people are using coding for detecting diseases for sending emergency blood transfusion to to villages in africa to all the way to trading stocks on the stock market or first making snapchat filters there's such a wide range of things you could do with it whether for entertainment or for for helping change the world or for making money um so it's kind of a superpower thank you good afternoon my name is robbie rivosa and i was wondering when you learned code was it always your plan to teach code somehow or did an experience make you want to teach um it was definitely not my plan i started learning when i was about your age so i didn't really have any sort of plans i just was having fun and you know going about my life doing whatever felt right at the time so i'm sure most of you don't already plan what you're going to do when you're 40 years old and i'm 40 now so it took a long time to get here but as i was growing up i had such so much success in my career everything i ended up doing because of my technical background i felt i had a leg up on people and meanwhile all the companies i worked at or the companies that i helped along the way through my career everybody struggled to find great software engineers and coders there's just not that many of them in the world and i remember thinking like why is it this thing that i'm doing that pays so much money if you get do it as a job why is it so hard to find people who know these skills and then i realize it's because our schools aren't teaching and that's when i decided i wanted to help solve that problem and effectively become a teacher thank you hi my name is danny shay i was curious as to where you were a software engineer hi danny well i started my first job was actually at mit at the university in cambridge massachusetts it was one of my first coding summer jobs and i it wasn't actually legal for me to work then because i was i think either 14 or 15 so i was kind of getting paid under the table um my first fulltime job was at microsoft which is the company that i actually worked on the early versions of the windows operating system so it's in seattle which is where i live right now thank you hello my name is will cosgrove and uh the question i wanted to ask you was do you remember a specific moment when you just fell in love with coding i will um yeah for me the specific moment i fell in love with coding was learning how to make recursive fractals with computer graphics so um you know little images that if you look inside then there's the images inside the image and it's inside the images inside the image and it goes on forever which you know making something like that is almost impossible to do by hand to make it perfect but with a computer you can make it in fact if you look behind me there's a whole bunch of pictures that students make using the code.org artist these are pictures made by young kids um but this one was made by me um which is a recursive fractal if you can see it's a little tree that each branch of the tree is a little tree and each branch of the tree is a little tree and it takes only about 10 lines of code to make that but it's something that you couldn't do by hand and that's what made me fall in love with coding thank you very much hi my name is emerson bernardi could you please tell me what degree you got in college that helped you prepare for what you were doing now wait can you repeat it can i tell you what what what degree you got in college that helped you prepare for what you were doing now the degree i got was in computer science uh and it's funny because we're called code.org but we're really about helping schools teach computer science and computer science isn't just about coding it's about learning how computers work uh how their operating system works how the internet works uh it's about learning how to analyze data how machine learning impacts things cyber security and how to keep computer systems safe but coding and computer programming is a big big part of it it's right now one of the most sought after university degrees um and more students than ever before trying to learn computer science because uh it's such an important field thank you you're welcome hi and good afternoon my name is cecilia allen tuck do you think that code.org is making a difference in young kids um yes i definitely think code.org is making a difference in young kids uh you know it's just amazing to see so many of you here uh lined up to even talk about it but you know we're we're at the point where globally over one out of ten students on the planet have tried coding on code.org and that doesn't mean all 150 million of them are going to become coders one day but i know just from watching my own kids at trico.org for the first time even when we made the very very first drag and drop thing to make the first angry bird go to the pig i know the reaction that they have using it they're like oh my god this works now i can build on it i think it teaches not just coding but it teaches creativity and optimism and it helps students feel like they're in control of creating something rather than just answering multiple choice questions and for that i think more than anything else is is one of the greatest impacts we're going to have on the world i think it's nice that you started a website to teach kids how to code that is free to use and i'm really glad that i'm fortunate enough to use it because it makes you think of solutions to problems that you may never thought you could have solved so thank you thank you and this is our last one hi i'm alejandra figueroa mr partovi in 10 to 20 years do you believe that computer science will become as important as math and science that's a great question alejandro i think computer science is already as important as math or science uh it's just a question of how long does it take for the school system to to basically recognize that and the reason i think it's just as important is you know the reason we teach math isn't because everybody needs to become a mathematician it's because it helps you get a sense of you know first of all how numbers work and how they interrelate but it also teaches you critical thinking skills and it is foundational to so many other fields of study and computer science is just as foundational to so many

market if you want to work in health insurance if you want to become a doctor there's so many fields that that rely on math and increasingly the same thing is true about computer science as well the latest innovations in almost every field of study are driven by computer science and in every single industry uh the the fastest moving things involve computer science you know that if in farming the

done using computer science so i would say it's already as important as math and science thank you well that's all the questions we have for you today and we cannot thank you enough for giving us us this great opportunity to chat with you today i know we went over our allotted time and i appreciate that your time is really important so thank you thank you it was super fun please everybody give another round of applause to ms galirani and all of your teachers for being able to thank you thank you and have a great rest of your day
