00:00 - one thing that computers are really good
00:02 - at is repeating commands as a person you
00:05 - get really bored if you had to do the
00:06 - same thing lots of times in a row but a
00:09 - computer can do the same thing millions
00:11 - or even billions of times and not get
00:13 - bored and be able to carry that out
00:14 - really well
00:15 - so for example if I wanted to wish
00:17 - everyone on facebook a happy birthday by
00:19 - sending them an email it might take me
00:21 - more than a century to actually write
00:23 - out all of those emails to everyone but
00:25 - with just a few lines of code i can have
00:27 - a system send an email to everyone on
00:30 - facebook wishing them a happy birthday
00:32 - so that's what loops are and why they're
00:33 - valuable and something that computers
00:35 - can do very well in this example your
00:38 - goal is going to be to move the bird now
00:42 - we're going to be able to use the repeat
00:44 - block in order to be able to do this
00:45 - very easily you can either do this by
00:48 - giving the computer and move forward
00:51 - command five times in order to advance
00:53 - the the bird one step each time to the
00:56 - pig or you can just tell the computer to
00:59 - move forward once and then tell it to
01:01 - repeat that five times and it will do
01:03 - the same thing so in order to do this
01:05 - you drag your move forward command and
01:08 - then you put it inside the repeat block
01:11 - and you can click on it and tell it how
01:14 - many times you want to repeat the block
01:15 - to tell how many steps you wanted to
01:17 - take forward now one more thing is you
01:20 - can put as many commands as you want
01:22 - inside the repeat block so in this
01:23 - example your tongue it to move forward
01:25 - and turn left which will do five times
01:28 - alright good job and have fun
