00:12 - a team called global outsourcing at
00:14 - pinterest you're about to get started
00:17 - with play lab
00:18 - which is a tool that lets you make your
00:20 - own stories and games by writing code
00:23 - play lab has a bunch of characters you
00:25 - can pick called actors
00:28 - actors can move
00:31 - say things
00:34 - and interact with each other
00:38 - your code lets you control the actors
00:41 - add sounds and backgrounds score points
00:44 - and more
00:47 - you'll drag code blocks into your
00:49 - workspace to build programs
00:52 - code that you connect to the orange when
00:55 - run block
00:56 - will make things happen as soon as you
00:58 - press the run button
01:04 - to make your program react when someone
01:06 - plays with it you're going to use events
01:10 - these blocks are called event blocks
01:16 - when we code with events
01:18 - we're telling the computer
01:21 - to wait for something to happen
01:24 - and then respond right away
01:35 - the code connected to an event block
01:37 - runs when the player presses the key
01:42 - taps
01:43 - or clicks an actor
01:46 - or
01:47 - when one actor
01:49 - touches another actor
01:55 - event blocks can go anywhere in your
01:57 - workspace
01:59 - they never connect to the when run block
02:04 - so it's okay to leave them off to the
02:06 - side
02:08 - take your time and think carefully about
02:10 - how you want your program to work
02:13 - when you're finished you'll have
02:15 - something special that you can share
02:16 - with others
02:18 - now what do you want to create
02:22 - [Music]
