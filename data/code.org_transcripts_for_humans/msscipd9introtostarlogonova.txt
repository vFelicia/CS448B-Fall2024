00:04 - hi and welcome please join me in a
00:07 - guided tour of a new agent based
00:08 - modeling environment called Star logo
00:10 - Nova Star logo Nova was produced by the
00:14 - sheller teacher education program or
00:16 - step at MIT we are excited that you will
00:20 - be learning to use Star logo Nova to
00:22 - teach about topics in earth life and
00:24 - physical sciences in starlogo Nova
00:27 - environment you will be able to create
00:29 - share collaborate and store your very
00:32 - own computer models on the web so are
00:35 - you ready let's start having some fun
00:37 - with Star logo Nova first you need to
00:40 - open your internet browser and navigate
00:42 - to W w SL Nova org I will walk you
00:47 - through the steps on how to set up an
00:48 - account it's easy and you'll be up and
00:50 - running in no time so to create an
00:53 - account click on the register for an
00:55 - account link choose a username and
00:58 - password and you're going to want to
01:00 - enter an email address so that we can
01:02 - send you your password if you forget it
01:04 - once you have created your account click
01:06 - on the my profile link then click the
01:09 - Create a new project button to create a
01:11 - new project we will be starting from a
01:14 - blank project so choose that and then
01:16 - click Submit this is the starlogo Nova
01:19 - in the programming environment at the
01:22 - top of the page is some information
01:23 - about the project such as title
01:25 - description and author which is you
01:28 - pretty cool change the title and
01:30 - description to be something useful below
01:33 - the project information is the 3d world
01:35 - where the model will run we call this
01:37 - area space land the buttons in this area
01:40 - are used to control the model you can
01:43 - move the view by dragging and scrolling
01:45 - your mouse why don't you go ahead and
01:47 - try it
01:48 - below space land is the programming
01:51 - workspace or blocks where you will
01:53 - program the behaviors of your agents so
01:56 - basically here is what you're going to
01:58 - program put your blocks and tell them
02:00 - what to do here on the left are the
02:02 - drawers where you will find our commands
02:04 - for creating our program notice the
02:07 - drawers are full of command blocks you
02:10 - create your program by dragging blocks
02:11 - from these drawers and
02:13 - connecting them together on the pages of
02:15 - the agents on the right there are three
02:18 - different pages one for the world one
02:21 - for the agents other than the world and
02:23 - one for the breeds pages are areas where
02:27 - you organize blocks to program the
02:29 - different agents the user interface
02:31 - buttons in the space land that
02:33 - controlled the simulation are linked to
02:35 - the command blocks in these pages so for
02:38 - example if I put a when set up push
02:41 - block on the world page whenever the
02:43 - user pushes the setup block in Spaceland
02:46 - the commands I placed within that block
02:48 - or run or executed so basically whatever
02:51 - I told in my program my agents to do
02:54 - when I click setup they then follow
02:56 - those directions and run through the
02:58 - program now that you have taken a tour
03:01 - of the user interface you can get
03:03 - started on the tutorial
