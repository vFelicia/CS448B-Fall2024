00:00 - fun and thank you for joining us today
00:01 - for a special hour of code video chat to
00:04 - celebrate computer science education
00:05 - week joining us again this year's code
00:08 - orgs head of product and engineering
00:10 - Alice Stein glass you were all very
00:12 - familiar with Alice's work I'm she led
00:15 - the development for the hour of code
00:16 - Star Wars and minecraft tutorials which
00:18 - you guys have probably been playing all
00:20 - week so can I get everyone to give me a
00:22 - big round of applause and join me in
00:24 - welcoming Alice thank you great to have
00:36 - you here Ellis our first question this
00:38 - week comes from Stratford school so
00:41 - Roberto would your class like to ask
00:43 - their question yes we have a moge asking
00:47 - the question my name is ammo and my
00:58 - question is why do you think coding is
01:01 - so important well you know amogh do you
01:06 - use technology do you ever use phones or
01:09 - computers or anything that yeah yeah I
01:13 - mean these days we use it to have fun we
01:15 - use it to communicate it release it to
01:16 - schedule things we use it for work
01:18 - technology is a part of everything we're
01:20 - doing and learning a little bit of
01:22 - computer science as a way that you can
01:24 - learn a little bit about how all of that
01:26 - works right so you know in school you
01:29 - learn a lot of basic things you aren't
01:30 - reading you learn writing you probably
01:32 - are going to learn a little bit about
01:33 - how your body works have you learned
01:35 - about circulation and how you breathe in
01:37 - your lugs right exactly and so I do with
01:40 - learning a little bit of computer
01:41 - science is it's that same set of skills
01:43 - for a lot of the world around you and
01:46 - how it works so by learning a little bit
01:47 - of computer science you can have a
01:49 - better idea when you're no matter what
01:51 - you decide to do let's say you go into
01:53 - you know you become a doctor when you
01:55 - grow up or you work in you want to be an
01:57 - artist or you want to be a farmer or you
01:59 - want to be in you know marketing or
02:02 - whatever it is you decide to do when you
02:03 - grow up probably that field is going to
02:05 - use technology and a little bit about
02:08 - how it works you can you can do a better
02:11 - job of work
02:12 - the people who are doing that work or if
02:14 - you decide and liked that like how many
02:17 - people in your class really liked the
02:18 - hour of code like computer science i
02:20 - neva thought it was fun yeah yeah so if
02:24 - i doing like one truck and you get to
02:26 - say you know hey i like that then you
02:28 - can go on and do more and so if you want
02:30 - to study more computer science there's a
02:32 - fantastic career out there in computer
02:34 - science i love i love the fact that i
02:36 - have an engineering degree and get to do
02:37 - computer science and if you decide to do
02:39 - that you know I want you to keep trying
02:42 - don't stop with one hour of code
02:45 - absolutely what the hour of code is all
02:48 - about our next question today is going
02:50 - to come from Nicole's classroom in Salt
02:53 - Lake City my name is Eric and what extra
03:05 - classes did you have to take to help you
03:07 - get where you are right now what sorry
03:10 - classes I have to take yeah like
03:13 - extracurricular oh x tripura killer
03:16 - classes um I never took an
03:18 - extracurricular class I was really lucky
03:20 - that my school taught computer science i
03:22 - was able to start with computer science
03:23 - in school and uh and then i went on to
03:26 - college and I majored in computer
03:28 - science in college uh you know I think
03:31 - there are a lot of a lot of computers
03:33 - out there who don't take any
03:34 - extracurricular classes and find a way
03:36 - to do it in school but if your school
03:38 - has a doctorate there are fantastic
03:40 - classes online and if you go to code org
03:42 - slash learn / beyond after you finish
03:45 - your hour of code you can see links to
03:47 - all sorts of things you can do at home
03:49 - to keep doing the hour of code I'm sorry
03:51 - to keep learning how to code and that's
03:52 - everything from it looks like I know how
03:56 - old you are how old are you oh you're
04:00 - muted I can't hear you um but it looked
04:03 - like you might say what you say port
04:05 - with you yeah so if you're in high
04:07 - school there some great resources on for
04:09 - example Khan Academy where you can keep
04:11 - you can keep studying um our code
04:13 - Academy or code HS if you're younger
04:16 - there are classes a tinker um lots of
04:21 - your classes out there to keep learning
04:22 - if your school doesn't offer it
04:25 - but you know I I took um I took four
04:29 - years I have a bachelor's degree in
04:31 - computer science so you know four years
04:33 - of study I took lots and lots of classes
04:35 - I think computer science is something
04:37 - it's similar to a lot of fields right
04:39 - anybody can get started and you can do a
04:41 - lot you know pretty quickly but to
04:43 - really master it does take a lot of time
04:45 - both in school and in practice and in a
04:47 - job too great at it just like you know
04:49 - learning some amount of biology is
04:51 - useful for everybody but to become a
04:53 - doctor become a new uncle professional
04:56 - you do have to take years of study to
04:57 - really learn it and computer science is
04:59 - similar it takes a long time to really
05:00 - master it and a lot of dedication okay
05:03 - thanks yeah great answer Alice the hour
05:07 - of code is just the beginning but it's
05:08 - important to keep learning so we're
05:10 - going to jump next to Greg's class and
05:13 - hawaii hawaii all right so i think yo
05:23 - I'm go ahead um do you think computer
05:26 - programming should be taught in school
05:29 - absolutely don't you you know I'm so
05:32 - lucky that my school did teach computer
05:34 - science and I wouldn't have the career I
05:36 - have today if I hadn't had a chance to
05:38 - learn it in school I think every school
05:40 - should have the opportunity to to learn
05:43 - computer science no matter what career
05:44 - you end up with but also just because
05:47 - you know maybe you tried and you want to
05:48 - do computer science and having having
05:51 - entire school is a great first step
05:52 - toward that if any teachers are out
05:55 - there it sounds like your teachers are
05:56 - probably all the ones who are already
05:57 - teaching computer science so thank you
05:59 - but if you know if your school doesn't
06:02 - teach it I would recommend it you just
06:04 - try to find it on your own courses
06:07 - online if your school doesn't teach if
06:09 - it and if your teachers are out there
06:10 - listening and you want to teach and you
06:12 - don't know how on our website there's
06:14 - some great links and some workshops you
06:16 - can take for learning how to teach
06:18 - computer science thankfully dancer
06:21 - alison for one of our last questions
06:23 - were actually going to jump to a teacher
06:24 - who I know has been incorporating coding
06:27 - into its classroom Shane's class in
06:29 - Honolulu Hawaii what kind of what
06:31 - question do we have today
06:35 - I sing half-christmas Beverly it is a
06:48 - takedown right so it was a little hard
06:55 - to hear that I'm Kate if you get a
06:58 - question good game that's not it to see
07:01 - how they can be decided what advice if
07:04 - you can see students struggling or just
07:07 - party oh if I sisters struggling are
07:11 - just it's yeah so one of the things that
07:15 - i think is great about computer science
07:17 - is you don't have to get it right the
07:18 - first time so uh you know and you guys
07:21 - did the hour of code you saw that you
07:23 - know you can hit run and your guy
07:25 - doesn't get all the way to where you're
07:26 - supposed to go and then you can hit run
07:27 - again and try it again and try something
07:29 - else and try something else computer
07:31 - science is all trying it and trying to
07:34 - begin and try to begin nothing you ever
07:36 - write in code is going to work the first
07:38 - time and I think the difference but you
07:40 - know what will make you great is the
07:42 - fact that you keep trying so if you
07:43 - don't give up and you just keep hitting
07:45 - run and you just keep trying you'll
07:47 - eventually figure it out and I have had
07:49 - nights where I you know their days where
07:52 - things come easy if things work the
07:53 - first time but there's a lot of times
07:55 - where you know
07:57 - Perkins um and playing around sometimes
08:00 - you just discover something that you
08:02 - didn't think you would discovered it's
08:03 - so much fun when you build it and it
08:05 - finally works and you can show it to
08:06 - everybody and you can be like hey I
08:08 - built that and that works so if you're
08:11 - struggling with it um you're probably
08:12 - doing it right it means you're trying
08:15 - something that's challenging if it's
08:16 - you're not struggling it's too easy and
08:19 - you should try something a little harder
08:19 - and keep going for it everybody you know
08:23 - that's what learning feels like learning
08:24 - feels like just keep trying something
08:26 - and sometimes a little bit too hard and
08:28 - keep trying and making it work and
08:29 - that's true even when we build our
08:32 - software so when we were building this
08:33 - tutorial we're feels first building the
08:35 - Star Wars tutorial um it's true for both
08:39 - tutorials with a starburst Eto'o
08:40 - building it and nothing worked the first
08:43 - time so I remember going to break its
08:45 - computer we had those Probot interrupts
08:48 - um try it and way too large and kind of
08:52 - hiding your guy everywhere you look
08:53 - there were these pro bots flying around
08:55 - the screen or like that's not correct
08:57 - let's try it again so we tried to make
09:00 - them smaller and then they were too
09:01 - small and you couldn't see him and that
09:03 - we made a bigger and you know play
09:05 - around with it and trying to figure out
09:06 - how it works that's part of that's part
09:08 - of building something annagrace you to
09:10 - just keep going for it that's great
09:13 - advice Alice especially for students
09:15 - doing their first hour of code it's so
09:17 - important to remember that it's okay if
09:18 - you don't do it exactly right the first
09:20 - time so we have since we have a smaller
09:23 - number classroom to this chat we
09:24 - definitely like to loop back and see if
09:25 - anybody has extra questions on albertos
09:29 - class do you have another question you'd
09:30 - like to ask yes we have one more
09:37 - question super come on up
09:48 - how do you plan to encourage more girls
09:52 - to bit more interesting and clothing
09:55 - yeah how do we get more girls that
09:57 - you're still in coding well starts with
09:58 - you are you interested in coding yes
10:00 - yeah I think a lot of girls don't code
10:04 - because they've never tried it um you
10:06 - know I think girls if you look at them
10:08 - you know we'd love to build things we'd
10:10 - love to make things we love to create
10:12 - things and computer science is just
10:15 - about giving you the tools to create
10:16 - things and those things that you create
10:18 - they can be games they can be stories
10:21 - they can be apps girls use as many apps
10:24 - on their you know on the web and on
10:26 - their phones and on tablets as boys do
10:28 - and I think if we give everybody the the
10:31 - ability to go try it we're gonna find a
10:34 - lot of women want to do it and a lot of
10:36 - girls want to do it and you know there's
10:38 - a there's a myth out there that girls do
10:41 - less science and math than boys do if
10:43 - you actually look at the numbers girls
10:46 - do as much science and math as boys do
10:48 - there are more girls majoring in biology
10:49 - than there are boys there are almost as
10:51 - many girls majoring in math or physics
10:53 - as there are boys the one place where we
10:55 - don't have women and we don't have girls
10:56 - today is computer science and
10:58 - engineering and you know you know if we
11:01 - can good um just give I think all the
11:05 - girls the chance to try it I think we'd
11:07 - find just as many girls are is
11:08 - interested in um you know in building
11:11 - things as we are in biology and other
11:12 - things which are more traditional girl
11:14 - fields and science or math so I hope you
11:16 - guys all try it out I hope you guys
11:18 - think about what you want to build and
11:20 - what you would want to create I know you
11:22 - know um I'm a I'm a girl and a woman and
11:26 - computer science and an engineering I
11:27 - think it's a fantastic feel for women
11:29 - and there's so much stuff that you can
11:31 - do and create and and want to use I love
11:34 - building things that I myself would want
11:36 - to use and a lot of other women out
11:38 - there who will use it girls so just try
11:41 - it out I think we can do a lot there but
11:43 - you're the beginning of it so I want you
11:44 - to want you to try it okay awesome thank
11:48 - you great advice Alice is everyone are
11:51 - all the girls on this call gonna try
11:52 - computer science know
11:57 - hey yeah um Nicole's class in salt lake
12:03 - city do you have another question you'd
12:05 - like to ask we sure do was it hard going
12:09 - into this job being the woman and how
12:12 - were you able to go through the things
12:13 - you did to become successful you know it
12:18 - actually wasn't hard at all in a woman
12:20 - in computer science because you know mmm
12:23 - because you know woman I don't know I I
12:28 - just like building things and I'm
12:29 - building things I think the thing that
12:30 - that felt weird was that there weren't a
12:32 - lot of other women around right um and
12:35 - so when I took my classes in college I
12:37 - would often look around and find that I
12:38 - was one of you know three or four girls
12:40 - in the room um I've been on teams and
12:42 - worked in classes from the only girl on
12:44 - the team and that that is something that
12:47 - we can you know so for me personally no
12:49 - it was fine like I had fun and I liked
12:51 - what I was doing and I like building
12:53 - things I mean I worked on a brick time
12:54 - xbox I've worked on tools and office of
12:57 - worked in hololens I've done all sorts
12:59 - of amazing things and build things that
13:01 - I love to use and it was you know being
13:04 - a woman is just part of who I am and I
13:06 - think it it gives me you know knowing
13:08 - that that I can build something for
13:11 - other women and four men to use i can
13:13 - bring all of that and all of the skills
13:15 - that I've got his women to the table and
13:17 - it's been really fun to be a female in
13:20 - computer science but I would be more fun
13:23 - if there were more of you guys around
13:24 - with me so I think the the one thing
13:28 - that I would love to see is I would love
13:29 - to I would love to see more women at the
13:31 - table with me and you know the more of
13:34 - you guys who want to try computer
13:35 - science and want to join there's awesome
13:38 - opportunities in the field and there's
13:40 - also you know it is a career that um
13:42 - that has a lot of flexible you know I
13:45 - know you guys aren't thinking about
13:46 - someday like right now you're probably
13:49 - not thinking about families and kids but
13:51 - I've three kids and you know it's nice
13:53 - to be in a career where there is you
13:56 - know a good income the ability to I can
13:58 - leave work at any time and go to a
14:00 - doctor's appointment or take my kids to
14:01 - school come back and so it's a great
14:04 - it's a great career for women and I hope
14:06 - that more I hope I see more people table
14:08 - who are females
14:09 - hang out with me that would be great in
14:11 - a few years thank you so much um Greg's
14:20 - class in kawaii do we have another
14:21 - question you'd like to ask alice hello
14:25 - Alice so I'm teaching high school of
14:28 - course the bell has rung and all the
14:30 - kids decided that they needed to go eat
14:31 - lunch so I am the sole survivor but if
14:34 - you don't mind I'd like to ask you a
14:35 - question good fine can you tell me about
14:39 - one of the projects that you've worked
14:41 - on throughout your career that was
14:42 - especially fun for you or exciting or
14:44 - maybe got you hooked more or something
14:47 - that was really cool oh there's so many
14:50 - so the very first computer thing I built
14:53 - the computer science I had a computer at
14:55 - home and I had a little brother um and
14:57 - if any of you guys have low brothers you
14:58 - know what a problem they are um and so I
15:02 - built this way from my computer so that
15:04 - when my little brother would try to log
15:05 - on it would be really loudly like and
15:10 - then put a big letters on the screen sac
15:14 - which is my brother's name you have
15:16 - tried to break into my computer um this
15:19 - incursion has been blogged and you are
15:22 - hereby banned from you know all computer
15:25 - usage etc and so I thought that was
15:27 - pretty cool and my brother thought it
15:29 - was less cool than I did and then I
15:31 - think one of the things that got me
15:32 - excited once I got a little further into
15:34 - computer science I could do more with it
15:35 - than just a warning for my brother was
15:38 - that I could build things I wanted to
15:39 - use and so you know I you know math I
15:43 - was always solving a problem that was
15:45 - you know stated and then there was one
15:47 - answer right so you know prove this so
15:49 - you had to work through and you to do
15:51 - all the steps it was interesting the
15:52 - problems were fun but the end there was
15:54 - one answer and i liked the creativity of
15:57 - you know english we could write an essay
15:59 - about anything um but but that's just an
16:02 - essay and as these are great but i
16:04 - wanted to build things and the idea that
16:05 - I could you know I made a game of like a
16:08 - snake game where a snake was going
16:10 - around the the course
16:13 - heard you tried to avoid things sort of
16:15 - a variation on a game called nibbles or
16:17 - snake that you may have played and I
16:19 - remember when I built it I could build
16:21 - exactly what I wanted there was no right
16:22 - answer to the problem I could create it
16:24 - I could decide how it was going to work
16:25 - I decided which way the snake was going
16:27 - to move I decided what happened when you
16:29 - did or didn't get an apple and it was so
16:31 - much fun to be able to create it and by
16:33 - my teacher who was grading it ended up
16:37 - telling me that there was a bug in my
16:38 - program which means there's something
16:40 - wrong with it and the thing that was
16:41 - wrong with it was if you played it for
16:44 - like 15 hours straight uh it didn't go
16:48 - up to the you can get his high score
16:49 - that didn't fit on the screen um and he
16:52 - actually he actually broke my program by
16:55 - staying up all night and playing it
16:57 - because it was so much fun and it I
17:00 - didn't handle the high score he had
17:02 - gotten because I never tested it that
17:03 - high and it's just cool to know you can
17:05 - do that and you can build that kind of
17:07 - thing so you know whatever it is you
17:09 - want to build I think that's the finest
17:10 - thing is when you get to create your own
17:11 - whatever you want to do that's what's
17:14 - most fun about computer science awesome
17:17 - answer Ellis and for everyone who's
17:19 - doing the hour of code this week
17:21 - remember that at the end of the star
17:23 - wars and minecraft tutorials we have an
17:25 - option for you to build your own game so
17:26 - if you liked what else is talking about
17:28 - and using your coding creativity to
17:30 - create something be sure to check that
17:31 - out to wrap up we just like to loop back
17:34 - to Shane and Hawaii do we have one more
17:37 - question would you like to be President
17:41 - one day ankle what I like to be
17:45 - President one day and cokes that we were
17:47 - asking Oh EDD code at code.org that you
17:53 - say oh no I love my job I get to I get
17:57 - to actually build the tutorials you guys
17:59 - just used like how cool is that I get to
18:02 - come to work and build things like you
18:05 - know like the Star Wars tutorial and the
18:07 - minecraft tutorial and work on all of
18:10 - the courses that go beyond that so you
18:12 - know once you finish those tutorials if
18:13 - you want to keep keep studying we've got
18:15 - the cs fundamentals courses for grades
18:17 - kindergarten through grade five we have
18:19 - more courses to grade 8 that high school
18:21 - says you know as far as I can tell I
18:23 - have the best job in the world right now
18:25 - so um yeah that's i love what i do i
18:29 - want to do exactly what i'm doing just
18:30 - keep doing it I'm gonna build things
18:31 - that's why I got into it so i wouldn't
18:33 - want to stop building things well thank
18:37 - you so much owls for joining yesterday I
18:39 - know you have so many good insights
18:41 - about learning to code and what you can
18:43 - do creatively with coding so if everyone
18:45 - could give me a big round of applause
18:46 - and thank Alice for joining us today all
18:59 - right thank you so much everybody

Cleaned transcript:

fun and thank you for joining us today for a special hour of code video chat to celebrate computer science education week joining us again this year's code orgs head of product and engineering Alice Stein glass you were all very familiar with Alice's work I'm she led the development for the hour of code Star Wars and minecraft tutorials which you guys have probably been playing all week so can I get everyone to give me a big round of applause and join me in welcoming Alice thank you great to have you here Ellis our first question this week comes from Stratford school so Roberto would your class like to ask their question yes we have a moge asking the question my name is ammo and my question is why do you think coding is so important well you know amogh do you use technology do you ever use phones or computers or anything that yeah yeah I mean these days we use it to have fun we use it to communicate it release it to schedule things we use it for work technology is a part of everything we're doing and learning a little bit of computer science as a way that you can learn a little bit about how all of that works right so you know in school you learn a lot of basic things you aren't reading you learn writing you probably are going to learn a little bit about how your body works have you learned about circulation and how you breathe in your lugs right exactly and so I do with learning a little bit of computer science is it's that same set of skills for a lot of the world around you and how it works so by learning a little bit of computer science you can have a better idea when you're no matter what you decide to do let's say you go into you know you become a doctor when you grow up or you work in you want to be an artist or you want to be a farmer or you want to be in you know marketing or whatever it is you decide to do when you grow up probably that field is going to use technology and a little bit about how it works you can you can do a better job of work the people who are doing that work or if you decide and liked that like how many people in your class really liked the hour of code like computer science i neva thought it was fun yeah yeah so if i doing like one truck and you get to say you know hey i like that then you can go on and do more and so if you want to study more computer science there's a fantastic career out there in computer science i love i love the fact that i have an engineering degree and get to do computer science and if you decide to do that you know I want you to keep trying don't stop with one hour of code absolutely what the hour of code is all about our next question today is going to come from Nicole's classroom in Salt Lake City my name is Eric and what extra classes did you have to take to help you get where you are right now what sorry classes I have to take yeah like extracurricular oh x tripura killer classes um I never took an extracurricular class I was really lucky that my school taught computer science i was able to start with computer science in school and uh and then i went on to college and I majored in computer science in college uh you know I think there are a lot of a lot of computers out there who don't take any extracurricular classes and find a way to do it in school but if your school has a doctorate there are fantastic classes online and if you go to code org slash learn / beyond after you finish your hour of code you can see links to all sorts of things you can do at home to keep doing the hour of code I'm sorry to keep learning how to code and that's everything from it looks like I know how old you are how old are you oh you're muted I can't hear you um but it looked like you might say what you say port with you yeah so if you're in high school there some great resources on for example Khan Academy where you can keep you can keep studying um our code Academy or code HS if you're younger there are classes a tinker um lots of your classes out there to keep learning if your school doesn't offer it but you know I I took um I took four years I have a bachelor's degree in computer science so you know four years of study I took lots and lots of classes I think computer science is something it's similar to a lot of fields right anybody can get started and you can do a lot you know pretty quickly but to really master it does take a lot of time both in school and in practice and in a job too great at it just like you know learning some amount of biology is useful for everybody but to become a doctor become a new uncle professional you do have to take years of study to really learn it and computer science is similar it takes a long time to really master it and a lot of dedication okay thanks yeah great answer Alice the hour of code is just the beginning but it's important to keep learning so we're going to jump next to Greg's class and hawaii hawaii all right so i think yo I'm go ahead um do you think computer programming should be taught in school absolutely don't you you know I'm so lucky that my school did teach computer science and I wouldn't have the career I have today if I hadn't had a chance to learn it in school I think every school should have the opportunity to to learn computer science no matter what career you end up with but also just because you know maybe you tried and you want to do computer science and having having entire school is a great first step toward that if any teachers are out there it sounds like your teachers are probably all the ones who are already teaching computer science so thank you but if you know if your school doesn't teach it I would recommend it you just try to find it on your own courses online if your school doesn't teach if it and if your teachers are out there listening and you want to teach and you don't know how on our website there's some great links and some workshops you can take for learning how to teach computer science thankfully dancer alison for one of our last questions were actually going to jump to a teacher who I know has been incorporating coding into its classroom Shane's class in Honolulu Hawaii what kind of what question do we have today I sing halfchristmas Beverly it is a takedown right so it was a little hard to hear that I'm Kate if you get a question good game that's not it to see how they can be decided what advice if you can see students struggling or just party oh if I sisters struggling are just it's yeah so one of the things that i think is great about computer science is you don't have to get it right the first time so uh you know and you guys did the hour of code you saw that you know you can hit run and your guy doesn't get all the way to where you're supposed to go and then you can hit run again and try it again and try something else and try something else computer science is all trying it and trying to begin and try to begin nothing you ever write in code is going to work the first time and I think the difference but you know what will make you great is the fact that you keep trying so if you don't give up and you just keep hitting run and you just keep trying you'll eventually figure it out and I have had nights where I you know their days where things come easy if things work the first time but there's a lot of times where you know Perkins um and playing around sometimes you just discover something that you didn't think you would discovered it's so much fun when you build it and it finally works and you can show it to everybody and you can be like hey I built that and that works so if you're struggling with it um you're probably doing it right it means you're trying something that's challenging if it's you're not struggling it's too easy and you should try something a little harder and keep going for it everybody you know that's what learning feels like learning feels like just keep trying something and sometimes a little bit too hard and keep trying and making it work and that's true even when we build our software so when we were building this tutorial we're feels first building the Star Wars tutorial um it's true for both tutorials with a starburst Eto'o building it and nothing worked the first time so I remember going to break its computer we had those Probot interrupts um try it and way too large and kind of hiding your guy everywhere you look there were these pro bots flying around the screen or like that's not correct let's try it again so we tried to make them smaller and then they were too small and you couldn't see him and that we made a bigger and you know play around with it and trying to figure out how it works that's part of that's part of building something annagrace you to just keep going for it that's great advice Alice especially for students doing their first hour of code it's so important to remember that it's okay if you don't do it exactly right the first time so we have since we have a smaller number classroom to this chat we definitely like to loop back and see if anybody has extra questions on albertos class do you have another question you'd like to ask yes we have one more question super come on up how do you plan to encourage more girls to bit more interesting and clothing yeah how do we get more girls that you're still in coding well starts with you are you interested in coding yes yeah I think a lot of girls don't code because they've never tried it um you know I think girls if you look at them you know we'd love to build things we'd love to make things we love to create things and computer science is just about giving you the tools to create things and those things that you create they can be games they can be stories they can be apps girls use as many apps on their you know on the web and on their phones and on tablets as boys do and I think if we give everybody the the ability to go try it we're gonna find a lot of women want to do it and a lot of girls want to do it and you know there's a there's a myth out there that girls do less science and math than boys do if you actually look at the numbers girls do as much science and math as boys do there are more girls majoring in biology than there are boys there are almost as many girls majoring in math or physics as there are boys the one place where we don't have women and we don't have girls today is computer science and engineering and you know you know if we can good um just give I think all the girls the chance to try it I think we'd find just as many girls are is interested in um you know in building things as we are in biology and other things which are more traditional girl fields and science or math so I hope you guys all try it out I hope you guys think about what you want to build and what you would want to create I know you know um I'm a I'm a girl and a woman and computer science and an engineering I think it's a fantastic feel for women and there's so much stuff that you can do and create and and want to use I love building things that I myself would want to use and a lot of other women out there who will use it girls so just try it out I think we can do a lot there but you're the beginning of it so I want you to want you to try it okay awesome thank you great advice Alice is everyone are all the girls on this call gonna try computer science know hey yeah um Nicole's class in salt lake city do you have another question you'd like to ask we sure do was it hard going into this job being the woman and how were you able to go through the things you did to become successful you know it actually wasn't hard at all in a woman in computer science because you know mmm because you know woman I don't know I I just like building things and I'm building things I think the thing that that felt weird was that there weren't a lot of other women around right um and so when I took my classes in college I would often look around and find that I was one of you know three or four girls in the room um I've been on teams and worked in classes from the only girl on the team and that that is something that we can you know so for me personally no it was fine like I had fun and I liked what I was doing and I like building things I mean I worked on a brick time xbox I've worked on tools and office of worked in hololens I've done all sorts of amazing things and build things that I love to use and it was you know being a woman is just part of who I am and I think it it gives me you know knowing that that I can build something for other women and four men to use i can bring all of that and all of the skills that I've got his women to the table and it's been really fun to be a female in computer science but I would be more fun if there were more of you guys around with me so I think the the one thing that I would love to see is I would love to I would love to see more women at the table with me and you know the more of you guys who want to try computer science and want to join there's awesome opportunities in the field and there's also you know it is a career that um that has a lot of flexible you know I know you guys aren't thinking about someday like right now you're probably not thinking about families and kids but I've three kids and you know it's nice to be in a career where there is you know a good income the ability to I can leave work at any time and go to a doctor's appointment or take my kids to school come back and so it's a great it's a great career for women and I hope that more I hope I see more people table who are females hang out with me that would be great in a few years thank you so much um Greg's class in kawaii do we have another question you'd like to ask alice hello Alice so I'm teaching high school of course the bell has rung and all the kids decided that they needed to go eat lunch so I am the sole survivor but if you don't mind I'd like to ask you a question good fine can you tell me about one of the projects that you've worked on throughout your career that was especially fun for you or exciting or maybe got you hooked more or something that was really cool oh there's so many so the very first computer thing I built the computer science I had a computer at home and I had a little brother um and if any of you guys have low brothers you know what a problem they are um and so I built this way from my computer so that when my little brother would try to log on it would be really loudly like and then put a big letters on the screen sac which is my brother's name you have tried to break into my computer um this incursion has been blogged and you are hereby banned from you know all computer usage etc and so I thought that was pretty cool and my brother thought it was less cool than I did and then I think one of the things that got me excited once I got a little further into computer science I could do more with it than just a warning for my brother was that I could build things I wanted to use and so you know I you know math I was always solving a problem that was you know stated and then there was one answer right so you know prove this so you had to work through and you to do all the steps it was interesting the problems were fun but the end there was one answer and i liked the creativity of you know english we could write an essay about anything um but but that's just an essay and as these are great but i wanted to build things and the idea that I could you know I made a game of like a snake game where a snake was going around the the course heard you tried to avoid things sort of a variation on a game called nibbles or snake that you may have played and I remember when I built it I could build exactly what I wanted there was no right answer to the problem I could create it I could decide how it was going to work I decided which way the snake was going to move I decided what happened when you did or didn't get an apple and it was so much fun to be able to create it and by my teacher who was grading it ended up telling me that there was a bug in my program which means there's something wrong with it and the thing that was wrong with it was if you played it for like 15 hours straight uh it didn't go up to the you can get his high score that didn't fit on the screen um and he actually he actually broke my program by staying up all night and playing it because it was so much fun and it I didn't handle the high score he had gotten because I never tested it that high and it's just cool to know you can do that and you can build that kind of thing so you know whatever it is you want to build I think that's the finest thing is when you get to create your own whatever you want to do that's what's most fun about computer science awesome answer Ellis and for everyone who's doing the hour of code this week remember that at the end of the star wars and minecraft tutorials we have an option for you to build your own game so if you liked what else is talking about and using your coding creativity to create something be sure to check that out to wrap up we just like to loop back to Shane and Hawaii do we have one more question would you like to be President one day ankle what I like to be President one day and cokes that we were asking Oh EDD code at code.org that you say oh no I love my job I get to I get to actually build the tutorials you guys just used like how cool is that I get to come to work and build things like you know like the Star Wars tutorial and the minecraft tutorial and work on all of the courses that go beyond that so you know once you finish those tutorials if you want to keep keep studying we've got the cs fundamentals courses for grades kindergarten through grade five we have more courses to grade 8 that high school says you know as far as I can tell I have the best job in the world right now so um yeah that's i love what i do i want to do exactly what i'm doing just keep doing it I'm gonna build things that's why I got into it so i wouldn't want to stop building things well thank you so much owls for joining yesterday I know you have so many good insights about learning to code and what you can do creatively with coding so if everyone could give me a big round of applause and thank Alice for joining us today all right thank you so much everybody
