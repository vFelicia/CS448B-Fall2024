00:12 - so today
00:13 - i brought in
00:15 - a super special craft project
00:18 - yay
00:19 - are you guys ready
00:20 - yeah so it's it's it's kind of hard to
00:22 - see
00:24 - can you guys see it
00:27 - it's a panda on a string
00:31 - so i'm going to call this a sun catcher
00:33 - because it looks like something i might
00:35 - hang from the mirror in my car
00:37 - right when you drive so that the sun
00:40 - shines off of it
00:42 - or it could be something you put on a
00:44 - zipper on your jacket or on your
00:46 - backpack you can use it for whatever you
00:49 - want to use it for but this is what
00:50 - we're going to make
00:52 - so what we're going to do now is i'm
00:54 - going to tell you
00:55 - out loud how we're going to make it
00:58 - and then i want you
01:00 - to repeat it back to me
01:02 - okay so listening ears on
01:05 - are you ready
01:07 - bead
01:08 - knot
01:09 - bead
01:11 - not spacer
01:13 - not
01:15 - oh wait i'm not done yet
01:17 - bead not
01:19 - bead
01:20 - not
01:21 - spacer not panda
01:23 - special bead not everyone will have a
01:25 - panda so we'll call it a special bead
01:28 - and then a finishing knot to make sure
01:30 - that it all stays on
01:32 - so do you think you guys remember that
01:34 - okay ready go through it with me here we
01:36 - go
01:53 - okay
01:54 - we're going to try it again
01:56 - listen to me because we're going to call
01:57 - this a special bead and we're going to
01:59 - call this a finishing knot okay
02:02 - it's just a little bit different than
02:04 - the other ones
02:06 - bead
02:20 - good job you guys okay so now
02:24 - just in case
02:25 - we
02:26 - risk forgetting
02:28 - what we just did we're gonna write the
02:30 - instructions down so everyone can look
02:32 - at it when it's time to make your own
02:34 - okay
02:38 - here we go
02:39 - so what was the first thing
02:42 - go ahead yeah you can go ahead and shout
02:44 - it out all right what was the first
02:45 - thing
02:47 - bead
02:59 - and after that
03:14 - there's definitely a pattern what else
03:16 - are we noticing
03:21 - we could just repeat right
03:24 - but
03:24 - we don't have a repeat command here
03:27 - so we can't use one
03:29 - so we're going to write all the
03:30 - instructions down but what are what's
03:32 - happening here
03:34 - we're running out of room
03:37 - we have to figure out what we're gonna
03:38 - do
03:39 - if we went ahead and finished our
03:41 - pattern and put not here
03:44 - then we could just say to repeat this
03:46 - whole thing
03:48 - and we'd get a lot closer right but
03:50 - would we have room for everything
03:52 - no
03:53 - yeah we can make another block number
03:56 - seven and number eight until we go to
03:58 - this panda or the special okay so she's
04:02 - saying well but we could make more boxes
04:05 - and we don't have room to make more
04:06 - boxes here but what do you guys notice
04:12 - more boxes more boxes
04:15 - that's right so we do have room over
04:18 - here and over here
04:19 - where we can write some things
04:22 - so here's what i want to do
04:25 - i'm going to give you all a copy
04:28 - of
04:29 - this
04:30 - worksheet you guys are going to work in
04:32 - groups
04:34 - and this is the program this is like
04:36 - what what we're doing here
04:38 - and here are our two extra boxes
04:42 - now if we wanted to call
04:46 - let's see
04:49 - i'm gonna erase these out real quick
04:52 - if we had something in here and we said
04:56 - banana
05:00 - let's say banana
05:03 - what
05:04 - swordfish
05:07 - if we had banana swordfish over here
05:10 - how would i get this to call banana
05:12 - swordfish do you suppose
05:16 - i could write banana swordfish would
05:17 - that have saved me any room in my
05:19 - program yeah
05:20 - no
05:21 - repeat you could write f1 i could write
05:25 - f1
05:27 - so if i write f1 you guys are gonna know
05:32 - that i go over here
05:34 - and i read through f1
05:37 - before i go any further
05:41 - you get it
05:45 - okay so here's what i'm gonna do now
05:47 - i'm handing out the worksheets
05:50 - i'll have one here you three are going
05:51 - to work together all right
05:53 - now i want you to figure out how you use
05:56 - your two extra boxes
05:59 - you've got to call your box and your
06:01 - program
06:08 - remember to be careful not to over teach
06:11 - the fun in this lesson comes from
06:13 - letting the kids explore different
06:15 - options and having different answers to
06:17 - the same problem so let them figure it
06:19 - out and only go to them if they have a
06:21 - question
06:25 - the important part of this lesson is
06:26 - actually the wrap up because as you saw
06:28 - we kind of snuck the idea of a function
06:30 - on them and it's important that they
06:32 - don't really know that they're learning
06:35 - until afterwards so they can have as
06:36 - much fun as possible
06:38 - sometimes kids will come up with ideas
06:39 - like loops and functions on their own
06:41 - and they should definitely be commended
06:43 - but you don't need to go into it right
06:45 - then wait till they come back and
06:47 - they've got their sun catcher going and
06:50 - then you can say hey
06:51 - guess what we just learned
06:56 - okay so you guys
06:58 - understand now that you're going to take
07:01 - all of these instructions and you can
07:03 - fit this whole thing of instructions
07:06 - right into one line on your program
07:10 - just by calling the name
07:13 - of all of this
07:15 - and that is called a function in
07:18 - computer science we write functions all
07:20 - the time so we can take lots of
07:22 - instructions and call it at different
07:25 - points in a program really really easily
07:28 - another thing i bet you didn't notice
07:31 - is that these
07:33 - change right you have black beads and
07:36 - you have red beads and we don't know
07:39 - what kind of spacer you're going to have
07:42 - or what your special bead is going to be
07:44 - but we need something to put there
07:46 - anyway so that you know what
07:48 - instructions to follow before you even
07:50 - get your cup of beats
07:51 - and that's why we have these placeholder
07:54 - words and we call those variables
07:57 - so you guys just learned by making these
08:00 - little sun catchers
08:02 - how to use functions
08:04 - and variables pretty cool huh

Cleaned transcript:

so today i brought in a super special craft project yay are you guys ready yeah so it's it's it's kind of hard to see can you guys see it it's a panda on a string so i'm going to call this a sun catcher because it looks like something i might hang from the mirror in my car right when you drive so that the sun shines off of it or it could be something you put on a zipper on your jacket or on your backpack you can use it for whatever you want to use it for but this is what we're going to make so what we're going to do now is i'm going to tell you out loud how we're going to make it and then i want you to repeat it back to me okay so listening ears on are you ready bead knot bead not spacer not oh wait i'm not done yet bead not bead not spacer not panda special bead not everyone will have a panda so we'll call it a special bead and then a finishing knot to make sure that it all stays on so do you think you guys remember that okay ready go through it with me here we go okay we're going to try it again listen to me because we're going to call this a special bead and we're going to call this a finishing knot okay it's just a little bit different than the other ones bead good job you guys okay so now just in case we risk forgetting what we just did we're gonna write the instructions down so everyone can look at it when it's time to make your own okay here we go so what was the first thing go ahead yeah you can go ahead and shout it out all right what was the first thing bead and after that there's definitely a pattern what else are we noticing we could just repeat right but we don't have a repeat command here so we can't use one so we're going to write all the instructions down but what are what's happening here we're running out of room we have to figure out what we're gonna do if we went ahead and finished our pattern and put not here then we could just say to repeat this whole thing and we'd get a lot closer right but would we have room for everything no yeah we can make another block number seven and number eight until we go to this panda or the special okay so she's saying well but we could make more boxes and we don't have room to make more boxes here but what do you guys notice more boxes more boxes that's right so we do have room over here and over here where we can write some things so here's what i want to do i'm going to give you all a copy of this worksheet you guys are going to work in groups and this is the program this is like what what we're doing here and here are our two extra boxes now if we wanted to call let's see i'm gonna erase these out real quick if we had something in here and we said banana let's say banana what swordfish if we had banana swordfish over here how would i get this to call banana swordfish do you suppose i could write banana swordfish would that have saved me any room in my program yeah no repeat you could write f1 i could write f1 so if i write f1 you guys are gonna know that i go over here and i read through f1 before i go any further you get it okay so here's what i'm gonna do now i'm handing out the worksheets i'll have one here you three are going to work together all right now i want you to figure out how you use your two extra boxes you've got to call your box and your program remember to be careful not to over teach the fun in this lesson comes from letting the kids explore different options and having different answers to the same problem so let them figure it out and only go to them if they have a question the important part of this lesson is actually the wrap up because as you saw we kind of snuck the idea of a function on them and it's important that they don't really know that they're learning until afterwards so they can have as much fun as possible sometimes kids will come up with ideas like loops and functions on their own and they should definitely be commended but you don't need to go into it right then wait till they come back and they've got their sun catcher going and then you can say hey guess what we just learned okay so you guys understand now that you're going to take all of these instructions and you can fit this whole thing of instructions right into one line on your program just by calling the name of all of this and that is called a function in computer science we write functions all the time so we can take lots of instructions and call it at different points in a program really really easily another thing i bet you didn't notice is that these change right you have black beads and you have red beads and we don't know what kind of spacer you're going to have or what your special bead is going to be but we need something to put there anyway so that you know what instructions to follow before you even get your cup of beats and that's why we have these placeholder words and we call those variables so you guys just learned by making these little sun catchers how to use functions and variables pretty cool huh
