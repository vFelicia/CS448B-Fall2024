With timestamps:

00:00 - to close us out for the day we have this
00:02 - absolutely phenomenal panel of State
00:04 - leaders to share some insights with us
00:08 - and this is really a big deal this is a
00:11 - first for Cs edcon and probably a first
00:14 - for CS education to have this many state
00:17 - leaders talking together about Computer
00:20 - Science Education is absolutely
00:22 - thrilling and I'm so glad that you all
00:23 - will be here for it
00:25 - [Applause]
00:32 - so I'm going to start by introducing
00:33 - each of our panelists so when I say your
00:36 - name just give a quick wave to the
00:38 - audience and folks will save our
00:40 - Applause until all of them have been
00:42 - introduced
00:44 - uh so first I want to mention a couple
00:46 - State Chiefs who were meant to be here
00:48 - but couldn't uh be here for this this
00:49 - panel secretary Manny Diaz from Florida
00:53 - was here earlier today for a
00:54 - conversation unfortunately had to go to
00:57 - a prior commitment for this afternoon
00:59 - and Dr Penny Schwinn from Tennessee also
01:02 - wasn't able to be here but I'd plan to
01:04 - be here and uh you will see her on the
01:06 - slide so she is unfortunately not here
01:09 - all right so here we have uh Dr Angelica
01:12 - Allen McMillan of New Jersey
01:15 - superintendent Kirsten Basler of North
01:17 - Dakota
01:19 - superintendent Jillian Balo of Virginia
01:23 - superintendent Joan Ebert from Nevada
01:26 - Dr Daniel French of Vermont
01:29 - Dr Christina Grant from DC
01:33 - superintendent Johnny key from Arkansas
01:36 - Dr Eric Mackey from Alabama
01:39 - commissioner Pender Macon from Maine
01:43 - secretary Tiffany Sanderson from South
01:45 - Dakota
01:46 - and superintendent Molly Spearman from
01:48 - South Carolina give him a warm welcome
01:51 - [Applause]
01:58 - and I want to introduce you to one more
02:00 - person Bob renssey Bob is the interim
02:03 - leader of chiefs for change he's also a
02:06 - code.org board member and the former
02:08 - superintendent of Broward County Public
02:10 - Schools which was one of the first
02:12 - school districts to partner with
02:14 - code.org to bring computer science to
02:16 - all of its students
02:17 - so
02:18 - Bob you want to come up here
02:20 - all right let's welcome Bob
02:25 - all right Katie thank you so much and
02:27 - hey welcome everyone uh before I get
02:30 - started I definitely gotta give a shout
02:32 - out to some of the Broward peeps in here
02:34 - in particular uh Lisa milankovic and the
02:37 - Educators who have worked so hard to
02:40 - really expand uh computer science uh
02:43 - education in Broward County I know uh
02:46 - when I started there a little over a
02:47 - decade ago I think we had a few hundred
02:50 - students engaged in computer science and
02:53 - I know when I left just a few months ago
02:56 - we were well over 50 000 students
03:00 - engaged so just a huge credit and uh
03:04 - please give those folks a round of
03:06 - applause please
03:11 - I also want to mention um cheese for
03:13 - change I'm just so proud to be working
03:16 - with that organization it's a bipartisan
03:19 - network of State Chiefs and District
03:22 - leaders there's over 50 of them and we
03:26 - tend to describe them as bold leaders
03:29 - that are focused on real change in their
03:31 - systems and we work diligently to
03:34 - support them through our technical
03:35 - assistance work where we raise millions
03:38 - of dollars to go into those systems and
03:41 - help them deal with some of their
03:43 - biggest challenges and priorities we
03:46 - also have a future cheese program which
03:47 - is a leadership development program 18
03:50 - months folks go through that and then we
03:53 - help get them placed in a system and
03:57 - then Provide support to them and we also
03:59 - do advocacy work on the hill and work
04:02 - with Folks at the White House as well in
04:04 - the Department of Education a couple of
04:07 - the members a couple of the State Chiefs
04:10 - here today are members and Dr Christina
04:13 - Grant and Penny Schwinn Penny's not here
04:15 - today but we are really thrilled to have
04:17 - them as part of that amazing network of
04:20 - leaders so today we have a few questions
04:23 - for this amazing group here I think just
04:27 - looking at everyone here you can see
04:28 - that computer science clearly isn't a
04:31 - political issue or partisan issue it's
04:33 - an education issue it really is
04:36 - something that we can all focus on and
04:38 - get behind and do what's right for our
04:40 - kids we have a series of questions and
04:43 - we want to make sure we hear from each
04:45 - and every one of these amazing leaders
04:47 - and we will try to keep the answers
04:51 - short around a couple minutes but we'll
04:54 - try to go through this uh the best we
04:56 - can so the first question I like to put
04:59 - on a table is we know education leaders
05:02 - across the country I have been facing a
05:05 - variety of issues in fact I think we've
05:08 - had a historic high in turnover and
05:10 - vacancy rates
05:11 - um so with all this going on and the
05:14 - challenges that we have I want to ask a
05:17 - couple of you why is it important to you
05:20 - to keep computer science top of mind and
05:24 - an education priority in the systems
05:28 - that you lead and I will ask our leader
05:31 - from Maine in Vermont I guess we'll go
05:33 - up to the New England region for this
05:36 - one and I'll start with um Pender Megan
05:41 - Let's uh what are your thoughts on that
05:43 - question
05:45 - it's on
05:47 - um well you know I didn't want to take
05:48 - Dan's talking points on this one but um
05:52 - we of course want to have our students
05:53 - in Maine and Across the Nation to have
05:55 - every competitive opportunity in the
05:59 - increasingly global
06:01 - competitive environment that they are
06:03 - facing when they leave school
06:05 - additionally we want our students to uh
06:08 - to have those critical thinking skills
06:11 - and the um the Curiosity the iterative
06:14 - design and all of those other types of
06:17 - skills that students gain when they are
06:19 - involved in computer science
06:22 - um I would say above all there is the
06:25 - sense that they would face the
06:27 - inevitable challenges in computer
06:29 - science and in in creating programs that
06:32 - will do and change what is happening
06:35 - right in front of their eyes that
06:36 - Fosters a sense of
06:39 - optimism and creativity when they face
06:42 - challenges throughout their lives and so
06:44 - it's a great way to have students
06:47 - lean into agency and creativity and
06:50 - finally I guess I would say that in a
06:52 - world that is
06:53 - increasingly nebulous when it comes to
06:56 - truth and where much of the truth that
06:58 - we all absorb or think that we are
07:00 - hearing is provided to us through
07:03 - technology permeating every aspect of
07:05 - Our Lives our students need to
07:07 - understand the principles and the
07:10 - processes that underlie that which is
07:12 - presented to us all where we are getting
07:16 - the information that creates the notion
07:19 - of of truth I think that is one of the
07:21 - most critical pieces they we need them
07:23 - to understand all of that deeply all
07:26 - right thank you Pender ain't that the
07:27 - truth all right Dr French what would you
07:31 - like to add to that yeah she uh she said
07:33 - it all pretty much uh but I would say um
07:37 - yeah I would agree uh and we do work
07:38 - closely together Maine and Vermont um I
07:41 - think demographically we're two of the
07:42 - oldest States from a population
07:43 - perspective
07:45 - um and I would agree our education
07:47 - systems uh are very similar heavily
07:49 - local control and we've certainly had
07:51 - our challenges so the results of the
07:53 - pandemic but I would also say that I
07:55 - think there's a lot of opportunity and
07:57 - as in particular I think there's
07:58 - opportunity around the system probably
08:00 - being more open for structural change
08:02 - than it ever has been so I think it's
08:05 - important particularly with computer
08:06 - science as we've seen today with a
08:08 - conference there's a lot of consensus
08:10 - there's a lot of urgency there's a lot
08:11 - of collaboration happening computer
08:13 - science can really help Advance those
08:15 - structural changes now to make our
08:17 - education system more responsive to the
08:20 - personal learning needs of students some
08:22 - of those structures we've discussed
08:24 - today such as curriculum standards
08:26 - licensing standards graduation
08:28 - requirements those structural things
08:30 - have been slow to change and computer
08:32 - science sits at the Nexus of a lot of
08:34 - those issues in its own right it's an
08:36 - academic discipline to a certain extent
08:38 - it's a creative art
08:40 - um but it does call into question I
08:42 - think in a positive way uh some of our
08:44 - more rigid categorizations of the
08:46 - academic structures in K-12 education
08:48 - I think computer science is also
08:50 - important to shine a light on some of
08:53 - the opportunity gaps and what I think we
08:55 - notice in rural parts of Northern New
08:57 - England what I won't call aspiration
08:59 - gaps but aspirational limitations I
09:02 - think we all saw when our systems
09:04 - literally pivoted overnight to remote
09:06 - learning the equity gaps that are out
09:09 - there they existed prior to the pandemic
09:11 - but what we increasingly notice I think
09:14 - in our rural States and this is probably
09:16 - true in any student population that
09:17 - feels disenfranchised or disconnected to
09:20 - our modern economy our students don't
09:23 - often have a sense of the possibilities
09:24 - of the future and I think computer
09:25 - science today can really serve an
09:27 - important inspiration function for them
09:30 - um I think too many of our students are
09:33 - passive consumers of technology and
09:35 - computer science can provide them the
09:37 - tools to empower them to we'd say a
09:39 - Northern New England look under the hood
09:40 - or maybe Tinker I don't know if you're
09:43 - familiar with tinkering that's a
09:44 - Northern New England phenomena I
09:46 - certainly wouldn't advocate for
09:48 - tinkering as a graduation standard but I
09:50 - think we could certainly harness the
09:53 - energy or behind tinkering and wrap some
09:55 - formality and make computer science the
09:57 - new tinkering to empower our students to
09:59 - create Better Lives themselves their
10:01 - families and their communities
10:03 - thank you
10:05 - um so uh the next one I'll have for um
10:08 - Kirsten and Jillian you guys are sitting
10:10 - right next to each other so that'll work
10:12 - um and uh Kirsten I I think I'm correct
10:15 - you're going to be the incoming
10:17 - president of the national
10:19 - um State superintendent Association so
10:22 - congratulations to you on that um you
10:24 - can find a better person to do that
10:26 - you've had a really great track record
10:29 - um in North Dakota
10:30 - so both of you have been long time
10:33 - supporters of computer science and what
10:37 - I'd like to know and I'm sure the folks
10:40 - sitting out in the audience would like
10:41 - to know are what are some of the most
10:43 - effective things that you would
10:45 - recommend State leaders can do to
10:48 - promote computer science especially as
10:50 - you think about how do you work with
10:52 - districts provide incentives to them Etc
10:54 - what are your thoughts on it
10:57 - thank you um first thank you for those
10:59 - kind words um Bob thank you for
11:01 - facilitating this and a thank you to
11:03 - code.org for convening this and bringing
11:05 - us all together and and consistently
11:07 - having this very important conversation
11:09 - among all stakeholders so I appreciate
11:11 - that
11:12 - um as I was thinking about this as this
11:14 - question uh what what can what did we do
11:17 - what did I do as a leader I think
11:21 - um I think the answers as I was going
11:23 - through I like to do things in three so
11:24 - there's three pieces of advice and this
11:26 - is not just to us as State Chiefs I
11:29 - think this holds true for any leader if
11:31 - you are a leader out there if you're a
11:33 - district leader if you're a building
11:34 - leader if if you are a division leader a
11:37 - department leader I think the first
11:39 - thing that you should do is use your
11:41 - voice use your voice to lift up to
11:44 - communicate to educate develop that
11:47 - 30-second elevator speech
11:49 - tailor that 32nd elevator speech to the
11:52 - passions and the motivations to the
11:54 - audience that you're speaking to and
11:56 - make sure that you're doing that often
11:58 - and with passion
12:00 - so using your voice is one thing you the
12:03 - second thing is use the authority that
12:04 - you already have there are all sorts of
12:07 - barriers out there that that could exist
12:11 - to getting in the way of progressing and
12:13 - making gains on these issues but each of
12:15 - us has as leaders have the authority and
12:18 - that's one of the first things that we
12:19 - did in North Dakota as we looked at the
12:21 - nine policies that were recommended by
12:23 - code.org which one of those needed
12:27 - needed action by someone outside of our
12:30 - department we set those aside a little
12:31 - bit and then we worked on the ones that
12:34 - did not need action outside of our
12:36 - agency outside of our Authority and we
12:38 - made those changes all of those changes
12:40 - that were within our Authority First the
12:43 - final thing that I would say is don't go
12:46 - this alone
12:47 - find Partners we would not have been
12:50 - able to accomplish what we've
12:51 - accomplished so far in in both the the
12:54 - momentum and the actual policy change
12:57 - without code.org and other partners with
13:00 - partners partners within our state other
13:02 - state agencies Commerce Arc I.T again
13:06 - code.org was with us every step of the
13:08 - way and I can't be more grateful I can't
13:10 - say enough words of gratitude to them
13:11 - for that but don't try and do this alone
13:14 - find those partners that share the
13:15 - intersections of need within your within
13:19 - your your ecosystem and lean on them and
13:23 - share the challenges and the credit when
13:25 - you are triumphant Jillian well that was
13:29 - a wonderful answer superintendent so I'd
13:32 - love to just say ditto but I better add
13:34 - a couple more things
13:35 - um to that and I I think I'll just start
13:37 - with this
13:39 - um you know as as State Chiefs we have
13:41 - so many opportunities to get out and
13:42 - about in classrooms and um when you see
13:45 - great computer science instruction
13:47 - happening at any grad level you know
13:49 - right away I think one of the most
13:52 - compelling cases for computer science or
13:55 - one of the most compelling examples of
13:57 - computer science is when an elementary
13:59 - teacher is teaching algorithmic thinking
14:02 - unplugged and um
14:05 - so one of the I I guess maybe pieces of
14:10 - advice that I have is that if you have
14:12 - reluctant computer science stakeholders
14:15 - take them to a classroom and it's one
14:19 - thing to go to a high school classroom
14:20 - where kids are working on apps or like
14:22 - literally working on computers it's
14:25 - quite another to see a grid drawn on a
14:28 - kindergarten floor and students figuring
14:30 - out with each other or solo how to move
14:33 - from one side of the grid to the other
14:35 - and that's coding and so recognizing
14:38 - that coding is happening in classrooms
14:40 - every single day and as state leaders
14:43 - really being able to label that as such
14:45 - like like being a profit for that saying
14:47 - no no coding is happening computer
14:50 - science is happening in our classrooms
14:52 - right now with or without but then the
14:54 - next step and maybe the deeper step is
14:57 - what Kirsten said recognizing the
14:59 - partners that you need to bring you
15:01 - along to help codify that with the nine
15:03 - policy areas with standard words with
15:06 - professional development and daily
15:09 - practice in the classroom and the
15:11 - partners are are in all shapes and sizes
15:14 - Kirsten named them all and I have to say
15:17 - that you know every other content area
15:19 - is kind of plug and play we know how to
15:21 - do for example standards for reading and
15:25 - language arts not so much with computer
15:27 - science and so we have to tap into some
15:30 - Partnerships that maybe we have not
15:32 - historically had code.org has been a
15:35 - huge partner with us and when Sean first
15:38 - came to Wyoming where I was a state
15:40 - chief before Virginia
15:42 - we had a conversation you're not a
15:45 - lobbyist you're not a vendor you're a
15:49 - partner you're a thought partner you are
15:51 - an implementation partner in fact
15:54 - code.org and Sean in particular
15:57 - was the first person from out of state
15:59 - that we ever put on a committee to help
16:01 - us develop our standards in Wyoming for
16:04 - computer science That's How Deep The
16:07 - Partnerships need to run with higher
16:08 - education with business and industry
16:10 - with school school districts with
16:13 - legislators and with others and then
16:16 - finally I would just um I would I would
16:18 - just add that um I think a lot of us
16:21 - have have maybe tried some initiatives
16:23 - but haven't quite nailed them and it's
16:26 - important as state leaders and as school
16:28 - district leaders that we are really
16:30 - thinking about the infrastructure with a
16:33 - computer science plan and and with with
16:37 - what the long-term goals are around
16:40 - computer science and uh you know
16:43 - sometimes that's a little bit of an
16:44 - afterthought for us as Leaders because
16:46 - there's a lot of Glitz and glamor in
16:48 - computer science that's easy to distract
16:50 - us from what we need to do as Leaders
16:53 - which is building that core building
16:55 - that infrastructure
16:57 - all right well thank you thank you both
16:58 - so definitely make sure you have
17:01 - infrastructure but don't build it alone
17:02 - look for some help uh and some Partners
17:05 - out there well you know I've been in a
17:07 - room with all these leaders earlier
17:09 - today and I can tell you
17:11 - um they're very supportive set of
17:12 - colleagues they share ideas best
17:15 - practices they want to help each other
17:16 - uh but I know you all like to compete
17:18 - against each other right
17:20 - um and and so
17:22 - um what I'd like to ask
17:24 - um Tiffany is what's one thing that
17:28 - you've done really well in South Dakota
17:31 - that you'd like to brag about
17:33 - here in front of your colleagues in this
17:36 - fine audience that we have I'm happy to
17:39 - take you up on that offer I
17:42 - I think the biggest thing that we've
17:43 - done is think big and then build the
17:45 - education system around it to support
17:47 - students in a big pathway so I'll take
17:50 - you back to April of 2019 my first day
17:52 - on the job with Governor gnome we jumped
17:55 - across the state to Madison South Dakota
17:56 - where Dakota State University is and had
17:59 - a conversation with President Jose Marie
18:01 - Griffis and she laid out for us her
18:03 - vision for a brand new industry in the
18:06 - state cyber security it was a great day
18:08 - thinking really really big about what
18:10 - can we do to build a whole new industry
18:12 - in the state
18:14 - and I'll fast forward you now to March
18:16 - of 2020 this last March Governor gnome
18:18 - signed a 90 million dollar package
18:20 - public private partnership to start a
18:24 - new industry so that 90 million dollars
18:26 - is going to build a research lab for
18:28 - cyber security in South Dakota it's
18:30 - doubling the size of our cyber security
18:32 - programs at the college level and it's
18:35 - making dual credit computer science
18:37 - coursework available in every High
18:39 - School across the state so through this
18:42 - dual credit program isn't that awesome
18:44 - yeah it's so exciting
18:47 - through this dual credit program we're
18:49 - calling it the governor's cyber Security
18:51 - Academy
18:52 - not only are high school students
18:54 - learning directly from
18:56 - world-renowned College faculty in
18:59 - computer science they're getting peer
19:01 - mentorship from college students who are
19:03 - in computer science classes so they've
19:05 - got that support network as they're
19:07 - taking these challenging courses and
19:09 - we're building a digital simulation lab
19:12 - so that students are building skills in
19:14 - safe environments through their learning
19:16 - so super excited that this investment is
19:20 - helping us go big and then on the other
19:23 - end of this system we're pairing that
19:25 - with initiatives in K5 stem education
19:27 - heavy and computer science computer
19:30 - science standards professional
19:31 - development certification for our K-12
19:33 - teachers to make sure from the earliest
19:35 - days a kindergarten student has the
19:37 - opportunity to be aware of and build an
19:40 - engagement with computer science so very
19:42 - excited to go big and build the
19:44 - infrastructure around the whole system
19:46 - oh thank you I thought things are a
19:48 - little quiet out in South Dakota but you
19:49 - guys are busy
19:51 - all right
19:52 - um well you know there's a I think
19:54 - there's at least five states who have
19:56 - made computer science a graduation
19:58 - requirement
19:59 - um South Carolina has certainly done
20:01 - this for a number of years they've been
20:04 - kind of leader on that front it
20:06 - certainly one of the Hallmarks of
20:08 - maturity and making some really great
20:10 - progress at a state level to move on
20:13 - computer science forward so I'd like to
20:16 - ask Molly you know what have you kind of
20:19 - learned during that time and what and
20:20 - specifically what type of outcomes have
20:23 - you achieved in South Carolina after
20:25 - having moved and been doing this work
20:28 - for so long thanks Bob and I give a big
20:31 - shout out to the team from South
20:32 - Carolina who has had great vision
20:34 - actually I was around in 2005 not in
20:39 - this job but serving as a lobbyist at
20:42 - the Department of Education and even a
20:44 - few years before that when we began
20:45 - began the effort it was through the
20:47 - education Economic Development Donna you
20:50 - mentioned that earlier today and we've
20:52 - come an awful long way our outcomes are
20:55 - students learning and being engaged in
20:59 - computer science one of our outcomes
21:02 - that we're most proud of if you saw in
21:04 - the report today we have solved the
21:06 - gender gap all of our girls our girls
21:09 - take the courses they're involved their
21:10 - stem programs all across the state and
21:13 - we are so thrilled and proud of that I
21:16 - think I was inspired Monday that was
21:20 - only two days ago but we had our
21:22 - computer science Summit in Greenville
21:24 - South Carolina governor Hutchinson came
21:26 - over from Arkansas and our governor was
21:27 - there with us the hit of the day though
21:30 - were the four students who were on the
21:32 - stage and South Carolina is a state of
21:36 - really two South Carolina's very fluent
21:39 - fast-growing world-class schools
21:41 - world-class industry from all around the
21:43 - world and then there's rural South
21:45 - Carolina with little industry and lots
21:48 - of poverty
21:50 - but to be able to see that those four
21:53 - students on the stage represented both
21:56 - sides of South Carolina
21:57 - and they represented students who were
22:00 - so excited and engaged
22:03 - and I really think we've saved students
22:07 - we've saved lives and definitely changed
22:10 - lives because we require this and
22:13 - because we're making the access we're
22:15 - making it available to every child in
22:18 - South Carolina no matter where they live
22:19 - and that's the most important thing some
22:22 - students come running to participate
22:24 - because their parents can tell them
22:26 - about the opportunities and they know
22:29 - why this is a good thing for them to be
22:31 - involved with
22:32 - other students need us to like that
22:35 - spark
22:36 - and that's the most important thing but
22:38 - to see those young men and women who
22:42 - quite honestly
22:43 - um most of them have never traveled
22:45 - outside the state maybe not even outside
22:47 - their County to talk about that they
22:50 - want to go to MIT
22:52 - or they went to a program at the
22:53 - University of Texas I'm trying to I now
22:56 - I was worried about that on the way home
22:57 - we don't need them leaving the state
23:00 - kind of upset about that but um
23:04 - to see how engaged they were and that in
23:07 - our small rural state that we have
23:09 - required this opportunity and giving the
23:12 - access now we've got a ways to go and
23:15 - working even harder
23:17 - but we're committed to that and code.org
23:20 - has held our hand all the way through
23:22 - and we appreciate that but we've got
23:24 - more to do but it is really seeing the
23:27 - greatest thrilled is seeing the students
23:29 - and the possibilities that they have now
23:32 - for their Futures uh thank you Molly
23:34 - just a great man so you know sometimes
23:37 - when we do this work we're always trying
23:40 - to find data points and measures of how
23:43 - it's going but you know ultimately it's
23:46 - about how this impacts human lives and
23:50 - the stories around that and so we always
23:52 - need to keep that in mind so thank you
23:55 - Molly for uh reminding us of of that
23:59 - um you know we Arkansas and Nevada have
24:02 - also have graduation requirements and
24:05 - they've also implemented nine the nine
24:08 - recommended policies out there as well
24:10 - so I'd like to pitch it to
24:13 - um Johnny and Joan and ask them you know
24:17 - what's next for you and and how will you
24:20 - continue to measure success in your
24:22 - States maybe we'll start with Johnny key
24:25 - from Arkansas
24:26 - thank you Bob uh you know that's a great
24:29 - question and that's a question that
24:30 - probably many of my colleagues up here
24:32 - ask our seniors every year when we meet
24:36 - a senior student we say what's next you
24:38 - know I used to say where are you going
24:39 - to college and you know now I just say
24:42 - what's next because there are so many
24:43 - different avenues for students to pursue
24:47 - post-secondary and that's one one of the
24:49 - things we need to do in Arkansas now
24:51 - that we have that graduation requirement
24:53 - like okay I graduated I've done this I'm
24:57 - very interested in it and maybe I've
24:58 - even gone so far as to get some type of
25:02 - certification some proficiency some
25:04 - skills that I can demonstrate what do I
25:07 - do with it now what do we do to create
25:09 - those Pathways so we are working to take
25:13 - those next steps working with higher
25:15 - education working with industry we have
25:17 - a pretty robust defense industry sector
25:20 - in our state looking for opportunities
25:23 - to connect
25:25 - students to those Pathways you may have
25:28 - heard of Walmart that's that's in
25:31 - Arkansas and we know that Walmart has
25:33 - you know thousands of open I.T data jobs
25:38 - every year that they can't fill they
25:41 - can't fill them from anywhere
25:43 - and I was a couple weeks ago I was in
25:46 - Bentonville spoke with a group of
25:47 - students and they were describing their
25:49 - work-based learning opportunities that
25:52 - they have with Walmart
25:54 - one of the areas we need to improve is
25:57 - making those opportunities available not
25:58 - just for the students in Bentonville but
26:01 - opportunities for the the typically
26:04 - underrepresented students all over the
26:06 - state to give the balance with the girls
26:09 - that are interested in that as well to
26:12 - find those work based opportunities at
26:16 - work based learning in areas across the
26:19 - state so that that our momentum doesn't
26:22 - stop that it just it keeps going we keep
26:24 - building on what we've we've learned and
26:27 - we keep stealing great ideas from other
26:29 - states and Implement those
26:34 - no competition there at all we keep uh
26:36 - We've we brought our flags to this
26:39 - conference by the way if you haven't
26:41 - seen Nevada's Flags they are up in the
26:43 - front table here battleborn I'm very
26:46 - fortunate that we also have 14 people
26:49 - from Nevada here at this conference
26:51 - that's how invested we are in this work
26:54 - one of them is our vice president of our
26:57 - state board of education Mark Newburn
27:00 - Mark there you go what's really nice yes
27:03 - please give them a round of applause
27:08 - this is um the work and my colleagues
27:11 - talked about human capital right we talk
27:13 - about computer science and some people
27:14 - like oh computer science it must be you
27:16 - know something behind the curtain but it
27:18 - really is it's about people and and who
27:22 - we are and and where we're going into
27:24 - the future and so I'm very honored that
27:27 - Mark uh led the work in our state to
27:30 - make sure that all nine policies were
27:33 - adopted with our legislature it was not
27:36 - an easy lift but it was very intentional
27:38 - and also he is a computer scientist
27:42 - himself
27:43 - right so leveraging intellectual Capital
27:47 - that is there to make sure that it
27:49 - happens so we have as a state all nine
27:51 - policies in place as well as the
27:53 - graduation requirements for us now those
27:56 - policies are there but what is happening
27:58 - with our students in the classroom we're
28:02 - digging deep with our team that is here
28:04 - making sure that from pre-k all the way
28:08 - through 12 and then out the door onto
28:11 - higher ed post-secondary work that our
28:15 - students that it is deep work that is
28:18 - happening in the classrooms so policy as
28:22 - we said great it's in place but is it
28:25 - happening in the classroom and what does
28:27 - it look like I really loved when Jillian
28:29 - said making sure you're bringing people
28:31 - in the into the classroom as well
28:33 - our next phase is actually and I know
28:36 - many of you I lean on my colleagues who
28:39 - have had I think Virginia is on version
28:40 - 4.0 of profile of a learner and when we
28:46 - are going to move forward in that work
28:49 - it is bringing our students to the table
28:54 - bringing our business partners to the
28:57 - table and building it from the ground up
29:00 - and we know that computer science will
29:04 - be a major component of that work as we
29:09 - move forward so building up we had a
29:12 - conversation earlier about what
29:14 - assessments would look like in the
29:15 - future when you think about how computer
29:17 - science and all of that work can move it
29:21 - forward there is such great
29:22 - opportunities at this moment in time and
29:25 - in Nevada we're hoping that you'll lead
29:27 - with us and partner with us to that next
29:30 - generation of not just saying computer
29:32 - science being added into or on top of
29:35 - but developing from the ground up and
29:38 - leading to where we're going as a nation
29:41 - and thanks Joe and I that's a a great
29:44 - reminder of a way to integrate this
29:47 - um into everyone's thinking and envision
29:49 - of what we want for our children is as
29:52 - you develop things like profile of a
29:54 - learner profile of a graduate
29:56 - um that really can help really set the
29:58 - stage and it's a great way to have a
30:00 - broad community and Statewide
30:02 - conversations around this topic Dr Grant
30:07 - um you know congratulations on your
30:09 - start as a bowl leader in DC and I know
30:12 - there's one thing that you can certainly
30:14 - brag about and that is that DC has the
30:18 - highest percentage of female students
30:20 - taking advanced placement computer
30:21 - science in the nation at 36 percent
30:29 - but we know that's not the end right
30:31 - there's always something to work on
30:33 - um and there are still some disparities
30:35 - in participation in computer science as
30:37 - they continue
30:39 - um so uh what are you thinking about
30:41 - doing to increase uh the number of
30:43 - historically underrepresented
30:46 - um students enrolling in computer
30:47 - science courses Dr Grant thanks Bob um
30:50 - we are competitive but I do want to
30:53 - extend a thanks to code.org and all of
30:55 - you for bringing us together uh it is
30:58 - always a joy to be with our colleagues
31:00 - uh you can imagine that we don't see
31:02 - each other too often and today has been
31:04 - a great day of learning and excited to
31:07 - tell you so much about what we've done
31:09 - but really inspired in taking copious
31:12 - notes on all the work we have to do to
31:14 - push the work forward and I would say in
31:16 - DC this morning you got an opportunity
31:18 - to hear about one school digital
31:20 - Pioneers Academy where Michelle has told
31:23 - you that we are going to significantly
31:24 - increase the amount of students and
31:26 - particularly our young women who are
31:28 - taking Advan chance placement courses
31:30 - but the big question we're asking
31:32 - ourselves in Washington DC is how do we
31:34 - reimagine high schools that are designed
31:36 - around where children are and where they
31:38 - need to be as it relates to having
31:41 - access to high-wage high earning jobs
31:43 - and being residents that could be viable
31:46 - part part of our economic recovery and
31:50 - so a lot of our investments uh to the
31:52 - tune of 30 million dollars this year 35
31:55 - million dollars next year have been
31:57 - around what we're calling reimagining
31:59 - high schools and so I've been told I
32:02 - only have two minutes and so I'm going
32:04 - to respect the time but one example we
32:07 - launched this summer and I think it's
32:09 - important to note one as we talk to our
32:12 - Educators our principals we have endured
32:17 - unbelievable realities over the last set
32:20 - of years it is called the historic once
32:22 - in a lifetime event for a reason yet and
32:25 - still we drew a line in the sand and
32:27 - said we know that our children need to
32:29 - have access to Computer Science
32:31 - Education and be on Pathway to earn
32:34 - credentials in cyber security I.T
32:37 - ensuring as Michelle said that our
32:39 - students have access to the computer
32:41 - science education but they are also
32:43 - College and Career ready and so this
32:45 - summer last month we launched our
32:47 - Advanced Technical Center and the
32:49 - advanced Technical Center is a Twist on
32:51 - what we used to think about when we talk
32:54 - about Career and Technical education and
32:56 - so we are moving in directions of not
32:58 - opening new schools but opening new
33:00 - places that regardless of governance
33:02 - structures so we have half of our
33:04 - children in traditional Public Schools
33:06 - the other half of our children are in
33:08 - public charter schools regardless of
33:10 - where a child goes to school they can
33:11 - have access to the ATC and what that
33:14 - looks like is we've partnered with our
33:15 - higher University Partners this year we
33:18 - launched on Trinity University's campus
33:20 - with 150 Scholars who are on path to
33:23 - take career computer science coursework
33:26 - and be on a path to earn credentialing
33:28 - in cyber security and I.T while they're
33:31 - still in high school and so these
33:33 - students are probably in school right
33:35 - now
33:36 - having access to coursework on a
33:39 - computer on a college campus earning
33:41 - their credits and then we are providing
33:44 - resources to ensure that if those
33:45 - students graduate and want to remain a
33:48 - student at Trinity they could actually
33:49 - continue their education and so that's
33:52 - one example of a through line to how
33:55 - we're rethinking Computer Science
33:56 - Education and I'll tell you this was a
34:00 - conversation we had had earlier there
34:02 - was so much you know it's so hard to
34:05 - think about something new as we navigate
34:08 - all the twists and turns and I think
34:11 - it's been said over and over again our
34:13 - Target enrollment number for this fall
34:16 - was 50 students
34:17 - and we stood up the program our
34:20 - University president was delighted to to
34:22 - host our children on their campus we had
34:25 - 130 children enroll all across DC
34:29 - showing up in a wide array of uniforms
34:31 - before the school year started so we
34:34 - launched this program before the actual
34:36 - first day of school and all we did was
34:38 - provide the children with transportation
34:40 - and they all showed up and so it was it
34:43 - was a reminder that we are not designing
34:45 - the system for adults
34:47 - we are designing our system for our
34:50 - children and when we do when we have the
34:52 - right designs in place and we have the
34:54 - right offerings children will show up
34:57 - and exceed our expectations and so we've
34:59 - already blown our Target for FY 23 and
35:02 - 24 and that tells us our children are
35:05 - ready to embrace the future and we
35:08 - cannot be the barriers to their own
35:10 - success because in fact they will be
35:12 - taking care of us all one day we have to
35:15 - make sure we get that right
35:16 - thank you Dr Grant
35:19 - um just a a great example
35:22 - um kind of reminds me of this truism I
35:25 - have which is uh Talent is equally
35:27 - distributed but opportunity not so much
35:31 - right and so by doing what you've just
35:33 - described it's a way to create those
35:36 - opportunities for our students because
35:39 - we know if we give them those chances
35:40 - they will they will be able to succeed
35:43 - you know Alabama and New Jersey Jersey
35:48 - have also well they've implemented seven
35:51 - of the nine policies recommended by
35:54 - co.org and so I'd like to ask our folks
35:58 - from Alabama and New Jersey you know
36:00 - what are some of the key lessons uh that
36:03 - they've learned for that so Eric Mackey
36:05 - and Dr Angelica Allen McMillan I'll have
36:09 - you take the last well I guess next to
36:12 - our last question here so I saw Angelica
36:14 - when did you start wonderful well thank
36:17 - you again to code.org and to to all of
36:20 - you for being with us today as far as
36:23 - Lessons Learned I I am so pleased to
36:26 - share our success in taking off from the
36:30 - runway that we began Paving the road on
36:34 - from 2018
36:35 - with the formulation of our computer
36:39 - science Advisory Board we brought
36:41 - together those who are willing those who
36:43 - were interested and those who were able
36:45 - and from their work you year later we
36:48 - were able to produce a document
36:50 - that allows us to now in 2022 have
36:55 - computer science standards implemented
36:59 - in grades K through 12. and that was a
37:02 - long journey that took the corralling of
37:06 - many entities but I want to acknowledge
37:08 - our state board of education for
37:11 - honoring the work set forward by
37:13 - Governor Murphy when you think about
37:15 - advancing a new initiative I go back to
37:18 - my days as a classroom teacher there's
37:19 - always so much on the plate and here
37:21 - comes another great idea but I don't
37:24 - have room for it and so the
37:26 - Administration has worked diligently to
37:29 - remove obsolete items from the plate so
37:33 - that we have room for our new items but
37:35 - that was just the beginning we've worked
37:38 - with our regulatory officers to ensure
37:41 - that we are able to uh codify the needed
37:47 - licensure requirements for computer
37:49 - science teachers so we started and said
37:52 - hey
37:52 - superintendents if you have a teacher
37:54 - who is interested and meets your
37:56 - standards offer a course in computer
37:58 - science because we did not want to limit
38:01 - the possibilities and looking at us
38:03 - today we are scheduled for a May 2023
38:08 - rollout of the certification at the high
38:11 - school level as well as some
38:13 - endorsements for the elementary level
38:16 - our agency has also supported computer
38:19 - science initiatives with two million
38:21 - dollars since 2018 in the annual budget
38:25 - and so that has helped us to partner
38:27 - with institutions of higher education to
38:30 - form computer hubs and to date we've had
38:33 - approximately 700 Educators take courses
38:37 - at these hubs so we see that the
38:39 - teachers are interested we know that the
38:41 - students are willing but I have to
38:43 - acknowledge my team we have Daryl here
38:46 - who has served since its Inception of
38:49 - the on The Advisory Board since 2018 and
38:52 - we have Gilbert Gonzalez sitting here
38:53 - cheering me on the front row as our uh
38:56 - director of The Office of innovation and
38:58 - why am I raising their names because we
39:00 - work to identify the names of the
39:03 - teachers of the students and we are
39:06 - Guided by the work of a teacher who said
39:08 - I'm I have this drive but my
39:11 - administrator won't let me do this and
39:14 - and and and we need your help State
39:16 - Department of Education what can you do
39:17 - and now we can say we have answered the
39:20 - call by providing the standards that now
39:23 - clear the path forward for you to be
39:25 - Innovative in your classroom thank you
39:27 - thank you all right we'll move from the
39:29 - Garden State over to Eric
39:31 - to be last
39:33 - there's everything all so much good
39:36 - stuff's been said already but uh when
39:37 - you talk about Lessons Learned like
39:39 - Angelica said we we've learned how to
39:42 - push things forward and I would say one
39:44 - of the biggest lessons we learned was
39:46 - build a good team and build a team
39:48 - that's horizontal and vertical so part
39:50 - of my team are here I've got a couple of
39:52 - people from our department who are
39:53 - wonderful that work in Career Tech and
39:55 - in certification with us today but we
39:59 - also have a big non-profit in the state
40:02 - that does a lot of teacher education
40:03 - we've got a couple of those folks here
40:05 - with us today we identified a legislator
40:08 - early on when we passed the legislation
40:11 - who is not a computer science person
40:13 - somebody had a computer science person
40:15 - is there a policy maker iris is a lawyer
40:18 - but he really bought into the importance
40:20 - of teaching computer science and he owns
40:23 - that topic and every year he calls me
40:25 - and he says Eric do we are we getting
40:27 - enough for my project is there enough
40:29 - money in the budget do we need to do
40:31 - anything else do we need to tweet the
40:34 - law so we built this team of policy
40:37 - makers legislators our governor has has
40:39 - really been out front taking the lead on
40:42 - it our state school board but then we
40:44 - had to build this vertical team too
40:46 - because as we all know you can do all
40:48 - the state policies and everything can
40:50 - look really good and you have a lot of
40:51 - press conferences but if the districts
40:53 - don't buy into it and the School
40:55 - principles I and the teachers then it
40:58 - never happens and that's where we again
41:00 - built this really good team of going out
41:02 - into our schools and training people and
41:04 - getting people to buy into
41:05 - what we were trying to do to achieve and
41:09 - now we've achieved all nine of the
41:11 - code.org policy goals and and we feel
41:13 - good about where we're going we don't
41:15 - have everything in place we want more
41:18 - students participating we want to make
41:20 - sure that we're reaching our rural
41:22 - communities where they have fewer
41:23 - resources and and we don't want to leave
41:26 - them behind we want everybody to to
41:28 - catch this wave and move forward because
41:30 - as we all know this is um it is the
41:33 - future has already been set out here and
41:35 - you know everybody here I know has had
41:38 - to build that team and the folks who are
41:40 - here are parts of those teams because
41:42 - they they they believe it or they
41:44 - wouldn't be here
41:45 - well thank you I I know it's uh toward
41:49 - the end of the day here and we've got
41:51 - our our reception and cocktail coming up
41:54 - soon uh but I'd like you all to think
41:57 - about this you've got over 40
42:00 - um you know District leaders here I
42:03 - think there's over 60 uh Regional
42:05 - organizations as well so these are your
42:08 - folks right so if you could in just a
42:11 - few words like one sentence each of you
42:13 - just go around and just leave them with
42:17 - an inspirational message to inspire them
42:19 - to continue to do this work amidst all
42:22 - the other challenges and everything they
42:24 - have what would you say to them we'll
42:26 - start in the back and work our way all
42:29 - the way back around to Dr Grant so I
42:33 - would say that in the history of mankind
42:36 - there's always been times where someone
42:39 - decided what was important to teach
42:41 - their kids their young people
42:44 - and at some point in the history of this
42:46 - nation we decided that four years of
42:48 - English and four years of math and three
42:50 - years of science all of those things
42:52 - were important this is the time that we
42:55 - as a society Society need to decide
42:57 - computer science needs to join all the
43:01 - rest of those subjects as a necessity
43:03 - for our students
43:08 - please
43:10 - yeah absolutely and and everybody in
43:12 - this room is a believer in this topic
43:14 - that's why we're all here that's why you
43:16 - took time out of your schedule to be
43:17 - here when we run into to people who
43:20 - doubt or who have excuses are really
43:22 - good reasons why we shouldn't do it I
43:25 - think the answer has to be yes but we
43:28 - are going to do it so let's get beyond
43:30 - that
43:34 - and I would say take the risk be
43:37 - pre-forgiven to get out there and try
43:39 - and keep it as real and authentic as
43:41 - possible embed this work in real
43:43 - authentic project-based learning
43:48 - I think sometimes when we're faced with
43:51 - newness we just need permission to go
43:53 - forward and do great things so if you
43:55 - need permission today to run solid with
43:58 - Computer Science Education at whatever
44:00 - grade level you've got my permission you
44:02 - can talk to these folks later about what
44:04 - that means in your state but absolutely
44:06 - have permission to go forward and do
44:08 - great things
44:12 - I would just say as someone who grew up
44:16 - in the rural area go forth do great
44:18 - things and don't forget all the students
44:21 - all across your state because they
44:23 - deserve the opportunity too everyone
44:25 - deserves the opportunity
44:28 - [Applause]
44:30 - uh thank you I say break a lot of glass
44:33 - and then spend time cleaning it up and
44:35 - break more glass and just enjoy that
44:37 - process that's what this is all about
44:42 - I would just say I want to start with
44:44 - gratitude I always try to start with
44:45 - gratitude um thank you for all that the
44:47 - work has been that you've already done I
44:50 - would say I know that we're tired we can
44:53 - recognize that we're tired but so it's
44:56 - it's easy to just you know shut your
44:58 - door and do the work alone but I would
45:00 - say to remind everybody that you can go
45:02 - you can probably go swiftly alone but
45:06 - you'll go further together and my
45:09 - favorite Latin saying is this and I'm
45:10 - not going to attempt to say it in Latin
45:12 - but it is it translates into success is
45:15 - sweeter with difficulty so
45:18 - [Applause]
45:22 - I think I'm going to be the teacher's
45:23 - pet but whenever there is a barrier
45:27 - I I honestly I can't tell you the number
45:29 - of times that I've read hottie's
45:32 - biography and how he came to America and
45:36 - how he learned to code and there are
45:38 - stories like that all over so think
45:41 - about hottie's story when there's a
45:43 - barrier that's too difficult to overcome
45:45 - and then find those same stories and in
45:48 - your in your state and community
45:51 - thank you
45:53 - being a chief sometimes you feel you're
45:56 - alone and so I want you all to know that
46:00 - you are not alone I am not alone I have
46:03 - my colleagues here on this stage You Are
46:05 - Not Alone we are in this together we
46:08 - will lift each other up be bold be brave
46:12 - stay focused on the children and enjoy
46:15 - each and every moment as we all continue
46:18 - to move forward together
46:23 - now I just want to say uh thank you I
46:25 - think you know the issues of aspiration
46:28 - um really come down to having Role
46:29 - Models working with kids every single
46:31 - day so thank you for all of you work
46:33 - with kids with computer science not only
46:35 - sharing your skills but also your
46:37 - excitement and the fun of computer
46:38 - science it's really appreciated
46:42 - [Applause]
46:44 - pressure
46:48 - so you got some time to think about it a
46:50 - little bit I did uh no I think a couple
46:51 - of things you know as we were as we
46:53 - hopefully are moving away from the
46:56 - realities of the pandemic it is just
46:58 - true and noted that computer science
47:00 - saved us all so when we think about what
47:03 - we've all experienced technology is what
47:05 - got us to this place and it would be I
47:09 - think we all use the adage of never
47:11 - wasting a crisis we learned so much in
47:14 - the last three years that really does
47:16 - set the foundation for why all of us
47:18 - wherever we are in our journey are
47:20 - aligned on the importance of computer
47:21 - science education instruction and
47:24 - preparedness so that when the next thing
47:26 - comes we'll be further along in terms of
47:28 - how we respond and that's directly
47:30 - connected to the education of our
47:32 - children a fun fact is that mache has
47:35 - known me since I was a first year
47:36 - teacher and so I am going to end my
47:40 - thoughts with what she shared which is
47:42 - computer science for all for real it's a
47:45 - critical Equity conversation we ground
47:48 - equity and in lots of different ways but
47:51 - Equity is directly connected to access
47:53 - and you've heard every single person on
47:55 - this stage talk about how Urban rural
47:59 - north south east west if we can ensure
48:01 - that our children have access to
48:04 - Computer Science Education and that they
48:06 - are credentialed they will be ready for
48:08 - any challenge that they face as citizens
48:11 - of this United States of America and
48:13 - that's how we should ground ourselves as
48:15 - we think about what we're learning today
48:16 - and how we take that back into our
48:19 - communities
48:20 - well thank you
48:23 - well thank you all and I'll just throw a
48:27 - final thought in there I mean when you
48:29 - think about all of the systems that you
48:32 - all represent and the millions of
48:35 - students uh that you can uh impact
48:39 - um if you can't do it there's no one
48:41 - else to get it done the last thing I'll
48:44 - say to you is that yes this work is hard
48:46 - you've got your own personal challenges
48:49 - that you're dealing with but I always
48:51 - tell folks that even on your worst day
48:54 - you're going to be some kids best hope
48:56 - and that should keep you all going so
48:59 - thank you all and thank you to everyone
49:00 - for being here
49:03 - foreign

Cleaned transcript:

to close us out for the day we have this absolutely phenomenal panel of State leaders to share some insights with us and this is really a big deal this is a first for Cs edcon and probably a first for CS education to have this many state leaders talking together about Computer Science Education is absolutely thrilling and I'm so glad that you all will be here for it so I'm going to start by introducing each of our panelists so when I say your name just give a quick wave to the audience and folks will save our Applause until all of them have been introduced uh so first I want to mention a couple State Chiefs who were meant to be here but couldn't uh be here for this this panel secretary Manny Diaz from Florida was here earlier today for a conversation unfortunately had to go to a prior commitment for this afternoon and Dr Penny Schwinn from Tennessee also wasn't able to be here but I'd plan to be here and uh you will see her on the slide so she is unfortunately not here all right so here we have uh Dr Angelica Allen McMillan of New Jersey superintendent Kirsten Basler of North Dakota superintendent Jillian Balo of Virginia superintendent Joan Ebert from Nevada Dr Daniel French of Vermont Dr Christina Grant from DC superintendent Johnny key from Arkansas Dr Eric Mackey from Alabama commissioner Pender Macon from Maine secretary Tiffany Sanderson from South Dakota and superintendent Molly Spearman from South Carolina give him a warm welcome and I want to introduce you to one more person Bob renssey Bob is the interim leader of chiefs for change he's also a code.org board member and the former superintendent of Broward County Public Schools which was one of the first school districts to partner with code.org to bring computer science to all of its students so Bob you want to come up here all right let's welcome Bob all right Katie thank you so much and hey welcome everyone uh before I get started I definitely gotta give a shout out to some of the Broward peeps in here in particular uh Lisa milankovic and the Educators who have worked so hard to really expand uh computer science uh education in Broward County I know uh when I started there a little over a decade ago I think we had a few hundred students engaged in computer science and I know when I left just a few months ago we were well over 50 000 students engaged so just a huge credit and uh please give those folks a round of applause please I also want to mention um cheese for change I'm just so proud to be working with that organization it's a bipartisan network of State Chiefs and District leaders there's over 50 of them and we tend to describe them as bold leaders that are focused on real change in their systems and we work diligently to support them through our technical assistance work where we raise millions of dollars to go into those systems and help them deal with some of their biggest challenges and priorities we also have a future cheese program which is a leadership development program 18 months folks go through that and then we help get them placed in a system and then Provide support to them and we also do advocacy work on the hill and work with Folks at the White House as well in the Department of Education a couple of the members a couple of the State Chiefs here today are members and Dr Christina Grant and Penny Schwinn Penny's not here today but we are really thrilled to have them as part of that amazing network of leaders so today we have a few questions for this amazing group here I think just looking at everyone here you can see that computer science clearly isn't a political issue or partisan issue it's an education issue it really is something that we can all focus on and get behind and do what's right for our kids we have a series of questions and we want to make sure we hear from each and every one of these amazing leaders and we will try to keep the answers short around a couple minutes but we'll try to go through this uh the best we can so the first question I like to put on a table is we know education leaders across the country I have been facing a variety of issues in fact I think we've had a historic high in turnover and vacancy rates um so with all this going on and the challenges that we have I want to ask a couple of you why is it important to you to keep computer science top of mind and an education priority in the systems that you lead and I will ask our leader from Maine in Vermont I guess we'll go up to the New England region for this one and I'll start with um Pender Megan Let's uh what are your thoughts on that question it's on um well you know I didn't want to take Dan's talking points on this one but um we of course want to have our students in Maine and Across the Nation to have every competitive opportunity in the increasingly global competitive environment that they are facing when they leave school additionally we want our students to uh to have those critical thinking skills and the um the Curiosity the iterative design and all of those other types of skills that students gain when they are involved in computer science um I would say above all there is the sense that they would face the inevitable challenges in computer science and in in creating programs that will do and change what is happening right in front of their eyes that Fosters a sense of optimism and creativity when they face challenges throughout their lives and so it's a great way to have students lean into agency and creativity and finally I guess I would say that in a world that is increasingly nebulous when it comes to truth and where much of the truth that we all absorb or think that we are hearing is provided to us through technology permeating every aspect of Our Lives our students need to understand the principles and the processes that underlie that which is presented to us all where we are getting the information that creates the notion of of truth I think that is one of the most critical pieces they we need them to understand all of that deeply all right thank you Pender ain't that the truth all right Dr French what would you like to add to that yeah she uh she said it all pretty much uh but I would say um yeah I would agree uh and we do work closely together Maine and Vermont um I think demographically we're two of the oldest States from a population perspective um and I would agree our education systems uh are very similar heavily local control and we've certainly had our challenges so the results of the pandemic but I would also say that I think there's a lot of opportunity and as in particular I think there's opportunity around the system probably being more open for structural change than it ever has been so I think it's important particularly with computer science as we've seen today with a conference there's a lot of consensus there's a lot of urgency there's a lot of collaboration happening computer science can really help Advance those structural changes now to make our education system more responsive to the personal learning needs of students some of those structures we've discussed today such as curriculum standards licensing standards graduation requirements those structural things have been slow to change and computer science sits at the Nexus of a lot of those issues in its own right it's an academic discipline to a certain extent it's a creative art um but it does call into question I think in a positive way uh some of our more rigid categorizations of the academic structures in K12 education I think computer science is also important to shine a light on some of the opportunity gaps and what I think we notice in rural parts of Northern New England what I won't call aspiration gaps but aspirational limitations I think we all saw when our systems literally pivoted overnight to remote learning the equity gaps that are out there they existed prior to the pandemic but what we increasingly notice I think in our rural States and this is probably true in any student population that feels disenfranchised or disconnected to our modern economy our students don't often have a sense of the possibilities of the future and I think computer science today can really serve an important inspiration function for them um I think too many of our students are passive consumers of technology and computer science can provide them the tools to empower them to we'd say a Northern New England look under the hood or maybe Tinker I don't know if you're familiar with tinkering that's a Northern New England phenomena I certainly wouldn't advocate for tinkering as a graduation standard but I think we could certainly harness the energy or behind tinkering and wrap some formality and make computer science the new tinkering to empower our students to create Better Lives themselves their families and their communities thank you um so uh the next one I'll have for um Kirsten and Jillian you guys are sitting right next to each other so that'll work um and uh Kirsten I I think I'm correct you're going to be the incoming president of the national um State superintendent Association so congratulations to you on that um you can find a better person to do that you've had a really great track record um in North Dakota so both of you have been long time supporters of computer science and what I'd like to know and I'm sure the folks sitting out in the audience would like to know are what are some of the most effective things that you would recommend State leaders can do to promote computer science especially as you think about how do you work with districts provide incentives to them Etc what are your thoughts on it thank you um first thank you for those kind words um Bob thank you for facilitating this and a thank you to code.org for convening this and bringing us all together and and consistently having this very important conversation among all stakeholders so I appreciate that um as I was thinking about this as this question uh what what can what did we do what did I do as a leader I think um I think the answers as I was going through I like to do things in three so there's three pieces of advice and this is not just to us as State Chiefs I think this holds true for any leader if you are a leader out there if you're a district leader if you're a building leader if if you are a division leader a department leader I think the first thing that you should do is use your voice use your voice to lift up to communicate to educate develop that 30second elevator speech tailor that 32nd elevator speech to the passions and the motivations to the audience that you're speaking to and make sure that you're doing that often and with passion so using your voice is one thing you the second thing is use the authority that you already have there are all sorts of barriers out there that that could exist to getting in the way of progressing and making gains on these issues but each of us has as leaders have the authority and that's one of the first things that we did in North Dakota as we looked at the nine policies that were recommended by code.org which one of those needed needed action by someone outside of our department we set those aside a little bit and then we worked on the ones that did not need action outside of our agency outside of our Authority and we made those changes all of those changes that were within our Authority First the final thing that I would say is don't go this alone find Partners we would not have been able to accomplish what we've accomplished so far in in both the the momentum and the actual policy change without code.org and other partners with partners partners within our state other state agencies Commerce Arc I.T again code.org was with us every step of the way and I can't be more grateful I can't say enough words of gratitude to them for that but don't try and do this alone find those partners that share the intersections of need within your within your your ecosystem and lean on them and share the challenges and the credit when you are triumphant Jillian well that was a wonderful answer superintendent so I'd love to just say ditto but I better add a couple more things um to that and I I think I'll just start with this um you know as as State Chiefs we have so many opportunities to get out and about in classrooms and um when you see great computer science instruction happening at any grad level you know right away I think one of the most compelling cases for computer science or one of the most compelling examples of computer science is when an elementary teacher is teaching algorithmic thinking unplugged and um so one of the I I guess maybe pieces of advice that I have is that if you have reluctant computer science stakeholders take them to a classroom and it's one thing to go to a high school classroom where kids are working on apps or like literally working on computers it's quite another to see a grid drawn on a kindergarten floor and students figuring out with each other or solo how to move from one side of the grid to the other and that's coding and so recognizing that coding is happening in classrooms every single day and as state leaders really being able to label that as such like like being a profit for that saying no no coding is happening computer science is happening in our classrooms right now with or without but then the next step and maybe the deeper step is what Kirsten said recognizing the partners that you need to bring you along to help codify that with the nine policy areas with standard words with professional development and daily practice in the classroom and the partners are are in all shapes and sizes Kirsten named them all and I have to say that you know every other content area is kind of plug and play we know how to do for example standards for reading and language arts not so much with computer science and so we have to tap into some Partnerships that maybe we have not historically had code.org has been a huge partner with us and when Sean first came to Wyoming where I was a state chief before Virginia we had a conversation you're not a lobbyist you're not a vendor you're a partner you're a thought partner you are an implementation partner in fact code.org and Sean in particular was the first person from out of state that we ever put on a committee to help us develop our standards in Wyoming for computer science That's How Deep The Partnerships need to run with higher education with business and industry with school school districts with legislators and with others and then finally I would just um I would I would just add that um I think a lot of us have have maybe tried some initiatives but haven't quite nailed them and it's important as state leaders and as school district leaders that we are really thinking about the infrastructure with a computer science plan and and with with what the longterm goals are around computer science and uh you know sometimes that's a little bit of an afterthought for us as Leaders because there's a lot of Glitz and glamor in computer science that's easy to distract us from what we need to do as Leaders which is building that core building that infrastructure all right well thank you thank you both so definitely make sure you have infrastructure but don't build it alone look for some help uh and some Partners out there well you know I've been in a room with all these leaders earlier today and I can tell you um they're very supportive set of colleagues they share ideas best practices they want to help each other uh but I know you all like to compete against each other right um and and so um what I'd like to ask um Tiffany is what's one thing that you've done really well in South Dakota that you'd like to brag about here in front of your colleagues in this fine audience that we have I'm happy to take you up on that offer I I think the biggest thing that we've done is think big and then build the education system around it to support students in a big pathway so I'll take you back to April of 2019 my first day on the job with Governor gnome we jumped across the state to Madison South Dakota where Dakota State University is and had a conversation with President Jose Marie Griffis and she laid out for us her vision for a brand new industry in the state cyber security it was a great day thinking really really big about what can we do to build a whole new industry in the state and I'll fast forward you now to March of 2020 this last March Governor gnome signed a 90 million dollar package public private partnership to start a new industry so that 90 million dollars is going to build a research lab for cyber security in South Dakota it's doubling the size of our cyber security programs at the college level and it's making dual credit computer science coursework available in every High School across the state so through this dual credit program isn't that awesome yeah it's so exciting through this dual credit program we're calling it the governor's cyber Security Academy not only are high school students learning directly from worldrenowned College faculty in computer science they're getting peer mentorship from college students who are in computer science classes so they've got that support network as they're taking these challenging courses and we're building a digital simulation lab so that students are building skills in safe environments through their learning so super excited that this investment is helping us go big and then on the other end of this system we're pairing that with initiatives in K5 stem education heavy and computer science computer science standards professional development certification for our K12 teachers to make sure from the earliest days a kindergarten student has the opportunity to be aware of and build an engagement with computer science so very excited to go big and build the infrastructure around the whole system oh thank you I thought things are a little quiet out in South Dakota but you guys are busy all right um well you know there's a I think there's at least five states who have made computer science a graduation requirement um South Carolina has certainly done this for a number of years they've been kind of leader on that front it certainly one of the Hallmarks of maturity and making some really great progress at a state level to move on computer science forward so I'd like to ask Molly you know what have you kind of learned during that time and what and specifically what type of outcomes have you achieved in South Carolina after having moved and been doing this work for so long thanks Bob and I give a big shout out to the team from South Carolina who has had great vision actually I was around in 2005 not in this job but serving as a lobbyist at the Department of Education and even a few years before that when we began began the effort it was through the education Economic Development Donna you mentioned that earlier today and we've come an awful long way our outcomes are students learning and being engaged in computer science one of our outcomes that we're most proud of if you saw in the report today we have solved the gender gap all of our girls our girls take the courses they're involved their stem programs all across the state and we are so thrilled and proud of that I think I was inspired Monday that was only two days ago but we had our computer science Summit in Greenville South Carolina governor Hutchinson came over from Arkansas and our governor was there with us the hit of the day though were the four students who were on the stage and South Carolina is a state of really two South Carolina's very fluent fastgrowing worldclass schools worldclass industry from all around the world and then there's rural South Carolina with little industry and lots of poverty but to be able to see that those four students on the stage represented both sides of South Carolina and they represented students who were so excited and engaged and I really think we've saved students we've saved lives and definitely changed lives because we require this and because we're making the access we're making it available to every child in South Carolina no matter where they live and that's the most important thing some students come running to participate because their parents can tell them about the opportunities and they know why this is a good thing for them to be involved with other students need us to like that spark and that's the most important thing but to see those young men and women who quite honestly um most of them have never traveled outside the state maybe not even outside their County to talk about that they want to go to MIT or they went to a program at the University of Texas I'm trying to I now I was worried about that on the way home we don't need them leaving the state kind of upset about that but um to see how engaged they were and that in our small rural state that we have required this opportunity and giving the access now we've got a ways to go and working even harder but we're committed to that and code.org has held our hand all the way through and we appreciate that but we've got more to do but it is really seeing the greatest thrilled is seeing the students and the possibilities that they have now for their Futures uh thank you Molly just a great man so you know sometimes when we do this work we're always trying to find data points and measures of how it's going but you know ultimately it's about how this impacts human lives and the stories around that and so we always need to keep that in mind so thank you Molly for uh reminding us of of that um you know we Arkansas and Nevada have also have graduation requirements and they've also implemented nine the nine recommended policies out there as well so I'd like to pitch it to um Johnny and Joan and ask them you know what's next for you and and how will you continue to measure success in your States maybe we'll start with Johnny key from Arkansas thank you Bob uh you know that's a great question and that's a question that probably many of my colleagues up here ask our seniors every year when we meet a senior student we say what's next you know I used to say where are you going to college and you know now I just say what's next because there are so many different avenues for students to pursue postsecondary and that's one one of the things we need to do in Arkansas now that we have that graduation requirement like okay I graduated I've done this I'm very interested in it and maybe I've even gone so far as to get some type of certification some proficiency some skills that I can demonstrate what do I do with it now what do we do to create those Pathways so we are working to take those next steps working with higher education working with industry we have a pretty robust defense industry sector in our state looking for opportunities to connect students to those Pathways you may have heard of Walmart that's that's in Arkansas and we know that Walmart has you know thousands of open I.T data jobs every year that they can't fill they can't fill them from anywhere and I was a couple weeks ago I was in Bentonville spoke with a group of students and they were describing their workbased learning opportunities that they have with Walmart one of the areas we need to improve is making those opportunities available not just for the students in Bentonville but opportunities for the the typically underrepresented students all over the state to give the balance with the girls that are interested in that as well to find those work based opportunities at work based learning in areas across the state so that that our momentum doesn't stop that it just it keeps going we keep building on what we've we've learned and we keep stealing great ideas from other states and Implement those no competition there at all we keep uh We've we brought our flags to this conference by the way if you haven't seen Nevada's Flags they are up in the front table here battleborn I'm very fortunate that we also have 14 people from Nevada here at this conference that's how invested we are in this work one of them is our vice president of our state board of education Mark Newburn Mark there you go what's really nice yes please give them a round of applause this is um the work and my colleagues talked about human capital right we talk about computer science and some people like oh computer science it must be you know something behind the curtain but it really is it's about people and and who we are and and where we're going into the future and so I'm very honored that Mark uh led the work in our state to make sure that all nine policies were adopted with our legislature it was not an easy lift but it was very intentional and also he is a computer scientist himself right so leveraging intellectual Capital that is there to make sure that it happens so we have as a state all nine policies in place as well as the graduation requirements for us now those policies are there but what is happening with our students in the classroom we're digging deep with our team that is here making sure that from prek all the way through 12 and then out the door onto higher ed postsecondary work that our students that it is deep work that is happening in the classrooms so policy as we said great it's in place but is it happening in the classroom and what does it look like I really loved when Jillian said making sure you're bringing people in the into the classroom as well our next phase is actually and I know many of you I lean on my colleagues who have had I think Virginia is on version 4.0 of profile of a learner and when we are going to move forward in that work it is bringing our students to the table bringing our business partners to the table and building it from the ground up and we know that computer science will be a major component of that work as we move forward so building up we had a conversation earlier about what assessments would look like in the future when you think about how computer science and all of that work can move it forward there is such great opportunities at this moment in time and in Nevada we're hoping that you'll lead with us and partner with us to that next generation of not just saying computer science being added into or on top of but developing from the ground up and leading to where we're going as a nation and thanks Joe and I that's a a great reminder of a way to integrate this um into everyone's thinking and envision of what we want for our children is as you develop things like profile of a learner profile of a graduate um that really can help really set the stage and it's a great way to have a broad community and Statewide conversations around this topic Dr Grant um you know congratulations on your start as a bowl leader in DC and I know there's one thing that you can certainly brag about and that is that DC has the highest percentage of female students taking advanced placement computer science in the nation at 36 percent but we know that's not the end right there's always something to work on um and there are still some disparities in participation in computer science as they continue um so uh what are you thinking about doing to increase uh the number of historically underrepresented um students enrolling in computer science courses Dr Grant thanks Bob um we are competitive but I do want to extend a thanks to code.org and all of you for bringing us together uh it is always a joy to be with our colleagues uh you can imagine that we don't see each other too often and today has been a great day of learning and excited to tell you so much about what we've done but really inspired in taking copious notes on all the work we have to do to push the work forward and I would say in DC this morning you got an opportunity to hear about one school digital Pioneers Academy where Michelle has told you that we are going to significantly increase the amount of students and particularly our young women who are taking Advan chance placement courses but the big question we're asking ourselves in Washington DC is how do we reimagine high schools that are designed around where children are and where they need to be as it relates to having access to highwage high earning jobs and being residents that could be viable part part of our economic recovery and so a lot of our investments uh to the tune of 30 million dollars this year 35 million dollars next year have been around what we're calling reimagining high schools and so I've been told I only have two minutes and so I'm going to respect the time but one example we launched this summer and I think it's important to note one as we talk to our Educators our principals we have endured unbelievable realities over the last set of years it is called the historic once in a lifetime event for a reason yet and still we drew a line in the sand and said we know that our children need to have access to Computer Science Education and be on Pathway to earn credentials in cyber security I.T ensuring as Michelle said that our students have access to the computer science education but they are also College and Career ready and so this summer last month we launched our Advanced Technical Center and the advanced Technical Center is a Twist on what we used to think about when we talk about Career and Technical education and so we are moving in directions of not opening new schools but opening new places that regardless of governance structures so we have half of our children in traditional Public Schools the other half of our children are in public charter schools regardless of where a child goes to school they can have access to the ATC and what that looks like is we've partnered with our higher University Partners this year we launched on Trinity University's campus with 150 Scholars who are on path to take career computer science coursework and be on a path to earn credentialing in cyber security and I.T while they're still in high school and so these students are probably in school right now having access to coursework on a computer on a college campus earning their credits and then we are providing resources to ensure that if those students graduate and want to remain a student at Trinity they could actually continue their education and so that's one example of a through line to how we're rethinking Computer Science Education and I'll tell you this was a conversation we had had earlier there was so much you know it's so hard to think about something new as we navigate all the twists and turns and I think it's been said over and over again our Target enrollment number for this fall was 50 students and we stood up the program our University president was delighted to to host our children on their campus we had 130 children enroll all across DC showing up in a wide array of uniforms before the school year started so we launched this program before the actual first day of school and all we did was provide the children with transportation and they all showed up and so it was it was a reminder that we are not designing the system for adults we are designing our system for our children and when we do when we have the right designs in place and we have the right offerings children will show up and exceed our expectations and so we've already blown our Target for FY 23 and 24 and that tells us our children are ready to embrace the future and we cannot be the barriers to their own success because in fact they will be taking care of us all one day we have to make sure we get that right thank you Dr Grant um just a a great example um kind of reminds me of this truism I have which is uh Talent is equally distributed but opportunity not so much right and so by doing what you've just described it's a way to create those opportunities for our students because we know if we give them those chances they will they will be able to succeed you know Alabama and New Jersey Jersey have also well they've implemented seven of the nine policies recommended by co.org and so I'd like to ask our folks from Alabama and New Jersey you know what are some of the key lessons uh that they've learned for that so Eric Mackey and Dr Angelica Allen McMillan I'll have you take the last well I guess next to our last question here so I saw Angelica when did you start wonderful well thank you again to code.org and to to all of you for being with us today as far as Lessons Learned I I am so pleased to share our success in taking off from the runway that we began Paving the road on from 2018 with the formulation of our computer science Advisory Board we brought together those who are willing those who were interested and those who were able and from their work you year later we were able to produce a document that allows us to now in 2022 have computer science standards implemented in grades K through 12. and that was a long journey that took the corralling of many entities but I want to acknowledge our state board of education for honoring the work set forward by Governor Murphy when you think about advancing a new initiative I go back to my days as a classroom teacher there's always so much on the plate and here comes another great idea but I don't have room for it and so the Administration has worked diligently to remove obsolete items from the plate so that we have room for our new items but that was just the beginning we've worked with our regulatory officers to ensure that we are able to uh codify the needed licensure requirements for computer science teachers so we started and said hey superintendents if you have a teacher who is interested and meets your standards offer a course in computer science because we did not want to limit the possibilities and looking at us today we are scheduled for a May 2023 rollout of the certification at the high school level as well as some endorsements for the elementary level our agency has also supported computer science initiatives with two million dollars since 2018 in the annual budget and so that has helped us to partner with institutions of higher education to form computer hubs and to date we've had approximately 700 Educators take courses at these hubs so we see that the teachers are interested we know that the students are willing but I have to acknowledge my team we have Daryl here who has served since its Inception of the on The Advisory Board since 2018 and we have Gilbert Gonzalez sitting here cheering me on the front row as our uh director of The Office of innovation and why am I raising their names because we work to identify the names of the teachers of the students and we are Guided by the work of a teacher who said I'm I have this drive but my administrator won't let me do this and and and and we need your help State Department of Education what can you do and now we can say we have answered the call by providing the standards that now clear the path forward for you to be Innovative in your classroom thank you thank you all right we'll move from the Garden State over to Eric to be last there's everything all so much good stuff's been said already but uh when you talk about Lessons Learned like Angelica said we we've learned how to push things forward and I would say one of the biggest lessons we learned was build a good team and build a team that's horizontal and vertical so part of my team are here I've got a couple of people from our department who are wonderful that work in Career Tech and in certification with us today but we also have a big nonprofit in the state that does a lot of teacher education we've got a couple of those folks here with us today we identified a legislator early on when we passed the legislation who is not a computer science person somebody had a computer science person is there a policy maker iris is a lawyer but he really bought into the importance of teaching computer science and he owns that topic and every year he calls me and he says Eric do we are we getting enough for my project is there enough money in the budget do we need to do anything else do we need to tweet the law so we built this team of policy makers legislators our governor has has really been out front taking the lead on it our state school board but then we had to build this vertical team too because as we all know you can do all the state policies and everything can look really good and you have a lot of press conferences but if the districts don't buy into it and the School principles I and the teachers then it never happens and that's where we again built this really good team of going out into our schools and training people and getting people to buy into what we were trying to do to achieve and now we've achieved all nine of the code.org policy goals and and we feel good about where we're going we don't have everything in place we want more students participating we want to make sure that we're reaching our rural communities where they have fewer resources and and we don't want to leave them behind we want everybody to to catch this wave and move forward because as we all know this is um it is the future has already been set out here and you know everybody here I know has had to build that team and the folks who are here are parts of those teams because they they they believe it or they wouldn't be here well thank you I I know it's uh toward the end of the day here and we've got our our reception and cocktail coming up soon uh but I'd like you all to think about this you've got over 40 um you know District leaders here I think there's over 60 uh Regional organizations as well so these are your folks right so if you could in just a few words like one sentence each of you just go around and just leave them with an inspirational message to inspire them to continue to do this work amidst all the other challenges and everything they have what would you say to them we'll start in the back and work our way all the way back around to Dr Grant so I would say that in the history of mankind there's always been times where someone decided what was important to teach their kids their young people and at some point in the history of this nation we decided that four years of English and four years of math and three years of science all of those things were important this is the time that we as a society Society need to decide computer science needs to join all the rest of those subjects as a necessity for our students please yeah absolutely and and everybody in this room is a believer in this topic that's why we're all here that's why you took time out of your schedule to be here when we run into to people who doubt or who have excuses are really good reasons why we shouldn't do it I think the answer has to be yes but we are going to do it so let's get beyond that and I would say take the risk be preforgiven to get out there and try and keep it as real and authentic as possible embed this work in real authentic projectbased learning I think sometimes when we're faced with newness we just need permission to go forward and do great things so if you need permission today to run solid with Computer Science Education at whatever grade level you've got my permission you can talk to these folks later about what that means in your state but absolutely have permission to go forward and do great things I would just say as someone who grew up in the rural area go forth do great things and don't forget all the students all across your state because they deserve the opportunity too everyone deserves the opportunity uh thank you I say break a lot of glass and then spend time cleaning it up and break more glass and just enjoy that process that's what this is all about I would just say I want to start with gratitude I always try to start with gratitude um thank you for all that the work has been that you've already done I would say I know that we're tired we can recognize that we're tired but so it's it's easy to just you know shut your door and do the work alone but I would say to remind everybody that you can go you can probably go swiftly alone but you'll go further together and my favorite Latin saying is this and I'm not going to attempt to say it in Latin but it is it translates into success is sweeter with difficulty so I think I'm going to be the teacher's pet but whenever there is a barrier I I honestly I can't tell you the number of times that I've read hottie's biography and how he came to America and how he learned to code and there are stories like that all over so think about hottie's story when there's a barrier that's too difficult to overcome and then find those same stories and in your in your state and community thank you being a chief sometimes you feel you're alone and so I want you all to know that you are not alone I am not alone I have my colleagues here on this stage You Are Not Alone we are in this together we will lift each other up be bold be brave stay focused on the children and enjoy each and every moment as we all continue to move forward together now I just want to say uh thank you I think you know the issues of aspiration um really come down to having Role Models working with kids every single day so thank you for all of you work with kids with computer science not only sharing your skills but also your excitement and the fun of computer science it's really appreciated pressure so you got some time to think about it a little bit I did uh no I think a couple of things you know as we were as we hopefully are moving away from the realities of the pandemic it is just true and noted that computer science saved us all so when we think about what we've all experienced technology is what got us to this place and it would be I think we all use the adage of never wasting a crisis we learned so much in the last three years that really does set the foundation for why all of us wherever we are in our journey are aligned on the importance of computer science education instruction and preparedness so that when the next thing comes we'll be further along in terms of how we respond and that's directly connected to the education of our children a fun fact is that mache has known me since I was a first year teacher and so I am going to end my thoughts with what she shared which is computer science for all for real it's a critical Equity conversation we ground equity and in lots of different ways but Equity is directly connected to access and you've heard every single person on this stage talk about how Urban rural north south east west if we can ensure that our children have access to Computer Science Education and that they are credentialed they will be ready for any challenge that they face as citizens of this United States of America and that's how we should ground ourselves as we think about what we're learning today and how we take that back into our communities well thank you well thank you all and I'll just throw a final thought in there I mean when you think about all of the systems that you all represent and the millions of students uh that you can uh impact um if you can't do it there's no one else to get it done the last thing I'll say to you is that yes this work is hard you've got your own personal challenges that you're dealing with but I always tell folks that even on your worst day you're going to be some kids best hope and that should keep you all going so thank you all and thank you to everyone for being here foreign
