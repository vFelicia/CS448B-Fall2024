00:02 - here we are 2012 we all depend on
00:06 - technology and none of us know how to
00:08 - read and write code it's not this kind
00:11 - of geeky techy thing what you're doing
00:14 - is empowering yourself it's like a
00:16 - puzzle and if you like Puzzles and
00:18 - challenges you're going to love coding
00:20 - it's absolutely indispensable to so many
00:23 - of the things we're trying to do today
00:24 - whether you want to be the Prime
00:25 - Minister a vet or a social worker
00:28 - technology is going to underpin all of
00:31 - those
00:33 - jobs The Internet Is Now everywhere it's
00:36 - like water it's
00:37 - Transforming Our World in 20 years
00:40 - shapes are countries shapes are kind of
00:42 - social dynamics uh can innovate so much
00:45 - and so if you have that toolkit it means
00:47 - you have a lot of power to kind of come
00:48 - up with crazy ideas and make them real I
00:50 - got my first computer when I was in
00:52 - sixth grade I had a a
00:55 - zx81 personal computer I coded because I
00:58 - didn't just want to use the program I
01:00 - wanted to start writing them that's why
01:02 - I wrote a program to play tic tac toe
01:05 - you start small building something that
01:07 - you're interested in and you just learn
01:09 - these lessons and there aren't that many
01:10 - of them and you you just eventually can
01:12 - get to the point where you can do almost
01:13 - anything that you want you're able to
01:15 - launch something you know create it and
01:18 - deliver it across the world in in in no
01:20 - time at all it just unlocks all these
01:22 - all these different possibilities if you
01:24 - can code you can take the ideas in your
01:26 - head and make them happen so you can not
01:28 - just play Angry birds you can actually
01:30 - make your own Angry Birds or you can
01:32 - make visual effects in a film or you can
01:35 - design a jet propulsion engine it's all
01:37 - about possibilities and if you want to
01:40 - change the world technology is the best
01:42 - way great coders are to these
01:46 - we that's
01:50 - [Music]
01:58 - it
