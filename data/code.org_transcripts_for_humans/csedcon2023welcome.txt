00:00 - hi everyone and welcome to code.org
00:02 - Global Computer Science Education
00:04 - conference I am so happy that we're all
00:07 - in this space together to share our
00:08 - knowledge to network and to discuss
00:11 - making Computer Science Education more
00:13 - accessible to students around the world
00:16 - my name is Le Olan Bowen and I the
00:18 - Strategic Partnerships manager for
00:19 - code.org I am also your host for this
00:22 - session if this is your first time here
00:24 - you're in for a treat ask anyone who has
00:27 - attended before and they'll tell you
00:29 - that CS just keeps getting better and
00:31 - better every year and this year is no
00:33 - different now before I get into the
00:36 - who's in the room and what you can
00:37 - expect from csad con I want to share a
00:40 - story about two very important students
00:42 - to me their experience with computer
00:45 - science and while your work in computer
00:47 - science education is so
00:50 - important so this is high school leolin
00:54 - after attending a private elementary
00:56 - school and one of the top high schools
00:57 - in the country she was accepted to the
00:59 - the University of Illinois in Urbana
01:02 - champagne now her mother being the very
01:04 - smart woman that she is suggested that
01:06 - she major in computers because they seem
01:09 - like they're going to become a big
01:11 - thing now teenage leolin replied in a
01:14 - way that only teenagers can with a hand
01:17 - on her hip and an eye roll that said
01:20 - Mom that is not for me that is only for
01:23 - white
01:25 - boys so fast forward to when I become a
01:28 - mom I still don't know too much about
01:30 - Computer Science Education but like my
01:32 - mom I can see how technology continues
01:35 - to shape our future in our culture but I
01:38 - decided to start my CS education
01:40 - campaign a little bit earlier with my
01:42 - son so as early as I could I got him
01:45 - into stem programs because I did what I
01:48 - didn't want was for him to grow up and
01:50 - miss out on an amazing field because he
01:52 - like Teenage lolan didn't see himself in
01:55 - it you see Teenage lolan wasn't inverse
01:57 - to computer science because she thought
01:59 - she wasn't good at math or wasn't good
02:01 - at science or even that she didn't see
02:03 - how important technology was it was
02:05 - solely based on whatever messages she
02:07 - received up until that time that told
02:09 - her this ain't for
02:12 - you although I put my son into steam at
02:14 - 5 it was a people in this room that
02:16 - really helped me focus on my son's
02:19 - education for example he already had
02:21 - some familiarity with co.org in fact
02:24 - when I applied for my job at code.org
02:26 - about 5 years ago and I was like son I'm
02:29 - you know applying for this job at this
02:30 - organization called code.org he says Oh
02:33 - you mean the hour of
02:34 - code my kiddo who is now in eighth grade
02:38 - is taking algebra one because of what I
02:40 - learned from Carol Fletcher who's in
02:41 - this room um and the team at E3 Alliance
02:45 - um from the University of Texas Austin
02:47 - in a study they conducted titled Algebra
02:49 - 1 before high school is a gatekeeper to
02:51 - computer science participation and they
02:54 - found that Black and hispan Hispanic
02:55 - students my son happens to be both
02:58 - regardless of family income enrolled in
03:00 - Algebra 1 in 8th grade at rates
03:02 - substantially lower to their white and
03:04 - Asian counterparts in Texas now this is
03:07 - a major issue because their results show
03:09 - that students who took Algebra 1 before
03:11 - high school had double the odds of being
03:13 - enrolled in a computer science course so
03:16 - this is only one story about someone in
03:18 - this room who has had a positive
03:21 - far-reaching effect in computer science
03:23 - education so I encourage you to connect
03:25 - to share your stories with other folks
03:28 - in this room because you have no idea a
03:30 - how far your fet could have as
03:33 - well so who else is in this room where
03:35 - it happens the crcs atcon well we have
03:39 - over 400
03:40 - participants um this
03:42 - year they come from there are 60 leaders
03:45 - from 17 countries we have 42 States
03:49 - represented including DC we have 25
03:52 - people from this wonderful state of
03:54 - Nevada
03:58 - alone and then we have over 230 CEOs
04:02 - directors VPS principes superintendents
04:05 - SCA and Lea staff researchers nonprofits
04:09 - and Industry reps in this room this
04:11 - year so what will you learn at csdc con
04:14 - this year of course we're going to talk
04:17 - about recruiting Ur GS to
04:19 - CS we're going to be talking about how
04:21 - AI is affecting the future of Education
04:24 - work and computer
04:25 - science and we're going to be talking
04:27 - about how states are implementing the
04:29 - computer science Grant requirements and
04:31 - of course more engaging
04:33 - topics but we are especially excited to
04:36 - announce the release of the seventh
04:38 - state of Computer Science Education
04:40 - report co-authored by code.org csca and
04:43 - esep I see some of you all already have
04:45 - it in your hands right now so it's great
04:47 - a little taste of what's included this
04:48 - year is that
04:50 - 57.5% of high schools offer computer
04:52 - science in the US so make sure you if
04:55 - you haven't already pick up your copy at
04:56 - the registration table and then on
04:58 - Friday we'll go through a report
04:59 - together in more detail in the meantime
05:02 - I have a couple of slides of QR codes if
05:03 - you want to get your phone out um we
05:05 - have a pdf version of the report online
05:07 - at advocacy. co.org or you can scan the
05:10 - QR code right here on our site we have
05:12 - handouts for all 50 states and DC with
05:14 - additional information to access
05:16 - information about computer science in
05:18 - your
05:21 - state we also love for you to help us
05:24 - promote this report if you follow this
05:26 - QR code it'll take you to code.org
05:29 - social media post about the state ex CS
05:32 - so please spread the word by liking and
05:34 - sharing the post as well we much
05:35 - appreciate
05:37 - it now I mentioned before that what
05:41 - makes CS edcon special is that it's a
05:43 - global Computer Science Education
05:45 - conference in this room are people from
05:48 - around the world who are looking to
05:49 - expand computer science to their

hi everyone and welcome to code.org Global Computer Science Education conference I am so happy that we're all in this space together to share our knowledge to network and to discuss making Computer Science Education more accessible to students around the world my name is Le Olan Bowen and I the Strategic Partnerships manager for code.org I am also your host for this session if this is your first time here you're in for a treat ask anyone who has attended before and they'll tell you that CS just keeps getting better and better every year and this year is no different now before I get into the who's in the room and what you can expect from csad con I want to share a story about two very important students to me their experience with computer science and while your work in computer science education is so important so this is high school leolin after attending a private elementary school and one of the top high schools in the country she was accepted to the the University of Illinois in Urbana champagne now her mother being the very smart woman that she is suggested that she major in computers because they seem like they're going to become a big thing now teenage leolin replied in a way that only teenagers can with a hand on her hip and an eye roll that said Mom that is not for me that is only for white boys so fast forward to when I become a mom I still don't know too much about Computer Science Education but like my mom I can see how technology continues to shape our future in our culture but I decided to start my CS education campaign a little bit earlier with my son so as early as I could I got him into stem programs because I did what I didn't want was for him to grow up and miss out on an amazing field because he like Teenage lolan didn't see himself in it you see Teenage lolan wasn't inverse to computer science because she thought she wasn't good at math or wasn't good at science or even that she didn't see how important technology was it was solely based on whatever messages she received up until that time that told her this ain't for you although I put my son into steam at 5 it was a people in this room that really helped me focus on my son's education for example he already had some familiarity with co.org in fact when I applied for my job at code.org about 5 years ago and I was like son I'm you know applying for this job at this organization called code.org he says Oh you mean the hour of code my kiddo who is now in eighth grade is taking algebra one because of what I learned from Carol Fletcher who's in this room um and the team at E3 Alliance um from the University of Texas Austin in a study they conducted titled Algebra 1 before high school is a gatekeeper to computer science participation and they found that Black and hispan Hispanic students my son happens to be both regardless of family income enrolled in Algebra 1 in 8th grade at rates substantially lower to their white and Asian counterparts in Texas now this is a major issue because their results show that students who took Algebra 1 before high school had double the odds of being enrolled in a computer science course so this is only one story about someone in this room who has had a positive farreaching effect in computer science education so I encourage you to connect to share your stories with other folks in this room because you have no idea a how far your fet could have as well so who else is in this room where it happens the crcs atcon well we have over 400 participants um this year they come from there are 60 leaders from 17 countries we have 42 States represented including DC we have 25 people from this wonderful state of Nevada alone and then we have over 230 CEOs directors VPS principes superintendents SCA and Lea staff researchers nonprofits and Industry reps in this room this year so what will you learn at csdc con this year of course we're going to talk about recruiting Ur GS to CS we're going to be talking about how AI is
