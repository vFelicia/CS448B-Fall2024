00:09 - usually a teacher will read that big
00:11 - math problem in the beginning of the
00:12 - lesson and think that their students
00:14 - aren't quite ready for it and it's true
00:16 - they're not quite ready that's why you
00:18 - need to take that big complicated
00:20 - problem and break it up into smaller
00:22 - pieces
00:23 - by giving them the power to do it on
00:24 - their own it'll teach them how capable
00:27 - they are of solving things that they
00:29 - would have otherwise thought are just
00:30 - too hard
00:35 - okay
00:36 - so has anybody ever had a problem
00:39 - that is so big
00:41 - that it seems like you cannot do it by
00:43 - yourself
00:45 - how about
00:47 - cleaning your room
00:49 - right has your mom ever told you to go
00:51 - in and clean your room and you're like
00:54 - oh
00:56 - yeah
00:57 - but what if your mom says hey go in and
01:00 - put your clothes in a pile does that
01:02 - seem so hard
01:03 - or go in and pick up your books is that
01:06 - so hard yes
01:07 - no sometimes i don't even read books
01:13 - but you can get to the exact same place
01:16 - doing little steps at a time right
01:18 - so that's what our lesson is going to be
01:20 - about today we're going to learn
01:22 - about computational thinking
01:25 - so to start out
01:27 - i'm going to ask you
01:29 - to add some numbers in your head you
01:31 - said you all know addition right
01:34 - okay here we go
01:36 - i want you to add
01:39 - the numbers
01:41 - from 1 to 200 in your head ready go
01:45 - you have 30 seconds
01:47 - add all the numbers from 1 to 200 in
01:50 - your head
01:51 - okay go
02:00 - okay is anybody done yet
02:03 - so how far did you get
02:06 - one plus 200 plus 199
02:09 - plus 198
02:12 - okay
02:13 - so not quite all the way
02:15 - was that such a big problem for any of
02:17 - you that you didn't even try
02:19 - no
02:20 - yeah
02:22 - so does anybody think they have the
02:23 - actual answer
02:25 - it was kind of a hard problem huh
02:28 - what we were doing is we were adding one
02:32 - plus two
02:49 - that's what we were trying to do right
02:51 - that's a lot to do in your head isn't it
02:54 - but what if i taught you a trick
02:57 - that helped you do it in your head
03:01 - so the first thing is
03:02 - add the numbers from 1 to 200 all in
03:05 - your head in 30 seconds
03:07 - great
03:08 - that's hard that's a big problem our
03:10 - first step
03:12 - was to take that big problem
03:15 - and break it down into little steps
03:18 - right
03:19 - and then the next thing we can do
03:22 - is we can look for patterns
03:25 - so does anybody see a pattern
03:29 - you guys both do what's the pattern so
03:31 - um
03:33 - um if you add like one plus 200 then
03:36 - you'll get on 201 and then if you keep
03:38 - going like two plus 199 you'll get 201
03:42 - too and then if you have two plus
03:45 - if you have three plus
03:47 - 198 you get 201. does anybody see that
03:51 - pattern
03:52 - yeah
03:53 - so you have
03:55 - 201 201 201
03:58 - how many of these are you going to have
04:02 - um
04:03 - make you've got two hundred and half
04:05 - which is one hundred and then multiply
04:07 - two hundred and one times one hundred
04:09 - can i just tell you
04:11 - that you guys all did that in your head
04:14 - right
04:16 - so what does that equal
04:18 - well
04:27 - thank you
04:28 - so
04:30 - you guys just took a big scary problem
04:34 - you broke it down
04:36 - you found a pattern
04:38 - you put it together into an algorithm
04:41 - that you could solve
04:43 - you did it all in your head
04:45 - and if you were to do this again it
04:47 - would only take you less than 30 seconds
04:49 - i guarantee you
04:52 - these are skills that you guys can
04:53 - actually use on every problem for the
04:55 - entire rest of your life
04:58 - and you're gonna notice if someone hands
04:59 - you a big problem and you go oh wait a
05:02 - week that's a big problem
05:04 - how can i break it up into smaller
05:05 - problems
05:07 - and then solve one at a time until i
05:10 - figure it all out
05:12 - you're going to be the smartest kids in
05:13 - your class
05:14 - you're going to be the smartest people
05:16 - at your workplace you're going to be the
05:18 - smartest bosses that ever ran a company
05:20 - because you'll be unstoppable
05:22 - so
05:23 - we're going to learn how to practice
05:25 - that
05:26 - okay so i'm going to show you how to do
05:28 - this okay
05:30 - so there's three different stories
05:33 - you need to go through the stories
05:36 - and wherever they have the same word in
05:38 - the same place
05:40 - you circle it
05:42 - and wherever the words are different
05:44 - you cross them out or underline them
05:46 - okay
05:47 - and then at the end we're going to write
05:49 - down all the things that are the same
05:52 - and wherever there was something
05:53 - different you're going to have a blank
05:55 - so you're kind of going to make your own
05:56 - almost a mad lib do you guys know what
05:58 - mad libs are
05:59 - yeah okay
06:01 - so go ahead and get started and i'll
06:02 - walk around and help you in case you get
06:04 - stuck
06:11 - there is an obvious pattern and teachers
06:14 - like to make sure that the kids pick up
06:16 - on it but it's enough for the kids to
06:18 - come up with their own thoughts based on
06:20 - the game so if this group comes up with
06:22 - a different game than this group it's
06:25 - perfectly okay just have them explain
06:27 - their reasoning and let them know where
06:29 - they succeeded or where they could use a
06:31 - little help
06:39 - so read it out loud to me
06:42 - i chose a blank and rolled a blank
06:45 - then a blank then a blink that means i
06:48 - need to draw a blank blank on my blank
06:50 - okay
06:51 - so now you have to figure out
06:54 - how to play the game
06:56 - based on what you just wrote
06:58 - so i chose a blank
07:03 - and they said lion donkey and puppy and
07:05 - so i can make them so what do you think
07:07 - is the first thing you need to do
07:11 - i chose a
07:19 - you can choose any of them you want
07:21 - okay
07:22 - so now you know your first step of your
07:23 - game
07:24 - okay
07:25 - and then i rolled a blank a blank and a
07:28 - blank so how many times do you think you
07:30 - have to roll the dice
07:32 - very good so now make up your own rules
07:34 - of the game based off of the
07:35 - instructions
07:43 - so now
07:44 - what we're going to do is we're going to
07:46 - think about the game that we just played
07:50 - you had a big problem
07:52 - you had to figure out how to make
07:53 - directions to this game
07:57 - and you needed to break it down into
07:59 - little bits
08:00 - which you did by having three different
08:02 - stories
08:03 - you had to find patterns
08:06 - and what were the things that were
08:07 - patterns
08:08 - what were those yeah
08:14 - right so there were some things that
08:16 - were the same in every story and you
08:17 - circled them right
08:19 - then we had to use abstraction
08:22 - which was taking out all the details
08:25 - because the things that were different
08:27 - we wanted to just ignore that until we
08:28 - were ready to create our own story so
08:30 - what did we do
08:34 - we crossed it out right
08:37 - and we made an underline there so we
08:40 - ended up with words and underlines that
08:42 - let us make our own story
08:44 - and that became our algorithm for
08:46 - creating rules to our game
08:50 - so this is what we do in computer
08:51 - science all the time
08:53 - we find big problems we pull them apart
08:56 - to see what things are the same and what
08:58 - things are different and then based on
09:00 - what we find out
09:02 - we can create a solution that works for
09:05 - everything

Cleaned transcript:

usually a teacher will read that big math problem in the beginning of the lesson and think that their students aren't quite ready for it and it's true they're not quite ready that's why you need to take that big complicated problem and break it up into smaller pieces by giving them the power to do it on their own it'll teach them how capable they are of solving things that they would have otherwise thought are just too hard okay so has anybody ever had a problem that is so big that it seems like you cannot do it by yourself how about cleaning your room right has your mom ever told you to go in and clean your room and you're like oh yeah but what if your mom says hey go in and put your clothes in a pile does that seem so hard or go in and pick up your books is that so hard yes no sometimes i don't even read books but you can get to the exact same place doing little steps at a time right so that's what our lesson is going to be about today we're going to learn about computational thinking so to start out i'm going to ask you to add some numbers in your head you said you all know addition right okay here we go i want you to add the numbers from 1 to 200 in your head ready go you have 30 seconds add all the numbers from 1 to 200 in your head okay go okay is anybody done yet so how far did you get one plus 200 plus 199 plus 198 okay so not quite all the way was that such a big problem for any of you that you didn't even try no yeah so does anybody think they have the actual answer it was kind of a hard problem huh what we were doing is we were adding one plus two that's what we were trying to do right that's a lot to do in your head isn't it but what if i taught you a trick that helped you do it in your head so the first thing is add the numbers from 1 to 200 all in your head in 30 seconds great that's hard that's a big problem our first step was to take that big problem and break it down into little steps right and then the next thing we can do is we can look for patterns so does anybody see a pattern you guys both do what's the pattern so um um if you add like one plus 200 then you'll get on 201 and then if you keep going like two plus 199 you'll get 201 too and then if you have two plus if you have three plus 198 you get 201. does anybody see that pattern yeah so you have 201 201 201 how many of these are you going to have um make you've got two hundred and half which is one hundred and then multiply two hundred and one times one hundred can i just tell you that you guys all did that in your head right so what does that equal well thank you so you guys just took a big scary problem you broke it down you found a pattern you put it together into an algorithm that you could solve you did it all in your head and if you were to do this again it would only take you less than 30 seconds i guarantee you these are skills that you guys can actually use on every problem for the entire rest of your life and you're gonna notice if someone hands you a big problem and you go oh wait a week that's a big problem how can i break it up into smaller problems and then solve one at a time until i figure it all out you're going to be the smartest kids in your class you're going to be the smartest people at your workplace you're going to be the smartest bosses that ever ran a company because you'll be unstoppable so we're going to

you want okay so now you know your first step of your game okay and then i rolled a blank a blank and a blank so how many times do you think you have to roll the dice very good so now make up your own rules of the game based off of the instructions so now what we're going to do is we're going to think about the game that we just played you had a big problem you had to figure out how to make directions to this game and you needed to break it down into little bits which you did by having three different stories you had to find patterns and what were the things that were patterns what were
