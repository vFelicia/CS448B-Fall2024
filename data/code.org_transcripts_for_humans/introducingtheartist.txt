You wouldn't even qualify for the race
00:03 - if you don't have people that are proficient in
00:06 - computer sciences, because of how much data the cars collect.
00:10 - And the necessity to be able to have people that can write programs
00:14 - that figure out how you can continue to build performance.
00:18 - In these puzzles you will be an artist
00:20 - that uses a pencil to draw different shapes.
00:22 - So where ever your artist goes it will draw a line behind him.
00:25 - To move around the canvas, you'll use the move forward block.
00:29 - Here, the move forward block says, move forward by 100 pixels.
00:34 - When we hit run, what happens?
00:36 - The artist moves forward a certain amount
00:38 - and that amount is 100 pixels.
00:41 - Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your computer screen.
00:47 - The other block we have in this puzzle says,
turn right by ninety degrees.
00:51 - And when we drag that out.
00:53 - That makes our artist turn a certain amount.
00:55 - So you can play around with how far you want the artist to turn.
00:58 - This is a 90 degree turn.
01:02 - And this is a 120 degree turn.
01:04 - And remember you can change these values by clicking on the arrows
01:08 - next to the numbers for pixels and degrees.
01:11 - Enjoy drawing with your artist.

(JR Hildebrand race car driver) You wouldn't even qualify for the race if you don't have people that are proficient in computer sciences, because of how much data the cars collect.

In these puzzles you will be an artist that uses a pencil to draw different shapes. So where ever your artist goes it will draw a line behind him. To move around the canvas, you'll use the move forward block. Here, the move forward block says, move forward by 100 pixels. When we hit run, what happens? The artist moves forward a certain amount and that amount is 100 pixels. Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your computer screen. The other block we have in this puzzle says, turn right by ninety degrees. And when we drag that out. That makes our artist turn a certain amount. So you can play around with how far you want the artist to turn. This is a 90 degree turn. And this is a 120 degree turn.
