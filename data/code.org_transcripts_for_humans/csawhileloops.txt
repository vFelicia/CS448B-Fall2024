00:10 - let's say we're cleaning up and have a
00:12 - stack of plates to put away in our
00:13 - kitchen cabinet as long as there is at
00:15 - least one plate in the stack we have to
00:17 - continue putting plates away
00:19 - we're repeating a task as long as the
00:21 - condition is true
00:23 - we can use a control structure to repeat
00:25 - a task like this
00:27 - a control structure is a condition or
00:29 - iteration statement which affects the
00:31 - flow of a program
00:33 - an if statement is an example of a
00:35 - control structure that checks the
00:36 - condition only once
00:38 - we need to add an iteration statement to
00:40 - check more than once
00:42 - an iteration statement is a control
00:44 - structure that repeatedly executes a
00:47 - block of code
00:48 - java has a few ways we can write an
00:50 - iteration statement
00:52 - one way is using a while loop
00:54 - a while loop is a control structure
00:56 - which executes a block of code
00:58 - repeatedly as long as the condition is
01:00 - true
01:02 - let's use a while loop to put away our
01:03 - stack of plates
01:05 - first we write the keyword while
01:07 - in an open set of parentheses
01:10 - inside the parentheses we will specify
01:12 - the condition
01:13 - let's call a check for plate method as
01:16 - our condition
01:18 - if the condition returns true let's
01:20 - execute some code that puts the plate
01:21 - away for instance put plate away
01:25 - as long as there are plates in the stack
01:27 - the while loop runs again and again and
01:29 - again
01:31 - once there are no more plates in stack
01:34 - check for plate will return false
01:36 - and the program will exit the while loop
01:39 - with while loops we can repeat tasks as
01:42 - long as the condition is true
01:44 - while loops help simplify our programs
01:46 - so we don't have to rewrite the same
01:48 - code repeatedly
01:51 - [Music]
01:58 - you
