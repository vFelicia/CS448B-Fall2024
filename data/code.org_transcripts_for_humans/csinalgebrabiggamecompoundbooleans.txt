00:07 - Sam the Bat is safe from leaving the left
side of the screen or from leaving the right
00:13 - side of the screen.
00:14 - Let's combine the safe-left and safe-right
functions so that we can keep Sam safe from
00:19 - leaving the left AND the right sides.
00:24 - To do both, we'll need to use compound Booleans.
00:28 - We already know Boolean expressions can return
true or false.
00:32 - Well, we can combine multiple Boolean expressions
together to create compound Booleans that
00:40 - will also return true or false.
00:44 - There are two functions we can use to combine
Booleans: AND and OR.
00:50 - The AND function takes in two Booleans and
only returns true if BOTH of its Booleans
00:57 - are true.
00:58 - For example, if we asked, is this shape red?
and is this shape a circle?
01:06 - The answer would be true because both of the
Booleans are true.
01:12 - If we asked the same questions for this circle,
the answer would be false because while one
01:18 - of the Booleans is true, the other is false.
01:23 - The other way to combine Booleans with OR
which also takes in two Booleans but returns
01:30 - true if at least ONE of the Booleans is true.
01:35 - Let's look at this shape for an example.
01:37 - Is it a square or green?
01:41 - Is it a star or a circle?
01:44 - Is it a star or green?
01:47 - The answer to each of these questions is true.
01:51 - Use compound Booleans to keep Sam safe from
leaving the left and the right sides of the
01:57 - screen.

Sam the Bat is safe from leaving the left side of the screen or from leaving the right side of the screen. Let's combine the safeleft and saferight functions so that we can keep Sam safe from leaving the left AND the right sides. To do both, we'll need to use compound Booleans. We already know Boolean expressions can return true or false. Well, we can combine multiple Boolean expressions together to create compound Booleans that will also return true or false. There are two functions we can use to combine Booleans AND and OR. The AND function takes in two Booleans and only returns true if BOTH of its Booleans are true. For example, if we asked, is this shape red? and is this shape a circle? The answer would be true because both of the Booleans are true. If we asked the same questions for this circle, the answer would be false because while one of the Booleans is true, the other is false. The other way to combine Booleans with OR which also takes in two Booleans but returns true if at least ONE of the Booleans is true. Let's look at this shape for an example. Is it a square or green? Is it a star or a circle? Is it a star or green? The answer to each of these questions is true. Use compound Booleans to keep Sam safe from leaving the left and the right sides of the screen.
