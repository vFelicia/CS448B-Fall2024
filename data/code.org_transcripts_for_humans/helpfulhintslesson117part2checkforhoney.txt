00:00 - so how do we solve this puzzle
00:03 - i'm going to show you in a very simple
00:05 - way
00:06 - like we've done before we're going to
00:08 - keep moving as long as there's a path
00:10 - ahead
00:11 - so while path ahead move forward
00:14 - at the end of that path we are going to
00:17 - check underneath the cloud to see if
00:20 - you're at a honeycomb
00:22 - if you are at a honeycomb
00:24 - then you'll make honey
00:26 - that will get you all the way to the end
00:29 - check underneath the cloud for honeycomb
00:31 - and if there's a honeycomb there you
00:33 - will make honey one time
00:35 - now notice that if you were to put this
00:38 - whole block inside wall path ahead it
00:41 - would check every space until you get to
00:44 - the end of the path including the one at
00:45 - the end
00:46 - that's fine too either way works
00:49 - now i've helped you do half the puzzle
00:52 - how do you do the rest i know you can
00:54 - figure it out happy coding
