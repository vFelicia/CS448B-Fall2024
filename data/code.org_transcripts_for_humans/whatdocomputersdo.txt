00:08 - and an inventor so some of the things
00:11 - I've designed have been at Apple and now
00:13 - I design products for kids to use so
00:15 - that they can have an easier time in
00:17 - school my other jobs include DJing and
00:20 - dancing
00:25 - as the pioneers of computer science
00:28 - explored how to design a thinking
00:29 - machine they realized that it had to
00:31 - perform four different tasks it would
00:35 - need to take input store information
00:39 - process it and then output the results
00:42 - now this might sound simple but these
00:45 - four things are common to all computers
00:48 - that's what makes a computer a computer
00:57 - first we're going to talk about input
00:59 - this is my favorite because what input
01:02 - is is the stuff that the world does or
01:04 - that you do that makes the computer do
01:06 - stuff you can tell computer what to do
01:08 - with keyboard you can tell them what to
01:10 - do with a mouse the microphone the
01:13 - camera and now if you're wearing a
01:14 - computer on your wrist it might listen
01:16 - to your heartbeat or in your car it
01:18 - might be listening to what the car is
01:19 - doing and a touchscreen can actually
01:22 - sense your finger and it takes that as
01:24 - input on what it's doing all these
01:31 - different inputs give a computer
01:33 - information which is then stored in
01:35 - memory a computer's processor takes
01:38 - information from memory it manipulates
01:40 - it or changes it using an algorithm
01:42 - which is just a series of commands and
01:44 - then it sends the processed information
01:46 - back to be stored in memory again this
01:49 - continues until the processed
01:50 - information is ready to be output
01:57 - how a computer outputs information
01:59 - depends on what the computer is designed
02:01 - to do a computer display can show text
02:04 - photos videos or interactive games even
02:07 - virtual reality the output of a computer
02:09 - may even include signals to control a
02:11 - robot and when computers connect over
02:13 - the Internet the output from one
02:15 - computer becomes the input to another
02:17 - and vice versa
02:19 - but across all computers regardless of
02:22 - the different types of technology they
02:23 - use they're old as those doing the same
02:25 - for things they take in information they
02:29 - store it as data they process it and
02:31 - then they output the results
02:37 - [Music]
