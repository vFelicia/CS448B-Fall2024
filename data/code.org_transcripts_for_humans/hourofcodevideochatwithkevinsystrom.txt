00:00 - oh hi everyone thank you for joining us
00:03 - today for a special hour of code video
00:05 - chat to celebrate Computer Science
00:07 - Education Week joining us this year's
00:10 - Kevin Systrom Kevin is the co-founder
00:12 - and CEO of Instagram of photo sharing
00:14 - app all of us know that millions all
00:16 - over the world use to keep connected so
00:18 - please join me in welcoming Kevin that
00:41 - was the nicest reception I've ever gone
00:42 - thank you we practice all right we're
00:48 - gonna go to school number one West
00:50 - Jefferson middle school in Colorado oh I
00:59 - think you're still muted still muted I
01:01 - can see an icon yeah for encode even if
01:08 - you don't think you'll become a computer
01:10 - programmer yeah of course well first off
01:13 - I have to say I love your bowtie because
01:16 - we have tie Tuesday's here at the office
01:18 - and basically everyone wears ties on
01:22 - Tuesday it's an awesome Tiger eight job
01:24 - okay so awesome question - um I think
01:29 - it's important to learn to code because
01:32 - it helps you structure your thinking
01:34 - differently it's kind of like learning
01:36 - math um it's not clear that in the
01:38 - future every day you wake up and you do
01:40 - math problems on a piece of paper but it
01:43 - certainly helps certainly helps you
01:45 - think about the world differently when
01:47 - you're thinking about how to structure a
01:49 - problem how to break up the problem into
01:51 - component parts and then how to sequence
01:53 - your work on that problem I think that's
01:55 - what computer programming helps you do
01:57 - the most for me what's really
02:00 - interesting is I don't do any coding
02:01 - anymore although I wish I did and maybe
02:04 - I'll get back into it for me it really
02:07 - helps because I can talk to engineers
02:09 - and I can talk to designers in the
02:11 - language that they use every single day
02:13 - so even if you're gonna be a designer if
02:15 - you're gonna be a marketing person if
02:17 - you're going to be in PR you need to
02:19 - have a shared and common language with
02:21 - engineers if you're gonna work in
02:22 - Silicon Valley so learning to code also
02:24 - helps you do that I would say those are
02:26 - the two main components awesome so we're
02:32 - gonna move to North Shore Middle School
02:35 - in Wisconsin and they have their entire
02:37 - sixth grade students all in the library
02:40 - so we're gonna have two questions from
02:42 - them how and why do you think Instagram
02:47 - reached so many users so quickly great
02:52 - I'll answer that one I'll answer that
02:53 - one first well the honest truth of it is
02:57 - that it actually took a very very long
02:59 - time for Instagram to get where it is if
03:02 - you count all the days since having the
03:05 - idea to where we are today it's been
03:08 - nearly six years so if you think about
03:11 - it how old were you six years ago that's
03:14 - when Instagram started so you know
03:17 - initially we only had about a hundred
03:19 - people using it and the funny thing is
03:22 - most of those people told us that the
03:24 - app wasn't really going to work not many
03:26 - people would like it that it needed more
03:29 - features that it needed other stuff and
03:31 - and we believed them so we kept working
03:33 - on it but when we launched it worldwide
03:36 - it kind of took off and had 25,000
03:39 - people sign up the first day I think
03:42 - that's because people really wanted
03:44 - their photos to look interesting because
03:47 - phones at the time I don't know if you
03:49 - guys remember this but the first iPhone
03:51 - the camera wasn't actually all that good
03:53 - so instagrams filters made people's
03:57 - pictures go from being kind of boring
04:00 - and blurry to interesting and artsy and
04:02 - that was a need in the market at the
04:04 - time so people started telling their
04:07 - friends hey if you use this app you can
04:09 - make your photos look really interesting
04:11 - and cool and then over the course of you
04:14 - know six months or so we added a million
04:16 - people to the app which was an
04:17 - astounding number to us and now five
04:20 - years later and and by the way five
04:22 - years is quite a long time we now have
04:25 - over 400 million people using it
04:27 - every single month and for those of you
04:30 - who study geography you'll realize 400
04:33 - million is a larger number than the
04:36 - number of people in the United States we
04:38 - actually about 70% of the people who use
04:41 - Instagram are overseas and don't use
04:44 - Instagram in English so you really
04:47 - Instagram is is an international network
04:49 - and I think it's scaled back quickly
04:51 - because you don't have to read to use
04:54 - Instagram you don't have to understand
04:55 - English people can connect just because
04:58 - they're seeing each other's images and
05:00 - images are this universal language that
05:04 - everyone speaks or in this case sees I
05:06 - think that's partially why Instagram
05:08 - scaled so quickly even though it took
05:11 - five years what was the second question
05:20 - what was the inspiration for the
05:22 - Instagram logo and the apps various
05:25 - trademarks like the square shaped photo
05:27 - boomerang etc yeah for sure thank you
05:30 - for asking great question so initially I
05:35 - so when you get to college sometimes
05:38 - they allow you to study overseas so they
05:41 - say if you want to take six months you
05:43 - can go study abroad that's called and I
05:46 - decided to study in Italy so I took art
05:49 - history classes and photography classes
05:51 - in Italy and when I was there this was
05:54 - long before Instagram launched I was
05:57 - taking photos with a camera that used
05:59 - square film it was an antique camera
06:02 - called a Holga camera and as I used that
06:05 - I kind of fell in love with the square
06:06 - aesthetic the square aspect ratio of
06:10 - film because it was a lot easier to
06:12 - frame things and it was easier to make a
06:15 - good-looking photo with square and
06:17 - filters actually came from the idea that
06:20 - when I was developing the film the way
06:22 - you used to do it was that you actually
06:23 - shined a light through the film onto a
06:26 - piece of paper and then put that paper
06:28 - in chemicals to develop the print and
06:31 - you could change the colors by adding
06:33 - extra chemicals to that chemical bath
06:36 - and it would kind of shift the colors so
06:40 - square photos on Instagram came from
06:42 - that camera and then filters came from
06:45 - that process in the darkroom of being
06:47 - able to add chemicals and change and
06:49 - shift the colors and when we designed
06:53 - the icon the icon came from wanting to
06:55 - feel like an old vintage camera and it
06:59 - was kind of ironic because the most new
07:01 - most advanced cameras were the cell
07:04 - phones people were holding in their
07:06 - hands and we wanted to be the opposite
07:08 - of that we wanted to be cool and retro
07:10 - and vintage so we looked at a bunch of
07:13 - really old cameras back in the day and
07:15 - kind of borrowed elements from all of
07:17 - them and we made an icon out of it
07:20 - and still to this day people think of
07:22 - Instagram is kind of cool and vintage
07:24 - and and hip or at least I hope you guys
07:26 - do thank you for the question let's take
07:30 - our next question from st. Isidore
07:32 - school in California it would be really
07:40 - cool to work for Instagram what type of
07:42 - personality traits do you look for when
07:44 - you're hiring Wow good question on well
07:49 - number one you got a you know graduate
07:52 - from college so you guys have a few
07:54 - years we we look for really really smart
07:58 - folks so we look for people that are
08:00 - driven and you have a demonstrated
08:03 - ability to create things so oftentimes
08:06 - what we look for are people that
08:09 - throughout the last few years have been
08:11 - working on projects at home they've
08:13 - launched their own apps
08:14 - they've had ideas for what they want to
08:17 - build and they've done these one-off
08:19 - projects because it shows an
08:21 - entrepreneurial spirit and you have to
08:23 - be really smart and sharp to learn the
08:26 - skills to be able to do everything from
08:28 - think up the idea to code the idea to
08:30 - design the idea and then to launch the
08:33 - idea so we often look for that in people
08:36 - um we also look for a humility um and
08:39 - humility means not being prideful not
08:43 - being too boastful it's about being a
08:46 - team player and always trying to boost
08:49 - the work of others on your team rather
08:52 - than boost yourself I think
08:53 - that's one of the most important
08:54 - qualities as well and just being a hard
08:58 - worker I mean as you know in school the
09:01 - people who are best in your class are
09:02 - often the people who study the most and
09:05 - that's true here at work - the people
09:07 - who do the best work are often the
09:09 - people who work the hardest because you
09:12 - know to launch an apt this many people
09:14 - and to have great ideas you really have
09:16 - to put in a bunch of time and effort but
09:20 - I'd say maybe the most important
09:22 - personality quality would be to be nice
09:26 - we look for really nice people people
09:29 - who have smiles on their faces people
09:30 - who make everyone's day a little bit
09:33 - brighter and if you can do that you're
09:36 - what we call a culture fit and we like
09:38 - to hire you in here so graduate college
09:41 - work really hard and have ideas and be
09:43 - really nice those are the things thank
09:46 - you for asking
09:46 - awesome set of qualities let's take our
09:49 - next question from Fairhope high in
09:51 - Alabama if Instagram hadn't become
09:56 - popular what do you think you would be
09:58 - doing now um that's a good question I
10:02 - haven't really thought that through the
10:05 - good news is Instagram didn't become
10:06 - popular so I get to do this job which is
10:09 - my favorite job on earth but if it
10:13 - didn't become popular what I was doing
10:14 - at the time was teaching myself to code
10:17 - and working on startups and honestly I
10:20 - would probably be working at maybe
10:22 - another version of Instagram as an
10:24 - employee Silicon Valley is pretty
10:26 - awesome because there are tons of people
10:28 - with new ideas every single week and
10:30 - they always try to get people to work on
10:33 - their teams and launch new ideas so I'd
10:35 - probably be working at a start-up I'd
10:38 - probably do my best to be an engineer
10:41 - there or a designer and maybe if I was
10:44 - lucky that startup would affect as many
10:47 - people as Instagram was but I'd be just
10:49 - as happy doing that as as Instagram
10:52 - because you know working on ideas that
10:54 - touch millions of lives is kind of the
10:56 - dream of everyone here in Silicon Valley
10:58 - and the cool part is you've got a ton of
11:00 - folks here doing that every single day
11:03 - so that's probably what I'd be doing
11:06 - let's take our last classroom question
11:09 - from tanana middle school in Alaska nice
11:19 - and what about a program or another
11:23 - social network that you've never
11:24 - released a program that I've never used
11:28 - um you know I try to keep up with all
11:33 - the acts that launch you guys are
11:36 - actually the best at doing this so
11:38 - whenever I hear about a new app or a new
11:41 - social network I'll hear about it from
11:43 - my cousins who are 11 13 and 15 because
11:47 - it turns out you guys are like the pulse
11:49 - of what's happening online and you
11:51 - probably don't even know that you know
11:54 - things like like snapchat and photo and
11:59 - flip program and a bunch of these other
12:01 - apps that kind of have become popular
12:04 - all started with fairly young folks and
12:08 - over time grew and became really popular
12:10 - you guys are a little young to remember
12:14 - this but there was a day when Facebook
12:15 - didn't even exist and it started at
12:18 - colleges actually and it started with
12:20 - students and students you know used it
12:24 - before any grown-up did and then they
12:25 - launched in high schools and then they
12:27 - released it to everyone but there was a
12:29 - time when only college and high school
12:31 - students actually could use it um so
12:34 - when I think about experiencing new apps
12:37 - that I've never used before I often
12:39 - asked my young cousins what they use and
12:42 - they always surprise me but um I love
12:45 - going to the App Store and downloading
12:46 - games from the charts I look what's
12:48 - popular and see what's new I love music
12:52 - apps I love games I love apps that let
12:54 - you change your photos those are all the
12:57 - things that I focus on and if you have
13:00 - any ideas feel free to send them to me
13:03 - great so we have a couple of questions
13:06 - from Twitter and Kate is going to ask
13:09 - them hello so our first question that we
13:13 - got from Twitter is how do you measure
13:16 - the success of something you're involved
13:18 - in is it money or you
13:20 - or innovation or help longevity how do
13:23 - you measure your success uh I think it
13:26 - depends on the person but I think it's a
13:30 - little bit of everything you just
13:31 - mentioned because they're all kind of
13:33 - tied up with each other but at the end
13:34 - of the day what matters most is like
13:37 - whether or not you feel fulfilled and
13:41 - for some people that's you know doing
13:44 - something positive in the world and
13:46 - changing people's lives for the better
13:48 - for some people they really want to
13:50 - build a company and have lots of
13:52 - employees for some people they want to
13:55 - make a living so that they can send
13:56 - their kids to college and so that they
13:58 - can you know um give philanthropically I
14:02 - think it really depends on each
14:03 - individual person but I think when you
14:05 - start an idea or when you start a
14:08 - company or when you start you know
14:09 - working somewhere you should always ask
14:12 - yourself wha I used to ask yourself am I
14:15 - here because I want to make a difference
14:17 - am I here because I want to make a
14:18 - paycheck am I here because I want to
14:20 - learn and be really clear about your
14:23 - intentions because then at the end of
14:26 - the day you can ask yourself if you're
14:27 - actually meeting those goals or not for
14:29 - me Instagram actually initially it was
14:31 - just because I wanted to work on my own
14:33 - and I wanted to have ideas and actually
14:35 - see them through and I wanted to learn
14:38 - the code and I did that through
14:40 - Instagram as well I wanted to work in
14:43 - social media and I wanted to see if we
14:46 - could create a service that lots of
14:47 - people enjoyed and the crazy thing is
14:50 - over the last five to six years we've
14:52 - done all of those things and it's just
14:54 - grown to an enormous height and even now
14:57 - we ask ourselves okay what do we want to
14:59 - do in the next year I'm like how do we
15:01 - want to judge ourselves at the end of
15:03 - 2016 is it creating a business that
15:07 - makes a lot of revenue is it creating a
15:08 - business that touches many more millions
15:10 - of lives around the world and we keep
15:12 - asking ourselves those questions every
15:14 - year to make sure that we're headed in
15:16 - the right direction and I think everyone
15:18 - should do that whether you're a student
15:19 - an employee or a founder excellent
15:25 - answer and then we have our final
15:26 - question also from Twitter can you tell
15:29 - us about a program or a product that you
15:31 - worked on but that you never released to
15:33 - the public
15:34 - yeah they're actually um well I released
15:38 - it to the public but it didn't really go
15:40 - so well so um when I was in college I
15:44 - noticed a bunch of people in their dorm
15:46 - rooms they have stuff at the end of the
15:48 - year that they want to give away and I
15:51 - also noticed people want to buy things
15:52 - like fridges they want to buy mattresses
15:55 - they want to buy posters for their walls
15:57 - to decorate and there's this disconnect
16:00 - between people there was no market place
16:03 - so I I made something called that it was
16:06 - called swap swap actually and the idea
16:09 - is that you would swap goods with other
16:11 - people on college campuses and I
16:13 - actually did launch it and only about
16:15 - 200 people ever used it so it wasn't
16:18 - exactly successful it was a it was a
16:22 - small success compared to what Instagram
16:24 - ended up being but it taught me a lot
16:26 - and that's why I actually think you know
16:29 - forget about like how much money a
16:31 - company makes or how many people it
16:34 - touches every single experience in your
16:36 - life I think helps you learn for the
16:38 - next experience or the next challenge
16:40 - down the road so sometimes you know I
16:43 - would get bummed when I launched
16:44 - something and no one used it but looking
16:48 - back had I not done those things had I
16:50 - not had those failures we wouldn't have
16:53 - learned the really important lessons
16:55 - that actually ended up making Instagram
16:56 - successful and even today at Instagram I
16:59 - mean not everything is perfect I mean we
17:02 - have mistakes that we make we launch
17:04 - things that no one uses and we need to
17:06 - tweak them and make them better so
17:09 - always looking at mistakes or failures
17:11 - in the light of an opportunity to learn
17:13 - for the next time around I think that's
17:15 - probably the most important lesson I've
17:18 - learned over the years oh thank you so
17:21 - much Kevin for joining us today and
17:23 - inspiring students around the world to
17:25 - study computer science we appreciate you
17:28 - spending time answering these questions
17:29 - and sharing a little bit about your
17:30 - experience both impact technology can
17:32 - have on our lives so everyone let's
17:34 - thank heaven for joining us today

Cleaned transcript:

oh hi everyone thank you for joining us today for a special hour of code video chat to celebrate Computer Science Education Week joining us this year's Kevin Systrom Kevin is the cofounder and CEO of Instagram of photo sharing app all of us know that millions all over the world use to keep connected so please join me in welcoming Kevin that was the nicest reception I've ever gone thank you we practice all right we're gonna go to school number one West Jefferson middle school in Colorado oh I think you're still muted still muted I can see an icon yeah for encode even if you don't think you'll become a computer programmer yeah of course well first off I have to say I love your bowtie because we have tie Tuesday's here at the office and basically everyone wears ties on Tuesday it's an awesome Tiger eight job okay so awesome question um I think it's important to learn to code because it helps you structure your thinking differently it's kind of like learning math um it's not clear that in the future every day you wake up and you do math problems on a piece of paper but it certainly helps certainly helps you think about the world differently when you're thinking about how to structure a problem how to break up the problem into component parts and then how to sequence your work on that problem I think that's what computer programming helps you do the most for me what's really interesting is I don't do any coding anymore although I wish I did and maybe I'll get back into it for me it really helps because I can talk to engineers and I can talk to designers in the language that they use every single day so even if you're gonna be a designer if you're gonna be a marketing person if you're going to be in PR you need to have a shared and common language with engineers if you're gonna work in Silicon Valley so learning to code also helps you do that I would say those are the two main components awesome so we're gonna move to North Shore Middle School in Wisconsin and they have their entire sixth grade students all in the library so we're gonna have two questions from them how and why do you think Instagram reached so many users so quickly great I'll answer that one I'll answer that one first well the honest truth of it is that it actually took a very very long time for Instagram to get where it is if you count all the days since having the idea

of Instagram is kind of cool and vintage and and hip or at least I hope you guys do thank you for the question let's take our next question from st. Isidore school in California it would be really cool to work for Instagram what type of personality traits do you look for when you're hiring Wow good question on well number one you got a you know graduate from college so you guys have a few years we we look for really really smart folks so we look for people that are driven and you have a demonstrated ability to create things so oftentimes what we look for are people that throughout the last few years have been working on projects at home they've launched their own apps they've had ideas for what they want to build and they've done these oneoff projects because it shows an entrepreneurial spirit and you have to be really smart and sharp to learn the skills to be able to do everything from think up the idea to code the idea to design the idea and then to launch the idea so we often look for that in people um we also look for a humility um and humility means not being prideful not being too boastful it's about being a team player and always trying to boost the work of others on your team rather than boost yourself I think that's one of the most important qualities as well and just being a hard worker I mean as you know in school the people who are best in your class are often the people who study the most and that's true here at work the people who do the best work are often the people who work the hardest because you know to launch an apt this many people and to have great ideas you really have to put in a bunch of time and effort but I'd say maybe the most important personality quality would be to be nice we look for really nice people people who have smiles on their faces people who make everyone's day a little bit brighter and if you can do that you're what we call a culture fit and we like to hire you in here so graduate college work really hard and have ideas and be really nice those are the things thank you for asking awesome set of qualities let's take our next question from Fairhope high in Alabama if Instagram hadn't become popular what do you think you would be doing now um that's a good question I haven't really thought that through the good news is Instagram didn't become popular so I get to do this job which is my favorite job on earth but if it didn't become popular what I was doing at the time was teaching myself to code and working on startups and honestly I would probably be working at maybe another version of Instagram as an employee Silicon Valley is pretty awesome because there are tons of people with new ideas every single week and they always try to get people to work on their teams and launch new ideas so I'd probably be working at a startup I'd probably do my best to be an engineer there or a designer and maybe if I was lucky that startup would affect as many people as Instagram was but I'd be just as happy doing that as as Instagram because you know working on ideas that touch millions of lives is kind of the dream of everyone here in Silicon Valley and the cool part is you've got a ton of folks here doing that every single day so that's probably what I'd be doing let's take our last classroom question from tanana middle school in Alaska nice and what about a program or another social network that you've never released a program that I've never used um you know I try to keep up with all the acts that launch you guys are actually the best at doing this so whenever I hear about a new app or a new social network I'll hear about it from my cousins who are 11 13 and 15 because it turns out you guys are like the pulse of what's happening online and you probably don't even know that you know things like like snapchat and photo and flip program and a bunch of these other apps that kind of have become popular all started with fairly young folks and over time grew and became really popular you guys are a little young to remember this but there was a day when Facebook didn't even exist and it started at colleges actually and it started with students and students you know used it before any grownup did and then they launched in high schools and then they released it to everyone but there was a time when only college and high school students actually could use it um so when I think about experiencing new apps that I've never used before I often asked my young cousins what they use and they always surprise me but um I love going to the App Store and downloading games from the charts I look what's popular and see what's new I love music apps I love games I love apps that let you change your photos those are all the things that I focus on and if you have any ideas feel free to send them to me great so we have a couple of questions from Twitter and Kate is going to ask them hello so our first question that we got from Twitter is how do you measure the success of something you're involved in is it money or you or innovation or help longevity how do you measure your success uh I think it depends on the person but I think it's a little bit of everything you just mentioned because they're all kind of tied up with each other but at the end of the day what matters most is like whether or not you feel fulfilled and for some people that's you know doing something positive in the world and changing people's lives for the better for some people they really want to build a company and have lots of employees for some people they want to make a living so that they can send their kids to college and so that they can you know um give philanthropically I think it really depends on each individual person but I think when you start an idea or when you start a company or when you start you know working somewhere you should always ask yourself wha I used to ask yourself am I here because I want to make a difference am I here because I want to make a paycheck am I here because I want to learn and be really clear about your intentions because then at the end of the day you can ask yourself if you're actually meeting those goals or not for me Instagram actually initially it was just because I wanted to work on my own and I wanted to have ideas and actually see them through and I wanted to learn the code and I did that through Instagram as well I wanted to work in social media and I wanted to see if we could create a service that lots of people enjoyed and the crazy thing is over the last five to six years we've done all of those things and it's just grown to an enormous height and even now we ask ourselves okay what do we want to do in the next year I'm like how do we want to judge ourselves at the end of 2016 is it creating a business that makes a lot of revenue is it creating a business that touches many more millions of lives around the world and we keep asking ourselves those questions every year to make sure that we're headed in the right direction and I think everyone should do that whether you're a student an employee or a founder excellent answer and then we have our final question also from Twitter can you tell us about a program or a product that you worked on but that you never released to the public yeah they're actually um well I released it to the public but it didn't really go so well so um when I was in college I noticed a bunch of people in their dorm rooms they have stuff at the end of the year that they want to give away and I also noticed people want to buy things like fridges they want to buy mattresses they want to buy posters for their walls to decorate and there's this disconnect between people there was no market place so I I made something called that it was called swap swap actually and the idea is that you would swap goods with other people on college campuses and I actually did launch it and only about 200 people ever used it so it wasn't exactly successful it was a it was a small success compared to what Instagram ended up being but it taught me a lot and that's why I actually think you know forget about like how much money a company makes or how many people it touches every single experience in your life I think helps you learn for the next experience or the next challenge down the road so sometimes you know I would get bummed when I launched something and no one used it but looking back had I not done those things had I not had those failures we wouldn't have learned the really important lessons that actually ended up making Instagram successful and even today at Instagram I mean not everything is perfect I mean we have mistakes that we make we launch things that no one uses and we need to tweak them and make them better so always looking at mistakes or failures in the light of an opportunity to learn for the next time around I think that's probably the most important lesson I've learned over the years oh thank you so much Kevin for joining us today and inspiring students around the world to study computer science we appreciate you spending time answering these questions and sharing a little bit about your experience both impact technology can have on our lives so everyone let's thank heaven for joining us today
