00:00 - One of the great things in computer programming
is once you've taught a computer how to do
00:06 - an action, you can call that function again.
You give it a name and then you can call it.
00:18 - That's really like extending the language.
In the program we built, we learned how to
00:24 - draw a square by moving and turning four times.
We can take that function and give it a name,
00:34 - draw a square, so that any time we want to
do that, we simply say draw a square and it
00:42 - will go back and invoke that function, that
code. It will get done for us. We've added
00:49 - that concept to our programming language.
