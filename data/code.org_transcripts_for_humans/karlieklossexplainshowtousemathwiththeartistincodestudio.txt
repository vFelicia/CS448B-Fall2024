00:08 - if I went to draw a rectangle that is 50
00:10 - pixels tall and that is twice as wide as
00:13 - it is tall how would I program the
00:16 - computer to do that well I could tell
00:19 - the artist to go up 50 turn right and
00:22 - then go over 100 and loop the whole
00:24 - thing twice but then I'm doing the math
00:26 - for the computer multiplying 50 by 2 in
00:30 - your head may not be that hard but
00:32 - computers are really good at doing math
00:35 - so we should leave it to them whenever
00:37 - possible if I just used a variable
00:39 - called height instead then I could
00:41 - easily change height to 50 and then
00:44 - change my algorithm to tell the artist
00:46 - to go up by height turn right and then
00:49 - go over by height time 2 which gives us
00:52 - a rectangle that is twice as wide as it
00:55 - is tall
