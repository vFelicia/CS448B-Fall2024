00:10 - at my sandwich shop customers can only
00:12 - order one type of sandwich a turkey
00:14 - sandwich with no cheese that costs 2.99
00:18 - but what if i want to allow customers to
00:20 - create their own sandwiches
00:22 - let's find out how we can do this
00:25 - the no argument constructor to create a
00:27 - sandwich object sets the values for our
00:29 - default sandwich
00:31 - in this case we set turkey for the meat
00:35 - false for has cheese
00:37 - and 299 for price
00:40 - a parameterized constructor is a
00:42 - constructor that has a set number of
00:44 - arguments to be passed
00:46 - its purpose is to assign user-specified
00:48 - values to the instance variables when
00:50 - instantiating an object
00:53 - i can use a parameterized constructor to
00:55 - allow customers to specify their meat
00:57 - and whether or not they want cheese on
00:59 - their sandwich
01:01 - let's write a parameterized constructor
01:03 - for the sandwich class with two
01:05 - parameters
01:06 - first we use the keyword public
01:09 - followed by the name of the class
01:12 - then an open set of parentheses
01:15 - inside the parentheses we will write the
01:17 - parameters for the meat and has cheese
01:20 - instance variables
01:21 - since meat is a string
01:23 - the first parameter will be a string
01:27 - the second is a boolean to set whether
01:29 - or not the sandwich object has cheese
01:33 - inside the body of the constructor we
01:35 - assign the values for the meat
01:37 - has cheese
01:39 - and price instance variables
01:41 - now we can call this constructor by
01:43 - giving ham
01:44 - for the meat instance variable
01:46 - and true for the cheese instance
01:49 - variable
01:50 - this sandwich will have a price of 299.
01:54 - we can also add more constructors with
01:56 - different signatures
01:58 - having multiple constructors is known as
02:00 - overloading
02:02 - overloading is defining two or more
02:04 - constructors or methods with the same
02:06 - name but different signatures
02:10 - let's create a constructor with one
02:11 - parameter to specify the meat
02:14 - in the body of the constructor we can
02:16 - initialize the meat instance variable to
02:18 - the type of meat
02:20 - the has cheese instance variable to
02:22 - false
02:24 - and price to 299.
02:27 - this constructor signature is different
02:29 - from the other two constructors we have
02:31 - in the sandwich class
02:33 - this is another example of overloading
02:35 - it lets a customer decide the type of
02:38 - meat
02:38 - but none of these sandwiches will have
02:40 - cheese
02:42 - when we call this constructor we can
02:44 - instantiate a new sandwich object with
02:46 - roast beef
02:48 - as the value for the meat instance
02:50 - variable
02:51 - the sandwich will have false for has
02:54 - cheese and 299 for price
02:57 - as software engineers we decide how many
02:59 - constructors our class should have
03:02 - each situation will be different
03:03 - depending on what we are representing
03:05 - with code
03:06 - creating multiple constructors allows
03:08 - our objects to be more customizable
03:11 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

at my sandwich shop customers can only order one type of sandwich a turkey sandwich with no cheese that costs 2.99 but what if i want to allow customers to create their own sandwiches let's find out how we can do this the no argument constructor to create a sandwich object sets the values for our default sandwich in this case we set turkey for the meat false for has cheese and 299 for price a parameterized constructor is a constructor that has a set number of arguments to be passed its purpose is to assign userspecified values to the instance variables when instantiating an object i can use a parameterized constructor to allow customers to specify their meat and whether or not they want cheese on their sandwich let's write a parameterized constructor for the sandwich class with two parameters first we use the keyword public followed by the name of the class then an open set of parentheses inside the parentheses we will write the parameters for the meat and has cheese instance variables since meat is a string the first parameter will be a string the second is a boolean to set whether or not the sandwich object has cheese inside the body of the constructor we assign the values for the meat has cheese and price instance variables now we can call this constructor by giving ham for the meat instance variable and true for the cheese instance variable this sandwich will have a price of 299. we can also add more constructors with different signatures having multiple constructors is known as overloading overloading is defining two or more constructors or methods with the same name but different signatures let's create a constructor with one parameter to specify the meat in the body of the constructor we can initialize the meat instance variable to the type of meat the has cheese instance variable to false and price to 299. this constructor signature is different from the other two constructors we have in the sandwich class this is another example of overloading it lets a customer decide the type of meat but none of these sandwiches will have cheese when we call this constructor we can instantiate a new sandwich object with roast beef as the value for the meat instance variable the sandwich will have false for has cheese and 299 for price as software engineers we decide how many constructors our class should have each situation will be different depending on what we are representing with code creating multiple constructors allows our objects to be more customizable you
