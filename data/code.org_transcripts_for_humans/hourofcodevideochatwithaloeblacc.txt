00:00 - thank you so much everybody for joining
00:02 - us today
00:03 - I'd like to welcome a low block to our
00:05 - hour of code chat all of the successful
00:08 - recording artist best known for
00:10 - performance also is passionate about
00:16 - technology and teaches students about
00:18 - digital compression and one of codes per
00:20 - coulomb videos so everybody please give
00:22 - me a big warm welcome to Ella back how
00:39 - you doing everybody it's good to see you
00:40 - and I'm glad I had a chance to talk to
00:44 - you guys and answer some questions we're
00:47 - so happy you can be here today i lo so
00:48 - our first question comes from Jordans
00:50 - class in Oakland smash ramen
01:10 - we're Island computer science I started
01:13 - coding at the age of 14 some wondering
01:17 - when was the first time you heard about
01:20 - computer science first time I heard
01:22 - about computer science I was about six
01:24 - years old my dad bought an app a
01:28 - Commodore 64 computer and used to bring
01:31 - home magazines that that taught people
01:35 - who had these early computers how to
01:37 - basically how to build them themselves
01:39 - but they also had codes so that the
01:41 - adults could teach their kids how to do
01:44 - like really simple and fun designs in in
01:48 - the in the computer so I was really
01:51 - young when I learned about it just
01:54 - because you know my dad was sort of
01:56 - geeky into that stuff
02:00 - awesome I'm great to hear it our next
02:03 - question comes from Adams classroom in
02:05 - Vancouver Washington I see we've been a
02:06 - big heart poster for a low thanks guys
02:11 - hey my name is pocket wells and my
02:14 - question is how have you seen technology
02:16 - change the music industry and what role
02:19 - do you see it having in the future
02:21 - technology has changed the music
02:23 - industry in a lot of ways one of which
02:26 - is the distribution method when I first
02:29 - started making music
02:31 - I was selling cassettes
02:35 - and then I was selling vinyl and I was
02:38 - selling CDs but nowadays it's very
02:44 - infrequent that someone purchases a CD
02:46 - or a cassette or or vinyl
02:49 - now music is distributed through the
02:53 - internet and so we've gone from a
02:57 - physical world to a streaming world and
02:59 - a digital download world that has been
03:04 - the most dramatic change I've seen in
03:06 - the music industry
03:07 - another huge change has been the
03:10 - technology we used to make music you
03:13 - know when I was growing up I joined the
03:17 - school band and I played the trumpet but
03:20 - when I started actually using and
03:24 - producing music I was no longer using
03:26 - instruments I was using computers and
03:28 - and beat machines so technologies had
03:32 - you know multiple has affected the music
03:36 - business in multiple ways
03:39 - thanks for sharing how how music is
03:41 - changing thanks to technology ello our
03:43 - next question comes from Lawrence's
03:45 - class and they're actually local to us
03:47 - in Seattle hi my name is Elena from girl
03:54 - Checotah Ingram and we were wondering if
03:56 - you could create an application to make
03:58 - your life easier what would it be and
03:59 - why an application that would make my
04:04 - life easier would be a songwriting
04:08 - application if I could just press a
04:09 - button and the song would be written
04:11 - already and all I had to do was sing it
04:13 - that would be awesome I actually met a
04:15 - guy in Boulder Colorado who was working
04:20 - on a program that could mimic and model
04:25 - any artists style and he said that he
04:28 - had basically built this computer
04:30 - learning system to mimic and model even
04:34 - my style so they his computer basically
04:37 - could could write a song in my own way I
04:39 - mean in my own style hopefully he
04:42 - doesn't try to compete with me in the
04:43 - marketplace that would be crazy
04:46 - very cool to hear about that we're going
04:49 - to go to Meredith's classroom in
04:51 - Portland Oregon I would attribute it to
05:22 - number one skill so when I was in high
05:25 - school is when I started recording I
05:27 - started writing lyrics when I was nine
05:29 - years old writing rap lyrics because I
05:32 - thought I was gonna be a rapper but
05:34 - singing eventually was the way that I
05:37 - was able to break into the music
05:38 - industry but because I've been writing
05:41 - lyrics for so long from age nine up
05:43 - until I got signed to my first recording
05:45 - deal at age 25 I had about 16 years of
05:48 - experience and there are some theorists
05:50 - who say if you dedicate 10,000 hours to
05:54 - anything you can become a master at it
05:56 - and because I had dedicated so much time
05:59 - to songwriting I believe that skill I
06:02 - would attribute skill to my success
06:04 - today but I think it's also just finding
06:06 - the right mentors and the people who can
06:08 - support my career I've had a lot of
06:11 - great people offer me opportunities that
06:15 - have have been tremendous help to my
06:18 - career
06:23 - awesome it's so inspiring we hear people
06:25 - say that you know often the the biggest
06:27 - key to success is just practice and
06:29 - continuing to do something for a long
06:31 - time until you really get good at it for
06:34 - our last question we're going to go to
06:35 - evergreen high school
06:42 - hi my name is alvaro Khan and I'm from
06:45 - Evergreen Valley High School's girls who
06:47 - code my question is what inspired you to
06:50 - go into music and what advice you have
06:52 - for other aspiring musicians well I was
06:56 - inspired to make music because it helped
06:58 - me channel my creative energy and I've
07:02 - been doing it for so long that it was
07:05 - just my hobby I ended up going to the
07:08 - University of Southern California after
07:10 - high school and after my college
07:14 - experience I went to work as a business
07:16 - consultant and all during that time I
07:22 - continue to make music because it was
07:24 - just my passion it's something that I
07:25 - love to do even though it wasn't my day
07:27 - job eventually what happened was I lost
07:31 - my job I got laid off and as I
07:34 - contemplated going back to school to get
07:36 - a masters or PhD or going back to the
07:41 - workforce to find another job
07:42 - I just continued to make music and think
07:47 - positive things started happening and I
07:49 - never had to to look for another job and
07:52 - I'm I think you know it's
07:58 - so it's pretty lucky that I was able to
08:01 - do this but I'm really glad that I I
08:03 - went through school and I finished
08:04 - school and I got that experience and all
08:06 - of the education that I have because it
08:08 - helps me to do the business that I do

08:29 - first we have a tweet from Caitlyn from
08:31 - Nashville Tennessee and she wants to
08:34 - know alo what inspired you to make your
08:36 - own website and how long did it take you
08:39 - to learn how to build it
08:41 - what inspired me was
08:46 - a class that I had and I was taking at
08:50 - the University of Southern California
08:51 - USC this is back in 1997
08:55 - I took prevent class and we all had to
09:00 - create our own website so it didn't take
09:04 - very long to figure it out and it was
09:07 - all for me just basic HTML plus we had
09:10 - some you know graphic user interface
09:13 - tools back then it was like Netscape was
09:16 - our browser and we had an Netscape also
09:20 - had a
09:24 - a web a web authoring platform so you
09:30 - could create your website in a graphical
09:36 - environment without having to do all the
09:38 - code and that made it a lot easier but
09:42 - that was what inspired me it was
09:43 - basically a class
09:46 - it didn't take very long maybe a couple
09:48 - weeks that's awesome
09:51 - umm I bet all the kids are really
09:55 - excited to hear about that but it didn't
09:57 - take very long to figure out and it's
09:59 - very inspiring right alright uh
10:05 - Gabrielle from Miami Florida wants to
10:08 - know what are your favorite apps or
10:11 - technology inventions favorite apps
10:14 - technology inventions I love right now
10:16 - my my favorite technology invention is
10:20 - 360-degree camera I don't know how much
10:24 - of you are familiar with the this new
10:28 - format of video but on YouTube you can
10:31 - watch videos in 360 and I found a
10:36 - company called Jai Rob dick that makes a
10:37 - 360 camera because I was just so
10:39 - interested in it I want to be able to
10:40 - tell stories not just their music but
10:42 - visually as well and when I went to Ted
10:46 - in Vancouver Canada in February I had a
10:51 - chance to view
10:54 - documentary that was done in a Syrian
10:57 - refugee camp and it was in 360 I was
11:00 - wearing the Samsung gear VR and I was
11:04 - transported to the Syrian refugee camp
11:06 - which basically humanized the issue it's
11:09 - no longer no longer just people over
11:12 - there that are suffering it was I'm now
