00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - we're about to see a model lesson from
00:07 - the deep dive workshop as a reminder the
00:09 - intent of this model lesson is to really
00:11 - give teachers space to see and feel what
00:14 - lessons can look like in their own
00:15 - classrooms that's why we do a role play
00:18 - activity instead of having folks stay in
00:19 - their teacher role we ask them to be in
00:21 - the learner role and the lesson you're
00:23 - about to see is really going to leverage
00:25 - the pair programming feature so look out
00:27 - for that
00:29 - all right everybody before we get into
00:30 - the curriculum and start actually doing
00:32 - a lesson as learners we're going to take
00:35 - ourselves into the position of your
00:37 - students by looking at a few student
00:39 - profiles
00:40 - so you see here we have five student
00:42 - profiles five descriptions of students
00:45 - i'm going to give you a moment to read
00:47 - these and as you read i want you to
00:48 - reflect on whether or not you see any of
00:51 - your own students in these profiles
00:55 - and further i'd like you to think about
00:56 - what your role in responsibility is as a
00:59 - teacher in supporting these student
01:01 - needs
01:02 - take a few minutes to read and reflect
01:04 - and then we'll come back together
01:05 - i definitely see student number four in
01:07 - my classroom uh we focus a lot on
01:09 - collaboration and so it's nice having
01:11 - students who are always eager to work
01:13 - with other uh work with other students
01:14 - and support them in their learning yeah
01:16 - i think the challenge though is when you
01:18 - have those students who just want to
01:19 - blurt out the answer to everyone because
01:21 - they're so proud that they know it and
01:22 - they want to share their knowledge
01:25 - pacing them when you have other students
01:26 - who are still trying to work through
01:27 - things is definitely a challenge
01:29 - absolutely
01:30 - so in the past couple years of teaching
01:32 - this course i certainly have seen a lot
01:33 - of student number threes in my
01:34 - classrooms um
01:36 - they're certainly very engaged early on
01:38 - but as the lessons is a little bit more
01:39 - difficult they um
01:41 - get really discouraged and aren't as
01:42 - persistent as i'd like them to be and
01:44 - they work through all the hints that are
01:46 - provided in each puzzle but after they
01:47 - run out of hints then they give up
01:49 - entirely i'm trying to get past that
01:52 - i see student number one a lot we have a
01:53 - really big disparity in my class some
01:55 - kids are doing a ton of this at home and
01:58 - then they come in and they already know
01:59 - everything and they really are excited
02:01 - to share but then they get ahead of
02:02 - everyone else and they can sometimes get
02:04 - bored when i'm trying to pace it
02:06 - appropriately for the rest of the kids
02:08 - and it makes the kids who aren't doing
02:10 - at home maybe don't even have access to
02:12 - computers at home makes them feel behind
02:15 - and then
02:16 - it's it creates a bad dynamic in the
02:18 - class so i'm still figuring out how to
02:21 - deal with like engaging those students
02:23 - who are really ahead and excited because
02:25 - i don't want them to feel like they're
02:26 - doing something wrong but also making
02:28 - sure that they're not kind of like
02:29 - taking all my attention for sure
02:32 - that was a really great discussion about
02:34 - the students that you're seeing in your
02:35 - classroom and how that relates to the
02:37 - support that we need to provide as
02:39 - teachers
02:40 - i want you to keep those profiles in
02:42 - your mind and think about how you can
02:44 - channel the needs of those students as
02:46 - we move into our model lesson
02:48 - so
02:49 - this is a role-playing activity where i
02:52 - am going to be acting as the teacher and
02:55 - you are going to be acting as learners
02:57 - you are putting on what we call your
02:58 - learner hat i'm going to put on my
03:00 - teacher hat and you're going to notice
03:01 - that i sort of slip into a mode of
03:04 - talking to you like you're my students
03:06 - it's not because i don't respect you
03:07 - it's because we're doing a role play
03:09 - activity where you are going to act as
03:11 - learners in a classroom any questions
03:13 - about that
03:15 - okay great
03:17 - let me give you some context for the
03:18 - lesson that we're about to do
03:20 - this lesson falls in course d that's
03:22 - meant for third grade students
03:24 - and it's pretty far into the course it's
03:27 - uh lesson number 12. it introduces the
03:29 - concepts of while loops and it uses the
03:32 - farmer
03:34 - in this lesson we are going to be
03:36 - working with one another so you are
03:38 - going to need one computer per two
03:39 - people
03:40 - i'm gonna give you a moment to get that
03:42 - together and when you see my next slide
03:44 - we are all going to be in our role each
03:47 - of you as learners and me as a teacher
03:50 - okay
03:53 - [Music]
03:58 - hey everybody welcome back to technology
04:00 - class
04:01 - last time you were here we used a new
04:04 - block in code studio can you raise your
04:06 - hand for me if you remember using this
04:07 - block
04:09 - all right a couple of you remember a
04:10 - couple of you don't that's totally okay
04:12 - we're gonna talk about it a little bit
04:14 - who can tell me in your own words what
04:16 - this what this pink block does in code
04:19 - studio raise your hands please remember
04:24 - yeah right here it
04:26 - helps you do something a bunch of times
04:30 - yeah so it helps you do something
04:31 - multiple times so this block you might
04:34 - remember we called this a repeat block
04:37 - and repeat means we're doing something
04:40 - more than once and who remembers where
04:43 - the question marks are right now what
04:44 - can we put in there
04:47 - numbers right yeah we can put numbers in
04:49 - here so we use this block when we want
04:52 - to do something a certain number of
04:54 - times
04:56 - make sense
04:58 - all right
04:59 - today we are going to start off using
05:02 - that block again and we're going to
05:04 - build to the next kind of block that
05:06 - lets us repeat
05:07 - in order to do our task we're going to
05:09 - be working on two of our computational
05:12 - practices the first one we're going to
05:14 - work on is creativity coming up with
05:16 - unique solutions all of your own and the
05:19 - second is collaboration so that's
05:21 - working with another person to solve
05:23 - problems
05:25 - that's what computational practices
05:27 - we'll be using today
05:29 - in order to do these tasks we're going
05:31 - to pair program how many of you remember
05:33 - pair programming
05:36 - most of you awesome awesome just a quick
05:38 - recap because you've been away from
05:40 - technology class for a little bit when
05:42 - we pair program we each take a role and
05:46 - we take turns in our role
05:48 - so someone is the driver that means
05:51 - somebody is using the keyboard and mouse
05:54 - and someone is the navigator so that's
05:56 - the person who's keeping track of
05:58 - everything we're doing and giving
06:00 - instructions to the person in the
06:01 - driver's seat
06:03 - today we're gonna switch roles every two
06:06 - minutes and i've got a timer up here
06:08 - that's going to go off when it's time to
06:09 - switch
06:10 - does that sound good
06:12 - all right so let's go ahead and get
06:14 - started i need one computer per two
06:17 - people i know you grab them from the
06:19 - laptop cart on your way in so open up
06:21 - your computer one per two people
06:26 - go to code.org the website
06:29 - and in the top right corner where you
06:31 - see your name i want you to click and
06:34 - then select pair programming
06:37 - once you're there you're going to pick
06:39 - my class
06:41 - and then choose your partner whoever
06:43 - you're working with pick their name from
06:45 - the
06:46 - list can you give me a big thumbs up
06:49 - when you're connected to your partner
06:52 - awesome okay
06:53 - your task for right now is to go to
06:56 - course d that's the course on the
06:58 - code.org website that we've been working
07:00 - through
07:01 - today we're on lesson 12
07:04 - and you are going to get started by
07:06 - practicing with the first three bubbles
07:09 - all i want you to do is the first three
07:11 - bubbles and you're gonna take turns pair
07:14 - programming go ahead and get started
07:18 - so we need to use the repeat block to
07:20 - take advantage of just one but not five
07:22 - right yes
07:24 - one two once we're there after we walk
07:27 - at the end
07:31 - [Music]
07:40 - yes
07:46 - [Music]
07:51 - awesome job everybody with the first
07:53 - three bubbles here in this lesson i want
07:56 - to take a minute and recap what you just
07:58 - did
07:59 - in these activities you always knew how
08:02 - much dirt you needed to move how did you
08:04 - know how much dirt needed to be moved
08:09 - yeah it showed you the number right you
08:11 - are either taking away or adding a known
08:14 - amount of dirt every time
08:17 - i have a question for everybody
08:19 - what would you need to be able to do
08:23 - in order to do the same exercise if you
08:26 - didn't know how much dirt needed to move
08:29 - how would you solve that problem
08:35 - could you use a repeat block
08:40 - until it's done
08:42 - yeah so that's a super different way of
08:44 - using it right
08:45 - up to now when we use the repeat block
08:47 - we've done it a certain number of times
08:50 - but instead of saying
08:52 - dig 10 times we want to say shovel until
08:55 - there isn't any dirt left
08:57 - right dig until it's done
09:00 - so this is introducing a new type of
09:03 - loop a new block we're going to watch
09:05 - this video to learn more about how this
09:08 - block works
09:09 - and then you're going to get back on
09:10 - your computer and you're going to use it
09:12 - for yourself
09:14 - [Music]
09:18 - all right now that we know more about
09:20 - how while loops work you're going to go
09:22 - back on your computer still with your
09:24 - partner you're going to pair program to
09:26 - use this block sound good
09:28 - [Music]
09:32 - awesome job today everybody mrs smith is
09:35 - here now so you're going to head back to
09:36 - her class but i'll see you back here
09:38 - next week where we're going to keep
09:39 - going with while loops
09:42 - all right everybody hats are off time to
09:44 - talk pair programming show of hands how
09:46 - many of you have used pair programming
09:48 - the tool
09:49 - in your classroom with your students
09:52 - all right a couple but not everybody
09:54 - we're going to take some time right now
09:55 - to look at how pair programming shakes
09:58 - out in your teacher dashboard
10:00 - so you're going to notice on the screen
10:02 - here that when we pair program the icon
10:05 - changes just from like a single person
10:08 - or number to this like cluster of
10:10 - students this is how i as the teacher
10:12 - know that students completed this level
10:15 - with the pair programming feature turned
10:16 - on i want you to take a moment now to go
10:19 - to your computers if you weren't
10:21 - programming uh on your machine open your
10:23 - machine up as well and i want you to
10:25 - look at how your dashboard looks now
10:28 - that you've completed this lesson with a
10:30 - partner via pair programming we're going
10:33 - to take a couple minutes to do that and
10:34 - then come back and talk questions
10:37 - so that was the model lesson from the
10:39 - deep dive workshop we hope that seeing
10:42 - that gives you some context for how it
10:43 - actually looks to model a lesson
10:46 - and to talk to teachers as though
10:47 - they're students in that role playing
10:49 - context and gives you a little bit more
10:51 - detail about how we think the pair
10:53 - programming feature comes out in the
10:55 - lesson
11:03 - you

Cleaned transcript:

we're about to see a model lesson from the deep dive workshop as a reminder the intent of this model lesson is to really give teachers space to see and feel what lessons can look like in their own classrooms that's why we do a role play activity instead of having folks stay in their teacher role we ask them to be in the learner role and the lesson you're about to see is really going to leverage

needs take a few minutes to read and reflect and then we'll come back together i definitely see student number four in my classroom uh we focus a lot on collaboration and so it's nice having students who are always eager to work with other uh work with other students and support them in their learning yeah i think the challenge though is when you have those students who just want to blurt out the
