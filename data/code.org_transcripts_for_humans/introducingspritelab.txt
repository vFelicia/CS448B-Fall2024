[upbeat music] My name is Lesley Torres and I am a computer science student. What I like about computer science is that it helps me develop my creativity, and it also teaches me problem solving skills. This is Sprite Lab, a place where you can build imaginative and fun apps, and other useful programs. This is a Sprite. A Sprite is something you can interact with, like a character in a game, or an object in a scene. With Sprite Lab, you can change different aspects of a Sprite, like its costume, location, and color. You can also change how a Sprite behaves on the screen. Sprites can also interact with you or each other. You can create a dance party, a virtual pet, or an entire world of creatures that do whatever you tell them to. Now you can spend some time exploring Sprite Lab and see where your imagination leads you. [upbeat music fades away]
