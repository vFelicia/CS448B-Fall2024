00:02 - computer science education week and the
00:03 - hour of code for the representatives
00:05 - from those groups who are here today can
00:07 - you raise your hands
00:09 - can we get a round of applause for all
00:10 - of the
00:12 - people on these committees
00:16 - lastly to the cs teachers who are tuning
00:18 - in over the live stream with your
00:19 - classrooms
00:20 - the work that you are doing in the
00:22 - classroom every day is the most
00:24 - important part of this movement thank
00:26 - you truly for the work you are doing to
00:27 - bring computer science to your
00:29 - classrooms can we get a round of
00:30 - applause for the teachers
00:31 - [Applause]
00:37 - now in the past we've kicked off
00:39 - computer science education week with
00:41 - world leaders such as barack obama and
00:44 - justin trudeau
00:45 - this year we're honored to be in silicon
00:48 - valley with leading women in tech
00:51 - susan cheryl
00:52 - and peggy johnson
00:54 - now
00:56 - the
00:56 - they are amazing but the computer
00:58 - science education sorry women in
01:00 - computer science actually goes back to
01:02 - the very beginning
01:03 - computer science education week is held
01:05 - in december every year to commemorate
01:07 - two women
01:08 - ada lovelace who was born on december 10
01:11 - 1815
01:13 - and designed the very first computer
01:14 - program
01:15 - and grace hopper who was born almost 100
01:18 - years later on december 9 1906 and has
01:21 - been a pioneer in the field of computer
01:23 - science
01:25 - while the tech industry today is mostly
01:26 - male the teacher-led movement to bring
01:29 - computer science to our classrooms is
01:31 - dominated by women in our
01:34 - workshops we see that about 86 percent
01:37 - of the teachers attending to teach
01:38 - computer science to their classrooms are
01:40 - women and we have leading women who are
01:43 - inspiring
01:45 - running the organizations many
01:46 - organizations in this space including
01:48 - deborah seahorn who is currently running
01:50 - the computer science teachers
01:51 - association and is here today and we'll
01:54 - get to hear from her later
01:56 - now for hundreds
01:58 - yes for debra absolutely
02:00 - [Applause]
02:02 - for hundreds of thousands of teachers
02:04 - around the world their journey began
02:06 - with an hour of code during computer
02:08 - science education week this week
02:12 - and at this point
02:13 - over the last four years we've had four
02:16 - hundred thousand four hundred million
02:19 - hours of code done around the world and
02:21 - this week we're going to hit
02:23 - 500 million hours of code served
02:27 - [Applause]
02:31 - but an hour is only the beginning and
02:33 - most of the teachers go beyond an hour
02:36 - to teach years of computer science in
02:37 - their classrooms in the last four years
02:40 - we've seen incredible momentum
02:42 - we've had over 120 school districts
02:45 - start teaching computer science we've
02:47 - had 40 states pass policies to support
02:50 - computer science and a dozen countries
02:53 - have added computer science to their
02:55 - national curriculum
02:57 - that is only the beginning and today
02:59 - with the announcements you're going to
03:00 - hear today you're going to see how fast
03:03 - this is growing at this point the
03:04 - computer science education movement
03:07 - is the fastest growing movement in the
03:10 - history of education
03:13 - [Applause]
03:18 - now to kick off
03:19 - this worldwide event i'm pleased to have
03:22 - peggy johnson
03:25 - susan wojcicki and sheryl sandberg here
03:27 - today i'd like to first introduce peggy
03:30 - johnson
03:31 - an executive vice president of business
03:33 - development at microsoft peggy oversees
03:35 - microsoft's partnerships acquisitions
03:38 - and venture fund
03:39 - previously peggy spent 24 years at
03:42 - qualcomm in leadership positions across
03:44 - engineering sales and business
03:46 - development
03:47 - she has been recognized by multiple
03:48 - organizations including business insider
03:51 - as the number one most powerful female
03:54 - engineer in 2017. please join me in
03:57 - welcoming peggy johnson
04:08 - how about this one how about this one
04:11 - there you go y'all can hear me
04:13 - thank you uh alice and hottie very much
04:15 - it's um on behalf of microsoft it's a
04:17 - real honor to be here and to celebrate
04:19 - the wonderful code.org community
04:22 - um co.org's mission is deeply personal
04:25 - to me i am an engineer
04:28 - at college i learned a code and my first
04:30 - job
04:31 - outside of college was coding and
04:33 - computer science has in many ways been
04:36 - the foundation of my career it's really
04:38 - changed my life
04:40 - but i have to say um it almost was an
04:42 - accident it wasn't supposed to be that
04:44 - way and i'll give you a little bit of
04:45 - the back story on that
04:47 - i am one of 15 kids so i have 14
04:50 - brothers and sisters in my family um
04:52 - there's a little bit irish catholic in
04:54 - there that's how that happened um
04:57 - but i had the uh the unenviable position
04:59 - i wasn't the oldest i wasn't the
05:01 - youngest i was one of the 13 in the
05:02 - middle so for those of you who remember
05:04 - the brady bunch i definitely had some
05:06 - jan brady syndrome but my parents had
05:09 - two rules um one you had to go to
05:12 - college and two you had to pay for it
05:14 - yourself
05:15 - so uh following my older brothers and
05:17 - sisters as younger siblings do they had
05:19 - already uh gone off to college and many
05:21 - of them had become business majors and
05:23 - so i just sort of followed in their
05:24 - footsteps went off to san diego state
05:27 - got a job on campus and started my what
05:30 - i thought was going to be my my business
05:32 - degree
05:33 - and one day i find myself delivering a
05:35 - package to the engineering department a
05:38 - place i have never been to before in my
05:40 - life i didn't even know where it was i'd
05:42 - ask people how to get there
05:43 - so i walk in and i struck up a
05:46 - conversation with the two executive
05:48 - assistants who were behind the desk
05:50 - and who were strangely so excited to see
05:53 - me and what i didn't realize is they'd
05:55 - just been having a conversation about
05:57 - how they could get
05:58 - more women into engineering
06:01 - and the sad fact was they just they they
06:04 - tried they just couldn't get more in and
06:06 - all of a sudden i showed up in front of
06:08 - them so these two ladies they went to
06:10 - work on me they sat me down
06:12 - on the clock by the way
06:13 - and they said so what are you studying
06:15 - you know what are you going to be
06:17 - do you like math and science have you
06:19 - ever considered
06:21 - seeking a degree in engineering and
06:24 - frankly to be really honest no i didn't
06:26 - even really know what engineers did to
06:28 - tell you the truth there was no
06:30 - engineers in my family growing up there
06:32 - you know it was business majors
06:34 - and these two ladies just started
06:36 - working on me and working on me and i
06:37 - remember something that still resonates
06:39 - with me today they said the world will
06:41 - be your oyster if you pursue an
06:43 - engineering degree
06:45 - and the next morning i woke up changed
06:46 - my major to engineering and i tell you
06:48 - this story because it has a lot to do
06:50 - with luck when i looked around at my
06:53 - classes they were it was under 10 and
06:55 - the double e department were women i was
06:58 - i was just there by pure luck because of
07:00 - this package i had dropped off
07:03 - and frankly
07:04 - the
07:05 - the issue is that for too many of our
07:08 - young women today for too many of our
07:09 - young people of color for too many young
07:11 - people all together
07:13 - luck is still too much a part of the
07:14 - equation and as computer scientists
07:18 - luck is not a variable we like to deal
07:20 - with data okay probability odds things
07:23 - we can change but luck not so much
07:26 - and for me i wanted to be able to to
07:29 - change this number and
07:32 - for you the opportunity is there every
07:35 - day
07:36 - we are improving the odds with our kids
07:38 - when teachers introduce them to our of
07:41 - code when schools and districts scrape
07:43 - money together to get a computer
07:45 - scientist on their payroll and every day
07:49 - we can change a kid's life by saying to
07:51 - them hey have you ever thought about
07:54 - pursuing a degree
07:56 - and hey have you ever thought about
07:58 - going after coding and learning how to
08:00 - code
08:01 - so it's really incumbent upon all of us
08:03 - to to change that equation
08:06 - um
08:08 - in computer science
08:09 - or sorry
08:11 - code.org is all about
08:14 - really it's all about changing that
08:16 - equation leveling the playing field for
08:18 - all of these young kids it's why
08:20 - microsoft is so deeply involved in the
08:23 - program we're a founding member of it
08:25 - and we're continuing to embrace that
08:27 - vision because every child should have
08:29 - the opportunity to be able to change the
08:32 - world and coding is one way that they
08:33 - can do that no matter where she was born
08:36 - no matter who her parents are no matter
08:38 - what hallway she walked down to get
08:40 - there so thanks very much i hope you
08:41 - enjoy the rest of the day
08:43 - [Applause]
08:53 - thank you peggy
08:54 - and now i would like to introduce you to
08:57 - susan wojcicki susan wojcicki is the ceo
08:59 - of youtube the world's most popular
09:01 - digital video platform used by over a
09:04 - billion people across the globe to
09:06 - access information share video and shape
09:08 - culture an early champion of online
09:11 - video who was instrumental in google's
09:13 - 2006 acquisition of youtube susan now
09:16 - oversees youtube's content and business
09:18 - operations engineering and product
09:20 - development please join me in welcoming
09:22 - susan to the stage
09:24 - [Applause]
09:30 - all right
09:31 - so good morning everyone i'm thrilled to
09:33 - be here at this very special event
09:36 - and be here among students and educators
09:40 - administrators tech leaders celebrating
09:42 - something that just does not get enough
09:44 - attention that should get a lot more
09:47 - attention which is computer science
09:49 - education
09:50 - um so let me tell you my own story which
09:52 - in some ways is actually similar to
09:54 - peggy's story about how i developed my
09:57 - own passion for computer science
10:00 - so as a kid i was always doing creative
10:02 - projects drawing painting
10:05 - candle making
10:07 - mosaic making paper making you know all
10:10 - those favorite all those little art kits
10:12 - they sell in the store for kids i
10:14 - probably you know always wanted to do
10:16 - every single one of them
10:18 - the thing is i had never connected that
10:20 - computer science was actually a creative
10:23 - way of making
10:26 - services products
10:27 - that had the impact to change the world
10:30 - so
10:31 - um what happened to me was i didn't
10:34 - pursue it i actually have a degree in
10:36 - history and literature
10:37 - and
10:38 - my senior year in college
10:40 - i
10:42 - by accident
10:43 - interned
10:44 - at a startup
10:46 - i actually worked for this temporary
10:48 - service i used to come home from college
10:50 - and say
10:51 - just send me wherever you want sometimes
10:53 - they sent me to lawyers office doctor's
10:55 - offices everywhere and one time by
10:57 - accident i was sent to a startup and
11:00 - after i was there for a few days i
11:02 - realized wow there's something
11:03 - interesting here and i was answering the
11:05 - phone at this place and i thought you
11:07 - know i actually would like to do more
11:08 - than answer the phone i think i could do
11:10 - the same type of work as the people here
11:12 - in the office how do i do that
11:14 - i'm going to take a computer science
11:15 - class
11:17 - now i was a senior in college writing my
11:19 - thesis studying history and literature
11:22 - and i thought surely it is too late for
11:24 - me because i'm 20 and i'm a senior and
11:28 - my life has already been decided um and
11:31 - i just can't change but i had a friend
11:34 - and she was taking a computer science
11:36 - class and i always think back to that
11:38 - about how influential everyone can be
11:40 - whether they're a student if you're an
11:42 - eighth grader you can influence a sixth
11:43 - grader so my friend was taking a
11:45 - computer science class and i thought you
11:46 - know if she's taking it i can probably
11:49 - take it so here i was i signed up for
11:51 - computer science my senior year as a
11:53 - history and literature major um and took
11:55 - it and that's how i discovered my
11:57 - passion for computer science
12:01 - uh
12:02 - um
12:04 - it was it was amazing to me that this
12:06 - one class
12:07 - really changed my life
12:09 - and i'm always grateful and think wow my
12:11 - life could have been very different if i
12:13 - hadn't had that one experience in that
12:15 - one class now i was very lucky to take
12:18 - this class
12:19 - but in today's world where technology is
12:22 - changing every single thing we do it
12:24 - shouldn't be about a matter of luck
12:27 - computer science actually does a lot in
12:30 - data as we talked about and
12:32 - computer science is something that
12:34 - should be available to all students
12:38 - students also shouldn't have to wait
12:39 - until college
12:41 - i'm amazed the way a two-year-old can
12:42 - pick up a phone
12:44 - and figure out how to use it our kids
12:46 - today are digital natives they should
12:48 - have the access to learning computer
12:49 - science today in their school
12:52 - but many kids do not have that
12:54 - opportunity google commissioned a study
12:57 - and it showed that only 40 percent
12:59 - of kids in k-12 schools in the u.s offer
13:02 - computer science class and have access
13:04 - to them
13:06 - and as low as that number is the good
13:08 - news is it's an improvement because two
13:10 - years ago the number was only ten
13:12 - percent um so it shows that we can make
13:14 - progress when we focus on it and i do
13:16 - think code.org definitely had something
13:18 - to do with raising the number from 10 to
13:20 - 40 percent but we still have 60 the
13:23 - majority of kids still are not getting
13:25 - computer science and that's why there's
13:27 - so much important work left to do
13:30 - now it also has an impact on diversity
13:33 - the ap exam for computer science has the
13:36 - worst racial diversity of any ap course
13:40 - only 22 percent of students who take the
13:42 - course are students of color
13:45 - and black students in particular are
13:47 - less likely to have access to computer
13:49 - science classes compared to white and
13:51 - hispanic students so unless we make
13:53 - computer science something that is
13:55 - available to everybody
13:57 - we risk making these racial disparities
13:59 - worse
14:01 - now on the other hand if we provide it
14:03 - to everyone we also have an opportunity
14:05 - to benefit everyone and if you look at
14:07 - the economy you look at the importance
14:09 - that technology and tech jobs play in
14:11 - our society there are nearly half a
14:13 - million open computing jobs in the u.s
14:16 - in every
14:17 - state in every industry and they are
14:19 - projected to grow at twice the rate
14:22 - so we have a chance to enable all kids
14:24 - no matter where their background is
14:27 - where they come from which family they
14:29 - grew up with their only child or 15 one
14:31 - of 15
14:33 - to give them the opportunity to have
14:35 - these experiences
14:37 - google has been working to provide
14:40 - funding to non-profits to expand coding
14:42 - in schools we have our made for code
14:45 - initiative to inspire girls to take
14:47 - coding and as part of cs week we're
14:49 - encouraging students to also try the
14:50 - hour of code and we're doing a project
14:53 - to build a holiday emoji so if you're
14:55 - looking for a good project to do with
14:56 - your kid
14:58 - this is one and you can create your own
14:59 - google logo with the special coding
15:01 - activity and we also have a google
15:03 - doodle that encourages people to
15:06 - solve a puzzle using simple block
15:09 - block coding
15:10 - so i'm very happy to be here kicking off
15:12 - this week i can't emphasize enough how
15:14 - important this area is for every kid out
15:18 - there in the future and for our
15:20 - community our society our country
15:24 - and the opportunity to enable all those
15:26 - great kids out there in the world to
15:27 - really be the next leaders in technology
15:29 - and to make a difference for our world
15:31 - so thank you for being here i'm excited
15:33 - to kick off all the projects that we're
15:34 - going to be doing together thank you
15:39 - [Applause]
15:43 - thank you susan
15:45 - and now please join me in welcoming
15:46 - sheryl sandberg
15:48 - the chief operating officer at facebook
15:51 - cheryl has overseen facebook's business
15:53 - operations as ceo for the past nine
15:56 - years when she joined in 2008 facebook
15:59 - had 70 million users and 550 employees
16:02 - the like button had yet to be invented
16:06 - today over 2 billion people around the
16:08 - world chase check facebook every single
16:11 - day and the company employs more than 23
16:14 - 000 people
16:15 - please join me in welcoming cheryl
16:17 - [Applause]
16:25 - well i am so um honored and excited to
16:27 - be here today with this community who
16:29 - are really leading the investment in
16:32 - computer science in our area
16:34 - and we all know how important that is
16:38 - um joining peggy and joining susan i'm
16:41 - grateful for your friendship and your
16:43 - leadership
16:44 - we all are here to make
16:47 - feels weird to have this i guess i could
16:49 - put this
16:50 - i guess i could just put that right in
16:51 - there you see
16:53 - the kind of expertise you get when you
16:55 - work in technology
16:58 - we all know how important this field of
17:00 - study is both in what computer science
17:03 - gives us
17:05 - in terms of the products we build the
17:07 - impact the products have in the world
17:09 - but also opportunity for people
17:12 - i am just so proud of hadi and alice and
17:15 - the team of code.org hattie and ali have
17:18 - been long-term friends of mine really
17:20 - helped me transition
17:22 - to silicon valley and the work code.org
17:24 - is doing which is really transforming
17:26 - education and giving millions of
17:28 - students who otherwise would have no
17:30 - access and no exposure to computer
17:32 - science i really believe can change our
17:34 - country so congratulations to both of
17:36 - you and your team for your leadership
17:43 - the thing about jobs and technology is
17:46 - they are incredibly high impact
17:48 - incredibly high paying and incredibly
17:50 - flexible
17:51 - and when you think about what people
17:53 - entering the workforce want they really
17:54 - want the ability to make a difference
17:56 - and i think all of us in this room know
17:58 - that there's probably no better field to
18:01 - do that than the field of technology
18:03 - people also want in increasingly
18:05 - economic uncertain times
18:08 - job stability and the ability to know
18:10 - that they can always get a job and no
18:13 - matter what's happening really in any
18:15 - economy right now anywhere in the world
18:17 - the people who have more than full
18:19 - employment are the people with these
18:21 - technical degrees despite all of the
18:23 - concerns about unemployment we have in
18:26 - our economy and so many others
18:28 - there is a huge gap in unfilled
18:32 - technology jobs not just here but all
18:34 - around the world so if we're looking for
18:36 - the answer for economic growth for
18:38 - financial stability for families
18:41 - getting more of our children into these
18:43 - fields we know is a huge part of the
18:45 - answer
18:46 - it's also the case that when i think
18:48 - about what families need women and men
18:51 - to be flexible to have both careers and
18:54 - personal lives so that women are no
18:56 - longer no longer say to women you can't
18:58 - do both something we never say to men
19:01 - these are
19:02 - always these are almost always
19:05 - the most flexible jobs you can have we
19:08 - used to have a joke at facebook that we
19:10 - and it's not sure anymore but for many
19:12 - many years we had this unbelievable
19:14 - programmer that really no one had ever
19:16 - met
19:17 - because he didn't like to work in the
19:18 - office with other people
19:20 - but he was
19:22 - unbelievably productive
19:24 - and for people in this field who are
19:26 - unbelievably productive the type of
19:29 - flexibility we are willing to offer them
19:31 - and all the companies are willing to
19:32 - offer them
19:33 - shows how you can really integrate both
19:36 - a personal life and a professional life
19:38 - so really on any metric on anything we
19:41 - care about whether it's society or
19:43 - opportunity or impact or having jobs or
19:45 - being able to balance work and family
19:48 - this is an unbelievable field
19:50 - the problem is we do not give equal
19:53 - access to people to get in there 98
19:57 - of the people majoring in computer
19:59 - science and colleges were exposed to
20:01 - computer science before they went to
20:03 - college
20:04 - that's an amazing statistic and that
20:06 - shows how important the work code.org
20:08 - and so many people in this room are
20:10 - doing we also have to think about
20:13 - not just getting the usual suspects into
20:15 - this field but getting everyone into
20:17 - this field
20:18 - women were 35 of computer science majors
20:21 - in the 1980s it's 18
20:24 - today
20:25 - many years ago i hosted a summer party
20:27 - for
20:28 - a bunch of the facebook summer interns
20:30 - and there were so many boys like eight
20:32 - years ago and i said to one of them like
20:33 - where are all the girls and he looked up
20:36 - at me and said
20:37 - there are more daves than girls in my
20:40 - major in college and i looked at him i
20:43 - thought he was joking he was like no i
20:44 - counted
20:45 - there are this many people named dave
20:47 - and this many girls majoring in computer
20:50 - science at my school
20:51 - that's a problem and unfortunately one
20:53 - we are not making progress against
20:56 - same situation for the black and
20:57 - hispanic community is only 15 percent of
21:00 - the people majoring in these fields are
21:02 - black or hispanic and so what we need is
21:05 - equal access to computer science
21:07 - education and to motivate and excite
21:10 - everyone and let them know that this is
21:12 - a field they can excel in
21:14 - this is a field where they can really
21:16 - achieve and this is important so that we
21:18 - get to equal representation so that the
21:21 - products we build reflect the diversity
21:24 - not just of the people who use them but
21:26 - of the people who build them
21:28 - this is a really big priority for
21:30 - facebook we are putting large
21:33 - investments into funding into training
21:35 - support and jobs
21:36 - uh there we have lots and lots and lots
21:38 - of programs but i'll mention two i'm
21:39 - most proud of the first is we launched
21:42 - computer science and engineering lean in
21:44 - circles with facebook linkedin the anita
21:47 - borg foundation and my foundation the
21:49 - lean in foundation and the idea lean in
21:51 - circles are small groups
21:53 - that meet to support each other
21:56 - i think eight or ten people even though
21:58 - we have one in houston that they say
22:00 - they have 200 and they say everything's
22:02 - bigger in texas so they don't have eight
22:03 - they have 200. but it's any group of
22:06 - women or men who meet once a month
22:07 - together using the materials we provide
22:10 - for free to lean in to support each
22:12 - other in their ambitions a few years ago
22:14 - we launched computer science and
22:16 - engineering specific lean in circles
22:18 - to solve the problem for girls that they
22:20 - are surrounded by daves and not by girls
22:24 - so if there's only a few girls or one in
22:26 - their computer science
22:28 - class they're in a group that meets
22:30 - regularly to support them we now have
22:32 - over 250 circles and we're covering a
22:35 - huge number of campuses and we're
22:37 - grateful for the opportunity to work
22:39 - with those folks
22:40 - we also are working on tech prep with
22:42 - mckinsey we really studied what leads to
22:44 - a computer science path
22:46 - 90 of parents who want their children to
22:49 - learn cs but 77 have no idea how to
22:52 - pursue it so this is an online resource
22:55 - hub designed to reach parents we've now
22:57 - reached 1 million people in 50 states
23:00 - and i know that google and microsoft and
23:01 - other companies are talking about making
23:03 - really important investments and again
23:05 - i'm so grateful to susan and peggy for
23:07 - the partnership our companies have had
23:09 - on this
23:10 - we're at the beginning of our journey
23:13 - and the opportunity for us to come here
23:15 - and celebrate the people in this
23:16 - community who are leading who are making
23:19 - computer science accessible and open to
23:22 - the usual suspects we want everyone but
23:24 - also to more women and traditionally
23:27 - underrepresented minorities
23:29 - i'm really grateful
23:31 - when i think about all the problems we
23:33 - face and there are real problems right
23:34 - now i think about what makes me
23:37 - optimistic
23:39 - and what is core to being a technologist
23:43 - is that we believe that the future will
23:45 - be better than the past
23:47 - not perfect not the technology will
23:49 - solve every problem not the technology
23:51 - doesn't cause some of the problems we're
23:53 - realists and we understand all that
23:55 - but we believe fundamentally deep in our
23:58 - hearts
23:59 - that the power of technology is one that
24:01 - lifts people out of poverty gives people
24:02 - opportunity and brings us closer
24:04 - together
24:06 - and
24:06 - that will continue to happen due to the
24:08 - great work of the people in this room
24:10 - for which we are super grateful thank
24:12 - you
24:15 - [Applause]
24:23 - thank you cheryl

36:41 - milestone we just passed 10 million
36:44 - girls who have created accounts on our
36:46 - platform and to put that in perspective
36:48 - that's a lot of girls to put that in
36:50 - perspective
36:52 - cheryl was talking about the lack of
36:53 - diversity in our universities if just
36:56 - one percent of the girls who coded on
36:59 - code.org in the last year were to go on
37:01 - and study computer science in college
37:04 - that would more than make up for the
37:06 - gender gap that we have today so uh you
37:09 - know and the work that this has come
37:11 - from is really all due to the teachers
37:13 - um who are bringing this to our
37:15 - classroom every day so i want to one
37:17 - last round of applause to those teachers

37:30 - announcements and we saved the best for
37:32 - last
37:33 - we heard about all the international
37:35 - governments doing work for computer
37:37 - science and i'm glad to let you know
37:40 - that right here in the u.s we also have
37:43 - governments making new policies for
37:45 - computer science to tell us more about
37:46 - this i'd like to introduce cameron
37:48 - wilson he's our chief operating officer

38:02 - thank you alice i appreciate the chance
38:04 - to be here this morning the movement to
38:06 - bring computer science into our schools
38:08 - uh also means we need to update state
38:10 - policies to sustain this momentum for
38:12 - years to come
38:14 - policy leaders incl increasingly
38:16 - recognize every student should have the
38:18 - opportunity to take high quality
38:20 - computer science in k-12 this will
38:22 - unlock innovation opportunity and
38:24 - economic growth in their communities and
38:26 - enable students regardless of their
38:28 - gender race or background to participate
38:31 - in our rapidly growing digital economy
38:34 - and at a time when our country is
38:35 - divided this issue can also heal this
38:38 - divide political leaders from both major
38:41 - parties are working together to pass
38:43 - computer science policies
38:45 - as a result
38:47 - in the past four years 40 states have
38:49 - enacted policies to expand computer
38:51 - science education
38:53 - and i am pleased to announce new policy
38:55 - pledges this week from states to expand
38:58 - k-12 computer science governor scott in
39:00 - florida has pledged 15 million dollars
39:03 - for k-12 computer science professional
39:05 - development for the state's teachers
39:08 - the hawaiian state department of
39:09 - education is committed to a process to
39:12 - review and update its k-12 computer
39:14 - science standards
39:15 - and today the governors of alabama
39:18 - montana pennsylvania north dakota and
39:22 - indiana are all joining the governor's
39:24 - partnership for k-12 computer science
39:26 - education
39:27 - this bipartisan coalition of governors
39:30 - now 14 strong
39:32 - are all committed to working toward
39:34 - three goals in their states
39:36 - first that at least every high school
39:38 - will offer a computer science course
39:41 - second there will be funding for
39:42 - professional learning for computer
39:44 - science teachers
39:46 - third that the state will have rigorous
39:48 - k-12 computer science standards
39:50 - and now i'm pleased to introduce three
39:52 - governors who couldn't be here today but
39:54 - wanted to send a personal message by
39:55 - video with their new commitments to this
39:58 - movement
40:05 - hi this is governor asa hutchinson of
40:07 - the great state of arkansas from the
40:10 - moment my 11 year old granddaughter
40:12 - helped me to understand the importance
40:13 - of computer science for our future
40:16 - it has been a priority for me in the
40:18 - first month of my administration
40:20 - arkansas became the first state in the
40:22 - nation to require all public high
40:24 - schools to teach computer coding
40:27 - with the support of anthony owen my
40:29 - director of computer science and our
40:31 - educators statewide arkansas continues
40:34 - to lead the way in computer coding
40:36 - education one of our highly successful
40:39 - initiatives was to provide two thousand
40:42 - dollars stipends for high school
40:44 - teachers to learn to teach coding
40:46 - the enrollment in coding classes has
40:48 - increased dramatically
40:50 - teacher preparation is key to any
40:52 - successful educational initiative so
40:55 - with that success under our wings i am
40:58 - pleased to announce that arkansas is
41:00 - allocating five hundred thousand dollars
41:03 - of its computer science initiative
41:05 - budget to fund a first of its kind
41:07 - program to provide a two thousand dollar
41:09 - stipend for elementary and middle school
41:12 - teachers who train to become
41:14 - computer science lead teachers i'm proud
41:17 - to lead the state that is leading the
41:19 - way in computer science in his schools
41:22 - thank you
41:30 - hi i'm steve bullock governor montana
41:33 - montana's technology sector continues to
41:35 - grow we're seeing an increased demand
41:38 - for workers trained in computer science
41:40 - fields
41:42 - it's projected we'll need to fill nearly
41:44 - 30 000 computer science jobs over these
41:47 - next 10 years
41:49 - at the same time more and more jobs in
41:51 - all sectors require employees with
41:53 - strong problem solving and critical
41:56 - thinking skills that are integral to
41:58 - stem and computer science training
42:01 - we're serious about preparing montana
42:03 - students for these high demand and high
42:05 - paying jobs which is why i'm pleased to

42:58 - to be the home of such cutting-edge
43:00 - companies like eli lilly cook and
43:02 - cummins
43:03 - and today we are one of the fastest
43:06 - growing states for tech employment
43:09 - indiana knows that computer science is a
43:11 - foundational subject that touches all
43:14 - areas of study and fields of work and we
43:16 - are proud to be one of the first states
43:18 - to embed computer science in our k
43:21 - through 8 standards
43:23 - but we need to continue to expand access
43:25 - to help ensure that all hoosiers are
43:27 - equipped with the tools they need to
43:29 - succeed in today's rapidly evolving
43:32 - economy
43:33 - that's why i am proud to announce that a
43:36 - key piece of my 2018 next level agenda
43:40 - is to require all k through 12 schools
43:42 - across indiana to offer computer science
43:45 - by 2021
43:47 - and that we provide the resources
43:49 - necessary for professional development
43:51 - so that we have the teachers in the
43:53 - classroom that will allow us to meet
43:55 - this goal
43:57 - i am also pleased to announce that i am
43:59 - joining the governors for computer
44:01 - science partnership a bipartisan

44:10 - colleagues to help advocate for policies
44:12 - that expand computer science education
44:16 - thank you for all you're doing to
44:17 - support computer science education i'm
44:21 - excited for what this means for the
44:22 - future of our state
44:29 - let's give a round of applause for our
44:31 - uh state level commitments we really
44:33 - appreciate entire states getting behind
44:35 - this movement so thank you
44:41 - so since we're in california for this
44:43 - kickoff we're very excited to have one
44:45 - of the state's top leaders with us today
44:48 - lieutenant governor gavin newsom is here
44:50 - to help
44:51 - share what steps california is taking to
44:53 - expand computer science education for
44:56 - every student
44:58 - lieutenant governor newsom was elected
44:59 - as lieutenant governor of california in
45:01 - 2010
45:02 - after serving as mayor of san francisco
45:05 - for eight years
45:06 - as a member of the san francisco board
45:08 - of supervisors
45:10 - and then as mayor of san francisco and
45:12 - now as lieutenant governor of california
45:14 - who's been in leadership for a long time
45:16 - in the state
45:17 - new lieutenant governor newsom has been
45:19 - a national leader on issues of equity
45:21 - the environment homelessness healthcare
45:24 - policies he has initiated and
45:26 - implemented have been duplicated in
45:28 - cities across the united states
45:31 - now as lieutenant governor and in his
45:32 - role as the university
45:35 - uh
45:36 - as a university of california regent
45:38 - and cal state university trustee he's
45:41 - pushing to expand computer science
45:43 - education
45:44 - in
45:45 - our universities and k-12 classrooms so
45:47 - please
45:49 - provide a warm round of applause in
45:51 - welcoming lieutenant governor newsom to
45:52 - the stage
45:54 - [Applause]
45:58 - so i guess you guys did that purposely
46:00 - you rub it in with arkansas and indiana
46:02 - which trust me
46:04 - that ain't easy sitting here
46:06 - listening to those governors get ahead
46:08 - of california i i'm going to spare
46:10 - montana because i got married there and
46:12 - my daughter's name montana
46:14 - but i admire
46:16 - and appreciate their leadership and the
46:18 - question is where's california we've got
46:20 - to step up our game
46:22 - we haven't been out front we love to say
46:24 - about our state the future happened
46:26 - future happened here first but not as it
46:28 - relates to
46:30 - requiring computer science in all of our
46:34 - high schools
46:35 - we're actually trailing we've been
46:37 - falling behind
46:38 - and as you all know in a world where
46:40 - tech is racing ahead
46:42 - if education falls behind
46:45 - where does that leave us with more
46:47 - acuity in terms of wealth gaps more
46:49 - acuity in terms of income gaps more
46:52 - questions about the issues of social
46:55 - mobility the issues that i would argue
46:57 - disproportionately will define our times
47:00 - not as a way to begrudge other people's
47:02 - success but as a framework of a paradigm
47:05 - a gap that must be mined particularly in
47:08 - california the wealthiest and the
47:11 - poorest state in america eight million
47:14 - people i want to remind you living below
47:16 - the poverty line in the state of
47:17 - california when you look at the
47:18 - supplemental poverty index no state has
47:21 - more children
47:22 - living below the poverty line in the
47:24 - state of california this bifurcated
47:27 - hybrid reality a coastal economy and one
47:30 - struggling in the inland part of the
47:32 - state disproportionately so rather than
47:34 - lamenting about it we're here doing
47:36 - something about it and i want to just
47:38 - congratulate peggy and susan and cheryl
47:41 - code.org the great work of julie and
47:44 - access and all the enlightened
47:46 - leadership in this room for forcing us
47:50 - to get our act together to get out front
47:53 - and to advance an initiative we call
47:55 - cs4ca
47:58 - and that's simply this a goal
48:00 - a very comprehensive goal at scale
48:03 - respectfully the governors of those
48:05 - other states at scale
48:07 - to require cs in every high school in
48:11 - the state of california by
48:13 - 2025. we can achieve that
48:16 - and we are now committed to achieving
48:18 - that the governor just signed a bill
48:20 - i know program passing is not problem
48:22 - solving but we passed at least a
48:24 - commitment to establish a framework
48:28 - a strategic framework to implement a
48:31 - strategy with equity at the foundational
48:34 - principle of a paradigm
48:36 - 27
48:38 - that's the number of girls that took ap
48:41 - computer science last year that's it
48:43 - just 27
48:45 - of the 10 plus thousand people that took
48:47 - it in 2016 and this is jaw-dropping
48:50 - less than 150 african-americans
48:54 - 10 plus thousand people took ap computer
48:57 - science in the state of california less
48:58 - than 150
49:00 - were african-american but less than 1500
49:02 - by the way latino
49:04 - it's a majority minority state
49:07 - cannot have this conversation without
49:08 - having the question of equity being
49:11 - front and center that's the question we
49:12 - need to answer that's the question that
49:15 - will define our success or failure in
49:17 - these initiatives so we're going to step
49:20 - up our game we're going to make
49:22 - financial commitments we've got
49:24 - audacious goals that we will reach
49:27 - we have the core competency reflected in
49:30 - the work that all of you have been doing
49:32 - on this issue and we have the imperative
49:34 - in closing and that is the recognition
49:37 - that the plumbing of the world is
49:39 - radically changed
49:40 - you all know this we're going from
49:42 - something old to something new someone
49:44 - described it the other day as paralysis
49:47 - contrasted by rebirth
49:49 - when they described the taxicab industry
49:52 - versus uber and lyft and others
49:55 - it's a world where we ain't seen nothing
49:58 - yet
49:59 - you know that better than i the
50:00 - combinatorial nature of technology the
50:03 - stacking of technologies what's
50:05 - happening in this space
50:07 - is going to create conditions where the
50:10 - urgency of this moment
50:12 - cannot be underscored and so i just want
50:15 - to again compliment all of you for your
50:17 - guidance your wisdom your faith devotion
50:20 - to cause for
50:21 - problem solving uh and
50:24 - for the innovative spirit that defines
50:26 - the best of this state it's time to move
50:30 - away from downloading apps to have our
50:32 - kids start designing apps
50:34 - moving away from just plain on your
50:37 - phone to start actually programming that
50:40 - phone that's the spirit of this moment
50:42 - that's the spirit of this movement and
50:44 - that's a spirit that defines at least
50:47 - my modest participation uh here today
50:50 - thank you all very very much
51:02 - wow it's uh great to see states
51:04 - competing with each other to uh outdo
51:06 - each other for computer science uh we
51:08 - like to foster that competitive the
51:10 - competitive spirit of code.org so we
51:12 - appreciate the commitments to california

60:30 - because your parents were overprotective
60:33 - well i don't have a device's hearing
60:36 - parents less awkward and more cool but
60:38 - what i do have is a device that lets
60:40 - your parents know where you are when
60:42 - you're for a jog this way your parents
60:44 - will know that you indeed are running
60:47 - and nothing else
60:50 - it alerts your parents if you ever feel
60:51 - unsafe about your surroundings or
60:53 - location and it is waterproof i mean
60:56 - come on that deserves a round of
60:58 - applause
61:00 - [Applause]
61:04 - and for you ladies that want to track
61:06 - your husbands this works too
61:11 - okay so
61:13 - i
61:14 - i actually thought about this idea when
61:16 - i was laying in bed thinking to myself
61:18 - oh how am i going to survive running
61:20 - 26.2 miles without getting extra
61:22 - practicing i asked my mom if she could
61:25 - go out and roam with me but she was
61:27 - tired from coming home from work and
61:28 - wouldn't um and didn't let me run by
61:30 - myself because she thought our neighbor
61:32 - our neighborhood was unsafe so that's
61:34 - how i came up with find you
61:38 - might be thinking what is the find you
61:39 - app well it is an app that connects to
61:42 - our wristband
61:43 - which every wristband has a unique code
61:45 - you enter and you only have to log in
61:46 - once and we also pair it up with google
61:48 - maps to find your
61:50 - wristband's exact location
61:55 - hi my name is angela garcia and i'm the
61:57 - founder
61:58 - hi my name is crystal reynaga and i'm
61:59 - the ceo of find you run free
62:08 - you're shaking dude i'm shaking
62:10 - [Applause]
62:15 - thank you angela and crystal i think you
62:16 - guys are ready to go into business right
62:18 - now so that's awesome can we get another
62:20 - round of applause for them thank you so
62:21 - much
62:24 - thank you
62:25 - [Applause]
62:28 - and finally to kick off cs education
62:31 - week we have a special special message
62:34 - from melinda gates
62:36 - i wanted to be with you in person
62:38 - especially after i saw the program what
62:41 - an amazing group of leaders
62:43 - but i'm grateful for the opportunity to
62:45 - thank every single teacher
62:48 - mentor and policy maker who is helping
62:51 - students fall in love with computers and
62:53 - technology
62:54 - you're changing lives and i know that's
62:57 - true because i still remember the
62:58 - teacher who changed my life mrs bauer
63:02 - in 1982 she saw the apple ii computer at
63:05 - a math teachers conference and she
63:08 - persuaded the head of our school to buy
63:10 - one and then inspired me to imagine a
63:13 - different future
63:15 - that kind of inspiration and imagination
63:18 - is even more important today than it was
63:20 - back in the 1980s
63:23 - computer literacy is now an essential
63:25 - skill
63:26 - along with reading writing and
63:28 - arithmetic
63:29 - every student and i mean every student
63:32 - needs to learn his or her way around a
63:34 - computer but computer science education
63:36 - does even more than change lives it also
63:39 - changes the world
63:41 - it gives young people the power to build
63:43 - the future and the more we encourage
63:46 - different kinds of people to get
63:48 - interested in technology the better that
63:50 - future will be
63:52 - innovation happens when we approach
63:54 - urgent challenges from every different
63:56 - point of view bringing women and
63:59 - underrepresented minorities into the
64:01 - field guarantees that we see the full
64:04 - range of solutions to the real problems
64:07 - that people face in the world
64:09 - so one of the reasons i'm so optimistic
64:12 - about the future is that technology can
64:15 - make the impossible
64:17 - possible
64:18 - but only if we're all involved in the
64:21 - effort
64:22 - and that's what cs education is all
64:24 - about i hope you're leaving this event
64:27 - feeling motivated there's a big bright
64:30 - future waiting for our young women and
64:33 - young men
64:34 - together we can help them seize it
64:38 - thank you
64:40 - [Applause]
64:45 - and with that i think we can all say
64:47 - that computer science education week is
64:49 - officially kicked off in the one hour we
64:52 - have been here hundreds of thousands of
64:54 - students around the world have begun
64:56 - their first hour of code in their
64:59 - classroom so i want to say thank you to
65:01 - all of the classrooms joining us over
65:03 - the live stream and i want to wish you
65:05 - all a happy computer science education
65:08 - week
65:10 - and now if you're in the room i also
65:12 - want to let you know that we've got a
65:14 - computer science curriculum showcase
65:17 - with 17 curriculum and professional
65:19 - development partners
65:20 - you're all welcome to go
65:22 - check it out it's right over there
65:24 - and learn about different ways that you
65:25 - can bring computer science to your
65:27 - school or classroom thank you all for
65:29 - joining us
65:39 - maybe we'll get it done
69:25 - you

Cleaned transcript:

computer science education week and the hour of code for the representatives from those groups who are here today can you raise your hands can we get a round of applause for all of the people on these committees lastly to the cs teachers who are tuning in over the live stream with your classrooms the work that you are doing in the classroom every day is the most important part of this movement thank you truly for the work you are doing to bring computer science to your classrooms can we get a round of applause for the teachers now in the past we've kicked off computer science education week with world leaders such as barack obama and justin trudeau this year we're honored to be in silicon valley with leading women in tech susan cheryl and peggy johnson now the they are amazing but the computer science education sorry women in computer science actually goes back to the very beginning computer science education week is held in december every year to commemorate two women ada lovelace who was born on december 10 1815 and designed the very first computer program and grace hopper who was born almost 100 years later on december 9 1906 and has been a pioneer in the field of computer science while the tech industry today is mostly male the teacherled movement to bring computer science to our classrooms is dominated by women in our workshops we see that about 86 percent of the teachers attending to teach computer science to their classrooms are women and we have leading women who are inspiring running the organizations many organizations in this space including deborah seahorn who is currently running the computer science teachers association and is here today and we'll get to hear from her later now for hundreds yes for debra absolutely for hundreds of thousands of teachers around the world their journey began with an hour of code during computer science education week this week and at this point over the last four years we've had four hundred thousand four hundred million hours of code done around the world and this week we're going to hit 500 million hours of code served but an hour is only the beginning and most of the teachers go beyond an hour to teach years of computer science in their classrooms in the last four years we've seen incredible momentum we've had over 120 school districts start teaching computer science we've had 40 states pass policies to support computer science and a dozen countries have added computer science to their national curriculum that is only the beginning and today with the announcements you're going to hear today you're going to see how fast this is growing at this point the computer science education movement is the fastest growing movement in the history of education now to kick off this worldwide event i'm pleased to have peggy johnson susan wojcicki and sheryl sandberg here today i'd like to first introduce peggy johnson an executive vice president of business development at microsoft peggy oversees microsoft's partnerships acquisitions and venture fund previously peggy spent 24 years at qualcomm in leadership positions across engineering sales and business development she has been recognized by multiple organizations including business insider as the number one most powerful female engineer in 2017. please join me in welcoming peggy johnson how about this one how about this one there you go y'all can hear me thank you uh alice and hottie very much it's um on behalf of microsoft it's a real honor to be here and to celebrate the wonderful code.org community um co.org's mission is deeply personal to me i am an engineer at college i learned a code and my first job outside of college was coding and computer science has in many ways been the foundation of my career it's really changed my life but i have to say um it almost was an accident it wasn't supposed to be that way and i'll give you a little bit of the back story on that i am one of 15 kids so i have 14 brothers and sisters in my family um there's a little bit irish catholic in there that's how that happened um but i had the uh the unenviable position i wasn't the oldest i wasn't the youngest i was one of the 13 in the middle so for those of you who remember the brady bunch i definitely had some jan brady syndrome but my parents had two rules um one you had to go to college and two you had to pay for it yourself so uh following my older brothers and sisters as younger siblings do they had already uh gone off to college and many of them had become business majors and so i just sort of followed in their footsteps went off to san diego state got a job on campus and started my what i thought was going to be my my business degree and one day i find myself delivering a package to the engineering department a place i have never been to before in my life i didn't even know where it was i'd ask people how to get there so i walk in and i struck up a conversation with the two executive assistants who were behind the desk and who were strangely so excited to see me and what i didn't realize is they'd just been having a conversation about how they could get more women into engineering and the sad fact was they just they they tried they just couldn't get more in and all of a sudden i showed up in front of them so these two ladies they went to work on me they sat me down on the clock by the way and they said so what are you studying you know what are you going to be do you like math and science have you ever considered seeking a degree in engineering and frankly to be really honest no i didn't even really know what engineers did to tell you the truth there was no engineers in my family growing up there you know it was business majors and these two ladies just started working on me and working on me and i remember something that still resonates with me today they said the world will be your oyster if you pursue an engineering degree and the next morning i woke up changed my major to engineering and i tell you this story because it has a lot to do with luck when i looked around at my classes they were it was under 10 and the double e department were women i was i was just there by pure luck because of this package i had dropped off and frankly the the issue is that for too many of our young women today for too many of our young people of color for too many young people all together luck is still too much a part of the equation and as computer scientists luck is not a variable we like to deal with data okay probability odds things we can change but luck not so much and for me i wanted to be able to to change this number and for you the opportunity is there every day we are improving the odds with our kids when teachers introduce them to our of code when schools and districts scrape money together to get a computer scientist on their payroll and every day we can change a kid's life by saying to them hey have you ever thought about pursuing a degree and hey have you ever thought about going after coding and learning how to code so it's really incumbent upon all of us to to change that equation um in computer science or sorry code.org is all about really it's all about changing that equation leveling the playing field for all of these young kids it's why microsoft is so deeply involved in the program we're a founding member of it and we're continuing to embrace that vision because every child should have the opportunity to be able to change the world and coding is one way that they can do that no matter where she was born no matter who her parents are no matter what hallway she walked down to get there so thanks very much i hope you enjoy the rest of the day thank you peggy and now i would like to introduce you to susan wojcicki susan wojcicki is the ceo of youtube the world's most popular digital video platform used by over a billion people across the globe to access information share video and shape culture an early champion of online video who was instrumental in google's 2006 acquisition of youtube susan now oversees youtube's content and business operations engineering and product development please join me in welcoming susan to the stage all right so good morning everyone i'm thrilled to be here at this very special event and be here among students and educators administrators tech leaders celebrating something that just does not get enough attention that should get a lot more attention which is computer science education um so let me tell you my own story which in some ways is actually similar to peggy's story about how i developed my own passion for computer science so as a kid i was always doing creative projects drawing painting candle making mosaic making paper making you know all those favorite all those little art kits they sell in the store for kids i probably you know always wanted to do every single one of them the thing is i had never connected that computer science was actually a creative way of making services products that had the impact to change the world so um what happened to me was i didn't pursue it i actually have a degree in history and literature and my senior year in college i by accident interned at a startup i actually worked for this temporary service i used to come home from college and say just send me wherever you want sometimes they sent me to lawyers office doctor's offices everywhere and one time by accident i was sent to a startup and after i was there for a few days i realized wow there's something interesting here and i was answering the phone at this place and i thought you know i actually would like to do more than answer the phone i think i could do the same type of work as the people here in the office how do i do that i'm going to take a computer science class now i was a senior in college writing my thesis studying history and literature and i thought surely it is too late for me because i'm 20 and i'm a senior and my life has already been decided um and i just can't change but i had a friend and she was taking a computer science class and i always think back to that about how influential everyone can be whether they're a student if you're an eighth grader you can influence a sixth grader so my friend was taking a computer science class and i thought you know if she's taking it i can probably take it so here i was i signed up for computer science my senior year as a history and literature major um and took it and that's how i discovered my passion for computer science uh um it was it was amazing to me that this one class really changed my life and i'm always grateful and think wow my life could have been very different if i hadn't had that one experience in that one class now i was very lucky to take this class but in today's world where technology is changing every single thing we do it shouldn't be about a matter of luck computer science actually does a lot in data as we talked about and computer science is something that should be available to all students students also shouldn't have to wait until college i'm amazed the way a twoyearold can pick up a phone and figure out how to use it our kids today are digital natives they should have the access to learning computer science today in their school but many kids do not have that opportunity google commissioned a study and it showed that only 40 percent of kids in k12 schools in the u.s offer computer science class and have access to them and as low as that number is the good news is it's an improvement because two years ago the number was only ten percent um so it shows that we can make progress when we focus on it and i do think code.org definitely had something to do with raising the number from 10 to 40 percent but we still have 60 the majority of kids still are not getting computer science and that's why there's so much important work left to do now it also has an impact on diversity the ap exam for computer science has the worst racial diversity of any ap course only 22 percent of students who take the course are students of color and black students in particular are less likely to have access to computer science classes compared to white and hispanic students so unless we make computer science something that is available to everybody we risk making these racial disparities worse now on the other hand if we provide it to everyone we also have an opportunity to benefit everyone and if you look at the economy you look at the importance that technology and tech jobs play in our society there are nearly half a million open computing jobs in the u.s in every state in every industry and they are projected to grow at twice the rate so we have a chance to enable all kids no matter where their background is where they come from which family they grew up with their only child or 15 one of 15 to give them the opportunity to have these experiences google has been working to provide funding to nonprofits to expand coding in schools we have our made for code initiative to inspire girls to take coding and as part of cs week we're encouraging students to also try the hour of code and we're doing a project to build a holiday emoji so if you're looking for a good project to do with your kid this is one and you can create your own google logo with the special coding activity and we also have a google doodle that encourages people to solve a puzzle using simple block block coding so i'm very happy to be here kicking off this week i can't emphasize enough how important this area is for every kid out there in the future and for our community our society our country and the opportunity to enable all those great kids out there in the world to really be the next leaders in technology and to make a difference for our world so thank you for being here i'm excited to kick off all the projects that we're going to be doing together thank you thank you susan and now please join me in welcoming sheryl sandberg the chief operating officer at facebook cheryl has overseen facebook's business operations as ceo for the past nine years when she joined in 2008 facebook had 70 million users and 550 employees the like button had yet to be invented today over 2 billion people around the world chase check facebook every single day and the company employs more than 23 000 people please join me in welcoming cheryl well i am so um honored and excited to be here today with this community who are really leading the investment in computer science in our area and we all know how important that is um joining peggy and joining susan i'm grateful for your friendship and your leadership we all are here to make feels weird to have this i guess i could put this i guess i could just put that right in there you see the kind of expertise you get when you work in technology we all know how important this field of study is both in what computer science gives us in terms of the products we build the impact the products have in the world but also opportunity for people i am just so proud of hadi and alice and the team of code.org hattie and ali have been longterm friends of mine really helped me transition to silicon valley and the work code.org is doing which is really transforming education and giving millions of students who otherwise would have no access and no exposure to computer science i really believe can change our country so congratulations to both of you and your team for your leadership the thing about jobs and technology is they are incredibly high impact incredibly high paying and incredibly flexible and when you think about what people entering the workforce want they really want the ability to make a difference and i think all of us in this room know that there's probably no better field to do that than the field of technology people also want in increasingly economic uncertain times job stability and the ability to know that they can always get a job and no matter what's happening really in any economy right now anywhere in the world the people who have more than full employment are the people with these technical degrees despite all of the concerns about unemployment we have in our economy and so many others there is a huge gap in unfilled technology jobs not just here but all around the world so if we're looking for the answer for economic growth for financial stability for families getting more of our children into these fields we know is a huge part of the answer it's also the case that when i think about what families need women and men to be flexible to have both careers and personal lives so that women are no longer no longer say to women you can't do both something we never say to men these are always these are almost always the most flexible jobs you can have we used to have a joke at facebook that we and it's not sure anymore but for many many years we had this unbelievable programmer that really no one had ever met because he didn't like to work in the office with other people but he was unbelievably productive and for people in this field who are unbelievably productive the type of flexibility we are willing to offer them and all the companies are willing to offer them shows how you can really integrate both a personal life and a professional life so really on any metric on anything we care about whether it's society or opportunity or impact or having jobs or being able to balance work and family this is an unbelievable field the problem is we do not give equal access to people to get in there 98 of the people majoring in computer science and colleges were exposed to computer science before they went to college that's an amazing statistic and that shows how important the work code.org and so many people in this room are doing we also have to think about not just getting the usual suspects into this field but getting everyone into this field women were 35 of computer science majors in the 1980s it's 18 today many years ago i hosted a summer party for a bunch of the facebook summer interns and there were so many boys like eight years ago and i said to one of them like where are all the girls and he looked up at me and said there are more daves than girls in my major in college and i looked at him i thought he was joking he was like no i counted there are this many people named dave and this many girls majoring in computer science at my school that's a problem and unfortunately one we are not making progress against same situation for the black and hispanic community is only 15 percent of the people majoring in these fields are black or hispanic and so what we need is equal access to computer science education and to motivate and excite everyone and let them know that this is a field they can excel in this is a field where they can really achieve and this is important so that we get to equal representation so that the products we build reflect the diversity not just of the people who use them but of the people who build them this is a really big priority for facebook we are putting large investments into funding into training support and jobs uh there we have lots and lots and lots of programs but i'll mention two i'm most proud of the first is we launched computer science and engineering lean in circles with facebook linkedin the anita borg foundation and my foundation the lean in foundation and the idea lean in circles are small groups that meet to support each other i think eight or ten people even though we have one in houston that they say they have 200 and they say everything's bigger in texas so they don't have eight they have 200. but it's any group of women or men who meet once a month together using the materials we provide for free to lean in to support each other in their ambitions a few years ago we launched computer science and engineering specific lean in circles to solve the problem for girls that they are surrounded by daves and not by girls so if there's only a few girls or one in their computer science class they're in a group that meets regularly to support them we now have over 250 circles and we're covering a huge number of campuses and we're grateful for the opportunity to work with those folks we also are working on tech prep with mckinsey we really studied what leads to a computer science path 90 of parents who want their children to learn cs but 77 have no idea how to pursue it so this is an online resource hub designed to reach parents we've now reached 1 million people in 50 states and i know that google and microsoft and other companies are talking about making really important investments and again i'm so grateful to susan and peggy for the partnership our companies have had on this we're at the beginning of our journey and the opportunity for us to come here and celebrate the people in this community who are leading who are making computer science accessible and open to the usual suspects we want everyone but also to more women and traditionally underrepresented minorities i'm really grateful when i think about all the problems we face and there are real problems right now i think about what makes me optimistic and what is core to being a technologist is that we believe that the future will be better than the past not perfect not the technology will solve every problem not the technology doesn't cause some of the problems we're realists and we understand all that but we believe fundamentally deep in our hearts that the power of technology is one that lifts people out of poverty gives people opportunity and brings us closer together and that will continue to happen due to the great work of the people in this room for which we are super grateful thank you thank you cheryl now cs education week is not about code.org it's about all of the organizations the district the schools and the teachers who are in this space and helping bring computer science um to all of our students and this week for computer science education week there were more than a hundred different organizations nonprofits districts states countries making pledges to expand computer science now we don't have time to share all of them with you today but i'd like to invite peggy and cheryl back on stage and come on come on up yes um and we're going to read you some of the amazing work that's going on um we're going to start with districts we had over 70 school districts who are making pledges to expand computer science as part of computer science education week cheryl do you want to start by sharing some of those yes we're super excited because pledges which are the announcements of commitments to invest are what uh keep this progress going all right so not too far from us in fresno california the central district pledges to bring cs courses to all students grades 7 through 12. the amazing and the fresno i have more and the fresno unified school district is going to offer cs courses at all 10 of their comprehensive high schools um i think i'll suggest we hold applause till the end because there's so many good things to applaud here we want everyone to feel the applause okay in houston texas the dist where they have large lean in circles and my brother lives which has nothing to do with this at all uh the district is expanding advanced computer science courses to all high school students by the end of the 2018 school year and staying in texas the garland district is going to work over the next three years to provide cs for all k12 students at each of their 72 campuses by 2020 the lincoln public schools in nebraska will offer comprehensive cs education to all 42 000 students and finally hillsborough country public schools which is not hillsboro as i was pointing this way it's in tampa florida we'll expand cs offerings to 27 high schools and 46 middle schools during the coming school year providing access to over 90 000 students hold the applause we have more so in georgia walker county schools is implementing a new cs curriculum in all 16 k through 12 schools reaching over 8 000 students by the year 2020 in weed re4 school district in windsor colorado they pledged to bring cs to all schools in the entire district let's go to michigan where utica community schools is implementing a new cs curriculum in all 11 secondary schools during the 2018 school year which will reach approximately 10 000 students and here in california the riverside district will offer at least one cs course at every high school in the district and the val verde unified school district will bring computer science to all 12 elementary schools and all comprehensive high schools in the district and last but not least in the la unified school district where i grew up in pledges to provide a cs education for 100 of their students by the year 2025. and we have more in austin texas the school district has pledged to reach all students with cs courses by 2019 and across the country boston public schools will teach cs in all 130 schools over the next three years and that's not the only school district that's going to reach all of their students in compton they're bringing cs to every single k12 school and in fontana they are going to offer cs at every high school and launch it across the elementary schools dallas is also making great strides in elementary schools and by 2020 the dallas district has pledged to bring cs to all 150 elementary schools and in nearby fort worth they're going even further in this coming school year not only is the castleberry district providing a comprehensive cs pathway for their 4 000 students but they're also going to make sure that every student has internet access at home can we get a round of applause for all of those districts and the other districts making pledges today to bring computer science now in addition to the 70 school districts there are over 50 nonprofits and universities who are making pledges this week to prepare new middle and high school teachers to begin teaching cs in 2018. again we're going to go through hold your applause we're just going to share some highlights and i'd like to kick it off with cheryl in hawaii women in technology pledges to prepare 60 cs teachers in 2018 in colorado mine spark learning and colorado education initiative are adding another 128 to that number marquette university in wisconsin is going to prepare 160 teachers and our count goes up by 180 with the michigan mathematics and science center network a few more in west virginia university they pledged to prepare 128 teachers by 2018 and here in the bay area alameda county office of education contra costa county office of education and the silicon valley education foundation will add another 146 teachers to their roles the friday institute north carolina will reach 165 teachers and finally next tech in indiana adds 192 teachers keep adding if you're keeping track in dallas the university of texas will be preparing another 96 in illinois luminese adding 118. in arizona the grand canyon university and science foundation arizona are preparing an additional 120 and across montana wyoming and north and south dakota the america campaign and thai will add 384 new teachers now those were just a few examples across all the organizations pledging to prepare new middle and high school teachers we have 4 500 new teachers who are going to begin teaching computer science this year they will reach over 200 000 students every year can we get a round of applause for all of these organizations and it goes beyond professional learning many organizations are doing other work to support computer science including building new courses for these students some highlights who are making announcements today include bootstrap who with support from nsf and bloomberg is creating a new introductory data science course code hs which will launch a new cyber security course and the microbit education foundation which is announcing the release of new lesson plans aligned to code.org's cs fundamentals curriculum many companies are also innovating in how they teach their cs courses for example codeable is announcing it will develop an adaptive learning platform in 2018 using smart data and machine learning to allow every child to learn at their level and according to their interests these organizations and companies are also reaching out to new students and teachers and this is one of my favorites code combat is pledging to expand their partnership with the center for educational excellence and alternative settings to run coding competitions in juvenile justice facilities in 2018 they will teach coding to 1 500 students across 16 juvenile justice facilities and the national math and science initiative is also making an important pledge today to offer ap computer science principles in all high schools they support through their college readiness program by 2021 and given the popularity and just general awesomeness of scratch this is a big one the scratch ed team is pledging to engage over 3 000 educators in participatory professional learning experiences this year adding it up on top of the 70 school districts we have 100 organizations making pledges today let's give them all a round of applause and we're still not done the examples we heard so far were all inside the united states this initiative is worldwide and this movement is global we have announcements from around the world and cheryl do you want to share a couple of them in canada kids code genus and the foundation csdm pledged to bring cs to 28 000 students from ages 8 to 12. in italy program il futuro pledges to bring cs education to 2 million students in italian schools this is a good kind of long speech right i'll think of all this value the malaysia digital economy corporation will work with malaysia's ministry of education to build an educator support group for 30 000 computer science teachers so important and lastly the ecuador ministry of education announced its new digital education agenda which includes a plan to establish cs as a foundational subject in the national curriculum in mexico quantrex and funduscan fundacion televisa are pledging to bring cs to 500 schools and 1 000 teachers and they are launching technolocos mexico an initiative to inspire and include mexican girls and young women in computer science in the uk the government has committed 100 million pounds to its 2018 budget to train 8 000 new computer science teachers in secondary schools and to establish a new national center for computing education now those were just some examples the full list includes 20 announcements from countries around the world pledging support for programs that will cumulatively prepare 20 000 new cs teachers and teach over 2 million students around the world you get a round of applause for all of the organizations around the world and i want to thank you both for coming up and sharing all of these they're going to come back in a few minutes but thank you next up we were supposed to have kimberly bryant come she had to cancel last minute um but i wanted to say a couple words on her behalf about the work that black girls code is doing uh kimberly brown bryant is the founder and executive director of black girls code and they are reaching students girls of color across the country and as part of cs education week they are also going to reach out to new students across the country to help them be introduced to computer science so get a round of applause for black girls code now while we celebrate the work of the entire community here for computer science education week i also want to make some announcements specifically on behalf of code.org i want to recognize organizations that are announcing new multimillion dollar donations to code.org to support teachers and schools teaching computer science with an emphasis on diversity as part of their access your potential commitment pwc pledges three million dollars for a threeyear sponsorship with code.org to support teacher workshops for the cs fundamentals cs discoveries and cs principles programs and the creation of a customized middle school technology curriculum the middle school curriculum will be launched in december and provide an introduction to technology skills and the careers they can lead to the bill and melinda gates foundation and the infosys foundation are also renewing their support for computer science the combined gifts from today's new pledges including the bill and melinda gates foundation infosys and pwc adds up to 12 million dollars in new funding thank you so much for your donations can get a round of applause for these excellent organizations and i'm also pleased to announce that just this week code.org hit a major milestone we just passed 10 million girls who have created accounts on our platform and to put that in perspective that's a lot of girls to put that in perspective cheryl was talking about the lack of diversity in our universities if just one percent of the girls who coded on code.org in the last year were to go on and study computer science in college that would more than make up for the gender gap that we have today so uh you know and the work that this has come from is really all due to the teachers um who are bringing this to our classroom every day so i want to one last round of applause to those teachers who have introduced 10 million girls to computer science and we're almost done with our announcements and we saved the best for last we heard about all the international governments doing work for computer science and i'm glad to let you know that right here in the u.s we also have governments making new policies for computer science to tell us more about this i'd like to introduce cameron wilson he's our chief operating officer and the president of the code.org advocacy coalition thank you alice i appreciate the chance to be here this morning the movement to bring computer science into our schools uh also means we need to update state policies to sustain this momentum for years to come policy leaders incl increasingly recognize every student should have the opportunity to take high quality computer science in k12 this will unlock innovation opportunity and economic growth in their communities and enable students regardless of their gender race or background to participate in our rapidly growing digital economy and at a time when our country is divided this issue can also heal this divide political leaders from both major parties are working together to pass computer science policies as a result in the past four years 40 states have enacted policies to expand computer science education and i am pleased to announce new policy pledges this week from states to expand k12 computer science governor scott in florida has pledged 15 million dollars for k12 computer science professional development for the state's teachers the hawaiian state department of education is committed to a process to review and update its k12 computer science standards and today the governors of alabama montana pennsylvania north dakota and indiana are all joining the governor's partnership for k12 computer science education this bipartisan coalition of governors now 14 strong are all committed to working toward three goals in their states first that at least every high school will offer a computer science course second there will be funding for professional learning for computer science teachers third that the state will have rigorous k12 computer science standards and now i'm pleased to introduce three governors who couldn't be here today but wanted to send a personal message by video with their new commitments to this movement hi this is governor asa hutchinson of the great state of arkansas from the moment my 11 year old granddaughter helped me to understand the importance of computer science for our future it has been a priority for me in the first month of my administration arkansas became the first state in the nation to require all public high schools to teach computer coding with the support of anthony owen my director of computer science and our educators statewide arkansas continues to lead the way in computer coding education one of our highly successful initiatives was to provide two thousand dollars stipends for high school teachers to learn to teach coding the enrollment in coding classes has increased dramatically teacher preparation is key to any successful educational initiative so with that success under our wings i am pleased to announce that arkansas is allocating five hundred thousand dollars of its computer science initiative budget to fund a first of its kind program to provide a two thousand dollar stipend for elementary and middle school teachers who train to become computer science lead teachers i'm proud to lead the state that is leading the way in computer science in his schools thank you hi i'm steve bullock governor montana montana's technology sector continues to grow we're seeing an increased demand for workers trained in computer science fields it's projected we'll need to fill nearly 30 000 computer science jobs over these next 10 years at the same time more and more jobs in all sectors require employees with strong problem solving and critical thinking skills that are integral to stem and computer science training we're serious about preparing montana students for these high demand and high paying jobs which is why i'm pleased to announce my commitment to join governors for computer science as part of this commitment we're ramping up our efforts to develop comprehensive k12 computer science standards provide high quality professional development and training for teachers as well and will ensure that every montana student has access to computer science coursework i want to thank all those participated in computer science education week for shining a light on this important topic as we work to ensure equity of opportunity for all montana students thanks so much good morning i'm governor eric holcomb throughout our 200 year history indiana has embraced innovation and we're proud to be the home of such cuttingedge companies like eli lilly cook and cummins and today we are one of the fastest growing states for tech employment indiana knows that computer science is a foundational subject that touches all areas of study and fields of work and we are proud to be one of the first states to embed computer science in our k through 8 standards but we need to continue to expand access to help ensure that all hoosiers are equipped with the tools they need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving economy that's why i am proud to announce that a key piece of my 2018 next level agenda is to require all k through 12 schools across indiana to offer computer science by 2021 and that we provide the resources necessary for professional development so that we have the teachers in the classroom that will allow us to meet this goal i am also pleased to announce that i am joining the governors for computer science partnership a bipartisan initiative to promote computer science education in schools across the country i look forward to working with my colleagues to help advocate for policies that expand computer science education thank you for all you're doing to support computer science education i'm excited for what this means for the future of our state let's give a round of applause for our uh state level commitments we really appreciate entire states getting behind this movement so thank you so since we're in california for this kickoff we're very excited to have one of the state's top leaders with us today lieutenant governor gavin newsom is here to help share what steps california is taking to expand computer science education for every student lieutenant governor newsom was elected as lieutenant governor of california in 2010 after serving as mayor of san francisco for eight years as a member of the san francisco board of supervisors and then as mayor of san francisco and now as lieutenant governor of california who's been in leadership for a long time in the state new lieutenant governor newsom has been a national leader on issues of equity the environment homelessness healthcare policies he has initiated and implemented have been duplicated in cities across the united states now as lieutenant governor and in his role as the university uh as a university of california regent and cal state university trustee he's pushing to expand computer science education in our universities and k12 classrooms so please provide a warm round of applause in welcoming lieutenant governor newsom to the stage so i guess you guys did that purposely you rub it in with arkansas and indiana which trust me that ain't easy sitting here listening to those governors get ahead of california i i'm going to spare montana because i got married there and my daughter's name montana but i admire and appreciate their leadership and the question is where's california we've got to step up our game we haven't been out front we love to say about our state the future happened future happened here first but not as it relates to requiring computer science in all of our high schools we're actually trailing we've been falling behind and as you all know in a world where tech is racing ahead if education falls behind where does that leave us with more acuity in terms of wealth gaps more acuity in terms of income gaps more questions about the issues of social mobility the issues that i would argue disproportionately will define our times not as a way to begrudge other people's success but as a framework of a paradigm a gap that must be mined particularly in california the wealthiest and the poorest state in america eight million people i want to remind you living below the poverty line in the state of california when you look at the supplemental poverty index no state has more children living below the poverty line in the state of california this bifurcated hybrid reality a coastal economy and one struggling in the inland part of the state disproportionately so rather than lamenting about it we're here doing something about it and i want to just congratulate peggy and susan and cheryl code.org the great work of julie and access and all the enlightened leadership in this room for forcing us to get our act together to get out front and to advance an initiative we call cs4ca and that's simply this a goal a very comprehensive goal at scale respectfully the governors of those other states at scale to require cs in every high school in the state of california by 2025. we can achieve that and we are now committed to achieving that the governor just signed a bill i know program passing is not problem solving but we passed at least a commitment to establish a framework a strategic framework to implement a strategy with equity at the foundational principle of a paradigm 27 that's the number of girls that took ap computer science last year that's it just 27 of the 10 plus thousand people that took it in 2016 and this is jawdropping less than 150 africanamericans 10 plus thousand people took ap computer science in the state of california less than 150 were africanamerican but less than 1500 by the way latino it's a majority minority state cannot have this conversation without having the question of equity being front and center that's the question we need to answer that's the question that will define our success or failure in these initiatives so we're going to step up our game we're going to make financial commitments we've got audacious goals that we will reach we have the core competency reflected in the work that all of you have been doing on this issue and we have the imperative in closing and that is the recognition that the plumbing of the world is radically changed you all know this we're going from something old to something new someone described it the other day as paralysis contrasted by rebirth when they described the taxicab industry versus uber and lyft and others it's a world where we ain't seen nothing yet you know that better than i the combinatorial nature of technology the stacking of technologies what's happening in this space is going to create conditions where the urgency of this moment cannot be underscored and so i just want to again compliment all of you for your guidance your wisdom your faith devotion to cause for problem solving uh and for the innovative spirit that defines the best of this state it's time to move away from downloading apps to have our kids start designing apps moving away from just plain on your phone to start actually programming that phone that's the spirit of this moment that's the spirit of this movement and that's a spirit that defines at least my modest participation uh here today thank you all very very much wow it's uh great to see states competing with each other to uh outdo each other for computer science uh we like to foster that competitive the competitive spirit of code.org so we appreciate the commitments to california now we want to recognize the amazing work that's really being done at the heart of this movement the organizations schools teachers and students and to kick things off for this recognition i'd like to introduce deborah seahorne deborah is the interim executive director of the computer science teachers association this is a great association we've had a partnership for years with that really represents the field of computer science teachers out there and has previously led the association standards work as well as serving on the csta board of directors from 2013 uh to 2015. she's a former teacher and is an education consultant for the north carolina department of instruction please welcome debra to the stage isn't this amazing the podium moves up and down for our short people thank you cameron and good morning champions for computer science guests and friends of computer science education happy computer science education week on behalf of the computer science teachers association i welcome you to the inaugural csta and code.org champions for computer science awards as cameron mentioned csta is a membership organization that supports and promotes the teaching of computer science and other computing disciplines at the k12 level it is particularly gratifying for csta to be a part of recognizing these tremendous computer science accomplishments we stand in awe of the incredible achievements that these awardees have made in computer science education there were so many outstanding achievements submitted that the elect selection committee for the awards had a great deal of difficulty in selecting the winners the students teachers schools school districts and organizations that we are recognizing today are the best of the best they are truly broadening participation in computer science advocating for computer science innovating and making an impact in their community you are an awesome group and we salute you for your accomplishments now i'd like to invite susan cheryl and peggy to please come back to the stage to help me recognize our champions for computer science award winners when we asked for nominations for these awards we were amazed to receive close

community outreach efforts have reached 700 juveniles from the justice system our second award goes to the queen city robotics alliance in charlotte north carolina to accept the award we have executive director leah schwinghamer they have hosted coding camp since 2014 to help atrisk families in the international and refugee community in charlotte now i would like to bring peggy up to the podium to present the school award okay so i'm pleased to announce there's four winners from across the country as our school champions for computer science eufaula high school in alabama arkansas school for mathematics sciences and the arts brennam high school in texas and anacapa middle school here in california accepting the awards on behalf of their schools we have lee calton corey alderdice trenton hall and christy steinlich and while we can't highlight all the great accomplishments of these schools i do want to take a second to specifically talk about the work being done at eufaula high because they've more than tripled their cs enrollment in the last year and they've done it with equity in mind female enrollment increased by 233 percent and minority enrollment by 800 percent so thank you all and i get to present the computer science the champions for computer science to teachers we all know how important teachers can be this to diane neville from gulfstream academy of hallandale beach in hallandale beach florida which is so close to where i grew up uh for broadening participation in computer science to heather surkowski from crac mont montessori magnet school in hartford connecticut for her work in advocacy to efrin lopez from jw nixon high school in laredo texas for the impact you're making in your community and to lawrence ramos from the emerson community charter middle school in los angeles california for innovation lawrence is a special education teacher who learned the principles of cs education and started a coding school in his class congratulations again we all know how important teachers can be to this and we're super grateful to all of you for all you've done okay and finally i am pleased to announce the student student champions for computer science let's name a few of them vidi srivastava angela joanna garcia pena and shreya shagar so let's please join me in congratulating and giving a huge round of applause for these incredible leaders teachers and students for all of their contributions to computer science all right and now we have a very special demo that crystal and angela are going to do today we're going to call them up here on stage so using an adafruit board crystal and angela developed a gps connected wrist brand which when paired with their mobile app helps parents monitor their young children they have been featured in la opinion and telemundo so let's welcome these two budding entrepreneurs and watch their demo come on up what if you were a teenager that had a race coming up but couldn't practice throughout the week or on the weekends because your parents were overprotective well i don't have a device's hearing parents less awkward and more cool but what i do have is a device that lets your parents know where you are when you're for a jog this way your parents will know that you indeed are running and nothing else it alerts your parents if you ever feel unsafe about your surroundings or location and it is waterproof i mean come on that deserves a round of applause and for you ladies that want to track your husbands this works too okay so i i actually thought about this idea when i was laying in bed thinking to myself oh how am i going to survive running 26.2 miles without getting extra practicing i asked my mom if she could go out and roam with me but she was tired from coming home from work and wouldn't um and didn't let me run by myself because she thought our neighbor our neighborhood was unsafe so that's how i came up with find you might be thinking what is the find you app well it is an app that connects to our wristband which every wristband has a unique code you enter and you only have to log in once and we also pair it up with google maps to find your wristband's exact location hi my name is angela garcia and i'm the founder hi my name is crystal reynaga and i'm the ceo of find you run free you're shaking dude i'm shaking thank you angela and crystal i think you guys are ready to go into business right now so that's awesome can we get another round of applause for them thank you so much thank you and finally to kick off cs education week we have a special special message from melinda gates i wanted to be with you in person especially after i saw the program what an amazing group of leaders but i'm grateful for the opportunity to thank every single teacher mentor and policy maker who is helping students fall in love with computers and technology you're changing lives and i know that's true because i still remember the teacher who changed my life mrs bauer in 1982 she saw the apple ii computer at a math teachers conference and she persuaded the head of our school to buy one and then inspired me to imagine a different future that kind of inspiration and imagination is even more important today than it was back in the 1980s computer literacy is now an essential skill along with reading writing and arithmetic every student and i mean every student needs to learn his or her way around a computer but computer science education does even more than change lives it also changes the world it gives young people the power to build the future and the more we encourage different kinds of people to get interested in technology the better that future will be innovation happens when we approach urgent challenges from every different point of view bringing women and underrepresented minorities into the field guarantees that we see the full range of solutions to the real problems that people face in the world so one of the reasons i'm so optimistic about the future is that technology can make the impossible possible but only if we're all involved in the effort and that's what cs education is all about i hope you're leaving this event feeling motivated there's a big bright future waiting for our young women and young men together we can help them seize it thank you and with that i think we can all say that computer science education week is officially kicked off in the one hour we have been here hundreds of thousands of students around the world have begun their first hour of code in their classroom so i want to say thank you to all of the classrooms joining us over the live stream and i want to wish you all a happy computer science education week and now if you're in the room i also want to let you know that we've got a computer science curriculum showcase with 17 curriculum and professional development partners you're all welcome to go check it out it's right over there and learn about different ways that you can bring computer science to your school or classroom thank you all for joining us maybe we'll get it done you
