00:36 - questions if that's okay with you you
00:38 - are I'm very looking forward to it great
00:40 - so our first question is going to come
00:42 - from Alma Intermediate School in Alma
00:45 - Arkansas what is your favorite BuzzFeed
00:54 - post that went viral
00:55 - hi everyone that's a great question
00:58 - there's so many of my favorite posts but
01:00 - I think that my most favorite post is
01:02 - the one about the dress now let me see a
01:05 - show of hands who how many of you
01:08 - thought the dress was white and gold how
01:14 - many of you thought it was blue and
01:15 - black
01:17 - all right and how many of you have no
01:19 - idea what I'm talking about
01:23 - it was a it was a a great post you asked
01:27 - your friends who saw it where there was
01:28 - a picture of a dress and people couldn't
01:31 - decide what colors it was which seems
01:33 - like a very straightforward thing but it
01:36 - was my favorite post because it really
01:37 - just got a lot of people talking to each
01:39 - other and having a debate about about
01:43 - things that we know and things that we
01:45 - don't know and people were just showing
01:48 - each other pictures of the dress on
01:50 - their phone it was it was a it was quite
01:53 - a phenomenon earlier this year but in
01:55 - February of 2015 that was that was my
01:59 - favorite post you guys can check it out
02:01 - if you have for those of you who haven't
02:03 - seen it thanks Dale actually I remember
02:07 - when that post came out and we had a
02:09 - huge office debate about what the color
02:11 - actually was great our next school is
02:16 - Prairie elementary school from
02:18 - Worthington Minnesota that's a um that's
02:31 - another great question there's so many
02:33 - things that surprised me about what
02:36 - people find really shareable and what
02:38 - people wouldn't want to talk about
02:39 - BuzzFeed a lot of people just know us
02:43 - for our funny lists and our videos which
02:46 - are all amazing but what people don't
02:48 - know is that actually a lot of our very
02:51 - serious investigations and and essays
02:55 - are shared a lot and go pretty viral we
02:59 - have reporting about Ebola about Isis
03:03 - about investigations into companies that
03:07 - do bad things you know that take
03:09 - advantage of people about women who were
03:14 - treated really unfairly about laws that
03:17 - that send kids teenagers to jail for for
03:21 - skipping school all these stories got
03:22 - you know hundreds of thousands millions
03:24 - or in some cases over a million views
03:26 - which is a lot of people and
03:29 - so those kinds of stories also get you
03:32 - know go viral or get shared a lot and
03:34 - that's a that's an important part of
03:37 - being an immediate company too so I
03:41 - encourage you to look at so look at some
03:43 - of those two if those if you if you come
03:44 - across them
03:46 - great thank you our next question is
03:49 - going to come from Trinity school of
03:51 - Texas and Longview Texas what is an
03:56 - example of a small feature change you
03:58 - made to a story or post that ended up
04:00 - making a huge difference so that's
04:05 - that's a great question because what
04:07 - people see at the end when things go
04:09 - really viral as I see the end product
04:11 - they don't see all of the things that
04:13 - didn't work that at the beginning that
04:16 - really led to us learning something that
04:20 - led to big success later and I think
04:22 - that that has a lot of it has a lot of
04:26 - parallels to what we do every day and
04:29 - what you guys do at school which is
04:31 - learning sometimes when you first learn
04:32 - something it doesn't work right but then
04:35 - if you keep keep at it then then it can
04:37 - then you learn more and you get really
04:39 - good at it so the example we'll talk
04:41 - about is quizzes so how many people here
04:43 - are taking a BuzzFeed quiz is anyone we
04:47 - get a BuzzFeed quiz there's some yeah
04:49 - okay a few hands and so we've been doing
04:54 - quizzes for a long time and one of the
04:56 - changes that we tried a couple of years
05:01 - ago was to put the answers of the quiz
05:03 - in a grid format instead of in a list
05:06 - format and that was just something that
05:08 - an entrepreneurial editor tried doing
05:12 - and it ended up getting a lot more
05:14 - engagement people took the quiz thought
05:16 - it was more fun to take even though the
05:19 - format of the content of the quiz was
05:21 - the same and so we just experimented
05:24 - more and more with how we show quiz
05:27 - answers and that ended up I ended up
05:31 - making quizzes a lot more fun to take
05:33 - and then ended up with us having a huge
05:35 - run of really popular quizzes that tens
05:38 - of millions of people millions people
05:40 - took so it's something that you see now
05:43 - but it wasn't always done that way and
05:45 - it sort of talks about how the more you
05:49 - try things and the more you work at at
05:51 - making things better than the more
05:53 - success you'll have great Thank You Dow
06:00 - our next question is going to come from
06:02 - cash on high school and cash on Oklahoma
06:10 - what advice do you have for someone when
06:13 - trying to launch a new website and
06:14 - making a popular hmm let's see
06:19 - I guess what I would say is that you
06:22 - should really think about what other
06:25 - people are looking for like why some why
06:29 - other people would want to use your
06:30 - service or your website and and and talk
06:37 - to a lot of those kinds of people and
06:39 - say oh do you think this would be really
06:41 - useful and do you think this would be
06:43 - interesting and why and maybe really
06:46 - sort of candid about about what you want
06:49 - to do with the kinds of people that you
06:50 - that you're interested in and then and
06:53 - then the other thing I guess is to is to
06:58 - realize that it's really hard to get it
07:00 - right the first time and to always be
07:03 - thinking about how you how you can
07:06 - improve and what you can learn from the
07:09 - people who are using your service or not
07:11 - using your you not using your service I
07:13 - think that I think that the probably the
07:17 - the the services and the things that are
07:20 - most successful today are made by people
07:22 - who who made things in the past that
07:25 - didn't work well but then who were able
07:27 - to learn from that and I think that's
07:28 - something that you know you learn as a
07:32 - kid in school when growing up but even
07:35 - as adults all right you know what we're
07:37 - doing here at BuzzFeed certainly is
07:39 - we're always trying to learn more about
07:40 - what people are doing and why and and
07:43 - how we can how we can serve them better
07:45 - with with better content or a better
07:47 - experience great and we'll have one more
07:51 - question from one one last school today
07:54 - Rosa Parks Mill
07:56 - Brook Elementary in Lancaster Texas it's
08:04 - beltline about line evolution if you can
08:09 - create an application to make your life
08:11 - because your world would it be alive if
08:15 - I get created there's an application
08:16 - there life easier I think that maybe it
08:20 - would be teleportation it'd be great if
08:26 - I could just teleport right into your
08:28 - classroom and talk to you and then
08:30 - teleport into the nice classroom and
08:31 - side to them I think that would be
08:33 - awesome
08:33 - Judy that would be cool maybe there
08:37 - maybe they'll be working on that soon
08:43 - fully that's actually what I always say
08:45 - as well thank you for joining us and do
08:50 - you have um kind of any closing thoughts
08:52 - and words that you would love to share
08:54 - with the students who talk to you today
08:55 - I know they're all big fans of BuzzFeed
08:57 - and the work you guys do I would just
09:00 - say keep it up I think that coding is
09:03 - such a fun thing to do and to have fun
09:05 - with it I think that's the most
09:07 - important thing because if you don't if
09:10 - you don't have fun with it then you're
09:11 - not going to want to do more of it and
09:13 - and that it's you know don't don't don't
09:18 - let others like tell you that it's that
09:21 - you're not good at it or that it's not
09:23 - fun it's just something that I think is
09:25 - it could be a thing that a lot of people
09:28 - can do and and and have a good time
09:32 - that's what I that's what I love about
09:34 - coding great thank you
09:37 - how about we have everybody unmute their
09:40 - mics and give dal big thank you for
09:43 - joining us today
