00:12 - student at the university of washington
00:14 - and i do research in accessibility and
00:15 - human computer interaction basically i
00:18 - work on making technology more
00:19 - accessible to people with disabilities
00:22 - when we look at an object in the real
00:24 - world how do we describe it to someone
00:26 - else
00:27 - if i place an order for a cake i might
00:30 - describe to the chef that i want a two
00:32 - layer chocolate cake with rainbow
00:34 - sprinkle
00:35 - my friend might order a three layered
00:38 - vanilla cake with strawberries on top
00:41 - both cakes but different
00:43 - these descriptions or characteristics
00:45 - are what we call attributes
00:47 - we represent these attributes as
00:48 - instance variables in java
00:52 - instance variables are variables defined
00:54 - in a class where each variable
00:56 - represents an attribute of an object
00:59 - in this case we create a cake class and
01:01 - declare instance variables to represent
01:03 - a cake's layers
01:05 - flavor and toppings
01:07 - when we create a cake object it will get
01:10 - its own copy of these instance variables
01:12 - so we can assign specific values for the
01:14 - cake
01:15 - for example we could assign the value 2
01:18 - to layers
01:19 - the value chocolate to flavor
01:21 - and the value sprinkles to topping
01:25 - when we create a class we decide what
01:27 - attributes we want the instance
01:28 - variables to represent
01:30 - for example if we created a student
01:32 - class we might declare instance
01:34 - variables for the student's name
01:36 - age and grade level
01:39 - when we create a student object the
01:41 - object then gets its own copy of the
01:43 - instance variables that are initialized
01:44 - for the values we specify
01:47 - all students but each with their own
01:49 - attributes their own instance variables
01:52 - using instance variables we can store
01:54 - attributes for each object we create
