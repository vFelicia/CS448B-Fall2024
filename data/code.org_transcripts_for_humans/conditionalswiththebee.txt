00:04 - This is the conditional block. It says IF
there is nectar or honey that is equal,
00:10 - less than or greater than a number, then DO
something. This is useful when we don't know
00:16 - how much nectar or honey to get, as we see
here with this question mark. In this example,
00:23 - we're going to say IF the purple flower has
nectar greater than 0, get nectar. That will
00:28 - tell our bee to keep getting nectar as long
as it's there. Ta-dah!
