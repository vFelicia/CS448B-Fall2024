00:12 - hey I'm Hill Harper actor author and
00:16 - founder of the Black Wall Street digital
00:19 - wallet and app hi I'm Dieter Shirley and
00:21 - I'm the CTO of dapper Labs the
00:24 - dubstreet is a blockchain
00:25 - technology-powered community that hopes
00:28 - to solve the racial wealth Gap through
00:31 - providing opportunity for folks to help
00:34 - them build wealth jobs and opportunity
00:36 - copper Labs is a company that believes
00:39 - that digital Collectibles are the future
00:42 - of fandom and that blockchain technology
00:44 - can give users a level of ownership and
00:48 - control over their digital lives that
00:50 - they've never really had before
00:53 - chains have potential far beyond
00:56 - cryptocurrencies alone see blockchain
00:59 - technology offers an open database where
01:03 - people can record information without
01:05 - the need for essential Authority but
01:09 - blockchains can do more than just store
01:11 - information they can perform
01:14 - computations to enforce Fair transaction
01:17 - rules without Gatekeepers and expensive
01:20 - or sometimes corrupt human oversight
01:23 - okay as an example let's look at music
01:27 - royalties
01:28 - record labels receive money when you
01:31 - play music
01:33 - then they distribute that money to
01:36 - individual musicians and artists
01:38 - usually there are lots of musicians who
01:42 - collaborate on a song and each one
01:44 - receives a different percentage of the
01:46 - money but keeping track of all that is
01:48 - complicated which is why artists give up
01:51 - a large share of their earnings to
01:53 - record labels Publishers and other third
01:55 - parties to collect and distribute these
01:57 - papers blockchain technology could be
02:00 - used to perform these same calculations
02:03 - and issue payments directly to the
02:06 - appropriate artists without a third
02:08 - party and almost in real time
02:11 - to do so we use a program called a smart
02:13 - contract although if we're honest a
02:15 - smart contract is neither especially
02:17 - smart or is it really a contract it's an
02:20 - autonomous program that you can think of
02:22 - kind of like a vending machine you put
02:23 - the right amount of money in and the
02:25 - product comes out automatically it can
02:27 - ensure that the rules of a certain kind
02:29 - of transaction are followed without the
02:31 - need for legal contracts and it runs
02:34 - correctly 24 7 without oversight
02:36 - executing the agreement whenever the
02:38 - right conditions are met I want to give
02:39 - you an example when a song you wrote
02:42 - becomes a top hit a smart contract could
02:45 - deposit the money right into your
02:47 - account
02:48 - say you wrote the song with a friend and
02:51 - a third friend performed it a smart
02:54 - contract could divide the money three
02:56 - ways deposited into a digital wallet and
02:59 - the smart contract only keeps track of
03:01 - how you agree to divide the money but
03:03 - also divides it for you and then the
03:06 - blockchain keeps a record of all these
03:08 - transactions so you can go back and
03:09 - review it if you want with smart
03:11 - contracts blockchains can decentralize
03:13 - not only the storage of data information
03:15 - but also the rules about how that data
03:18 - is used and the Computing effort that
03:21 - enforces those rules so what kinds of
03:23 - things are possible on blockchains using
03:26 - smart contracts well
03:28 - The Advocates of this technology believe
03:30 - it can change many aspects of society by
03:34 - removing the role of governments
03:36 - corporations and third parties for
03:39 - example blockchain technology could
03:42 - enable transparent elections by
03:45 - automatically recording votes and
03:47 - publicly auditing them all while
03:50 - protecting voter Identity or it could
03:53 - allow us to trade renewable energy with
03:55 - our neighbors without paying a third
03:57 - party for the transaction of course
04:01 - none of this is happening right now
04:03 - today at least not on a large scale so
04:06 - there is a lot of debate about whether
04:09 - blockchain technology will ever lead to
04:12 - these things being like completely
04:14 - widely adopted
04:16 - non-fungible tokens or nfts are a
04:19 - popular example of smart contracts that
04:21 - are already in use and nft is a unique
04:24 - asset individually tracked on the
04:25 - blockchain that can be associated with
04:27 - the ownership of digital Collectibles
04:29 - artwork or items in a game if you want
04:32 - to buy or sell the item the smart
04:35 - contract handles the transaction with
04:36 - preset rules such as giving some of the
04:39 - purchase price to the original Creator
04:41 - as an ongoing royalty musicians like
04:44 - Grimes and Kings of Leon have already
04:47 - released their work as nfts and
04:51 - governments are considering recognizing
04:53 - smart contracts as legally enforceable
04:57 - agreements the potential of nfts and
04:59 - smart contracts is often debated the
05:02 - tractors like to focus on examples of
05:04 - fraudsters using it as a tool to trick
05:06 - people well other people think that nfts
05:08 - will one day represent all property
05:10 - ownership entirely eliminating the need
05:12 - for middlemen and governments and all
05:14 - sorts of transactions but as with most
05:17 - things the truth will probably fall
05:18 - somewhere in the middle ultimately the
05:20 - utility of this technology
05:22 - will depend on its adoption in the real
05:24 - world
05:25 - will future concert Halls accept nft
05:28 - tickets will game makers accept tokens
05:31 - bought and sold outside of their own
05:33 - games will major musicians be paid
05:36 - through smart contracts will everybody
05:37 - have just a digital wallet and real
05:40 - wallets will be gone will governments
05:42 - recognize property ownership or even
05:44 - votes recorded on a blockchain
05:47 - we'll all have to wait and see
