00:10 - hi i'm judy and i'm a software engineer
00:12 - at snap i make mistakes all the time
00:14 - actually at work me and my peers joke
00:17 - about it
00:18 - as long as we learn from it that's
00:20 - really the biggest lesson and we grow
00:22 - from it and able to improve ourselves be
00:25 - open-minded be open to learning and
00:27 - exploring new things it can get
00:28 - frustrated at first but i think what
00:31 - really truly matters is that you're able
00:33 - to enjoy it love doing learning
00:36 - and that really what all it comes down
00:38 - to
00:40 - welcome to the theater
00:42 - we will use the theater to learn java
00:44 - while creating visuals animations and
00:47 - sound effects
00:50 - to use the theater we have to import a
00:52 - package that contains classes like the
00:54 - scene class
00:56 - we can also import a package that
00:58 - contains classes for various media
01:00 - components
01:02 - in our code we can instantiate a scene
01:05 - object and use it to draw shapes and
01:07 - images and play sounds in the theater
01:09 - we can use the draw image method to draw
01:12 - images at a given x and y location with
01:14 - a specified size
01:16 - we can also use the draw rectangle
01:19 - draw ellipse
01:22 - and draw line methods to create drawings
01:26 - the scene class also has methods to
01:28 - change the fill
01:31 - and stroke colors of these shapes
01:33 - [Music]
01:34 - the theater is 400 pixels wide by 400
01:38 - pixels tall but don't worry
01:40 - you don't have to remember that the
01:42 - scene class has methods get width and
01:44 - get height to give us this information
01:46 - when we need it
01:48 - we can also play sounds in the theater
01:50 - using the play sound and play note
01:52 - methods
01:53 - the play sound method lets us play a
01:55 - sound file
01:57 - and the play note method let us play
01:59 - individual notes
02:01 - if we call several methods to draw
02:03 - images or shapes we'll see the result as
02:06 - one image
02:07 - we can create animations using the pause
02:10 - method in the scene class
02:12 - with the pause method we can draw an
02:14 - image then pause for a given amount of
02:16 - time before drawing the next image or
02:19 - shape
02:20 - finally when we want to clear the stage
02:23 - we can use the clear method in the scene
02:25 - class
02:27 - there are other classes and methods that
02:29 - we can use to create some pretty cool
02:31 - drawings and animations that we'll learn
02:33 - about
02:34 - later theater is a space for you to use
02:37 - your imagination be creative and express
02:40 - yourself with art animation and sound
02:43 - all while learning java
02:46 - [Music]
