00:29 - Some examples of events are listening for a mouse click,
00:33 - an arrow button, or a tap on the screen.

00:53 - You can use the "when up arrow" event block,
00:57 - and connect a "do once" block to it.
01:00 - When you press the up arrow key, the code attached
01:03 - to the "when up" arrow block is run.
01:07 - Which dance move will you choose?
01:10 - Make sure the type of dancer you choose
01:13 - matches one of the dancers you created inside the setup block,
01:17 - or you might not see anything happen.
01:20 - Eventually, you can create more events like this
01:24 - to make your dancers perform different moves with each key.
01:30 - Give it a try, and with the few lines of code, you can make your own interactive dance!
