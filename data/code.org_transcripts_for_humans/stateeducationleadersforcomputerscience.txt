00:05 - computer science is important to me
00:08 - because it's ubiquitous and if our
00:11 - students don't have the understanding of
00:13 - how it works how to use it or how to
00:16 - create with it then our students will be
00:18 - behind the world computer science is
00:21 - important to me as a state chief because
00:24 - I have the opportunity to Usher forward
00:27 - what our students need most now we know
00:30 - that it's important to educate students
00:32 - today for what they're going to be doing
00:33 - 10 20 50 years from now computer science
00:37 - is going to be the base of that Talent
00:39 - is distributed equally across my state
00:41 - across this nation but unfortunately
00:43 - access and opportunity is not and it is
00:48 - our responsibility as state leaders as
00:50 - District leaders as department leaders
00:52 - to ensure that we open up more
00:55 - opportunities for Access and not only
00:57 - have access but the outcome and what
00:59 - they learn in in the classrooms we need
01:02 - to make sure that it's of high quality
01:05 - that they can Implement they can see
01:07 - themselves moving on to post-secondary
01:10 - or directly into the workforce that's
01:12 - the beauty of it
01:13 - from the earliest days kindergarten on
01:16 - up if students are able to learn about
01:18 - coding and have an awareness of the
01:20 - opportunities not just for jobs in our
01:22 - state but jobs across the globe that
01:25 - they can be a part of that's our
01:27 - responsibility to provide them those
01:29 - opportunities when we hear excitement
01:31 - from principals and students and parents
01:33 - and we have responsibility to follow
01:35 - that passion I know it's hard
01:37 - particularly when it's viewed as added
01:38 - yet another thing on the table so to
01:40 - speak but I would argue that computer
01:41 - science could also function as a
01:43 - significant Catalyst to advance the
01:44 - system we're engaging students some who
01:47 - were not engaged before whenever we can
01:50 - get students involved in Hands-On and
01:52 - things that they really enjoy our high
01:55 - school graduation rate goes up to 98
01:57 - from 84 percent computer science is one
02:00 - of those things where you can really put
02:02 - your state your districts you can put
02:05 - them on the map you can set a direction
02:07 - for the future and I think that's a
02:09 - great legacy for any of our state
02:11 - leaders if you learn a little bit you
02:13 - want to learn a lot more I would just
02:16 - really encourage State leaders
02:18 - especially to be inspired by that notion
02:21 - by that Curiosity that drives us all I
02:24 - don't think that there's a way you can
02:25 - lean in too far on computer science as a
02:27 - leader it is core to our competitiveness
02:30 - as a global leader a global space and
02:33 - computer science will will continue to
02:35 - push us forward and so it is time to be
02:37 - bold
