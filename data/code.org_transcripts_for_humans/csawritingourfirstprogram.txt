00:05 - there's a few roles and things to know
00:07 - about writing java code
00:09 - let's explore some of these rules and
00:11 - learn how to write our first program
00:15 - to get started we first write the class
00:18 - header
00:22 - the class header consists of the class
00:24 - keyword and the name of the class
00:28 - the name of the class must be the same
00:31 - as the file
00:33 - the class is public so it can be
00:35 - accessed by our entire program
00:39 - notice that we also wrote my console
00:41 - with an uppercase m
00:43 - and an uppercase c
00:45 - this format is called camelcase
00:48 - camelcase is a naming convention in
00:50 - which the first letter of the first word
00:53 - is either uppercase or lowercase
00:56 - and the first letter of each additional
00:57 - word is upper case
01:00 - when we write the name of a class we
01:02 - write it with an uppercase letter
01:06 - then we write a set of curly braces
01:09 - when we write one java lab will
01:12 - automatically insert a matching closing
01:15 - curly brace
01:17 - these indicate the beginning and end of
01:20 - a block of code
01:22 - curly braces are part of the java syntax
01:26 - syntax is the rules for how a programmer
01:28 - must write code for a computer to
01:30 - understand
01:32 - if we don't follow these rules we will
01:34 - get a syntax error
01:37 - a syntax error is a mistake in the code
01:40 - that does not follow a programming
01:42 - language's syntax
01:44 - for example if we're missing a curly
01:47 - brace
01:48 - we'll get this error
01:52 - next
01:53 - we need to write our main method
02:04 - the main method tells java where to
02:07 - start running our program
02:09 - then we write another set of curly
02:11 - braces
02:13 - java is case sensitive
02:16 - case sensitive is differentiating
02:18 - between lower and upper case letters
02:21 - if we write main in uppercase letter
02:24 - letters
02:25 - we get an error that our program doesn't
02:28 - have a main method
02:30 - so main
02:32 - in lowercase letters is different than
02:34 - main
02:35 - in uppercase letters
02:38 - inside our main method we can write the
02:41 - code that we want java to execute when
02:42 - we run our program
