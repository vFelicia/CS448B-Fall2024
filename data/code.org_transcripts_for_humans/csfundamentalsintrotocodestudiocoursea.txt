00:04 - Okay, we're going to learn to program
using a drag-and-drop language called
00:09 - Blockly. Blockly uses colorful
instructions called blocks, to build
00:14 - programs that you can use to solve
puzzles. Under the hood, you're still
00:18 - creating code. Each puzzle you'll solve
with the code is split into four main
00:24 - parts. On the left is the play area, where
your program will run. In the center,
00:30 - you'll see the toolbox area, that holds
all the blocks that you will need for
00:34 - each puzzle. To the right is your
workspace, where you will drag blocks to
00:39 - build your program. Finally, above the
workspace, you will see the specific
00:45 - instructions for each puzzle. Don't worry
if you accidentally drag out a block
00:51 - that you don't need. If you have an extra
block, simply drag it back into the
00:55 - toolbox to put it away.
After you hit run, you can always hit the
01:01 - reset button to get your character back
to the start, so you can try again.
