07:39 - the world has some big problems
07:42 - but i'm little what can i do
07:44 - even when problems seem big we can
07:46 - tackle them one step at a time our
07:48 - generation can help make a more
07:50 - prosperous equitable and sustainable
07:52 - world i'm learning to code i'm designing
07:55 - apps that solve local problems
07:57 - i'm programming robots
07:59 - on learning computer science to make
08:01 - change happen
08:02 - because with technology we can build
08:05 - robots to clean the world's oceans we
08:07 - can program drones to detect forest
08:09 - fires quickly we
08:11 - young women with digital skills and
08:13 - tools we can program our mobile apps to
08:15 - streamline farming in poor rural areas
08:18 - we can use gene sequencing to diagnose
08:20 - diseases and create personalized
08:22 - medicine to cure them i'm little but
08:24 - don't look at my size look at my
08:26 - potential i can make change happen i can
08:29 - make change happen i can make change
08:31 - happen i can make change happen
08:43 - welcome everyone to the
08:46 - 2021 computer science education
08:48 - conference cs edcon give yourselves a
08:50 - round of applause
08:56 - feel free to tweet your questions or
08:59 - just comments pictures to atco.org
09:03 - hashtag csedcon
09:05 - my name is pat yarm praddit
09:09 - and
09:11 - you know a lot of things have changed
09:13 - during the last year and a half
09:17 - this particular picture is actually
09:20 - about 10 years old and obviously
09:23 - pre-covered pre-mask wearing so
09:25 - you know i went to the code.org website
09:27 - and i decided to update it
09:33 - uh you know just kidding that's that's
09:35 - not me that's that's the winter soldier
09:37 - but
09:39 - this is me
09:42 - and and yes
09:43 - i've been working out
09:46 - but all jokes aside
09:48 - we have
09:49 - 270 participants here
09:52 - again give yourselves a round of
09:55 - applause just for making it out
09:58 - go ahead and raise your hand if this is
10:01 - the first in-person conference you've
10:03 - had since covey began
10:06 - wow
10:07 - so it's a wonderful uh
10:09 - time to be here it's a wonderful time in
10:11 - computer science education
10:13 - like i said we have 270 participants
10:16 - from 47 states and 10 countries
10:21 - and given the fact that all of us have
10:22 - been
10:23 - zoomed out over the last year and a half
10:26 - i want you to know that this conference
10:28 - is designed around engagement
10:30 - from the regional networking session
10:32 - we're going to have after this plenary
10:33 - session
10:35 - to the reception later on this evening
10:37 - to the happy hour tomorrow and the
10:40 - strategy sessions on friday we've
10:42 - designed this conference to promote
10:44 - valuable interactions
10:46 - so cs edcon was designed to
10:49 - foster unique interactions
10:53 - to focus and energize the computer
10:56 - science
10:57 - education community
11:00 - and to develop to help you develop new
11:03 - tools and strategies to advance equity
11:07 - in your states your regions and your
11:09 - countries
11:10 - so again thank you for attending cs
11:13 - edcon
11:14 - without further ado i'd like to
11:16 - introduce
11:18 - mrs allison yoshimoto tauri
11:21 - she's going to welcome us to los angeles
11:23 - but first
11:24 - a quick bio about miss mrs yoshimoto
11:28 - towery
11:29 - allison is the chief academic officer of
11:31 - los angeles unified school district
11:36 - she oversees birth to adult education
11:40 - most important to allison is leading
11:42 - from an equity lens and rethinking how
11:44 - business as usual
11:46 - is done to meet the needs of those
11:48 - students and communities historically
11:50 - underserved by public education
11:52 - certainly a mission that we can
11:54 - commiserate with in computer science
11:56 - education
11:57 - mrs allison yoshimoto towery thank you
12:00 - thanks so much
12:04 - so welcome to los angeles everybody
12:11 - so for those of you joining virtually i
12:14 - want you to know there are over 200 and
12:16 - almost 300 people here that are dressed
12:18 - from head to toe in professional clothes
12:23 - quite amazing
12:24 - so it's a blessing to be with you today
12:26 - in person i did want to welcome you to
12:28 - sunny los angeles i know many of you got
12:30 - on planes and are traveling for the
12:31 - first time it's wonderful to be here
12:33 - together
12:35 - i wanted to take you on a little journey
12:36 - but first i wanted to say i'm a mother
12:38 - of two boys we have about a half a
12:40 - million los angeles students sitting in
12:42 - classroom right at this very moment
12:45 - as we're breathing here in this room
12:47 - and
12:48 - they're waiting for the opportunity
12:51 - to for us to do exactly what we're here
12:53 - to talk about
12:55 - my father was an auto mechanic in east
12:57 - los angeles
12:58 - and went to l unified schools and when
13:01 - he started as an auto mechanic it only
13:03 - required a wrench
13:05 - but by the time he finished in his
13:06 - lifetime he needed to understand how to
13:08 - use a computer
13:10 - to fix a car
13:13 - so i'm going to start by from the back
13:14 - from the end and talk forward
13:17 - and in the next few minutes want to
13:19 - build a picture for ourselves
13:21 - if we know already that computing is the
13:24 - number one source of income for our
13:25 - students in the united states
13:28 - and if we know already
13:31 - that girls who take an ap computer
13:33 - science class are 10 times more likely
13:37 - to major in computer science
13:40 - and if we know already that our black
13:42 - and latino students who take ap computer
13:44 - science are seven times more likely
13:47 - to major in computer science
13:50 - and if we know already that students
13:52 - love art and music
13:54 - and computer science and they find more
13:56 - joy
13:57 - in those things in school
14:01 - then we want to make sure that all of
14:03 - our students have those opportunities
14:06 - don't we
14:08 - i want to hear that really loud don't we
14:12 - yes we absolutely do so our challenge
14:15 - today
14:16 - and over the course of this conference
14:18 - is to really think about joy equity
14:21 - and how do we provide that engagement
14:24 - equity and that joy equity
14:27 - that our students deserve
14:28 - every day just like a paper and a piece
14:31 - and a pencil
14:32 - access to computer science to coding is
14:34 - what's going to give them access
14:37 - not necessarily
14:39 - all in computer science industry but
14:41 - that creative innovative thought and
14:44 - that design thinking that students get
14:46 - when they're creating
14:48 - coding when they're
14:49 - it's like riding a bike with the wind
14:51 - flowing through your hair
14:53 - where you know you can steer yourself
14:56 - they get that same feeling
14:58 - when they're learning computer science
14:59 - and how to code
15:01 - that's going to create the new best
15:03 - transportation in this country in this
15:05 - world
15:06 - it's going to create the new fashionista
15:08 - because it's that creative thought
15:10 - right it's going to create the new
15:13 - best way to
15:15 - fix somebody who needs heart surgery
15:18 - because we're
15:19 - we're
15:20 - investing in our young people and the
15:22 - way to think about problems in the world
15:24 - and to create solutions
15:27 - so with that i just want to say thank
15:29 - you for investing thank you for putting
15:31 - everything
15:32 - and being all in with us
15:34 - because this is not just about public
15:36 - education
15:38 - it's about how the private sector offers
15:40 - internships to our students
15:42 - it's about how philanthropy makes up the
15:44 - difference
15:45 - between what students some students get
15:47 - at home and what others don't
15:49 - it's about how our nonprofit world like
15:51 - our amazing partnership with code.org
15:53 - give it up for them
15:59 - leans into public education to support
16:02 - our students
16:03 - and our teachers and our next educators
16:06 - because the way we learned computer
16:08 - science 15 years ago
16:11 - is not the way our students are going to
16:13 - need to be learning at 15 years from now
16:16 - so even today as our students are
16:18 - sitting in class
16:19 - we need to be thinking differently as
16:22 - the grown-ups in the room so thank you
16:24 - all welcome to la and thank you for
16:26 - blessing us with your presence today and
16:28 - enjoy your conference
16:30 - thank you again allison thank you
16:31 - [Applause]
16:35 - so let's go over some logistics
16:38 - starting with uh a bitly link that you
16:41 - all actually have access to on your
16:43 - lanyards i don't have a lanyard on me
16:45 - right now but right behind it is a qr
16:47 - code if you use that qr code you can
16:50 - actually connect to our daily digest
16:53 - that daily digest also includes
16:57 - there it is bitly csikon21 that's the
17:00 - bitly link but you can just use a qr
17:02 - code as well
17:04 - in that daily digest you will find
17:08 - a question parking lot and yes so if you
17:10 - have questions you can type those
17:12 - questions into that question parking lot
17:14 - we'll answer them during the plenaries
17:16 - or the breaks
17:18 - we're going to be tweeting at hashtag cs
17:20 - edcon
17:22 - if you need to use the bathroom it's
17:24 - just over to your left over there that's
17:26 - pretty important
17:29 - we've been released from zoom meetings
17:31 - for the next what two two and a half
17:33 - days so let's take the time to engage
17:36 - with one another personally and like i
17:38 - said we've designed this conference
17:39 - around personal interaction
17:42 - additionally cell phone wise please
17:44 - quiet your cell phones during sessions
17:47 - and if you need to connect to the wi-fi
17:49 - in this area the conference area
17:51 - weston meeting and the password is
17:54 - lowercase cs edcon 2021.
17:58 - now the conference team has worked
17:59 - really hard to make this conference a
18:02 - safe in-person experience
18:04 - and everyone who is here has completed a
18:06 - covid vaccination attestation form thank
18:08 - you for that the local policy here
18:10 - requires us to wear mass at all times
18:12 - indoors unless eating and outside it's
18:15 - recommended but voluntary and so we'll
18:17 - be outside later on for the reception
18:21 - you have these table tents on all of
18:24 - your tables
18:26 - including in this room as well as in the
18:28 - session rooms
18:30 - please uh use that qr code to access our
18:35 - uh contact tracing form so that in the
18:38 - in the case where there might be some
18:40 - medical situation we can uh trace
18:43 - contacts
18:45 - additionally you've all been given the
18:46 - opportunity to wear different colored
18:48 - lanyards depending on your
18:50 - um
18:51 - your
18:52 - just to describe your personal space so
18:55 - starting with the pink one
18:57 - to the yellow one and then the blue one
18:59 - the blue one this uh this okay with hugs
19:02 - and handshakes actually it's been
19:04 - surprising a lot of people are actually
19:05 - okay with hugs and handshakes so much
19:07 - that we actually ran out of those
19:10 - purplish lanyards we had to find another
19:12 - batch so if you had to pick a yellow one
19:15 - and you're actually okay with hugs and
19:17 - handshakes you can go ahead and switch
19:19 - that later on we found another batch
19:23 - lastly
19:25 - we have rapid uh
19:27 - antigen testing in the san diego room
19:30 - uh thursday tomorrow from 3 to 5 pm
19:34 - and then friday
19:36 - at uh from
19:38 - 10 to 12 30.
19:42 - lastly
19:43 - uh the entire schedule is available
19:46 - online at cs edcon dot com schedule
19:49 - there you can create an account add your
19:51 - picture
19:53 - figure out what sessions you want to
19:54 - attend
19:56 - additionally
19:57 - because these sessions are so amazing
19:59 - if you can't attend a session during a
20:02 - particular breakout session slot
20:04 - the slide decks will be uploaded
20:06 - probably about 30 minutes to an hour
20:08 - before that session begins
20:13 - so
20:13 - without further ado i want to introduce
20:15 - our next speakers jake baskin the
20:17 - executive director of the computer
20:19 - science teachers association
20:21 - carol fletcher the principal
20:22 - investigator investigator of the esup
20:24 - alliance and dr katie hendrickson the
20:27 - president of the code.org advocacy
20:29 - coalition let's give them a round of
20:31 - applause
20:38 - good afternoon everyone i am dr katie
20:42 - hendrickson and i am so thrilled to be
20:44 - here with you all to launch the 2021
20:47 - state of computer science education
20:49 - report
20:50 - this is the fifth annual report which
20:53 - combines
20:54 - information about policies that have
20:56 - been adopted to support computer science
20:58 - education
20:59 - with implementation data on computer
21:01 - science access and opportunity
21:06 - code.org the csta and esep are the
21:08 - co-authors of the report but the real
21:11 - work comes from everybody here in this
21:13 - room and everybody watching on the live
21:15 - stream
21:16 - we thank our corporate partners our
21:18 - non-profit partners coalition members
21:21 - advocating for computer science
21:24 - the policy makers who are making
21:26 - computer science foundational
21:28 - and all of the teachers and school
21:30 - leaders who are doing this work on the
21:31 - ground
21:34 - so you'll have a copy of this report
21:36 - i'll take you through some of these
21:37 - highlights
21:38 - for the first time
21:40 - finally
21:41 - half of all high schools in the united
21:43 - states offer computer science
21:50 - this is tremendous this is such a
21:52 - milestone
21:53 - that's up from about 35 percent just a
21:55 - few years ago
21:58 - but on the other hand this means that
22:00 - half of all schools still lack access
22:05 - and there are gaps in who has access
22:07 - i live in a rural community in
22:09 - southeastern ohio one of the poorest
22:11 - counties in the state
22:13 - and students there
22:15 - are likely to attend
22:17 - an under-resourced school
22:19 - students who attend urban schools rural
22:21 - schools or schools that serve high
22:23 - populations of economically
22:25 - disadvantaged students are less likely
22:28 - to offer computer science
22:31 - we need to start to accelerate the
22:33 - closing of these gaps
22:36 - and how do we do that
22:38 - well one answer is policy
22:40 - we know from this report that policy
22:43 - does matter it makes a difference
22:46 - states that adopt more computer science
22:48 - education policies see a greater
22:50 - percentage of high schools offering
22:52 - computer science this is where we can
22:54 - really make a difference to ensure that
22:56 - every student has access
23:00 - so i'd be remiss if i didn't mention
23:02 - what these nine policies are they're
23:04 - detailed in the report so you can dig in
23:06 - but we've seen incredible growth over
23:08 - the past year
23:10 - 50 policies
23:12 - have been adopted by 31 states this year
23:17 - 21 of those states continued their
23:19 - funding for computer science teacher
23:21 - professional development
23:23 - 65 million dollars this year were
23:25 - allocated by state legislatures
23:27 - prioritizing this
23:29 - that's more than any year previous
23:33 - and this year we also saw our first
23:35 - comprehensive policy adoption where now
23:38 - students in every single state can apply
23:40 - a computer science course towards their
23:42 - high school graduation requirements
23:44 - every single student
23:46 - three states went even further and now
23:49 - require all students to take a computer
23:52 - science course in high school before
23:53 - graduation
23:55 - this has been such a big year for
23:57 - computer science education policy
24:00 - now i'm going to turn over to jake
24:02 - jay can you tell us about what this
24:04 - means for
24:05 - implementation and enrollment in schools
24:08 - absolutely thanks katie
24:10 - and this katie said
24:11 - while we cross that halfway threshold we
24:13 - still know that almost half of all
24:15 - schools still don't offer a single
24:17 - computer science course
24:19 - and we also now know thanks to more
24:21 - detailed data from states that even in
24:23 - places that do offer a course it doesn't
24:26 - necessarily mean that students are
24:27 - taking it
24:28 - or that that opportunity is distributed
24:30 - equally
24:33 - for the first time i'm really thrilled
24:34 - to share that we can report that 4.7
24:38 - of all high school students enrolled in
24:40 - a foundational computer science course
24:42 - last year
24:43 - that's for all foundational computer
24:45 - science courses not just ap
24:48 - so i want you to take a second and think
24:49 - about what that percentage is for a math
24:51 - class or an english class in your state
24:56 - although this number represents
24:57 - tremendous growth for computer science
25:00 - there's still so many students who are
25:02 - missing out
25:03 - and there are persistently predictable
25:06 - disparities in who's taking these
25:08 - classes
25:11 - we now know that by introducing computer
25:13 - science and elementary grades
25:15 - in environments where all students are
25:17 - learning together
25:18 - we're thrilled to see gender parity and
25:20 - participation in computer science
25:23 - however as we move into middle and high
25:25 - school we see that gender gap widen
25:28 - where there's a a larger gap in
25:30 - participation between males male
25:32 - students and their female and non-binary
25:34 - peers
25:37 - and as we look at english learners
25:39 - students with disabilities or
25:41 - economically disadvantaged students
25:43 - those gaps persist
25:45 - relative to the overall population of
25:47 - those students in the student body
25:50 - to me these data make it incredibly
25:53 - clear that it's not just about access to
25:55 - computer science
25:57 - it's about what's happening every single
25:59 - day inside of classrooms
26:01 - to ensure that students are walking into
26:03 - equitable and inclusive environments
26:06 - and we need to invest deeply in how we
26:08 - support teachers and develop them
26:10 - throughout their careers to ensure that
26:12 - every student is walking into a
26:14 - welcoming and sustaining computer
26:16 - science environment
26:18 - in fact that's why we specifically call
26:20 - out in the standards for cs teachers
26:22 - that teachers be
26:24 - active advocates for equity and
26:26 - inclusion in their classroom
26:28 - and here at csta we're thrilled to
26:30 - support teachers as they work to create
26:33 - an intentional equity focused vision to
26:36 - improve access engagement and
26:38 - achievement for all of their students in
26:40 - cs
26:42 - and while i'm up here and have the stage
26:44 - i just want to take a second to say an
26:46 - enormous thank you to all of the
26:48 - computer science teachers here in the
26:50 - room and who are watching on the live
26:52 - stream for all of the work that you've
26:53 - been doing
27:00 - it's been probably the most challenging
27:03 - two years imaginable for computer
27:05 - science teachers and teachers everywhere
27:07 - and the wins in this report are thanks
27:09 - to the work that you're doing every day
27:10 - in your classroom so thank you
27:13 - and we also know that teachers operate
27:16 - in larger systems
27:17 - so i'd like to turn it over to carol to
27:19 - share a little bit more about what the
27:20 - report tells us about those environments
27:22 - thank you
27:25 - so um
27:26 - we know that uh
27:29 - csta has done an exceptional job of
27:33 - really providing the supports that
27:35 - teachers need to teach equitably and
27:38 - inclusively in their classrooms but we
27:40 - also know that if we want to scale and
27:42 - sustain
27:44 - the the
27:46 - improvements we've seen in access and
27:47 - participation and evidenced in this
27:49 - report
27:50 - we've also got to address the systems
27:54 - that are producing these equities
27:56 - and in the esep alliance we look at we
28:00 - use a framework called the cape
28:01 - framework
28:02 - to really analyze the entire ecosystem
28:05 - of cs education so we're looking at what
28:08 - is the capacity for equitable cs
28:10 - education where does access and equity
28:14 - intersect what is our uh equitable
28:16 - participation look like and then finally
28:19 - are we giving equitable experiences to
28:22 - students
28:23 - in order to do that work at that systems
28:26 - level however
28:27 - we've got to have disaggregated data
28:31 - at the state level as well
28:34 - because we can't measure what we can't
28:37 - see
28:38 - and so i'm really excited to celebrate
28:41 - some improvements we've seen this year
28:44 - in the report
28:45 - we see that we have more than doubled
28:48 - the number of states that are that are
28:50 - sharing disaggregated data around things
28:53 - like students with disabilities
28:56 - students who are economically
28:57 - disadvantaged
28:58 - race gender english language learners
29:01 - this is a fantastic improvement
29:04 - but as you can see with 30 to 35 states
29:06 - we still don't have every state able to
29:09 - share and interrogate this kind of data
29:12 - and so we need to do more so that we can
29:15 - identify our priorities
29:17 - and then set goals and establish
29:19 - interventions for improvement based on
29:21 - that data
29:23 - i want to give you a couple of examples
29:24 - of states that are using policy policies
29:27 - like what katie mentioned in order to do
29:30 - this
29:31 - one example is the state of washington
29:34 - uh washington was able to implement a
29:37 - policy
29:38 - that said they would have to collect
29:41 - this kind of disaggregated data and
29:43 - generate an annual report i was just
29:46 - reading the annual report the other
29:47 - night on their website their first
29:49 - report out
29:50 - so they've used data policy to drive
29:53 - equity
29:54 - another example of this is in the state
29:56 - of indiana just this year
29:59 - where their legislature said every k-12
30:01 - school has to offer computer science and
30:05 - our state has to collect data based on
30:09 - all of these disaggregated factors so
30:12 - that we can see where those gaps are and
30:14 - then make investments to address those
30:17 - gaps
30:18 - great news here is that when we have
30:21 - this kind of disaggregated data at a
30:23 - state level
30:25 - then we can bring it together up at a
30:27 - national level in the report and here's
30:29 - an example
30:30 - when we look across the nation what we
30:33 - see
30:34 - when we look at who's in our high
30:36 - schools
30:37 - and then who's in our cs classes
30:40 - one of our greatest disparities is with
30:43 - our hispanic and latinx students
30:45 - that means we've got work to do
30:49 - so what we're doing in the ecf alliance
30:51 - to support that work we are launching a
30:53 - three-year common metrics project
30:56 - to help states all across the country
30:58 - understand how to build these common
31:01 - metrics for measuring capacity access
31:04 - participation and experience
31:06 - and to contribute to the broader
31:09 - national conversation around how we help
31:12 - everyone
31:13 - across the country address these
31:16 - inequities
31:18 - i'm going to turn it over to katie now
31:20 - to finish up thank you
31:23 - all right well thank you carol it's
31:24 - great to hear about this work that esep
31:26 - is doing to support state teams and data
31:28 - systems it really does matter for this
31:30 - report
31:31 - and for knowing where our gaps are
31:34 - so i know you're all wondering where you
31:35 - can find out more you have the book in
31:37 - front of you but there are so many more
31:39 - resources online so the blue table tents
31:42 - have a qr code you'll also see the qr
31:45 - code on the standees throughout the
31:47 - reception area and it's also of course
31:49 - on the slide behind me
31:51 - and on the back cover of your book you
31:54 - can go to the website to find
31:56 - state-specific handity
31:57 - handouts an accessible pdf
32:00 - and a tableau interactive data
32:03 - visualization where you can see every
32:05 - single school in the country that offers
32:08 - computer science or doesn't you can
32:10 - filter that by state by region by
32:13 - legislative district however you want to
32:15 - be able to see who has access and
32:17 - opportunity
32:18 - so thank you all so much
32:21 - [Applause]
32:29 - i'd now like to introduce code.org's
32:32 - founder and ceo hadi partovi who's going
32:36 - to talk to us about the next decade of
32:38 - computer science education hadi partovi
32:47 - thank you pat it is so great to be here
32:49 - and to see so many faces in person
32:52 - i actually just wanted to start by
32:54 - thanking both my staff at code.org and
32:56 - also the hotel staff
32:58 - for helping organize the first in-person
33:00 - gathering of the cs community since the
33:02 - pandemic closed the amount of work that
33:04 - has gone into making sure things are
33:06 - safe between the rapid testing and and
33:08 - everything thank you all so please give
33:10 - a round of applause to everybody helping
33:17 - uh pat asked me to start my presentation
33:19 - uh with a brief personal a brief version
33:22 - of a personal story that i shared
33:24 - at the cs.com two years ago our first cs
33:27 - edcon
33:28 - i want to apologize for those of you who
33:29 - attended then that this may be a little
33:31 - bit repetitive but i'm going to make it
33:33 - shorter and i hope for the folks who are
33:35 - i'm
33:36 - seeing for the first time that is a
33:37 - meaningful message but i wanted to talk
33:40 - a little bit before i talk about the
33:41 - future of cs about my why
33:43 - uh you know about my personal motivation
33:46 - for what caused me to start code.org
33:47 - because when you know why you're doing
33:49 - something you put more into it
33:53 - my mother was a computer scientist in
33:55 - iran
33:56 - and my father was a physicist a
33:58 - professor and he started a university to
34:00 - teach technology which has now become
34:02 - the mit of the middle east
34:04 - so between a mother who's a computer
34:05 - scientist and a father who's a professor
34:08 - you could say i had
34:09 - computer science education literally in
34:11 - my blood
34:12 - but that's only part of my why
34:15 - i grew up in tehran iran it's a
34:17 - beautiful country with jungles and
34:20 - beaches and mountains and ski resorts
34:23 - and shopping malls
34:24 - and the main capital tehran is quite
34:26 - different than the stereotypes you see
34:28 - in traditional western media
34:31 - when i was six years old my life turned
34:33 - upside down
34:34 - the country broke out into an islamic
34:36 - revolution
34:37 - and all sorts of change happened in my
34:39 - life
34:40 - i was part of a large family all of whom
34:43 - fled the country
34:44 - my father decided that we would stay
34:46 - behind because he wanted to make sure
34:48 - his university stayed stable during a
34:50 - time of upheaval
34:51 - and life got really really different
34:55 - you know i spent most of my early
34:56 - childhood in constant fear living in a
34:59 - police state you know there were i had
35:00 - friends in our family friends or even
35:03 - family members who'd gotten disappeared
35:05 - and whisked away and for who knows what
35:08 - and i learned that it was safest to just
35:09 - not talk to anybody
35:11 - to act like i was you know to pretend
35:14 - like i was a muslim because that's what
35:15 - you had to do there was forced prayer in
35:17 - school and basically i learned that the
35:20 - safest thing was to not be seen
35:22 - and that was how i would survive
35:24 - and then as the police state if that
35:26 - wasn't enough a war broke out with the
35:28 - neighboring country of iraq which
35:30 - invaded and then
35:32 - my my home was right next to the
35:34 - television station of the country so we
35:36 - had bombings every other night so most
35:39 - of my evenings in my childhood were
35:41 - spent in a basement with a kerosene lamp
35:44 - holding my ears just hoping that our
35:46 - home would get spared
35:48 - and my father would wake up in the
35:49 - morning to go up to the rooftop to
35:51 - assess the damage
35:52 - and so this was basically the repeated
35:54 - scenes of what i saw growing up and then
35:56 - things got bad enough eventually that my
35:58 - parents decided uh we weren't gonna stay
36:00 - there and so then we we decided to move
36:03 - to the united states which itself if
36:06 - anybody here is an immigrant knows is
36:07 - not an easy process but it's extra
36:10 - difficult if you're iranian during the
36:12 - 1980s so we when we applied for
36:15 - admission to the united states we were
36:17 - rejected the first time we were rejected
36:19 - the second time we were rejected the
36:22 - third time but then finally we got in on
36:24 - as tourists uh
36:26 - but then i needed to my parents wanted
36:28 - us to stay permanently as students
36:30 - that wasn't possible so i was actually
36:32 - deported and told i need to go back to
36:34 - my home country we got very lucky that a
36:38 - a generous lawyer helped us basically
36:40 - apply a fourth time
36:42 - and uh the fourth time we finally got to
36:44 - stay uh in the country
36:46 - but staying in america as a as a new
36:49 - immigrant family had its own challenges
36:50 - my family was poor
36:52 - uh that we you know we didn't have our
36:54 - own house uh we had to share a bedroom
36:57 - all four of us with mom and dad my
37:00 - brother and i sharing
37:01 - two twin beds that were stuck next to
37:03 - each other uh
37:05 - i i didn't get to buy my own clothes i
37:08 - only wore very loose-fitting
37:09 - hand-me-downs the first car i managed to
37:11 - get with my brother together we scrapped
37:13 - together 500
37:15 - to buy our own car but this was still
37:17 - wonderful because we weren't living in
37:19 - fear and we weren't in a time of war
37:22 - what wasn't so great is the
37:23 - discrimination
37:25 - iranians faced at that time my first
37:27 - nickname in school was sheikh
37:30 - my second nickname was jihad
37:33 - literally calling me a terrorist
37:35 - and i learned again to laugh along at
37:37 - jokes made at my expense and to try not
37:39 - to be different than anybody else
37:41 - but after all this my life has turned
37:43 - out to be amazing i went to the best
37:45 - school and because of my parents
37:47 - investment in education
37:49 - i i attended on financial aid
37:52 - and i worked throughout my summers and
37:53 - and school years to pay tuition i
37:56 - majored in computer science i got my
37:57 - first job in technology and since then
38:00 - doors have been open for me and things
38:02 - have just gotten better and better and
38:04 - better and i'm now living
38:06 - thanks to the amazingness of the
38:09 - opportunity systems in this country and
38:11 - the education i had i'm now a nice
38:13 - embodiment of the american dream
38:15 - but i should say still as an iranian in
38:17 - this country it is not always
38:19 - uh roses you know iranian americans even
38:23 - though my skin is white life in the us
38:25 - doesn't come with all the privileges of
38:26 - being white
38:28 - you know iranian americans and middle
38:29 - easterners in general have sought for
38:31 - decades to be classified by the united
38:33 - states as people of color to recognize
38:35 - the discrimination that we face
38:37 - some people get to be judged the moment
38:39 - somebody sees your face other people are
38:41 - judged when your name shows up on a
38:43 - resume or an email
38:45 - and for me this is still personal
38:47 - within the last year i was called arab
38:49 - trash by somebody
38:51 - and also just in the last seven months
38:53 - the association of computing machinery
38:55 - in our own field of computer science
38:57 - gave its highest award the turing award
39:00 - to a professor who explicitly said that
39:03 - he won't help iranian students
39:06 - now why do i say all this i'm not first
39:09 - of all comfortable saying all this
39:11 - because i'm not asking for pity my story
39:13 - is not a sob story my story is a story
39:15 - of opportunity in the american dream and
39:18 - i wake up every day feeling like i'm the
39:19 - luckiest person in the world
39:21 - but what is relevant is anybody who
39:23 - faces struggles or discrimination of any
39:26 - sort
39:27 - learns about the difficulties that
39:28 - others face and learns empathy for
39:30 - discrimination and learns about how how
39:33 - important it is to give people a pathway
39:36 - and a pathway to opportunity
39:38 - and so when i think about my own story i
39:40 - also think about the story of other
39:42 - students
39:43 - students like spencer applegate growing
39:45 - up in rural kentucky in one of the
39:48 - poorest neighborhoods where almost a
39:50 - third of his fellow students are
39:51 - homeless
39:52 - and he in just a hundred lines of code
39:55 - wrote the the rewrote the game tetris on
39:58 - code.org as an as part of his cs
40:01 - principles class but he's too poor to
40:03 - have the phone that he could play the
40:05 - game on where i think of
40:07 - uh araceli casillas growing up in south
40:10 - seattle as a child of immigrants as the
40:13 - first member of her family to go to
40:14 - university when i see these people's
40:16 - story i see my own story
40:19 - and i share that because each of us has
40:21 - our own story of what brings us into
40:23 - this movement into this idea of helping
40:26 - others survive and helping others thrive
40:29 - my story isn't what we put on the on the
40:31 - main page of code.org because each of us
40:34 - with all of our differences have
40:36 - different reasons why we believe in
40:38 - opportunity for our children but that
40:40 - belief is what brings us together
40:43 - our shared belief that opportunity
40:45 - shouldn't depend on the color of your
40:47 - skin on your gender on your family
40:50 - income on the zip code or the country
40:52 - you grow up in on your religion on your
40:54 - nationality this is what brings us
40:57 - together and this is an idea that unites
40:59 - people across states across countries
41:03 - across political divides it is why our
41:06 - movement has been so strong it is why
41:08 - our movement has had the support of
41:10 - every presidential administration in
41:12 - this country as well as presidential
41:14 - administrations from all uh all
41:16 - political sides across different
41:18 - countries
41:20 - and so the idea that every student in
41:22 - every school should have the opportunity
41:24 - to learn computer science is not just an
41:26 - idea about opportunity it's an idea
41:28 - about unity and about bringing people
41:30 - together
41:33 - now i want to reflect a little bit
41:34 - briefly about the amazing process that
41:36 - we
41:37 - the amazing progress that we had in the
41:39 - last decade because
41:41 - this is 2021 but we kind of skipped 2020
41:44 - and we didn't get a chance to ring in
41:45 - the new decade so this is really our
41:47 - chance to do this
41:49 - i first want to show again the the the
41:51 - picture that katie presented
41:53 - it is amazing that we're now finally at
41:55 - the point that the majority of schools
41:57 - in the united states teach computer
41:59 - science when we started code.org it was
42:01 - around 10 of schools we're now at past
42:05 - the halfway mark of getting to 100 of
42:08 - schools that is amazing work
42:10 - and i want to make sure everybody not
42:12 - only celebrates this work for because
42:14 - it's all your work so quick let's do a
42:16 - round of applause
42:22 - this is the work of all the folks here
42:24 - from the united states working on this
42:25 - and i'd love for you to share the news
42:27 - so if you have your phones
42:29 - please scan this qr code it's a link
42:31 - directly to a tweet
42:33 - about this news
42:34 - if you have your phones just scan the qr
42:36 - code and hit the retweet button we would
42:39 - love to share the news that the majority
42:41 - of u.s schools are now teaching computer
42:43 - science
42:44 - and by the way i'm so happy that
42:46 - everybody now knows how to scan qr codes
42:48 - it's like the new
42:49 - skill that we all learned in the last
42:51 - year and a half
42:55 - there's some other things i just want to
42:57 - share about the progress we've made
42:58 - including the progress we've made just
43:00 - in the last two years
43:03 - two years ago on this stage we announced
43:05 - that there were one million computer
43:07 - science teachers on code.org
43:10 - just two years later there's over 2
43:12 - million computer science teachers on
43:13 - code.org it's doubled in two years time
43:16 - which is phenomenal and it shows the
43:18 - power of technology spreading education
43:21 - and it also shows that even during a
43:23 - pandemic this movement is strong
43:26 - two years ago we also shared that
43:29 - there's 50 million student projects that
43:31 - have been created on code.org
43:34 - if if doubling the number of teachers
43:36 - wasn't enough we're now at 170 million
43:39 - projects created on code.org
43:47 - and again your work is what has made
43:49 - this possible
43:50 - now if you think about the bigger
43:52 - picture beyond code.org we're part of a
43:55 - global movement in education that is now
43:57 - one of the largest and fastest efforts
43:59 - to add a new subject to the global
44:01 - curriculum
44:02 - in the united states all 50 states have
44:05 - passed policies and plans to make
44:07 - computer science a more systemic part of
44:10 - education
44:12 - there's been over 350 million dollars in
44:14 - federal and state funding for this work
44:17 - and over a hundred thousand new computer
44:19 - science teachers have gone through
44:20 - professional learning workshops thanks
44:22 - to all of our partners and the many
44:24 - other organizations working on this
44:25 - problem
44:26 - and globally
44:28 - over 70 countries have now announced
44:30 - plans of some sort for teaching computer
44:32 - science many of them complete national
44:35 - rollouts or requirements for every
44:36 - student to learn
44:38 - and as i mentioned over 2 million
44:39 - teachers alone on code.org alone have
44:41 - begun teaching and the hour of code this
44:44 - simple idea that just started with
44:46 - having every teacher just try one hour
44:48 - of computer science in their classroom
44:50 - has passed over 1.3 billion engagements
44:53 - all of this has been incredible work and
44:56 - so many of the folks in this room are
44:57 - the ones that are responsible for making
44:59 - it happen so thank you for that
45:01 - but we are still so far behind where we
45:04 - could be behind the vision of every
45:06 - student in every school learning
45:08 - computer science
45:09 - when jake shared the numbers in terms of
45:12 - enrollment of students in the united
45:13 - states it's so great to see that we
45:16 - finally have enrollment numbers for the
45:17 - entire country
45:19 - but we are so far from where we could be
45:21 - and we also know that disparities exist
45:24 - disparities in access based on where you
45:26 - live and or your
45:28 - or your income level disparities
45:30 - enrollment especially among young women
45:33 - in ap computer science there's so much
45:35 - we need to do
45:37 - now as we think forward to the ringing
45:38 - in of a new decade
45:40 - computer science is at a major
45:42 - inflection point this is a major
45:44 - inflection point caused by 2020 and the
45:47 - pandemic and the digital divide
45:50 - the last 10 years
45:52 - we had so much success in our movement
45:54 - the next 10 years we are poised for so
45:56 - much more because of the ways the
45:58 - pandemic has changed the importance and
46:00 - need for computer science i want to
46:03 - mention three different ways the
46:04 - pandemic is going to accelerate the work
46:07 - of computer science education in the
46:09 - next three years
46:11 - the first is the proliferation of
46:12 - devices in the united states we are at
46:15 - now at the point where 90 of students
46:18 - have one-on-one devices given to them
46:20 - from the school this is a change that
46:22 - happened because of the pandemic when
46:24 - when everything shifted to distance
46:26 - learning and now we have an opportunity
46:28 - to use those devices for more than
46:30 - zooming into classrooms but for learning
46:33 - how to create technology and this isn't
46:35 - a us-only trend uh i was just speaking
46:38 - to to
46:40 - the the
46:41 - i think it's claudia from el salvador
46:43 - who's saying that they're rolling out
46:44 - computers to every single student in el
46:46 - salvador not every country has the same
46:49 - capability but across all the countries
46:52 - there's been an increase in devices
46:54 - the second pandemic change that is
46:56 - helping our movement is that every
46:58 - teacher
46:59 - has had a crash course in technology
47:02 - whether it's learning zoom or slido or
47:05 - kahoot or whatever it is every teacher
47:08 - had to up their technology game
47:10 - every school had to learn to adapt
47:13 - and after decades of thinking that
47:15 - schools and education can't adapt
47:17 - everybody has learned that when there's
47:19 - a need we can adapt our school systems
47:22 - and so that gives us an opportunity to
47:24 - rethink what education should look like
47:26 - in the future
47:28 - there's a third and still ongoing change
47:30 - from the pandemic which is the economic
47:33 - hurt caused by the closures of every
47:35 - business for almost a year
47:38 - everywhere around the world economies
47:40 - are hurting and we're still seeing that
47:42 - today with the issues with our supply
47:44 - chain it's going to take some time for
47:46 - things to come back
47:47 - so the need for opportunity people's
47:49 - need for having a livelihood for seeing
47:52 - a pathway up is greater now than ever
47:54 - before
47:55 - and during in that situation meanwhile
47:58 - what has changed is the nature of work
48:00 - the number of companies that are willing
48:02 - to hire people with technical skills
48:04 - anywhere in any community in any state
48:07 - and in many cases in any country
48:10 - these are all logos of companies that
48:12 - have said they will hire technologists
48:14 - remotely so you don't need to move to
48:16 - silicon valley if you're growing up in
48:18 - rural kentucky you can get a tech job in
48:21 - rural kentucky
48:23 - in fact if you look at the states that
48:25 - have the most job openings in computing
48:28 - california is the largest state with 70
48:31 - 000 open computing jobs
48:33 - the second largest is remote which means
48:36 - you can work from anywhere you don't
48:38 - need to move to california to work in
48:40 - tech you could work from wherever it is
48:42 - and this is something that is not only a
48:44 - u.s
48:46 - change or trend this is going to be a
48:47 - global trend which means anywhere in the
48:50 - world
48:51 - the the way towards opportunity is more
48:54 - going to be about education work will
48:55 - come to where the talent is
48:58 - and so as we think about ushering a new
49:00 - decade
49:01 - we can establish that computer science
49:03 - is more important now than ever before
49:06 - and this has to be our mindset we need
49:08 - to reignite interest in computer science
49:11 - and we need to help educators think
49:12 - about establishing a new normal with
49:15 - computer science as a basic part of it
49:18 - in the united states we've worked so
49:20 - hard to get ap computer science to grow
49:22 - we need to imagine that in the in the
49:24 - 2020s computer science is going to
49:27 - become an equal of the other top ap
49:29 - subjects right alongside english
49:31 - literature u.s history biology or
49:34 - calculus computer science should be at
49:36 - least equal if not ahead of some of
49:38 - those aps in popularity it's still far
49:41 - from there today because it's not even
49:43 - available in most schools but we are
49:45 - definitely going to catch up with that
49:47 - within the next 10 years
49:49 - the other thing we need to establish is
49:51 - that computer science isn't just about
49:52 - tech jobs it's a foundational part of
49:55 - basic education it's as foundational as
49:58 - reading and writing and arithmetic
50:00 - just like you use what you learn in
50:02 - english class when you go into history
50:04 - class and just like you use the math you
50:07 - learn when you go into physics class
50:10 - we're going to need to establish that
50:11 - computer science isn't just its own
50:14 - standalone course it will need to be
50:16 - integrated into other courses as well
50:19 - and in fact for this year's hour of code
50:21 - our theme is that computer science is
50:23 - everywhere to help show teachers to make
50:26 - connections between computer science and
50:28 - other fields like biology like art like
50:32 - history and so on
50:33 - and code.org is going to be announcing
50:35 - its own curriculum efforts in this space
50:37 - soon we're going to make a multi-year
50:39 - effort and commitment to support
50:41 - teachers who want to bring computer
50:43 - science not just in computer science
50:46 - class but into the other classes and
50:48 - subjects as well and in fact every
50:50 - computer science teacher is going to
50:52 - have an opportunity to help their school
50:54 - integrate computer science into physics
50:57 - into chemistry into social studies into
51:00 - art into literature to help make those
51:02 - connections
51:05 - we also need to establish the computer
51:07 - science is more important is more than
51:10 - just coding you know my hat says code on
51:13 - it so a lot of people assume that
51:14 - computer science and code are the same
51:16 - thing
51:17 - but computer science is about so much
51:19 - more and in fact the non-coding aspects
51:22 - of computer science in this decade are
51:24 - likely to become more important than
51:26 - coding when you think about data science
51:28 - ai machine learning and cyber security
51:31 - those three things together might be
51:33 - more important than coding by the end of
51:36 - the 2020s
51:38 - cyber security requires its own special
51:40 - call out i was recently at the white
51:42 - house to talk with all the top tech
51:44 - leaders the top banking leaders
51:46 - insurance leaders and education leaders
51:48 - in the country about the importance of
51:50 - cyber security to our national defense
51:52 - and this isn't just a us issue it's a
51:54 - global issue
51:56 - we are in a cyber world war right now
51:58 - people don't talk about it because it's
52:00 - invisible but our country and every
52:03 - country is in a state of war when it
52:04 - comes to cyber security and every cs
52:07 - teacher plays a role in our national
52:09 - cyber defense in helping citizens know
52:12 - how to stay stay safe online and how to
52:14 - protect their home computers because as
52:16 - we are all connected a student's
52:19 - computer at home is on the same network
52:21 - as their mom or dad's computer who's
52:23 - then logging in remotely into a
52:25 - workplace and one person making a
52:27 - mistake can cause entire systems to go
52:30 - down
52:32 - my last comment i want to make is that
52:34 - computer science is increasingly about
52:36 - solving global problems
52:38 - and this is one of the most important
52:39 - messages we need to establish
52:42 - when i was studying computer science it
52:44 - was about
52:45 - using coding to solve or to calculate
52:48 - the fibonacci sequence of numbers or
52:50 - using recursion to calculate factorials
52:53 - and many of you who learned computer
52:55 - science over the last 10 or 20 years may
52:57 - have heard
52:58 - learned it that way when mark zuckerberg
53:00 - was starting computer science it was
53:02 - about sharing information on the
53:03 - internet
53:04 - we need to establish that computer
53:06 - science is about curing diseases
53:08 - cleaning oceans addressing global
53:10 - poverty addressing gender equality and
53:13 - addressing climate
53:15 - this we need to change our computer
53:16 - science courses to be about solving
53:19 - global problems and to recognize this
53:21 - movement as a global movement
53:23 - the next generation is inheriting all
53:25 - sorts of issues and problems from the
53:28 - older generation and most of those
53:29 - problems are going to be ones that
53:31 - they're going to be able to solve using
53:33 - technology but only if we democratize
53:36 - access to the learning and the skills
53:38 - for them to do that
53:41 - one last question i want to bring up is
53:43 - this question of should computer science
53:44 - even be a graduation requirement this is
53:47 - a question we are going to face over the
53:49 - next decade it's a question that's
53:51 - already being asked in the united states
53:53 - in multiple states
53:55 - there are three states so far
53:57 - arkansas south carolina and nevada that
53:59 - require every student must learn
54:01 - computer science and in fact because of
54:04 - doing that they are addressing gender
54:06 - disparity and racial disparity and
54:08 - income disparity in who enrolls because
54:10 - every student enrolls when it's a
54:12 - graduation requirement there's many
54:14 - other states already thinking about this
54:17 - and code.org hasn't yet decided to put
54:19 - its weight behind a graduation
54:21 - requirement as a recommendation but we
54:23 - are certainly aware that this is a
54:26 - movement and a push that's already
54:27 - happening and i'm confident that over
54:29 - the next 10 years
54:31 - we're going to shift from sort of wait
54:33 - and see approach and and looking at the
54:35 - research
54:36 - 10 years from now we're going to be in
54:38 - the mode that computer science is
54:39 - something that every school not only
54:40 - should teach but that every student
54:42 - should be studying as a requirement for
54:44 - graduating i'm sure that the conditions
54:47 - are going to change in that direction so
54:49 - you need to start thinking every one of
54:51 - us who's working on this problem should
54:52 - think about
54:53 - what does it take to make computer
54:55 - science a graduation requirement what
54:57 - are the conditions that need to be
54:58 - present in terms of the schools the
55:01 - teaching capacity the universities the
55:03 - funding etc to get us to get a state or
55:06 - even a country to be ready for that
55:08 - change
55:09 - if we think 10 years out we should be
55:12 - able to get every u.s student studying
55:14 - computer science by 2030 by making a
55:17 - requirement for graduation
55:19 - and if you think globally within 20
55:22 - years we should be able to get to every
55:23 - single student in the world by making it
55:26 - a requirement for graduation this is the
55:28 - ultimate holy grail in cs education is
55:30 - making it required for students it's not
55:33 - something we've talked about
55:34 - very much but it is going to be
55:36 - something that over the next decade
55:38 - becomes part of this movement
55:41 - now this movement is a community effort
55:43 - and i'm so thankful for all the
55:44 - organizations that are here with us it's
55:47 - an educator-led movement that started
55:49 - with teachers teachers like juan lonzano
55:52 - in my own neighborhood of south seattle
55:54 - who brought computer science to their
55:55 - own school and from their school spread
55:58 - it to their entire district who helped
56:00 - make
56:01 - policy change happen in all 50 states
56:04 - and we're now at the point that all 70
56:06 - that sorry that 70 different countries
56:08 - have announced plans it is amazing for
56:11 - all of us here to be part of a global
56:12 - movement
56:14 - and when i think about this global
56:15 - movement i want to return things to my
56:17 - own personal story and my why
56:20 - when i came to the united states as an
56:22 - immigrant my family didn't have very
56:24 - much i was learning a new language i was
56:26 - learning a new culture i didn't even
56:28 - have the the right fashion sense to
56:30 - dress correctly for the my first day of
56:32 - school
56:33 - but what i did have is a fantastic
56:35 - ability to code and a pathway in
56:38 - education that helped me succeed way
56:41 - ahead of my peers and way ahead of my
56:43 - dreams
56:45 - and so my story is a story of
56:46 - opportunity but my story is also the
56:48 - same as the story of araceli casillas or
56:51 - spencer applegate or of katie clemens in
56:54 - missouri who in her apcs principles
56:57 - class built an app to help diagnose her
56:59 - friend's mental her classmate's mental
57:02 - health or of these students in
57:04 - johannesburg south africa who are
57:06 - participating in africa code week or
57:08 - this young girl in in rural popayan in
57:11 - colombia and this work is thanks to
57:14 - teachers everywhere like flo von in
57:17 - oakland who are globally bringing more
57:19 - and more students into computer science
57:22 - their story is all a story of
57:24 - opportunity
57:25 - at a time when our world is full of
57:27 - despair
57:28 - this movement brings people hope and
57:30 - opportunity and at a time when the world
57:33 - is increasingly divided this movement
57:36 - brings people unity it is a story of
57:38 - unity
57:39 - and so i want to close by thanking all
57:41 - of you and the over 2 million educators
57:44 - and partners together you're helping
57:46 - changing the face of computer science
57:49 - thank you
57:56 - so we have
57:58 - we have some time for
58:00 - uh a couple questions and we have these
58:02 - two microphones right here so if you'd
58:05 - like to come up and ask a question of
58:06 - hottie this is the opportunity to ask
58:09 - i'll ask a question of hadi ari
58:12 - uh what is the
58:14 - the greatest challenge we face
58:16 - coming out of kovid in terms of uh
58:19 - raising more awareness around computer
58:21 - science
58:23 - that's a great question
58:25 - i think our greatest challenge is the
58:26 - same challenge we've faced
58:28 - for the whole time this movement has
58:30 - been growing which is
58:32 - the challenge of perceptions
58:34 - about whether or not computer science is
58:36 - part of basic education
58:38 - most adults think of education as the
58:41 - school they went through and so when
58:43 - they think about computer science they
58:44 - don't think of adding it at the same
58:47 - level as math or english they think of
58:49 - adding it like as an after school
58:50 - activity or a maker lab or something for
58:53 - the special kids getting adults to think
58:55 - that this is as foundational as reading
58:59 - or writing or math or science and it
59:00 - belongs as a pillar of education that is
59:03 - by far the hardest challenge to change
59:05 - hearts and minds but we are lucky
59:07 - because of the pandemic that there is a
59:08 - new
59:09 - opportunity to rethink things people are
59:11 - more willing to rethink education just
59:14 - like you see people are willing to
59:16 - rethink the workplace that we have an
59:18 - opportunity because of the pandemic to
59:20 - actually break through in terms of this
59:22 - this perception
59:25 - great
59:26 - thank you hottie
59:28 - any other questions come on up come on
59:31 - up to the microphones and you can
59:33 - ask a question of our ceo here
59:38 - and please introduce yourself
59:41 - hey hottie my name is mark barnes i'm a
59:43 - computer science specialist with the
59:44 - state of arkansas
59:46 - i work with
59:47 - the arkansas school for the deaf and the
59:49 - arkansas school for the blind and
59:51 - visually impaired
59:52 - what kind of work is code.org doing
59:54 - right now
59:56 - to help students particularly students
59:58 - with blindness and visual impairment
60:01 - who may not be able to use like a
60:02 - block-based coding environment or some
60:04 - of the other tools that are currently a
60:06 - big part of computer science education
60:09 - that's a really good question
60:11 - you know students with learning
60:12 - disabilities of any sorts are
60:14 - are a different group that is
60:15 - underrepresented in computer science and
60:17 - there's work that needs to be done
60:19 - when it comes to deaf students code.org
60:21 - has done a lot
60:22 - such as putting captions in all of our
60:24 - videos and a number of other activities
60:27 - like that when it comes to
60:28 - vision impaired students code.org's own
60:31 - courses aren't directly supportive
60:33 - enough but we've partnered with a group
60:35 - called access i think access cs out of
60:37 - university of washington working with a
60:39 - tool called quorum to make a a version
60:42 - of our cs principles course designed for
60:44 - visually impaired students
60:46 - and this is a topic that is near and
60:48 - dear to my heart so we haven't we
60:50 - haven't yet announced plans for doing
60:52 - things to to support
60:54 - visually impaired students but as we
60:56 - think of new ides and new ways to teach
60:58 - computer programming you know not only
61:01 - the block based coding is vision based
61:03 - if you look at the actual output of the
61:05 - programs it's usually drawing art or
61:08 - making apps or making websites and one
61:10 - of my personal interests is to see can
61:12 - we shift to you know using python or
61:15 - java to make music or to make chat bots
61:18 - you know voice chat like alexa these are
61:21 - also technological systems that you
61:23 - don't need your eyes to be able to
61:25 - interface with the computer to listen to
61:26 - music or to use voice-based uh computing
61:29 - and i think but those are going to be
61:31 - opportunities we tap into in the next
61:32 - decade
61:34 - thank you
61:38 - good afternoon
61:39 - definitely i'm height deficient sorry
61:42 - um good afternoon my name is fran
61:44 - bromley norwood i am the k-12 computer
61:47 - science administrator for the clark
61:48 - county school district
61:50 - in nevada um and i my question for you
61:54 - is is that when you have the opportunity
61:55 - to go to the white house primarily to
61:57 - talk about cyber security
61:59 - as we're aware unfortunately the
62:01 - internet infrastructure
62:04 - globally specifically in our country in
62:07 - order to make sure that they're getting
62:08 - those opportunities
62:10 - that are the plugged version versus the
62:12 - unplugged version of what code.org
62:14 - offers whereas conversation discussed i
62:17 - know that there have been a lot of input
62:19 - and communication regarding making that
62:21 - happen i was just wondering whether or
62:23 - not you've had an opportunity to
62:25 - demonstrate that code.org would like to
62:27 - support that
62:28 - in order to make sure that students
62:31 - you know countrywide are able to access
62:34 - the amazing programming that's available
62:37 - for them
62:38 - so that those numbers get higher in
62:39 - terms of exposure to computer science
62:42 - well we have advocated for increased
62:44 - connectivity in schools
62:46 - throughout our existence we're lucky in
62:48 - the united states that there's
62:50 - billions of dollars a year being
62:51 - provided by the federal government for
62:53 - school internet connectivity although
62:54 - we're still not at 100 of schools the
62:57 - the picture of connectivity in schools
62:59 - in the us today is far better than eight
63:02 - years ago when code.org started
63:04 - and globally even it is improving but
63:07 - far far behind
63:09 - but i am hopeful that internet
63:11 - connectivity in schools as well as
63:13 - device availability for students those
63:15 - are things that are growing even with or
63:17 - without code.org
63:20 - my main goal is to make sure as we
63:22 - connect up schools and as we give
63:23 - devices to students let's also provide
63:26 - the education for them to not only learn
63:28 - how to use technology but how to create
63:30 - it or how to understand its societal
63:32 - impacts
63:33 - and i believe that's actually the harder
63:35 - challenge because there's lots and lots
63:37 - of people worrying about connecting
63:39 - schools and not enough worrying about
63:41 - computer science education but thank you
63:43 - so much
63:44 - thank you
63:46 - and pat i think we're all set yeah we
63:49 - have uh two more questions hottie okay
63:51 - um
63:54 - hi heidi i'm ann leflich i'm a professor
63:56 - at indiana university and i'm a code um
63:59 - csf facilitator for next tech and also
64:02 - co-pi for the esup grants um my question
64:05 - really comes in as we're talking about
64:06 - elementary and you're talking about all
64:08 - the different areas um
64:10 - where computer science is incorporating
64:12 - ethics and incorporating ai and data
64:14 - science and cyber security what do you
64:16 - see happening to your elementary
64:18 - curriculum and how is that going to be
64:20 - adapted to either include those things
64:21 - or do you see that as
64:23 - something that is going to be included
64:24 - up in the higher grades
64:26 - that's a great question so the code.org
64:28 - cs fundamentals elementary curriculum
64:30 - already includes
64:32 - aspects of digital literacy digital
64:35 - citizenship cyber security we recently
64:37 - added our ai for oceans module into that
64:40 - just to make sure those students learn
64:42 - about machine learning as part of cs
64:43 - fundamentals but the real effort that we
64:46 - need to do is the one that i mentioned
64:48 - earlier which is basically
64:50 - creating
64:52 - learning units for integrating computer
64:53 - science into math into english into art
64:57 - and into the other subjects taught in
64:58 - elementary schools
65:00 - because when you think about computer
65:01 - science in elementary schools
65:03 - code.org has and and scratch both have
65:06 - spread very broadly as kind of a special
65:08 - in education but they're not
65:10 - systemically included in most schools
65:13 - and one of the best ways to be
65:14 - systemically included in elementary
65:16 - education is to also be included as part
65:18 - of math and english and the other
65:20 - subjects that are
65:22 - effectively baked into elementary
65:24 - education and so as we think about
65:26 - shifting from sort of a teacher-led
65:28 - effort to teach coding in k-5 to making
65:31 - it more of a district-led effort part of
65:33 - our work is going to be about creating
65:35 - the curriculum lessons for integration
65:37 - into math integration into english
65:39 - integration into social studies etc and
65:42 - and that's the future of where our
65:44 - elementary curriculum is going
65:48 - thank you crystal franklin c.s for clea
65:50 - out of cleveland state university and of
65:51 - course esep
65:53 - uh you mentioned there are uh three
65:55 - states that currently require cs4
65:57 - graduation
65:58 - do you foresee any danger and i'm going
66:01 - to use danger
66:02 - in the way you think
66:03 - of mandating that where there's resource
66:06 - poor districts and the option to opt out
66:09 - may create actually the reverse effect
66:11 - that's a great question and in fact
66:13 - you're
66:14 - to
66:15 - the the question she asked is is there
66:17 - any danger to mandating computer science
66:19 - for graduation
66:21 - there absolutely is and that is why i
66:23 - said code.org is still in a wait-and-see
66:25 - mode of trying to understand
66:27 - how things go in the states that have
66:29 - done this and getting a better sense of
66:31 - what the conditions on the ground need
66:32 - to be to make it possible uh the dangers
66:35 - of mandating computer science for
66:37 - graduation without thinking about it the
66:39 - the most obvious danger is kids not
66:41 - graduating
66:42 - beca you know the other danger is at
66:45 - schools that don't have the capacity to
66:47 - teach computer science
66:49 - you know what do they do
66:51 - do they not graduate students or what
66:53 - are they cut or so on so
66:56 - but thinking about mandating it for
66:57 - students forces you to address all the
67:00 - other access and representation and
67:02 - funding issues and there's many states
67:04 - who are then looking at that and saying
67:06 - what what can they do about it there's a
67:08 - state
67:09 - that i where i've been
67:10 - talking to some of the leadership of a
67:12 - state where they're talking about first
67:13 - of all reducing some of the other
67:15 - graduation requirements so it doesn't
67:17 - raise the bar on students and about
67:19 - providing funding to every school to
67:21 - teach computer science and also offering
67:23 - an online sort of
67:25 - option for a school that doesn't have a
67:27 - cs teacher at least students can learn
67:29 - it online
67:31 - and certainly anthony owen who's here
67:33 - from arkansas
67:34 - can share if you talk to with him later
67:36 - what are the steps arkansas took
67:38 - getting to cs as a graduation
67:40 - requirement requires all the other work
67:42 - first to get to uh you know if the the
67:46 - the slide that cal showed about the cape
67:47 - framework it requires the capacity and
67:50 - the access and and the then finally this
67:54 - brings in the the participation and the
67:56 - experience for students
67:57 - thank you for the questions very
67:59 - important to keep it in mind
68:04 - howdy thank you so much for uh
68:07 - giving us a vision for the future of
68:09 - computer science
68:15 - just a couple notes per those questions
68:17 - you can visit code.org accessibility if
68:20 - you want to learn about our
68:22 - accessibility uh work
68:25 - including
68:26 - with
68:27 - deaf students and students who are
68:29 - visually impaired
68:30 - and as per the last question that
68:31 - crystal asked about states
68:33 - we actually have a session about that
68:35 - how to make computer science and
68:36 - graduation requirement the right way
68:38 - actually featuring arkansas the national
68:40 - governors association as well as south
68:42 - carolina if you're interested in that
68:44 - visit that session tomorrow right now
68:47 - we have regional networking
68:50 - and so in about 10 minutes
68:53 - you're going to be in these different
68:55 - rooms depending on whether you are in
68:57 - the midwest northeast south or west now
68:59 - you might be wondering well actually
69:01 - what what what is my state is it is it
69:03 - midwest or is it is it south well if you
69:06 - visit csedcon.com
69:09 - schedule
69:10 - you'll find a listing of the states
69:13 - per those different regions so those are
69:15 - those rooms those rooms you'll actually
69:17 - find right outside
69:20 - this door to the california ballroom
69:22 - and down the stairs
69:24 - and then around the corner those that's
69:25 - where all the regional networking rooms
69:27 - are as well as all of our sessions
69:30 - go ahead you are dismissed
69:39 - you

Cleaned transcript:

wow uh so bye so do foreign do two foreign dude i miss you i miss you my the world has some big problems but i'm little what can i do even when problems seem big we can tackle them one step at a time our generation can help make a more prosperous equitable and sustainable world i'm learning to code i'm designing apps that solve local problems i'm programming robots on learning computer science to make change happen because with technology we can build robots to clean the world's oceans we can program drones to detect forest fires quickly we young women with digital skills and tools we can program our mobile apps to streamline farming in poor rural areas we can use gene sequencing to diagnose diseases and create personalized medicine to cure them i'm little but don't look at my size look at my potential i can make change happen i can make change happen i can make change happen i can make change happen welcome everyone to the 2021 computer science education conference cs edcon give yourselves a round of applause feel free to tweet your questions or just comments pictures to atco.org hashtag csedcon my name is pat yarm praddit and you know a lot of things have changed during the last year and a half this particular picture is actually about 10 years old and obviously precovered premask wearing so you know i went to the code.org website and i decided to update it uh you know just kidding that's that's not me that's that's the winter soldier but this is me and and yes i've been working out but all jokes aside we have 270 participants here again give yourselves a round of applause just for making it out go ahead and raise your hand if this is the first inperson conference you've had since covey began wow so it's a wonderful uh time to be here it's a wonderful time in computer science education like i said we have 270 participants from 47 states and 10 countries and given the fact that all of us have been zoomed out over the last year and a half i want you to know that this conference is designed around engagement from the regional networking session we're going to have after this plenary session to the reception later on this evening to the happy hour tomorrow and the strategy sessions on friday we've designed this conference to promote valuable interactions so cs edcon was designed to foster unique interactions to focus and energize the computer science education community and to develop to help you develop new tools and strategies to advance equity in your states your regions and your countries so again thank you for attending cs edcon without further ado i'd like to introduce mrs allison yoshimoto tauri she's going to welcome us to los angeles but first a quick bio about miss mrs yoshimoto towery allison is the chief academic officer of los angeles unified school district she oversees birth to adult education most important to allison is leading from an equity lens and rethinking how business as usual is done to meet the needs of those students and communities historically underserved by public education certainly a mission that we can commiserate with in computer science education mrs allison yoshimoto towery thank you thanks so much so welcome to los angeles everybody so for those of you joining virtually i want you to know there are over 200 and almost 300 people here that are dressed from head to toe in professional clothes quite amazing so it's a blessing to be with you today in person i did want to welcome you to sunny los angeles i know many of you got on planes and are traveling for the first time it's wonderful to be here together i wanted to take you on a little journey but first i wanted to say i'm a mother of two boys we have about a half a million los angeles students sitting in classroom right at this very moment as we're breathing here in this room and they're waiting for the opportunity to for us to do exactly what we're here to talk about my father was an auto mechanic in east los angeles and went to l unified schools and when he started as an auto mechanic it only required a wrench but by the time he finished in his lifetime he needed to understand how to use a computer to fix a car so i'm going to start by from the back from the end and talk forward and in the next few minutes want to build a picture for ourselves if we know already that computing is the number one source of income for our students in the united states and if we know already that girls who take an ap computer science class are 10 times more likely to major in computer science and if we know already that our black and latino students who take ap computer science are seven times more likely to major in computer science and if we know already that students love art and music and computer science and they find more joy in those things in school then we want to make sure that all of our students have those opportunities don't we i want to hear that really loud don't we yes we absolutely do so our challenge today and over the course of this conference is to really think about joy equity and how do we provide that engagement equity and that joy equity that our students deserve every day just like a paper and a piece and a pencil access to computer science to coding is what's going to give them access not necessarily all in computer science industry but that creative innovative thought and that design thinking that students get when they're creating coding when they're it's like riding a bike with the wind flowing through your hair where you know you can steer yourself they get that same feeling when they're learning computer science and how to code that's going to create the new best transportation in this country in this world it's going to create the new fashionista because it's that creative thought right it's going to create the new best way to fix somebody who needs heart surgery because we're we're investing in our young people and the way to think about problems in the world and to create solutions so with that i just want to say thank you for investing thank you for putting everything and being all in with us because this is not just about public education it's about how the private sector offers internships to our students it's about how philanthropy makes up the difference between what students some students get at home and what others don't it's about how our nonprofit world like our amazing partnership with code.org give it up for them leans into public education to support our students and our teachers and our next educators because the way we learned computer science 15 years ago is not the way our students are going to need to be learning at 15 years from now so even today as our students are sitting in class we need to be thinking differently as the grownups in the room so thank you all welcome to la and thank you for blessing us with your presence today and enjoy your conference thank you again allison thank you so let's go over some logistics starting with uh a bitly link that you all actually have access to on your lanyards i don't have a lanyard on me right now but right behind it is a qr code if you use that qr code you can actually connect to our daily digest that daily digest also includes there it is bitly csikon21 that's the bitly link but you can just use a qr code as well in that daily digest you will find a question parking lot and yes so if you have questions you can type those questions into that question parking lot we'll answer them during the plenaries or the breaks we're going to be tweeting at hashtag cs edcon if you need to use the bathroom it's just over to your left over there that's pretty important we've been released from zoom meetings for the next what two two and a half days so let's take the time to engage with one another personally and like i said we've designed this conference around personal interaction additionally cell phone wise please quiet your cell phones during sessions and if you need to connect to the wifi in this area the conference area weston meeting and the password is lowercase cs edcon 2021. now the conference team has worked really hard to make this conference a safe inperson experience and everyone who is here has completed a covid vaccination attestation form thank you for that the local policy here requires us to wear mass at all times indoors unless eating and outside it's recommended but voluntary and so we'll be outside later on for the reception you have these table tents on all of your tables including in this room as well as in the session rooms please uh use that qr code to access our uh contact tracing form so that in the in the case where there might be some medical situation we can uh trace contacts additionally you've all been given the opportunity to wear different colored lanyards depending on your um your just to describe your personal space so starting with the pink one to the yellow one and then the blue one the blue one this uh this okay with hugs and handshakes actually it's been surprising a lot of people are actually okay with hugs and handshakes so much that we actually ran out of those purplish lanyards we had to find another batch so if you had to pick a yellow one and you're actually okay with hugs and handshakes you can go ahead and switch that later on we found another batch lastly we have rapid uh antigen testing in the san diego room uh thursday tomorrow from 3 to 5 pm and then friday at uh from 10 to 12 30. lastly uh the entire schedule is available online at cs edcon dot com schedule there you can create an account add your picture figure out what sessions you want to attend additionally because these sessions are so amazing if you can't attend a session during a particular breakout session slot the slide decks will be uploaded probably about 30 minutes to an hour before that session begins so without further ado i want to introduce our next speakers jake baskin the executive director of the computer science teachers association carol fletcher the principal investigator investigator of the esup alliance and dr katie hendrickson the president of the code.org advocacy coalition let's give them a round of applause good afternoon everyone i am dr katie hendrickson and i am so thrilled to be here with you all to launch the 2021 state of computer science education report this is the fifth annual report which combines information about policies that have been adopted to support computer science education with implementation data on computer science access and opportunity code.org the csta and esep are the coauthors of the report but the real work comes from everybody here in this room and everybody watching on the live stream we thank our corporate partners our nonprofit partners coalition members advocating for computer science the policy makers who are making computer science foundational and all of the teachers and school leaders who are doing this work on the ground so you'll have a copy of this report i'll take you through some of these highlights for the first time finally half of all high schools in the united states offer computer science this is tremendous this is such a milestone that's up from about 35 percent just a few years ago but on the other hand this means that half of all schools still lack access and there are gaps in who has access i live in a rural community in southeastern ohio one of the poorest counties in the state and students there are likely to attend an underresourced school students who attend urban schools rural schools or schools that serve high populations of economically disadvantaged students are less likely to offer computer science we need to start to accelerate the closing of these gaps and how do we do that well one answer is policy we know from this report that policy does matter it makes a difference states that adopt more computer science education policies see a greater percentage of high schools offering computer science this is where we can really make a difference to ensure that every student has access so i'd be remiss if i didn't mention what these nine policies are they're detailed in the report so you can dig in but we've seen incredible growth over the past year 50 policies have been adopted by 31 states this year 21 of those states continued their funding for computer science teacher professional development 65 million dollars this year were allocated by state legislatures prioritizing this that's more than any year previous and this year we also saw our first comprehensive policy adoption where now students in every single state can apply a computer science course towards their high school graduation requirements every single student three states went even further and now require all students to take a computer science course in high school before graduation this has been such a big year for computer science education policy now i'm going to turn over to jake jay can you tell us about what this means for implementation and enrollment in schools absolutely thanks katie and this katie said while we cross that halfway threshold we still know that almost half of all schools still don't offer a single computer science course and we also now know thanks to more detailed data from states that even in places that do offer a course it doesn't necessarily mean that students are taking it or that that opportunity is distributed equally for the first time i'm really thrilled to share that we can report that 4.7 of all high school students enrolled in a foundational computer science course last year that's for all foundational computer science courses not just ap so i want you to take a second and think about what that percentage is for a math class or an english class in your state although this number represents tremendous growth for computer science there's still so many students who are missing out and there are persistently predictable disparities in who's taking these classes we now know that by introducing computer science and elementary grades in environments where all students are learning together we're thrilled to see gender parity and participation in computer science however as we move into middle and high school we see that gender gap widen where there's a a larger gap in participation between males male students and their female and nonbinary peers and as we look at english learners students with disabilities or economically disadvantaged students those gaps persist relative to the overall population of those students in the student body to me these data make it incredibly clear that it's not just about access to computer science it's about what's happening every single day inside of classrooms to ensure that students are walking into equitable and inclusive environments and we need to invest deeply in how we support teachers and develop them throughout their careers to ensure that every student is walking into a welcoming and sustaining computer science environment in fact that's why we specifically call out in the standards for cs teachers that teachers be active advocates for equity and inclusion in their classroom and here at csta we're thrilled to support teachers as they work to create an intentional equity focused vision to improve access engagement and achievement for all of their students in cs and while i'm up here and have the stage i just want to take a second to say an enormous thank you to all of the computer science teachers here in the room and who are watching on the live stream for all of the work that you've been doing it's been probably the most challenging two years imaginable for computer science teachers and teachers everywhere and the wins in this report are thanks to the work that you're doing every day in your classroom so thank you and we also know that teachers operate in larger systems so i'd like to turn it over to carol to share a little bit more about what the report tells us about those environments thank you so um we know that uh csta has done an exceptional job of really providing the supports that teachers need to teach equitably and inclusively in their classrooms but we also know that if we want to scale and sustain the the improvements we've seen in access and participation and evidenced in this report we've also got to address the systems that are producing these equities and in the esep alliance we look at we use a framework called the cape framework to really analyze the entire ecosystem of cs education so we're looking at what is the capacity for equitable cs education where does access and equity intersect what is our uh equitable participation look like and then finally are we giving equitable experiences to students in order to do that work at that systems level however we've got to have disaggregated data at the state level as well because we can't measure what we can't see and so i'm really excited to celebrate some improvements we've seen this year in the report we see that we have more than doubled the number of states that are that are sharing disaggregated data around things like students with disabilities students who are economically disadvantaged race gender english language learners this is a fantastic improvement but as you can see with 30 to 35 states we still don't have every state able to share and interrogate this kind of data and so we need to do more so that we can identify our priorities and then set goals and establish interventions for improvement based on that data i want to give you a couple of examples of states that are using policy policies like what katie mentioned in order to do this one example is the state of washington uh washington was able to implement a policy that said they would have to collect this kind of disaggregated data and generate an annual report i was just reading the annual report the other night on their website their first report out so they've used data policy to drive equity another example of this is in the state of indiana just this year where their legislature said every k12 school has to offer computer science and our state has to collect data based on all of these disaggregated factors so that we can see where those gaps are and then make investments to address those gaps great news here is that when we have this kind of disaggregated data at a state level then we can bring it together up at a national level in the report and here's an example when we look across the nation what we see when we look at who's in our high schools and then who's in our cs classes one of our greatest disparities is with our hispanic and latinx students that means we've got work to do so what we're doing in the ecf alliance to support that work we are launching a threeyear common metrics project to help states all across the country understand how to build these common metrics for measuring capacity access participation and experience and to contribute to the broader national conversation around how we help everyone across the country address these inequities i'm going to turn it over to katie now to finish up thank you all right well thank you carol it's great to hear about this work that esep is doing to support state teams and data systems it really does matter for this report and for knowing where our gaps are so i know you're all wondering where you can find out more you have the book in front of you but there are so many more resources online so the blue table tents have a qr code you'll also see the qr code on the standees throughout the reception area and it's also of course on the slide behind me and on the back cover of your book you can go to the website to find statespecific handity handouts an accessible pdf and a tableau interactive data visualization where you can see every single school in the country that offers computer science or doesn't you can filter that by state by region by legislative district however you want to be able to see who has access and opportunity so thank you all so much i'd now like to introduce code.org's founder and ceo hadi partovi who's going to talk to us about the next decade of computer science education hadi partovi thank you pat it is so great to be here and to see so many faces in person i actually just wanted to start by thanking both my staff at code.org and also the hotel staff for helping organize the first inperson gathering of the cs community since the pandemic closed the amount of work that has gone into making sure things are safe between the rapid testing and and everything thank you all so please give a round of applause to everybody helping uh pat asked me to start my presentation uh with a brief personal a brief version of a personal story that i shared at the cs.com two years ago our first cs edcon i want to apologize for those of you who attended then that this may be a little bit repetitive but i'm going to make it shorter and i hope for the folks who are i'm seeing for the first time that is a meaningful message but i wanted to talk a little bit before i talk about the future of cs about my why uh you know about my personal motivation for what caused me to start code.org because when you know why you're doing something you put more into it my mother was a computer scientist in iran and my father was a physicist a professor and he started a university to teach technology which has now become the mit of the middle east so between a mother who's a computer scientist and a father who's a professor you could say i had computer science education literally in my blood but that's only part of my why i grew up in tehran iran it's a beautiful country with jungles and beaches and mountains and ski resorts and shopping malls and the main capital tehran is quite different than the stereotypes you see in traditional western media when i was six years old my life turned upside down the country broke out into an islamic revolution and all sorts of change happened in my life i was part of a large family all of whom fled the country my father decided that we would stay behind because he wanted to make sure his university stayed stable during a time of upheaval and life got really really different you know i spent most of my early childhood in constant fear living in a police state you know there were i had friends in our family friends or even family members who'd gotten disappeared and whisked away and for who knows what and i learned that it was safest to just not talk to anybody to act like i was you know to pretend like i was a muslim because that's what you had to do there was forced prayer in school and basically i learned that the safest thing was to not be seen and that was how i would survive and then as the police state if that wasn't enough a war broke out with the neighboring country of iraq which invaded and then my my home was right next to the television station of the country so we had bombings every other night so most of my evenings in my childhood were spent in a basement with a kerosene lamp holding my ears just hoping that our home would get spared and my father would wake up in the morning to go up to the rooftop to assess the damage and so this was basically the repeated scenes of what i saw growing up and then things got bad enough eventually that my parents decided uh we weren't gonna stay there and so then we we decided to move to the united states which itself if anybody here is an immigrant knows is not an easy process but it's extra difficult if you're iranian during the 1980s so we when we applied for admission to the united states we were rejected the first time we were rejected the second time we were rejected the third time but then finally we got in on as tourists uh but then i needed to my parents wanted us to stay permanently as students that wasn't possible so i was actually deported and told i need to go back to my home country we got very lucky that a a generous lawyer helped us basically apply a fourth time and uh the fourth time we finally got to stay uh in the country but staying in america as a as a new immigrant family had its own challenges my family was poor uh that we you know we didn't have our own house uh we had to share a bedroom all four of us with mom and dad my brother and i sharing two twin beds that were stuck next to each other uh i i didn't get to buy my own clothes i only wore very loosefitting handmedowns the first car i managed to get with my brother together we scrapped together 500 to buy our own car but this was still wonderful because we weren't living in fear and we weren't in a time of war what wasn't so great is the discrimination iranians faced at that time my first nickname in school was sheikh my second nickname was jihad literally calling me a terrorist and i learned again to laugh along at jokes made at my expense and to try not to be different than anybody else but after all this my life has turned out to be amazing i went to the best school and because of my parents investment in education i i attended on financial aid and i worked throughout my summers and and school years to pay tuition i majored in computer science i got my first job in technology and since then doors have been open for me and things have just gotten better and better and better and i'm now living thanks to the amazingness of the opportunity systems in this country and the education i had i'm now a nice embodiment of the american dream but i should say still as an iranian in this country it is not always uh roses you know iranian americans even though my skin is white life in the us doesn't come with all the privileges of being white you know iranian americans and middle easterners in general have sought for decades to be classified by the united states as people of color to recognize the discrimination that we face some people get to be judged the moment somebody sees your face other people are judged when your name shows up on a resume or an email and for me this is still personal within the last year i was called arab trash by somebody and also just in the last seven months the association of computing machinery in our own field of computer science gave its highest award the turing award to a professor who explicitly said that he won't help iranian students now why do i say all this i'm not first of all comfortable saying all this because i'm not asking for pity my story is not a sob story my story is a story of opportunity in the american dream and i wake up every day feeling like i'm the luckiest person in the world but what is relevant is anybody who faces struggles or discrimination of any sort learns about the difficulties that others face and learns empathy for discrimination and learns about how how important it is to give people a pathway and a pathway to opportunity and so when i think about my own story i also think about the story of other students students like spencer applegate growing up in rural kentucky in one of the poorest neighborhoods where almost a third of his fellow students are homeless and he in just a hundred lines of code wrote the the rewrote the game tetris on code.org as an as part of his cs principles class but he's too poor to have the phone that he could play the game on where i think of uh araceli casillas growing up in south seattle as a child of immigrants as the first member of her family to go to university when i see these people's story i see my own story and i share that because each of us has our own story of what brings us into this movement into this idea of helping others survive and helping others thrive my story isn't what we put on the on the main page of code.org because each of us with all of our differences have different reasons why we believe in opportunity for our children but that belief is what brings us together our shared belief that opportunity shouldn't depend on the color of your skin on your gender on your family income on the zip code or the country you grow up in on your religion on your nationality this is what brings us together and this is an idea that unites people across states across countries across political divides it is why our movement has been so strong it is why our movement has had the support of every presidential administration in this country as well as presidential administrations from all uh all political sides across different countries and so the idea that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science is not just an idea about opportunity it's an idea about unity and about bringing people together now i want to reflect a little bit briefly about the amazing process that we the amazing progress that we had in the last decade because this is 2021 but we kind of skipped 2020 and we didn't get a chance to ring in the new decade so this is really our chance to do this i first want to show again the the the picture that katie presented it is amazing that we're now finally at the point that the majority of schools in the united states teach computer science when we started code.org it was around 10 of schools we're now at past the halfway mark of getting to 100 of schools that is amazing work and i want to make sure everybody not only celebrates this work for because it's all your work so quick let's do a round of applause this is the work of all the folks here from the united states working on this and i'd love for you to share the news so if you have your phones please scan this qr code it's a link directly to a tweet about this news if you have your phones just scan the qr code and hit the retweet button we would love to share the news that the majority of u.s schools are now teaching computer science and by the way i'm so happy that everybody now knows how to scan qr codes it's like the new skill that we all learned in the last year and a half there's some other things i just want to share about the progress we've made including the progress we've made just in the last two years two years ago on this stage we announced that there were one million computer science teachers on code.org just two years later there's over 2 million computer science teachers on code.org it's doubled in two years time which is phenomenal and it shows the power of technology spreading education and it also shows that even during a pandemic this movement is strong two years ago we also shared that there's 50 million student projects that have been created on code.org if if doubling the number of teachers wasn't enough we're now at 170 million projects created on code.org and again your work is what has made this possible now if you think about the bigger picture beyond code.org we're part of a global movement in education that is now one of the largest and fastest efforts to add a new subject to the global curriculum in the united states all 50 states have passed policies and plans to make computer science a more systemic part of education there's been over 350 million dollars in federal and state funding for this work and over a hundred thousand new computer science teachers have gone through professional learning workshops thanks to all of our partners and the many other organizations working on this problem and globally over 70 countries have now announced plans of some sort for teaching computer science many of them complete national rollouts or requirements for every student to learn and as i mentioned over 2 million teachers alone on code.org alone have begun teaching and the hour of code this simple idea that just started with having every teacher just try one hour of computer science in their classroom has passed over 1.3 billion engagements all of this has been incredible work and so many of the folks in this room are the ones that are responsible for making it happen so thank you for that but we are still so far behind where we could be behind the vision of every student in every school learning computer science when jake shared the numbers in terms of enrollment of students in the united states it's so great to see that we finally have enrollment numbers for the entire country but we are so far from where we could be and we also know that disparities exist disparities in access based on where you live and or your or your income level disparities enrollment especially among young women in ap computer science there's so much we need to do now as we think forward to the ringing in of a new decade computer science is at a major inflection point this is a major inflection point caused by 2020 and the pandemic and the digital divide the last 10 years we had so much success in our movement the next 10 years we are poised for so much more because of the ways the pandemic has changed the importance and need for computer science i want to mention three different ways the pandemic is going to accelerate the work of computer science education in the next three years the first is the proliferation of devices in the united states we are at now at the point where 90 of students have oneonone devices given to them from the school this is a change that happened because of the pandemic when when everything shifted to distance learning and now we have an opportunity to use those devices for more than zooming into classrooms but for learning how to create technology and this isn't a usonly trend uh i was just speaking to to the the i think it's claudia from el salvador who's saying that they're rolling out computers to every single student in el salvador not every country has the same capability but across all the countries there's been an increase in devices the second pandemic change that is helping our movement is that every teacher has had a crash course in technology whether it's learning zoom or slido or kahoot or whatever it is every teacher had to up their technology game every school had to learn to adapt and after decades of thinking that schools and education can't adapt everybody has learned that when there's a need we can adapt our school systems and so that gives us an opportunity to rethink what education should look like in the future there's a third and still ongoing change from the pandemic which is the economic hurt caused by the closures of every business for almost a year everywhere around the world economies are hurting and we're still seeing that today with the issues with our supply chain it's going to take some time for things to come back so the need for opportunity people's need for having a livelihood for seeing a pathway up is greater now than ever before and during in that situation meanwhile what has changed is the nature of work the number of companies that are willing to hire people with technical skills anywhere in any community in any state and in many cases in any country these are all logos of companies that have said they will hire technologists remotely so you don't need to move to silicon valley if you're growing up in rural kentucky you can get a tech job in rural kentucky in fact if you look at the states that have the most job openings in computing california is the largest state with 70 000 open computing jobs the second largest is remote which means you can work from anywhere you don't need to move to california to work in tech you could work from wherever it is and this is something that is not only a u.s change or trend this is going to be a global trend which means anywhere in the world the the way towards opportunity is more going to be about education work will come to where the talent is and so as we think about ushering a new decade we can establish that computer science is more important now than ever before and this has to be our mindset we need to reignite interest in computer science and we need to help educators think about establishing a new normal with computer science as a basic part of it in the united states we've worked so hard to get ap computer science to grow we need to imagine that in the in the 2020s computer science is going to become an equal of the other top ap subjects right alongside english literature u.s history biology or calculus computer science should be at least equal if not ahead of some of those aps in popularity it's still far from there today because it's not even available in most schools but we are definitely going to catch up with that within the next 10 years the other thing we need to establish is that computer science isn't just about tech jobs it's a foundational part of basic education it's as foundational as reading and writing and arithmetic just like you use what you learn in english class when you go into history class and just like you use the math you learn when you go into physics class we're going to need to establish that computer science isn't just its own standalone course it will need to be integrated into other courses as well and in fact for this year's hour of code our theme is that computer science is everywhere to help show teachers to make connections between computer science and other fields like biology like art like history and so on and code.org is going to be announcing its own curriculum efforts in this space soon we're going to make a multiyear effort and commitment to support teachers who want to bring computer science not just in computer science class but into the other classes and subjects as well and in fact every computer science teacher is going to have an opportunity to help their school integrate computer science into physics into chemistry into social studies into art into literature to help make those connections we also need to establish the computer science is more important is more than just coding you know my hat says code on it so a lot of people assume that computer science and code are the same thing but computer science is about so much more and in fact the noncoding aspects of computer science in this decade are likely to become more important than coding when you think about data science ai machine learning and cyber security those three things together might be more important than coding by the end of the 2020s cyber security requires its own special call out i was recently at the white house to talk with all the top tech leaders the top banking leaders insurance leaders and education leaders in the country about the importance of cyber security to our national defense and this isn't just a us issue it's a global issue we are in a cyber world war right now people don't talk about it because it's invisible but our country and every country is in a state of war when it comes to cyber security and every cs teacher plays a role in our national cyber defense in helping citizens know how to stay stay safe online and how to protect their home computers because as we are all connected a student's computer at home is on the same network as their mom or dad's computer who's then logging in remotely into a workplace and one person making a mistake can cause entire systems to go down my last comment i want to make is that computer science is increasingly about solving global problems and this is one of the most important messages we need to establish when i was studying computer science it was about using coding to solve or to calculate the fibonacci sequence of numbers or using recursion to calculate factorials and many of you who learned computer science over the last 10 or 20 years may have heard learned it that way when mark zuckerberg was starting computer science it was about sharing information on the internet we need to establish that computer science is about curing diseases cleaning oceans addressing global poverty addressing gender equality and addressing climate this we need to change our computer science courses to be about solving global problems and to recognize this movement as a global movement the next generation is inheriting all sorts of issues and problems from the older generation and most of those problems are going to be ones that they're going to be able to solve using technology but only if we democratize access to the learning and the skills for them to do that one last question i want to bring up is this question of should computer science even be a graduation requirement this is a question we are going to face over the next decade it's a question that's already being asked in the united states in multiple states there are three states so far arkansas south carolina and nevada that require every student must learn computer science and in fact because of doing that they are addressing gender disparity and racial disparity and income disparity in who enrolls because every student enrolls when it's a graduation requirement there's many other states already thinking about this and code.org hasn't yet decided to put its weight behind a graduation requirement as a recommendation but we are certainly aware that this is a movement and a push that's already happening and i'm confident that over the next 10 years we're going to shift from sort of wait and see approach and and looking at the research 10 years from now we're going to be in the mode that computer science is something that every school not only should teach but that every student should be studying as a requirement for graduating i'm sure that the conditions are going to change in that direction so you need to start thinking every one of us who's working on this problem should think about what does it take to make computer science a graduation requirement what are the conditions that need to be present in terms of the schools the teaching capacity the universities the funding etc to get us to get a state or even a country to be ready for that change if we think 10 years out we should be able to get every u.s student studying computer science by 2030 by making a requirement for graduation and if you think globally within 20 years we should be able to get to every single student in the world by making it a requirement for graduation this is the ultimate holy grail in cs education is making it required for students it's not something we've talked about very much but it is going to be something that over the next decade becomes part of this movement now this movement is a community effort and i'm so thankful for all the organizations that are here with us it's an educatorled movement that started with teachers teachers like juan lonzano in my own neighborhood of south seattle who brought computer science to their own school and from their school spread it to their entire district who helped make policy change happen in all 50 states and we're now at the point that all 70 that sorry that 70 different countries have announced plans it is amazing for all of us here to be part of a global movement and when i think about this global movement i want to return things to my own personal story and my why when i came to the united states as an immigrant my family didn't have very much i was learning a new language i was learning a new culture i didn't even have the the right fashion sense to dress correctly for the my first day of school but what i did have is a fantastic ability to code and a pathway in education that helped me succeed way ahead of my peers and way ahead of my dreams and so my story is a story of opportunity but my story is also the same as the story of araceli casillas or spencer applegate or of katie clemens in missouri who in her apcs principles class built an app to help diagnose her friend's mental her classmate's mental health or of these students in johannesburg south africa who are participating in africa code week or this young girl in in rural popayan in colombia and this work is thanks to teachers everywhere like flo von in oakland who are globally bringing more and more students into computer science their story is all a story of opportunity at a time when our world is full of despair this movement brings people hope and opportunity and at a time when the world is increasingly divided this movement brings people unity it is a story of unity and so i want to close by thanking all of you and the over 2 million educators and partners together you're helping changing the face of computer science thank you so we have we have some time for uh a couple questions and we have these two microphones right here so if you'd like to come up and ask a question of hottie this is the opportunity to ask i'll ask a question of hadi ari uh what is the the greatest challenge we face coming out of kovid in terms of uh raising more awareness around computer science that's a great question i think our greatest challenge is the same challenge we've faced for the whole time this movement has been growing which is the challenge of perceptions about whether or not computer science is part of basic education most adults think of education as the school they went through and so when they think about computer science they don't think of adding it at the same level as math or english they think of adding it like as an after school activity or a maker lab or something for the special kids getting adults to think that this is as foundational as reading or writing or math or science and it belongs as a pillar of education that is by far the hardest challenge to change hearts and minds but we are lucky because of the pandemic that there is a new opportunity to rethink things people are more willing to rethink education just like you see people are willing to rethink the workplace that we have an opportunity because of the pandemic to actually break through in terms of this this perception great thank you hottie any other questions come on up come on up to the microphones and you can ask a question of our ceo here and please introduce yourself hey hottie my name is mark barnes i'm a computer science specialist with the state of arkansas i work with the arkansas school for the deaf and the arkansas school for the blind and visually impaired what kind of work is code.org doing right now to help students particularly students with blindness and visual impairment who may not be able to use like a blockbased coding environment or some of the other tools that are currently a big part of computer science education that's a really good question you know students with learning disabilities of any sorts are are a different group that is underrepresented in computer science and there's work that needs to be done when it comes to deaf students code.org has done a lot such as putting captions in all of our videos and a number of other activities like that when it comes to vision impaired students code.org's own courses aren't directly supportive enough but we've partnered with a group called access i think access cs out of university of washington working with a tool called quorum to make a a version of our cs principles course designed for visually impaired students and this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart so we haven't we haven't yet announced plans for doing things to to support visually impaired students but as we think of new ides and new ways to teach computer programming you know not only the block based coding is vision based if you look at the actual output of the programs it's usually drawing art or making apps or making websites and one of my personal interests is to see can we shift to you know using python or java to make music or to make chat bots you know voice chat like alexa these are also technological systems that you don't need your eyes to be able to interface with the computer to listen to music or to use voicebased uh computing and i think but those are going to be opportunities we tap into in the next decade thank you good afternoon definitely i'm height deficient sorry um good afternoon my name is fran bromley norwood i am the k12 computer science administrator for the clark county school district in nevada um and i my question for you is is that when you have the opportunity to go to the white house primarily to talk about cyber security as we're aware unfortunately the internet infrastructure globally specifically in our country in order to make sure that they're getting those opportunities that are the plugged version versus the unplugged version of what code.org offers whereas conversation discussed i know that there have been a lot of input and communication regarding making that happen i was just wondering whether or not you've had an opportunity to demonstrate that code.org would like to support that in order to make sure that students you know countrywide are able to access the amazing programming that's available for them so that those numbers get higher in terms of exposure to computer science well we have advocated for increased connectivity in schools throughout our existence we're lucky in the united states that there's billions of dollars a year being provided by the federal government for school internet connectivity although we're still not at 100 of schools the the picture of connectivity in schools in the us today is far better than eight years ago when code.org started and globally even it is improving but far far behind but i am hopeful that internet connectivity in schools as well as device availability for students those are things that are growing even with or without code.org my main goal is to make sure as we connect up schools and as we give devices to students let's also provide the education for them to not only learn how to use technology but how to create it or how to understand its societal impacts and i believe that's actually the harder challenge because there's lots and lots of people worrying about connecting schools and not enough worrying about computer science education but thank you so much thank you and pat i think we're all set yeah we have uh two more questions hottie okay um hi heidi i'm ann leflich i'm a professor at indiana university and i'm a code um csf facilitator for next tech and also copi for the esup grants um my question really comes in as we're talking about elementary and you're talking about all the different areas um where computer science is incorporating ethics and incorporating ai and data science and cyber security what do you see happening to your elementary curriculum and how is that going to be adapted to either include those things or do you see that as something that is going to be included up in the higher grades that's a great question so the code.org cs fundamentals elementary curriculum already includes aspects of digital literacy digital citizenship cyber security we recently added our ai for oceans module into that just to make sure those students learn about machine learning as part of cs fundamentals but the real effort that we need to do is the one that i mentioned earlier which is basically creating learning units for integrating computer science into math into english into art and into the other subjects taught in elementary schools because when you think about computer science in elementary schools code.org has and and scratch both have spread very broadly as kind of a special in education but they're not systemically included in most schools and one of the best ways to be systemically included in elementary education is to also be included as part of math and english and the other subjects that are effectively baked into elementary education and so as we think about shifting from sort of a teacherled effort to teach coding in k5 to making it more of a districtled effort part of our work is going to be about creating the curriculum lessons for integration into math integration into english integration into social studies etc and and that's the future of where our elementary curriculum is going thank you crystal franklin c.s for clea out of cleveland state university and of course esep uh you mentioned there are uh three states that currently require cs4 graduation do you foresee any danger and i'm going to use danger in the way you think of mandating that where there's resource poor districts and the option to opt out may create actually the reverse effect that's a great question and in fact you're to the the question she asked is is there any danger to mandating computer science for graduation there absolutely is and that is why i said code.org is still in a waitandsee mode of trying to understand how things go in the states that have done this and getting a better sense of what the conditions on the ground need to be to make it possible uh the dangers of mandating computer science for graduation without thinking about it the the most obvious danger is kids not graduating beca you know the other danger is at schools that don't have the capacity to teach computer science you know what do they do do they not graduate students or what are they cut or so on so but thinking about mandating it for students forces you to address all the other access and representation and funding issues and there's many states who are then looking at that and saying what what can they do about it there's a state that i where i've been talking to some of the leadership of a state where they're talking about first of all reducing some of the other graduation requirements so it doesn't raise the bar on students and about providing funding to every school to teach computer science and also offering an online sort of option for a school that doesn't have a cs teacher at least students can learn it online and certainly anthony owen who's here from arkansas can share if you talk to with him later what are the steps arkansas took getting to cs as a graduation requirement requires all the other work first to get to uh you know if the the the slide that cal showed about the cape framework it requires the capacity and the access and and the then finally this brings in the the participation and the experience for students thank you for the questions very important to keep it in mind howdy thank you so much for uh giving us a vision for the future of computer science just a couple notes per those questions you can visit code.org accessibility if you want to learn about our accessibility uh work including with deaf students and students who are visually impaired and as per the last question that crystal asked about states we actually have a session about that how to make computer science and graduation requirement the right way actually featuring arkansas the national governors association as well as south carolina if you're interested in that visit that session tomorrow right now we have regional networking and so in about 10 minutes you're going to be in these different rooms depending on whether you are in the midwest northeast south or west now you might be wondering well actually what what what is my state is it is it midwest or is it is it south well if you visit csedcon.com schedule you'll find a listing of the states per those different regions so those are those rooms those rooms you'll actually find right outside this door to the california ballroom and down the stairs and then around the corner those that's where all the regional networking rooms are as well as all of our sessions go ahead you are dismissed you
