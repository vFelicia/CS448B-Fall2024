00:12 - hi my name is kinjal Shaw and I'm a
00:15 - partner at watching Capital my name is
00:17 - olianka odannarin I am the founder of
00:20 - black women blockchain Council and I'm
00:22 - also a blockchain Enthusiast we were
00:24 - founded back in 2013 so one of the
00:27 - earliest to focus specifically on
00:29 - blockchain use cases and we invest
00:32 - across the entire industry the mission
00:35 - of black women blockchain council is to
00:37 - make sure that no one gets left behind
00:38 - in particular the black women we want to
00:41 - make sure that this technology is a
00:43 - field that they see themselves at I
00:45 - think of blockchain as a horizontal
00:47 - technology that can be applied to many
00:50 - different sectors what really drew me
00:52 - into blockchain is how interdisciplinary
00:54 - it is it pulls on threads from economics
00:56 - politics social sciences and even beyond
01:00 - that to philosophy I myself am an
01:02 - investor at blockchain Capital I spend
01:04 - most of my time better understanding the
01:07 - technology researching and doing
01:09 - diligence on a number of opportunities
01:11 - and then working with Founders to help
01:13 - build this industry together
01:15 - [Music]
01:16 - every week you read that bitcoin's price
01:19 - is going up or down
01:22 - some newfangled cryptocurrency
01:24 - skyrockets in value and a piece of
01:27 - digital art famously sells for 69
01:30 - million dollars
01:32 - but a few months later you read that
01:35 - everything is crashing and people are
01:37 - losing money
01:38 - and then it all goes back up again
01:40 - what's going on what does it even mean
01:42 - for things to have value on the
01:44 - blockchain
01:46 - blockchain as a technology allows us to
01:49 - make new forms of cryptocurrencies and
01:51 - new forms of ownership
01:53 - it does this by enabling decentralized
01:56 - record keeping
01:58 - but the technology itself doesn't assign
02:02 - prices or values people do that prices
02:05 - on a blockchain are determined by how
02:08 - much people are willing to pay using
02:10 - traditional forms of money how does this
02:13 - work
02:14 - well transactions are saved on a
02:17 - blockchain when somebody gives their
02:19 - currency to somebody else but what do
02:21 - they get in return well it could be
02:24 - anything really like buying a pizza
02:27 - using Bitcoin
02:30 - these days the most common transaction
02:32 - is to trade digital assets for each
02:35 - other or for traditional money on an
02:38 - exchange
02:39 - an exchange is a marketplace where
02:42 - anybody can buy or sell something
02:44 - the price at any given moment is not set
02:47 - by a central Authority but by what
02:49 - people are willing to pay
02:51 - but if lots of people want to buy these
02:54 - same assets we may see the price go up
02:57 - as an example consider the London Stock
03:00 - Exchange
03:01 - when this Marketplace emerge in a coffee
03:04 - house in the early 1700s people traded
03:07 - Stocks by shouting the price
03:09 - making a deal and then handing over cash
03:13 - cryptocurrencies and other tokens are
03:16 - bought and sold in the same way on
03:18 - Modern exchanges
03:20 - in both cases and in any free market
03:23 - there's no higher power deciding prices
03:27 - just a free-for-all based on the
03:29 - economic principle of supply and demand
03:32 - but why do the prices swing so much more
03:35 - for digital assets
03:38 - that depends on the asset and why people
03:40 - value it digital assets on a blockchain
03:43 - could have physical real world value
03:45 - today people are experimenting with
03:48 - selling concert tickets on the
03:50 - blockchain
03:51 - one day blockchain could be used to
03:55 - record government recognized ownership
03:57 - of a home with real walls and real roof
04:00 - the price of a home is determined by
04:03 - supply and demand in the real world
04:05 - independent of how its ownership is
04:07 - recorded
04:08 - the blockchain is just a digital setting
04:11 - in stone to record that ownership and
04:14 - doesn't impact the price other digital
04:17 - assets only have psychological value you
04:20 - value it because you believe somebody
04:22 - else will also value it like digital art
04:25 - where price is based on how much the
04:29 - buyer believes they'll get for reselling
04:31 - a given piece even traditional
04:34 - currencies don't have real world value
04:36 - unless others believe in them
04:39 - consider the US dollar
04:41 - the paper itself has no value
04:44 - dollars are only valuable if you believe
04:46 - you can use them for payment and that
04:49 - the person you pay believes the same
04:50 - thing
04:51 - with the traditional currency disbelief
04:54 - depends on a country's military or
04:57 - economic power if everybody believes a
05:00 - currency has value
05:02 - if they stop believing a currency stops
05:04 - having value this is why some
05:07 - traditional currencies can drop in value
05:09 - causing inflation
05:12 - many factors can lead to why people
05:14 - believe there is value in cryptocurrency
05:17 - things like media hype government
05:19 - regulations and businesses accepting
05:21 - digital currency can all cause people to
05:24 - believe or disbelieve the price of
05:27 - Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency on a
05:30 - blockchain ultimately measures how much
05:33 - people believe
05:35 - blockchain technology is touted by many
05:38 - for its potential and yet many
05:40 - blockchain projects have failed because
05:42 - of hacks and scams beliefs can fluctuate
05:46 - wildly which is why prices go up and
05:48 - down so much and so quickly if a lot
05:51 - more people believe digital assets could
05:54 - One Day become much more valuable if a
05:57 - lot fewer people believe these assets
06:00 - could become completely worthless and
06:03 - with so many different types of projects
06:05 - using blockchain technology it's hard to
06:07 - tell which will succeed and which are
06:11 - doomed to fail
06:15 - foreign
06:18 - [Music]
