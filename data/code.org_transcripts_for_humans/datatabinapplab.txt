00:05 - hi my name is ariana and i'm going to
00:07 - show you how to use the data tab in app
00:09 - lab when viewing an app lab project or
00:11 - an app lab level you might have noticed
00:13 - that there are three tabs the code tab
00:16 - the design tab and the data tab
00:18 - when you click on the data tab you'll be
00:20 - taken to a data library where you can
00:22 - see different categories of data sets
00:24 - that you can use in building your
00:26 - programs and apps
00:27 - you can click on a category to see the
00:29 - different data sets within that category
00:32 - click on a specific data set to see a
00:34 - little more information about that data
00:36 - set
00:37 - when you click on more info you'll be
00:38 - taken to a different page that tells you
00:40 - more about the source of the data any
00:43 - cleaning up of the data that may have
00:44 - happened and information about each
00:46 - column
00:48 - you can also click this preview button
00:50 - to see what columns are included as well
00:53 - as some of the data that's in your data
00:54 - set so you can see if you're interested
00:56 - in using it click the x at the top right
00:59 - to return to the data tab
01:03 - any of these data sets can be imported
01:05 - and used in any program or app that
01:06 - you're building
01:08 - before you can use a data set in your
01:09 - code you'll first need to import it
01:12 - let's say i wanted to import a data set
01:14 - in the geography category like this u.s
01:16 - states data set when i click on the name
01:19 - i have the option to import by clicking
01:21 - on this orange import button
01:23 - then i can click on the name on the
01:25 - right to preview
01:27 - now i can see all of the data in columns
01:30 - any of these columns in any of these
01:32 - data sets can turn into a list in your
01:34 - project's code if i wanted to i could
01:37 - make a separate list for every column
01:38 - here
01:39 - once i've imported i'm ready to use the
01:41 - data in my code
01:43 - i'll click back to data and then click
01:45 - over to the code tab the first thing
01:47 - i'll do is create a new variable that
01:49 - will hold a list
01:52 - i'll call it state names
01:56 - now to get the data from the data tab
01:58 - into this list i'll go over to the data
02:00 - drawer and pull out the get column
02:02 - command
02:06 - next i select the name of the table i've
02:08 - imported
02:10 - now i can pick which column i want to
02:12 - use
02:14 - i'm going to pick state names but you
02:16 - can choose any of these down here
02:19 - because get column returns a list
02:21 - meaning it gives you back a list you
02:23 - don't need to create a separate list
02:26 - notice there are no brackets here
02:29 - when i print out what's in this list
02:30 - you'll see that we have a full list in
02:32 - the console log
02:34 - notice the bracket and all 50 state
02:36 - names in this list
02:38 - once you have this list in your program
02:40 - you can use it just like any other list
02:42 - so you can traverse over it
02:44 - filter it or anything you might do with
02:46 - another list
02:48 - and this allows you to make really
02:49 - exciting powerful and interesting
02:51 - programs
