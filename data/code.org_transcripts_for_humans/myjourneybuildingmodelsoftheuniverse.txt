00:22 - hi everyone and thanks for joining us
00:24 - today my name is leoland bowen and i
00:27 - work on the education programs team here
00:29 - at code.org
00:30 - i have an awesome job because i get to
00:32 - talk to so many interesting people about
00:34 - the incredible work that they do
00:36 - today i get to talk to two scientists
00:39 - who are using computer science to
00:40 - explore the universe
00:42 - dr kimberly archand and dr ruth
00:45 - barnardas both work at the center for
00:47 - astrophysics at harvard and smithsonian
00:50 - dr arkhan also works on nasa's chandra
00:53 - x-ray observatory and dr das works on
00:56 - nasa's universe of learning and the
00:58 - chandra x-ray observatory as well hi
01:01 - kimarutha
01:02 - hi
01:04 - so our first question and it's a very
01:06 - serious one what's your favorite space
01:08 - focused movie or book ruta let's start
01:11 - with you
01:13 - uh
01:14 - very serious of course
01:16 - um
01:17 - i have recently completely fallen in
01:20 - love with marvel
01:22 - um
01:23 - you know
01:24 - guardians of the galaxy is wonderful uh
01:26 - particularly anything ever avengers
01:29 - related um that's a recent love um way
01:32 - back from my childhood i'd have to say
01:34 - the magic school with space-based
01:35 - episodes
01:36 - lost in space seized stars
01:41 - i love it um i love this question
01:44 - and i don't know i know i had more time
01:46 - than routine to think but um
01:48 - i i have to say
01:50 - contact i absolutely loved that movie
01:53 - because it came out when i was
01:55 - essentially deciding that i wanted to be
01:57 - a scientist and seeing the main
01:59 - character in that role
02:01 - was just
02:02 - really exciting for me i hadn't seen
02:04 - that many women scientists before that
02:06 - so yeah that movie was was super
02:09 - important
02:10 - ah thanks for sharing i love the magic
02:12 - school bus as well that's still one of
02:14 - my favorite shows
02:16 - thank you all for sharing that
02:17 - um okay so tell us about your work tell
02:20 - us about what you do and how does your
02:21 - work help your community kim you want to
02:23 - start
02:24 - sure i'm actually going to share some
02:26 - slides
02:28 - really quick here we go
02:31 - okay so hopefully everybody can see
02:34 - um i just thought it would be useful to
02:36 - talk a little bit about my path because
02:39 - i really
02:40 - i did not know what i wanted to be
02:43 - when i was young and i think that's
02:45 - totally normal i
02:47 - wanted to save the world i wanted to be
02:49 - a doctor i wanted to be an
02:51 - environmentalist i wanted to be a
02:53 - veterinarian i loved the idea of science
02:56 - but i also loved writing and i loved
03:00 - reading and i loved just hanging out in
03:03 - the woods so i didn't know what i would
03:05 - do but i went to school for biology
03:08 - essentially and spent a lot of time
03:10 - looking through a microscope
03:12 - before i realized that i did not want to
03:15 - do that for the rest of my life so i
03:17 - wandered down to my computer science
03:19 - department and they very kindly adopted
03:22 - me even though i was not in a computer
03:24 - science program in college and i think
03:26 - it was that connection of figuring out
03:29 - how to use computers
03:31 - to tell the story of science where i
03:34 - really found my true love and so i
03:36 - traded a telescope for some coding and
03:38 - then well traded a microscope for some
03:40 - coding and then telescope and that's
03:42 - what i get to do these days so
03:45 - um rutu and i we get to spend a lot of
03:47 - time looking at data from nasa's chandra
03:50 - x-ray observatory which is a school bus
03:54 - sized telescope that goes about a third
03:56 - of the way to the moon to essentially
03:58 - observe the high energy universe things
04:01 - like exploding stars things like
04:04 - black holes
04:06 - and things like colliding galaxies
04:11 - so that means that we have lots of
04:14 - really amazing information to be able to
04:16 - share with people such as all of you
04:19 - today and one of my very favorite things
04:21 - that i get to do is to take that
04:23 - information and turn it into something
04:26 - so turn it into an image for example or
04:28 - turn it into something like a 3d print
04:31 - so one of the ways that i like to think
04:33 - about how i give back to my community
04:36 - even though i
04:38 - don't
04:39 - kid myself that i'm saving the world
04:41 - these days i do like to spend a lot of
04:44 - time
04:44 - making sure other people have access to
04:47 - the universe like i do
04:49 - and that includes figuring out how to
04:51 - take such visual data things that we can
04:54 - see
04:55 - and turn it into something that we can
04:57 - also touch so by 3d printing these 3d
05:01 - models of things like exploded stars for
05:03 - example i try to make sure that it's not
05:06 - just people with sight that can enjoy
05:08 - this information of our universe
05:10 - but also people who are blind or low
05:12 - vision to make sure they have access as
05:14 - well so that's kind of what i get to do
05:18 - i'll stop sharing
05:23 - wow that those look beautiful it's like
05:25 - artwork
05:26 - make your artwork thank you for sharing
05:28 - that
05:30 - thank you yeah they're definitely i'm
05:31 - using them as artwork behind me
05:33 - so clearly they're they're very
05:35 - beautiful um and wonderful to hold
05:38 - uh so i will also share my screen
05:42 - and
05:56 - all right does that
05:59 - seem to work properly
06:01 - good to go cool okay
06:03 - so hi everyone i'm rudy das and
06:07 - well like kim i also did not think i
06:11 - would be doing exactly what i'm doing
06:13 - today um
06:15 - i
06:16 - well i always loved science and math and
06:18 - i always loved the skies but
06:20 - i also loved literature and writing and
06:23 - i
06:24 - wanted to be a poet wanted to be a
06:26 - writer and my dad was like maybe you
06:29 - should do something where you like
06:32 - you know have a guaranteed source of
06:34 - income and i was at that point i was
06:36 - like okay fine um and now i'm like well
06:39 - i can do both but anyway so i i i loved
06:43 - all the humanities um
06:46 - i continued doing physics because while
06:48 - i loved all the sciences i was too
06:50 - squeamish to um do bio i i can't dissect
06:54 - um i thought i loved chemistry and then
06:56 - found i didn't understand much of
06:58 - chemistry once i actually started
07:00 - learning it uh i was very confused about
07:02 - chemistry but i still like physics i
07:05 - loved the universe um
07:07 - and
07:09 - i through my life i continued doing both
07:12 - science and things like you know taking
07:14 - writing classes and philosophy classes
07:16 - and photography classes and things like
07:17 - that um
07:19 - then i went to grad school
07:20 - and did a lot of research and
07:24 - jumped right into astronomy and research
07:26 - and science and
07:28 - did not have a humanities component in
07:30 - my life
07:32 - and decided that i didn't like that very
07:34 - much
07:35 - so
07:36 - now i am back to both and i
07:41 - am an astrophysicist and science
07:43 - communicator and i use code to
07:46 - do both parts and i'm gonna
07:49 - show you something really quickly about
07:51 - what i do so
07:56 - so as i said i'm an astrophysicist as
07:58 - part of what i do um and people wonder
08:01 - what that is i i hope many of you have
08:03 - seen this sort of meme
08:05 - you know uh many people ask hey can you
08:08 - like read the stars and tell me what's
08:10 - gonna happen like no we can't we don't
08:12 - do astrology um
08:15 - we can look at the stars and tell you
08:17 - where they'll be the next day
08:19 - but
08:20 - not what they're
08:21 - not any sort of effect they would have
08:23 - on your life um my friends think i do a
08:25 - lot of math i do some math but like
08:29 - i i i like math i don't
08:31 - absolutely love math so i leave
08:34 - the most math to like the theorists um
08:37 - my mom well actually my mom sort of
08:40 - knows what i do very well which makes me
08:42 - very happy but most of my family thinks
08:44 - i'm doing i'm you know creating rockets
08:46 - working with nasa setting things into
08:48 - space
08:49 - i think i am just
08:51 - flying through space and everything is
08:54 - beautiful there are galaxies you know
08:56 - like all those pretty pictures you see
08:58 - in the marvel movies yeah um
09:01 - what i'm actually doing all day is
09:03 - writing lots and lots and lots of code
09:06 - because when we look up at the sky there
09:08 - is
09:09 - so much data there are so many different
09:11 - points that it's
09:13 - impossible
09:14 - to try to
09:16 - learn about all of that by hand if i try
09:18 - to
09:19 - like take notes about everything in
09:21 - space by hand um
09:24 - well i i i maybe like
09:27 - be able to do like a tiny patch of what
09:29 - i can see with my eyes like over my life
09:32 - but
09:33 - i i want to study the whole sky so for
09:36 - example
09:37 - i like to look at clusters of galaxies
09:40 - basically they're a bunch of galaxies
09:42 - that
09:43 - are orbiting each other they're flying
09:45 - around each other they are some of the
09:47 - biggest things in the universe
09:50 - in this picture everything you see
09:53 - almost every dot you see in this picture
09:56 - almost every dot is a galaxy
09:58 - um
09:59 - and i want to learn details about all of
10:02 - those galaxies not just the big ones in
10:04 - the middle but also the tiny tiny ones
10:07 - in the background
10:09 - so as you can see there are hundreds
10:10 - maybe thousands of little dots in this
10:13 - picture so yeah i'm not going to sit
10:15 - there and do that by hand i'm going to
10:17 - tell a computer
10:18 - how
10:19 - to look at this picture of the sky and
10:22 - tell me about what those little dots are
10:25 - doing
10:26 - and now it's not just like the thousands
10:28 - on this picture because then i work with
10:30 - like hundreds of different clusters of
10:32 - galaxies um and there are people who
10:35 - work with thousands of different
10:36 - clusters of galaxies so you can see like
10:39 - the numbers of little dots add up really
10:41 - really quickly and you know sometimes
10:44 - they're like gritting down at you
10:45 - mischievously going yeah i have lots of
10:48 - data how are you gonna how are you gonna
10:49 - process it how are you gonna like make
10:51 - any sense out of me um and i say well
10:54 - i'm gonna use code i'm gonna tell a
10:56 - computer how to take each of those
10:58 - little dots and make sense of it for me
11:01 - um
11:02 - one of the other things i can do is make
11:05 - a model of what our universe might be
11:07 - doing so
11:10 - for a long time many people thought that
11:11 - the universe was just
11:13 - gravity you know gravity is the thing
11:15 - like i throw this thing up it brings it
11:17 - down to me it's pulling everything in
11:20 - the universe to each other so
11:22 - if we put a lot of
11:24 - stuff in one place everything pulls
11:27 - everything else with gravity so
11:29 - somebody put a lot of stuff into a box
11:32 - and said what would happen if we just
11:34 - let gravity take over
11:36 - and we saw that all that stuff just
11:38 - bunched up
11:39 - and this is sort of how all the stuff in
11:41 - the universe bunched up into galaxies so
11:44 - all the little clumps you see there are
11:46 - actually galaxies and
11:49 - i get to tell a computer
11:51 - to show like i get to give a computer
11:53 - instructions on how to show us
11:55 - how the universe turned into galaxies
11:58 - or you know how stuff in the universe
11:59 - turn into galaxies so as i said i'm an
12:02 - astrophysicist
12:03 - and science communicator which means i
12:06 - also get to talk to all of you
12:08 - um
12:09 - and i spend my days and sometimes nights
12:12 - looking at the sky and the stars writing
12:15 - code but also creating things for museum
12:17 - displays and writing stories about how
12:20 - we learned about space and creating fun
12:22 - activities and as i said talking to all
12:25 - of you and i use coding for that as well
12:28 - um and
12:30 - i'll talk a little bit more later about
12:32 - some of the things i do with that
12:35 - thank you both so much jess i'm amazed
12:38 - just from your introductory question
12:40 - answers i can
12:42 - only wish we had i had more time to talk
12:44 - to you all all day to listen to the
12:46 - amazing work that you all are doing
12:48 - um we have our first audience question
12:50 - and everyone watching if you have
12:52 - questions please feel free to leave them
12:54 - in the chat this question comes from mrs
12:56 - bilka's class i hope i'm pronouncing
12:58 - that correctly um how do you decide what
13:01 - colors to use to make those models that
13:03 - you all both showed us
13:05 - oh that is a great question and
13:08 - we essentially tell these stories by
13:12 - using that science information so when
13:15 - we get the scientific data from our
13:18 - telescope scientists will process it and
13:20 - analyze it to figure out what's
13:22 - happening all of that sciencey goodness
13:25 - that's inside those ones and zeros that
13:27 - binary code that arrives in our suitcase
13:29 - if you will the digital suitcase when we
13:31 - first get the information and all of the
13:33 - unpackaging of that information and
13:35 - analysis figuring out what's happening
13:38 - then drives that scientific story so we
13:41 - take that scientific story and we figure
13:43 - out how best to then portray that
13:46 - information because all of this
13:47 - information i'm talking about like the
13:49 - image behind me for example this is
13:51 - mostly invisible to human eyes right so
13:54 - we have to translate it from one form
13:56 - into another so we pick a color and we
13:58 - pick other kinds of processes as well
14:00 - based on that science story and for
14:03 - x-ray images it often turns out that the
14:05 - best way to show that x-ray data is in
14:08 - like blues and purples and pinks i'm not
14:12 - exactly sure why but for some reason
14:14 - that seems to be the color palette if
14:16 - you will that best suits that data
14:19 - because we often package that
14:20 - information with other kinds of light
14:23 - with the visible light that we can see
14:24 - with human eyes for example or with
14:27 - ultraviolet light or
14:29 - infrared light and so having different
14:31 - kinds of color codings it's just like
14:32 - having a weather map right on your phone
14:35 - or on the nightly news and on the
14:37 - weather map they might have your region
14:39 - color coded by say temperature or by
14:42 - wind speeds and so we'll do the same
14:44 - thing we'll color code our data by say
14:48 - the uh energetic material or by the
14:50 - chemical composition all those little
14:52 - bits and pieces that make up that stuff
14:55 - and so it's all about getting the best
14:57 - map that tells the best parts of those
15:00 - stories to be able to share them with
15:02 - everybody so yeah these images they're
15:05 - they're not space selfies they are a
15:07 - translation of scientific information
15:09 - from a form that we can't naturally see
15:12 - with human eyes into something that we
15:14 - can either see
15:15 - or
15:16 - touch or perhaps even hear
15:22 - i love that space selfies i i definitely
15:24 - heard that friends
15:28 - i know i think kim covered that very
15:31 - completely
15:33 - perfect maybe two completely sorry
15:37 - but you just pick ones that look nice
15:39 - yeah i'm very passionate about that
15:40 - topic
15:42 - i love it okay so our next question is a
15:44 - two-parter and the second part of that
15:45 - question comes from an audience question
15:48 - so if some of the kids watching wanted
15:50 - to do what you all do when they grow up
15:52 - what are some skills or abilities that
15:54 - they can start working on now and the
15:56 - second part of that question is what
15:57 - were the biggest obstacles that you all
15:59 - had to deal with in pursuit of your
16:01 - current careers
16:05 - ruth you want to start uh yeah sure um
16:09 - well
16:10 - if you want to do
16:13 - astrophysics um
16:15 - or any type of science really i would
16:17 - say first of all just keep exploring
16:20 - things you're interested in um you never
16:22 - know what will spark out to you um
16:26 - math is important but like i said it's
16:29 - not the end-all be-all
16:31 - um would be good to
16:33 - you know
16:35 - like learn in your math classes in your
16:37 - science classes um
16:39 - if you want to learn how to code um even
16:42 - a little bit that will carry through
16:44 - very well
16:45 - um towards the end um and it's never too
16:48 - late like i actually learned to code
16:50 - pretty late in life um but it's never
16:52 - too late um if you get a head start
16:54 - that's wonderful
16:55 - um
16:57 - and what other well and if you want to
16:59 - communicate science like both kim and i
17:02 - do well
17:03 - then you will need to uh
17:06 - work on your communication skills a bit
17:07 - um you know
17:09 - don't don't feel like you need to focus
17:11 - on any one thing
17:14 - to the exception of all others you know
17:16 - you
17:17 - you can do all the things you're
17:18 - interested in
17:20 - and
17:21 - you know if you want to do space uh if
17:23 - you want to do something with space when
17:24 - you grow up then
17:26 - you know learn about space learn about
17:27 - all the different things there are
17:29 - to learn about in space you know not
17:31 - that learning about all the things
17:33 - that's possible but
17:34 - you know go to museums read books
17:37 - just
17:38 - i think keep learning and then
17:41 - be willing to learn new things and
17:44 - that's the most important thing um
17:46 - there was a second part to this question
17:48 - yeah the second part is what were the
17:51 - biggest obstacles that you had in the
17:52 - pursuit of your current career um
17:56 - biggest obstacles i think
18:02 - uh definitely um
18:03 - [Music]
18:05 - so i i was that student in school who
18:07 - like had her hand up all the time and um
18:10 - you know answered every question and
18:12 - wanted to get like 102 on every exam and
18:16 - i did that for the most part but then i
18:18 - got to college and stuff was a whole lot
18:20 - harder and i started getting like
18:24 - really bad grades in my classes and
18:27 - one of the hardest things for me
18:29 - to realize was
18:32 - how to
18:34 - limit myself and how much i do like i
18:36 - want to do everything but that doesn't
18:38 - mean i should be doing everything all
18:40 - the time
18:42 - um
18:43 - and if you actually space yourselves out
18:46 - a little bit you will get the chance to
18:48 - do everything just you know maybe
18:50 - three or four different things at a time
18:53 - so yeah
18:55 - thank you kim
18:57 - yeah i love her two's answers and i
18:59 - would just say for me i i definitely
19:01 - recommend coding for my career
19:04 - coding really was a key that unlocked
19:06 - the universe because
19:08 - there are so many different things that
19:10 - we do with coding to help take care of
19:12 - the gender spacecraft and then also to
19:15 - analyze the data and then to produce
19:17 - some sort of science output if you will
19:20 - and i learned coding in college there
19:22 - wasn't really a heavy computer science
19:25 - class when i was in high school and i
19:26 - really wasn't even aware of it if there
19:28 - had been
19:30 - so i learned coding because i had a work
19:32 - study program to help me fund my
19:35 - college program essentially and my
19:37 - professor that i was working for
19:38 - economics wanted a web page so i learned
19:41 - html and that simple act of creating my
19:45 - first web page and it was like horribly
19:47 - ugly and tacky
19:49 - i loved it i loved being able to create
19:51 - something like that and so i just took
19:54 - that a step further and learned like a
19:55 - little bit more coding learned the
19:57 - scripting language and then went into
19:59 - object oriented program and it was for
20:01 - me that idea that i could learn and keep
20:03 - going and keep progressing um but like
20:06 - rutu said it's also hard to just pick
20:08 - one thing because when i'm like working
20:10 - with people in a team when i'm looking
20:11 - to bring someone new into a team i'm
20:13 - always looking for people that come from
20:15 - very different backgrounds that bring
20:17 - lots of different skill sets to the
20:19 - table um people who speak different
20:21 - languages people who are curious people
20:23 - who are creative
20:25 - artists and former journalists and
20:28 - programmers yes but people maybe that
20:30 - were programmers after they did
20:31 - something else who knows right like i've
20:33 - always really appreciated working with a
20:35 - group of people that are very um
20:38 - different in their perspectives that
20:39 - they bring and so i would say for me my
20:42 - obstacles have been varied but i would
20:44 - say um similar to route 2 once i was in
20:46 - college i definitely struggled a bit
20:48 - with some of my classes and i remember
20:50 - being horrified that i failed a class
20:53 - because i was paying for my college
20:54 - right and so when i failed a class
20:56 - genetics i'll never forget it
20:59 - i was mortified that all that money down
21:01 - the drain that time i was embarrassed
21:04 - but i hadn't gone to my professor for
21:05 - help i thought i could do it all on my
21:07 - own i was being very stubborn and also i
21:10 - was really shy i still am kind of shy
21:12 - and people don't know that about me and
21:14 - it was hard to reach out for help so one
21:16 - of the lessons i learned early on is
21:18 - that that's nonsense you should always
21:20 - feel comfortable reaching out for help
21:22 - definitely do not be embarrassed and
21:25 - it's okay to fail i can honestly say
21:28 - that that failure taught me so much more
21:31 - than like five classes that i aced right
21:34 - so for me being able to fail really was
21:37 - a helpful part of my journey that kind
21:40 - of steered me in a different direction
21:42 - and then here i am today doing something
21:44 - that i love
21:46 - you both talked about um struggling when
21:49 - you got to college and um maybe not
21:52 - getting good grades maybe failing a
21:53 - class which actually leads to our next
21:55 - audience question
21:57 - um that comes from gia leah i'm saying
22:00 - that correctly from the second grade
22:02 - and they want to know if you make a big
22:05 - mistake and you're in what your work is
22:07 - now how do you fix it
22:12 - you thought you want to start uh sure
22:14 - yeah
22:15 - so
22:18 - if you make a big well
22:20 - here's the thing first of all
22:21 - there will be times when you make big
22:23 - mistakes everybody does as kim said you
22:26 - know failing is okay because everyone
22:28 - does it you would be really weird if you
22:30 - did not fail at something at some point
22:34 - and
22:37 - the way to fix it is you know first of
22:39 - all you have to realize that something
22:40 - is wrong you might figure that out
22:42 - yourself somebody else might tell you
22:45 - and then just you know have an open mind
22:47 - like okay it's wrong you know no need to
22:49 - be
22:50 - defensive
22:51 - no need to like be like no no no i can't
22:53 - make a mistake because then you can't
22:54 - fix your mistakes if you don't like
22:56 - accept that you've made them
22:58 - and then just go back and see
23:00 - what was wrong um
23:02 - for example if it's like a huge mistake
23:05 - with some code you go through it line by
23:07 - line and go does it work up to this
23:09 - point yes does it work up to the next
23:11 - point yes
23:13 - you have to systematically go through
23:15 - and just figure out how to fix it and
23:16 - then everybody will be like yeah you
23:18 - fixed it and everybody will forget that
23:19 - you like didn't grab it right the first
23:21 - time
23:22 - um
23:24 - so yeah just you know be willing to say
23:27 - that oops i did that wrong but i'm gonna
23:30 - go fix it now
23:33 - yeah 100 and i just my cat is trying to
23:36 - make an appearance so if you see
23:37 - midnight everybody can say hi
23:39 - always always when i sit in the share to
23:40 - talk he appears anyways um yeah i think
23:43 - it's really important to just keep
23:45 - things in perspective because i have
23:47 - always struggled with failing like i
23:50 - mentioned when i failed that class it
23:52 - was like horrifying to me not only
23:55 - because of the money but i was just
23:56 - really embarrassed and just felt so down
24:00 - and i think what i've tried to learn
24:02 - since then and i'm not saying i'm
24:03 - totally successful but what i've tried
24:05 - to learn is that
24:08 - you have to keep things in perspective
24:10 - right um i was not in an operating room
24:12 - right when i failed that class like i
24:15 - was some doing something that i was
24:16 - trying to learn and for me failure since
24:18 - then even one failure is really hard and
24:20 - i feel like i've done something really
24:22 - bad or just done a really poor job i
24:25 - just try to keep that perspective of you
24:27 - know where is this in the grand scheme
24:30 - of people's lives right and that usually
24:33 - gives me some measure of comfort and
24:35 - then sorry from there
24:36 - it's all about and my cat agrees um and
24:39 - then from there it's all about like
24:40 - roots you said owning up to it
24:43 - for me as quickly as possible and then
24:45 - fixing it because truly i'm not just
24:47 - saying it but i l i have absolutely
24:50 - learned the best when i have failed at
24:52 - something because that's a lesson you'll
24:54 - never forget and then when you can
24:56 - successfully fix something that you've
24:58 - done poorly at
25:00 - the relief and that feeling of happiness
25:03 - is very strong again as my cat agrees
25:07 - sorry
25:08 - good night
25:10 - it's very frisky this morning i don't
25:12 - know what to do about him anyways
25:15 - add one quick thing that i forgot to say
25:18 - um but uh can talking remind me yeah
25:20 - first of all yes it's really hard to
25:23 - accept
25:24 - that you failed at something um
25:26 - my initial reaction was always to just
25:29 - panic
25:30 - and especially in grad school i used to
25:32 - go into like this
25:34 - oh my god nothing's gonna work now oh my
25:37 - my thesis is a lie um and then you have
25:39 - to like remember to breathe
25:43 - and also there's a balance you know
25:45 - accept that you have made mistakes but
25:47 - have confidence in yourself have
25:49 - confidence that your past self probably
25:52 - knew what they were doing to some extent
25:55 - because several times when i thought i
25:57 - had failed once i actually calmed down
25:59 - and went back and looked at my code and
26:01 - looked or looked at other things like
26:04 - i actually did that properly and the
26:07 - current me has forgotten why i did that
26:09 - thing so it is a balance
26:11 - be willing to accept that you have
26:12 - failed be willing to fix it but also
26:14 - don't panic because
26:16 - your past self also knew what they were
26:18 - doing
26:20 - exactly um i just wanted to note we have
26:23 - received so many
26:25 - amazing questions that we plan to if you
26:27 - all have time go over no more than five
26:29 - minutes does that work for you both oh
26:31 - yeah right right into the next great
26:33 - question great perfect because you all
26:34 - have some slides for this next question
26:36 - that i i want to make sure everyone
26:38 - share so kim we'll start with you what's
26:40 - a cool project you're working on right
26:41 - now or have finished recently
26:44 - yes definitely let me um share so i
26:46 - think i was talking about how
26:48 - um i'm very interested in oh you know
26:50 - what did i
26:52 - not sure i selected sound i think i did
26:54 - we'll find out um i
26:57 - spent well over 10 years of my career
26:59 - focusing on visuals creating something
27:02 - that people can see
27:03 - and it really bothered me that i had
27:05 - left out a segment of the population
27:07 - that could not process that data in the
27:09 - way that i had made it and especially
27:11 - someone who's paid by the government
27:13 - where everything i do should be public
27:15 - domain and accessible like i really felt
27:17 - a moral and ethical obligation to be
27:19 - able to make sure that what i had was
27:22 - shareable to more people
27:23 - so during um the pandemic we actually
27:26 - started a project with some colleagues
27:28 - um matt rousseau and andre santiglita
27:30 - specifically to be able to take the
27:32 - information that we had created visuals
27:34 - for and translate it into sound
27:36 - and i'm just going to play a little
27:38 - snippet here
27:40 - hopefully you can hear if i could get a
27:41 - thumbs up
27:43 - [Music]
28:01 - so that's taking that same information
28:03 - of an exploded star i showed earlier as
28:05 - a two-dimensional image and as a
28:07 - three-dimensional model and then taking
28:09 - that information and translating it into
28:11 - sound so these are not space sounds that
28:13 - you would hear if you were in outer
28:14 - space because we can't do that we can't
28:16 - hear an outer space there's no real
28:17 - medium for information to travel to our
28:19 - eardrums but here on the ground we can
28:21 - take information that could be say
28:23 - visual in one form and translate it into
28:27 - another form where we can hear and this
28:29 - is such a fun project to work on we've
28:31 - done about
28:32 - 12 different of these pieces of data
28:35 - sonification they're called or you know
28:37 - space soundscapes i suppose and the
28:39 - response has been just
28:42 - magical i've been so pleased we've
28:44 - worked with um people who are blind or
28:46 - low vision to be able to make sure that
28:48 - we can understand and really make some
28:50 - beautiful meanings out of this
28:52 - information and then just yeah we shared
28:55 - them with the world and it became very
28:58 - very popular and it was just so
28:59 - gratifying to know that something that i
29:02 - had created for a small tight-knit
29:04 - community ended up being useful not only
29:07 - for them but for people around the world
29:09 - and that was a really exciting finding
29:12 - that if you try to make something better
29:14 - for one group you could help make it
29:16 - better for all the groups or at least
29:18 - more groups so yep that's one of the
29:20 - projects that we've been working on
29:22 - lately
29:25 - thank you rutha
29:27 - uh yes i will also share
29:30 - my screen
29:34 - okay so hopefully you're seeing this
29:37 - weird looking graph
29:39 - uh yeah okay cool
29:42 - so um
29:44 - as kim said we
29:46 - sh so she has done a lot of stuff in
29:48 - trying to bring the universe to
29:50 - everybody
29:51 - and i like to delve a little deeper into
29:54 - bringing very specific aspects of the
29:57 - universe to people of the universe to
29:59 - people who you know don't usually study
30:01 - it so i want everybody to be able to
30:05 - fall in love with the universe and
30:07 - understand it um
30:09 - maybe not to the depth that people who
30:11 - work in uh astro do because that that
30:13 - takes a while but
30:15 - in enough depth to be able to appreciate
30:17 - it and see how cool space is and how
30:20 - cool just the world and cosmos around us
30:23 - is so
30:25 - what we have here is actually um
30:30 - it's light that has sort of been taken
30:33 - apart if you will um so when you throw
30:37 - sunlight through a prism you get a
30:40 - rainbow of colors right that's how
30:41 - rainbows form you know sunlight goes
30:43 - through rainwater and
30:45 - like water in the atmosphere and
30:48 - forms this like array of colors
30:51 - and it turns out that if we look at
30:53 - stuff in space and we separate out its
30:56 - light like that we can tell
30:59 - what things in space are made up of
31:02 - so
31:03 - what i wanted to do was show people how
31:07 - we learned about that so what you're
31:09 - seeing here is
31:10 - this is called the
31:12 - e0102 supernova remnant it's called that
31:15 - because
31:16 - there are so many things in space that
31:18 - we can't name all of them with cool
31:19 - names um
31:21 - so
31:22 - it's a star exploded and this is what
31:25 - was left over and we want to know what's
31:28 - up there
31:29 - um and to do that we take the light from
31:31 - the star and we separate it out again
31:34 - this is a computer doing this there is
31:36 - way too much light for me to separate it
31:38 - out on my own
31:39 - so i i tell a computer hey tell me how
31:42 - much red light there is tell me how much
31:44 - green and blue etc
31:46 - and depending on what light is most
31:49 - bright basically when something is
31:51 - higher it's brighter
31:52 - so given that this is a little higher
31:55 - over here in the red it's saying that
31:56 - and this is a little higher at this
31:58 - point in green it's like oh this is
32:00 - showing us that there's oxygen up there
32:03 - somewhere and neon basically
32:06 - this particular band of red and this
32:09 - particular band of green
32:11 - are very specific
32:13 - to those materials to those elements
32:16 - and
32:16 - this is how much light came in when we
32:19 - looked at this thing for about two hours
32:22 - but
32:24 - we want more details so we keep looking
32:27 - at it for longer and longer
32:30 - and
32:31 - you see a little easily these little
32:33 - tiny bumps and the computer just tells
32:36 - us hey there's more of this kind of blue
32:38 - light tiny little bump and that tells us
32:41 - there is silicon up there silicon is the
32:43 - stuff that makes up sand
32:46 - um silicon and oxygen makeup scent and
32:48 - that's up there where a star exploded um
32:51 - there is sulfur neon is the stuff you
32:53 - see in like
32:54 - light signs like signs in front of
32:56 - stores that's up there in the stars
33:00 - and
33:00 - we can use this to see that like
33:03 - a lot of the things
33:04 - that like basically everything you see
33:06 - around us even our own bodies
33:09 - came from stuff that's in stars
33:13 - we actually use this to figure out that
33:16 - our bodies are made up of the same exact
33:18 - things that are up there in stars so
33:21 - i thought that was really cool
33:23 - and um i like being able to show that we
33:25 - can spread out the light like this
33:29 - yeah i'm trying to think of a a
33:30 - different word to describe that but all
33:33 - i can come up with is that's really cool
33:36 - thank you for sharing both of your
33:39 - projects and unfortunately we are out of
33:41 - time um
33:43 - thank you all for joining us today we
33:44 - have so many uh we wish we could have
33:47 - got to all the audience questions and
33:49 - hopefully we can figure out a way to get
33:50 - those questions answered answered for
33:52 - everyone who are watching it was so
33:55 - great to hear about cameron ruth's
33:56 - experiences teachers please fill out the
33:59 - survey that you're receiving your email
34:00 - tomorrow and be sure to check out the
34:02 - other class chats and the virtual field
34:05 - trips including a field trip from nasa's
34:07 - chandra x-ray observatory at code.org
34:11 - cs journeys they're happening all
34:13 - semester long thanks everyone thanks kim
34:16 - rudu thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone and thanks for joining us today my name is leoland bowen and i work on the education programs team here at code.org i have an awesome job because i get to talk to so many interesting people about the incredible work that they do today i get to talk to two scientists who are using computer science to explore the universe dr kimberly archand and dr ruth barnardas both work at the center for astrophysics at harvard and smithsonian dr arkhan also works on nasa's chandra xray observatory and dr das works on nasa's universe of learning and the chandra xray observatory as well hi kimarutha hi so our first question and it's a very serious one what's your favorite space focused movie or book ruta let's start with you uh very serious of course um i have recently completely fallen in love with marvel um you know guardians of the galaxy is wonderful uh particularly anything ever avengers related um that's a recent love um way back from my childhood i'd have to say the magic school with spacebased episodes lost in space seized stars i love it um i love this question and i don't know i know i had more time than routine to think but um i i have to say contact i absolutely loved that movie because it came out when i was essentially deciding that i wanted to be a scientist and seeing the main character in that role was just really exciting for me i hadn't seen that many women scientists before that so yeah that movie was was super important ah thanks for sharing i love the magic school bus as well that's still one of my favorite shows thank you all for sharing that um okay so tell us about your work tell us about what you do and how does your work help your community kim you want to start sure i'm actually going to share some slides really quick here we go okay so hopefully everybody can see um i just thought it would be useful to talk a little bit about my path because i really i did not know what i wanted to be when i was young and i think that's totally normal i wanted to save the world i wanted to be a doctor i wanted to be an environmentalist i wanted to be a veterinarian i loved the idea of science but i also loved writing and i loved reading and i loved just hanging out in the woods so i didn't know what i would do but i went to school for biology essentially and spent a lot of time looking through a microscope before i realized that i did not want to do that for the rest of my life so i wandered down to my computer science department and they very kindly adopted me even though i was not in a computer science program in college and i think it was that connection of figuring out how to use computers to tell the story of science where i really found my true love and so i traded a telescope for some coding and then well traded a microscope for some coding and then telescope and that's what i get to do these days so um rutu and i we get to spend a lot of time looking at data from nasa's chandra xray observatory which is a school bus sized telescope that goes about a third of the way to the moon to essentially observe the high energy universe things like exploding stars things like black holes and things like colliding galaxies so that means that we have lots of really amazing information to be able to share with people such as all of you today and one of my very favorite things that i get to do is to take that information and turn it into something so turn it into an image for example or turn it into something like a 3d print so one of the ways that i like to think about how i give back to my community even though i don't kid myself that i'm saving the world these days i do like to spend a lot of time making sure other people have access to the universe like i do and that includes figuring out how to take such visual data things that we can see and turn it into something that we can also touch so by 3d printing these 3d models of things like exploded stars for example i try to make sure that it's not just people with sight that can enjoy this information of our universe but also people who are blind or low vision to make sure they have access as well so that's kind of what i get to do i'll stop sharing wow that those look beautiful it's like artwork make your artwork thank you for sharing that thank you yeah they're definitely i'm using them as artwork behind me so clearly they're they're very beautiful um and wonderful to hold uh so i will also share my screen and all right does that seem to work properly good to go cool okay so hi everyone i'm rudy das and well like kim i also did not think i would be doing exactly what i'm doing today um i well i always loved science and math and i always loved the skies but i also loved literature and writing and i wanted to be a poet wanted to be a writer and my dad was like maybe you should do something where you like you know have a guaranteed source of income and i was at that point i was like okay fine um and now i'm like well i can do both but anyway so i i i loved all the humanities um i continued doing physics because while i loved all the sciences i was too squeamish to um do bio i i can't dissect um i thought i loved chemistry and then found i didn't understand much of chemistry once i actually started learning it uh i was very confused about chemistry but i still like physics i loved the universe um and i through my life i continued doing both science and things like you know taking writing classes and philosophy classes and photography classes and things like that um then i went to grad school and did a lot of research and jumped right into astronomy and research and science and did not have a humanities component in my life and decided that i didn't like that very much so now i am back to both and i am an astrophysicist and science communicator and i use code to do both parts and i'm gonna show you something really quickly about what i do so so as i said i'm an astrophysicist as part of what i do um and people wonder what that is i i hope many of you have seen this sort of meme you know uh many people ask hey can you like read the stars and tell me what's gonna happen like no we can't we don't do astrology um we can look at the stars and tell you where they'll be the next day but not what they're not any sort of effect they would have on your life um my friends think i do a lot of math i do some math but like i i i like math i don't absolutely love math so i leave the most math to like the theorists um my mom well actually my mom sort of knows what i do very well which makes me very happy but most of my family thinks i'm doing i'm you know creating rockets working with nasa setting things into space i think i am just flying through space and everything is beautiful there are galaxies you know like all those pretty pictures you see in the marvel movies yeah um what i'm actually doing all day is writing lots and lots and lots of code because when we look up at the sky there is so much data there are so many different points that it's impossible to try to learn about all of that by hand if i try to like take notes about everything in space by hand um well i i i maybe like be able to do like a tiny patch of what i can see with my eyes like over my life but i i want to study the whole sky so for example i like to look at clusters of galaxies basically they're a bunch of galaxies that are orbiting each other they're flying around each other they are some of the biggest things in the universe in this picture everything you see almost every dot you see in this picture almost every dot is a galaxy um and i want to learn details about all of those galaxies not just the big ones in the middle but also the tiny tiny ones in the background so as you can see there are hundreds maybe thousands of little dots in this picture so yeah i'm not going to sit there and do that by hand i'm going to tell a computer how to look at this picture of the sky and tell me about what those little dots are doing and now it's not just like the thousands on this picture because then i work with like hundreds of different clusters of galaxies um and there are people who work with thousands of different clusters of galaxies so you can see like the numbers of little dots add up really really quickly and you know sometimes they're like gritting down at you mischievously going yeah i have lots of data how are you gonna how are you gonna process it how are you gonna like make any sense out of me um and i say well i'm gonna use code i'm gonna tell a computer how to take each of those little dots and make sense of it for me um one of the other things i can do is make a model of what our universe might be doing so for a long time many people thought that the universe was just gravity you know gravity is the thing like i throw this thing up it brings it down to me it's pulling everything in the universe to each other so if we put a lot of stuff in one place everything pulls everything else with gravity so somebody put a lot of stuff into a box and said what would happen if we just let gravity take over and we saw that all that stuff just bunched up and this is sort of how all the stuff in the universe bunched up into galaxies so all the little clumps you see there are actually galaxies and i get to tell a computer to show like i get to give a computer instructions on how to show us how the universe turned into galaxies or you know how stuff in the universe turn into galaxies so as i said i'm an astrophysicist and science communicator which means i also get to talk to all of you um and i spend my days and sometimes nights looking at the sky and the stars writing code but also creating things for museum displays and writing stories about how we learned about space and creating fun activities and as i said talking to all of you and i use coding for that as well um and i'll talk a little bit more later about some of the things i do with that thank you both so much jess i'm amazed just from your introductory question answers i can only wish we had i had more time to talk to you all all day to listen to the amazing work that you all are doing um we have our first audience question and everyone watching if you have questions please feel free to leave them in the chat this question comes from mrs bilka's class i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly um how do you decide what colors to use to make those models that you all both showed us oh that is a great question and we essentially tell these stories by using that science information so when we get the scientific data from our telescope scientists will process it and analyze it to figure out what's happening all of that sciencey goodness that's inside those ones and zeros that binary code that arrives in our suitcase if you will the digital suitcase when we first get the information and all of the unpackaging of that information and analysis figuring out what's happening then drives that scientific story so we take that scientific story and we figure out how best to then portray that information because all of this information i'm talking about like the image behind me for example this is mostly invisible to human eyes right so we have to translate it from one form into another so we pick a color and we pick other kinds of processes as well based on that science story and for xray images it often turns out that the best way to show that xray data is in like blues and purples and pinks i'm not exactly sure why but for some reason that seems to be the color palette if you will that best suits that data because we often package that information with other kinds of light with the visible light that we can see with human eyes for example or with ultraviolet light or infrared light and so having different kinds of color codings it's just like having a weather map right on your phone or on the nightly news and on the weather map they might have your region color coded by say temperature or by wind speeds and so we'll do the same thing we'll color code our data by say the uh energetic material or by the chemical composition all those little bits and pieces that make up that stuff and so it's all about getting the best map that tells the best parts of those stories to be able to share them with everybody so yeah these images they're they're not space selfies they are a translation of scientific information from a form that we can't naturally see with human eyes into something that we can either see or touch or perhaps even hear i love that space selfies i i definitely heard that friends i know i think kim covered that very completely perfect maybe two completely sorry but you just pick ones that look nice yeah i'm very passionate about that topic i love it okay so our next question is a twoparter and the second part of that question comes from an audience question so if some of the kids watching wanted to do what you all do when they grow up what are some skills or abilities that they can start working on now and the second part of that question is what were the biggest obstacles that you all had to deal with in pursuit of your current careers ruth you want to start uh yeah sure um well if you want to do astrophysics um or any type of science really i would say first of all just keep exploring things you're interested in um you never know what will spark out to you um math is important but like i said it's not the endall beall um would be good to you know like learn in your math classes in your science classes um if you want to learn how to code um even a little bit that will carry through very well um towards the end um and it's never too late like i actually learned to code pretty late in life um but it's never too late um if you get a head start that's wonderful um and what other well and if you want to communicate science like both kim and i do well then you will need to uh work on your communication skills a bit um you know don't don't feel like you need to focus on any one thing to the exception of all others you know you you can do all the things you're interested in and you know if you want to do space uh if you want to do something with space when you grow up then you know learn about space learn about all the different things there are to learn about in space you know not that learning about all the things that's possible but you know go to museums read books just i think keep learning and then be willing to learn new things and that's the most important thing um there was a second part to this question yeah the second part is what were the biggest obstacles that you had in the pursuit of your current career um biggest obstacles i think uh definitely um so i i was that student in school who like had her hand up all the time and um you know answered every question and wanted to get like 102 on every exam and i did that for the most part but then i got to college and stuff was a whole lot harder and i started getting like really bad grades in my classes and one of the hardest things for me to realize was how to limit myself and how much i do like i want to do everything but that doesn't mean i should be doing everything all the time um and if you actually space yourselves out a little bit you will get the chance to do everything just you know maybe three or four different things at a time so yeah thank you kim yeah i love her two's answers and i would just say for me i i definitely recommend coding for my career coding really was a key that unlocked the universe because there are so many different things that we do with coding to help take care of the gender spacecraft and then also to analyze the data and then to produce some sort of science output if you will and i learned coding in college there wasn't really a heavy computer science class when i was in high school and i really wasn't even aware of it if there had been so i learned coding because i had a work study program to help me fund my college program essentially and my professor that i was working for economics wanted a web page so i learned html and that simple act of creating my first web page and it was like horribly ugly and tacky i loved it i loved being able to create something like that and so i just took that a step further and learned like a little bit more coding learned the scripting language and then went into object oriented program and it was for me that idea that i could learn and keep going and keep progressing um but like rutu said it's also hard to just pick one thing because when i'm like working with people in a team when i'm looking to bring someone new into a team i'm always looking for people that come from very different backgrounds that bring lots of different skill sets to the table um people who speak different languages people who are curious people who are creative artists and former journalists and programmers yes but people maybe that were programmers after they did something else who knows right like i've always really appreciated working with a group of people that are very um different in their perspectives that they bring and so i would say for me my obstacles have been varied but i would say um similar to route 2 once i was in college i definitely struggled a bit with some of my classes and i remember being horrified that i failed a class because i was paying for my college right and so when i failed a class genetics i'll never forget it i was mortified that all that money down the drain that time i was embarrassed but i hadn't gone to my professor for help i thought i could do it all on my own i was being very stubborn and also i was really shy i still am kind of shy and people don't know that about me and it was hard to reach out for help so one of the lessons i learned early on is that that's nonsense you should always feel comfortable reaching out for help definitely do not be embarrassed and it's okay to fail i can honestly say that that failure taught me so much more than like five classes that i aced right so for me being able to fail really was a helpful part of my journey that kind of steered me in a different direction and then here i am today doing something that i love you both talked about um struggling when you got to college and um maybe not getting good grades maybe failing a class which actually leads to our next audience question um that comes from gia leah i'm saying that correctly from the second grade and they want to know if you make a big mistake and you're in what your work is now how do you fix it you thought you want to start uh sure yeah so if you make a big well here's the thing first of all there will be times when you make big mistakes everybody does as kim said you know failing is okay because everyone does it you would be really weird if you did not fail at something at some point and the way to fix it is you know first of all you have to realize that something is wrong you might figure that out yourself somebody else might tell you and then just you know have an open mind like okay it's wrong you know no need to be defensive no need to like be like no no no i can't make a mistake because then you can't fix your mistakes if you don't like accept that you've made them and then just go back and see what was wrong um for example if it's like a huge mistake with some code you go through it line by line and go does it work up to this point yes does it work up to the next point yes you have to systematically go through and just figure out how to fix it and then everybody will be like yeah you fixed it and everybody will forget that you like didn't grab it right the first time um so yeah just you know be willing to say that oops i did that wrong but i'm gonna go fix it now yeah 100 and i just my cat is trying to make an appearance so if you see midnight everybody can say hi always always when i sit in the share to talk he appears anyways um yeah i think it's really important to just keep things in perspective because i have always struggled with failing like i mentioned when i failed that class it was like horrifying to me not only because of the money but i was just really embarrassed and just felt so down and i think what i've tried to learn since then and i'm not saying i'm totally successful but what i've tried to learn is that you have to keep things in perspective right um i was not in an operating room right when i failed that class like i was some doing something that i was trying to learn and for me failure since then even one failure is really hard and i feel like i've done something really bad or just done a really poor job i just try to keep that perspective of you know where is this in the grand scheme of people's lives right and that usually gives me some measure of comfort and then sorry from there it's all about and my cat agrees um and then from there it's all about like roots you said owning up to it for me as quickly as possible and then fixing it because truly i'm not just saying it but i l i have absolutely learned the best when i have failed at something because that's a lesson you'll never forget and then when you can successfully fix something that you've done poorly at the relief and that feeling of happiness is very strong again as my cat agrees sorry good night it's very frisky this morning i don't know what to do about him anyways add one quick thing that i forgot to say um but uh can talking remind me yeah first of all yes it's really hard to accept that you failed at something um my initial reaction was always to just panic and especially in grad school i used to go into like this oh my god nothing's gonna work now oh my my thesis is a lie um and then you have to like remember to breathe and also there's a balance you know accept that you have made mistakes but have confidence in yourself have confidence that your past self probably knew what they were doing to some extent because several times when i thought i had failed once i actually calmed down and went back and looked at my code and looked or looked at other things like i actually did that properly and the current me has forgotten why i did that thing so it is a balance be willing to accept that you have failed be willing to fix it but also don't panic because your past self also knew what they were doing exactly um i just wanted to note we have received so many amazing questions that we plan to if you all have time go over no more than five minutes does that work for you both oh yeah right right into the next great question great perfect because you all have some slides for this next question that i i want to make sure everyone share so kim we'll start with you what's a cool project you're working on right now or have finished recently yes definitely let me um share so i think i was talking about how um i'm very interested in oh you know what did i not sure i selected sound i think i did we'll find out um i spent well over 10 years of my career focusing on visuals creating something that people can see and it really bothered me that i had left out a segment of the population that could not process that data in the way that i had made it and especially someone who's paid by the government where everything i do should be public domain and accessible like i really felt a moral and ethical obligation to be able to make sure that what i had was shareable to more people so during um the pandemic we actually started a project with some colleagues um matt rousseau and andre santiglita specifically to be able to take the information that we had created visuals for and translate it into sound and i'm just going to play a little snippet here hopefully you can hear if i could get a thumbs up so that's taking that same information of an exploded star i showed earlier as a twodimensional image and as a threedimensional model and then taking that information and translating it into sound so these are not space sounds that you would hear if you were in outer space because we can't do that we can't hear an outer space there's no real medium for information to travel to our eardrums but here on the ground we can take information that could be say visual in one form and translate it into another form where we can hear and this is such a fun project to work on we've done about 12 different of these pieces of data sonification they're called or you know space soundscapes i suppose and the response has been just magical i've been so pleased we've worked with um people who are blind or low vision to be able to make sure that we can understand and really make some beautiful meanings out of this information and then just yeah we shared them with the world and it became very very popular and it was just so gratifying to know that something that i had created for a small tightknit community ended up being useful not only for them but for people around the world and that was a really exciting finding that if you try to make something better for one group you could help make it better for all the groups or at least more groups so yep that's one of the projects that we've been working on lately thank you rutha uh yes i will also share my screen okay so hopefully you're seeing this weird looking graph uh yeah okay cool so um as kim said we sh so she has done a lot of stuff in trying to bring the universe to everybody and i like to delve a little deeper into bringing very specific aspects of the universe to people of the universe to people who you know don't usually study it so i want everybody to be able to fall in love with the universe and understand it um maybe not to the depth that people who work in uh astro do because that that takes a while but in enough depth to be able to appreciate it and see how cool space is and how cool just the world and cosmos around us is so what we have here is actually um it's light that has sort of been taken apart if you will um so when you throw sunlight through a prism you get a rainbow of colors right that's how rainbows form you know sunlight goes through rainwater and like water in the atmosphere and forms this like array of colors and it turns out that if we look at stuff in space and we separate out its light like that we can tell what things in space are made up of so what i wanted to do was show people how we learned about that so what you're seeing here is this is called the e0102 supernova remnant it's called that because there are so many things in space that we can't name all of them with cool names um so it's a star exploded and this is what was left over and we want to know what's up there um and to do that we take the light from the star and we separate it out again this is a computer doing this there is way too much light for me to separate it out on my own so i i tell a computer hey tell me how much red light there is tell me how much green and blue etc and depending on what light is most bright basically when something is higher it's brighter so given that this is a little higher over here in the red it's saying that and this is a little higher at this point in green it's like oh this is showing us that there's oxygen up there somewhere and neon basically this particular band of red and this particular band of green are very specific to those materials to those elements and this is how much light came in when we looked at this thing for about two hours but we want more details so we keep looking at it for longer and longer and you see a little easily these little tiny bumps and the computer just tells us hey there's more of this kind of blue light tiny little bump and that tells us there is silicon up there silicon is the stuff that makes up sand um silicon and oxygen makeup scent and that's up there where a star exploded um there is sulfur neon is the stuff you see in like light signs like signs in front of stores that's up there in the stars and we can use this to see that like a lot of the things that like basically everything you see around us even our own bodies came from stuff that's in stars we actually use this to figure out that our bodies are made up of the same exact things that are up there in stars so i thought that was really cool and um i like being able to show that we can spread out the light like this yeah i'm trying to think of a a different word to describe that but all i can come up with is that's really cool thank you for sharing both of your projects and unfortunately we are out of time um thank you all for joining us today we have so many uh we wish we could have got to all the audience questions and hopefully we can figure out a way to get those questions answered answered for everyone who are watching it was so great to hear about cameron ruth's experiences teachers please fill out the survey that you're receiving your email tomorrow and be sure to check out the other class chats and the virtual field trips including a field trip from nasa's chandra xray observatory at code.org cs journeys they're happening all semester long thanks everyone thanks kim rudu thanks
