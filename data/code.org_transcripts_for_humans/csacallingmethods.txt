00:11 - when i tell my dog to sit he sits
00:14 - i don't have to re-teach him how to sit
00:15 - every time he just knows what to do when
00:18 - i give him the command sit
00:20 - in java we call methods to give commands
00:22 - to our objects
00:24 - a method is a named set of instructions
00:26 - to perform a task
00:27 - let's say i have a dog object called
00:29 - phyto
00:30 - i've written a method in the doll class
00:32 - to make a dog object bark a given number
00:34 - of times
00:35 - the number of barks is called a
00:37 - parameter
00:40 - a parameter is a variable in the method
00:42 - that defines the type of value to
00:44 - receive when the method is called
00:46 - when we want a dog object to bark we
00:48 - call it spark method
00:50 - to do this we first state the name of
00:52 - the object
00:53 - then we use the dot operator
00:55 - the dot operator is used to call a
00:57 - method in a class
00:59 - then we say the name of the method we
01:01 - want to call
01:02 - in this case we call the bark method
01:05 - since the bark method has a parameter
01:06 - for how many times it should bark we
01:08 - have to call the method with a number
01:10 - value inside the parentheses we specify
01:13 - the number of times we want fido to bark
01:15 - let's tell fido to bark three times
01:18 - when we specify a value inside the
01:20 - parentheses this is called an argument
01:22 - an argument is a value passed to a
01:24 - method when the method is called
01:27 - when we run our program the method is
01:29 - called on our dog object
01:31 - in this case our method displays woof
01:33 - three times when we call bark
01:36 - a class can contain methods methods are
01:39 - named commands for actions we want to
01:41 - perform
01:42 - we'll be calling methods to make our
01:43 - objects do all kinds of cool things
01:46 - [Music]
