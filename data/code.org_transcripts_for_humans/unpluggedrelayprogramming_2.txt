00:06 - Relay programming is an extremely fun lesson
that gets across way more than computer science.
00:14 - Sometimes everybody is getting a little bit
antsy and you want to get them up on their

00:18 - This is a great way to add some excitement
to computer science.
00:24 - You break everyone up into two groups where
they stand in a line and run relay style.
00:30 - The first person in each group runs to the
other side of the room where you have a graph
00:35 - paper drawing and a blank piece of paper waiting
for them.
00:39 - They write down the first step to creating
that image, run back to their line, tag the
00:45 - next player who goes back up to write the
next step.
00:50 - This is a great way to get across the idea
of debugging, needing to proofread your own
00:56 - work, and needing to check the work of the
people done before you.
01:00 - You'll quickly understand how important it
is that you be careful in your coding when

Relay programming is an extremely fun lesson that gets across way more than computer science. Sometimes everybody is getting a little bit antsy and you want to get them up on their feet. This is a great way to add some excitement to computer science. You break everyone up into two groups where they stand in a line and run relay style. The first person in each group runs to the other side of the room where you have a graph paper drawing and a blank piece of paper waiting for them.
