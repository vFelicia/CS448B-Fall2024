Cleaned transcript:

Sometimes a poem's mood shifts partway through the poem. What might start out as a happy sounding poem turns sad, or perhaps darkness turns to light. And this activity you'll be working with events. You can use this event block to change the course of your program when a specific line in your poem shows up. Notice that event blocks don't snap into your main program. Instead, they create little programs of their own. Read through your poem and find a moment where the mood shifts. Count what line that happens on. 123. In your event block, enter the number of the line then program in something to reflect the shift in mood when that line shows up on the screen. When you press run, you can see what you coded.
