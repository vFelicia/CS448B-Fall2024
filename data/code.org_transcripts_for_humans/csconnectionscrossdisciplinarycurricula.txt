00:16 - if I knew this would help reinforce
00:18 - Concepts I was already teaching in the
00:20 - classroom just in a much more novel and
00:22 - engaging way this curriculum is for any
00:24 - teacher no matter what their background
00:26 - is no matter how much computer science
00:28 - they've done in the past no matter what
00:31 - they teach when you utilize code.orgs
00:33 - curriculum you have everything there for
00:35 - you it has the questions that you need
00:38 - to ask your students that has the
00:39 - lessons that you need to teach and it
00:41 - gives you guidance on how to do it
00:48 - I like about my project is being able to
00:51 - bring my poem to life
00:53 - when we have computer science situated
00:56 - within the context of another subject
00:58 - area we suddenly see the purpose of
01:01 - using computer science and so it's not
01:04 - just learning computer science for
01:05 - computer science sake it is learning it
01:08 - within a problem statement or within a
01:11 - project that they create or an app that
01:13 - they develop it is practical uses of
01:15 - computer science thank you
01:18 - my name is Brody gullick and I'm a
01:20 - software engineer here at Pinterest my
01:22 - name is Ali Chase and I am an
01:23 - oceanographer at the University of
01:25 - Washington my name is Kim now and I'm a
01:27 - part of the Google Maps team we wanted
01:29 - to show students that computer science
01:31 - is more than just coding so we featured
01:34 - artists writers and scientists in our
01:37 - videos so students can see that computer
01:39 - science is done in all sorts of
01:41 - Industries I think it's been a wonderful
01:43 - addition to my teaching repertoire we
01:45 - want teachers to feel inspired by this
01:47 - curriculum so much so that they take it
01:50 - and modify it so that it is relevant to
01:53 - what they're teaching that year in their
01:55 - classrooms I incorporate into my
01:57 - language arts lessons I incorporate into
01:59 - my math lessons or my science this is
02:00 - very easy to do found that it was so
02:02 - engaging for my students more than
02:04 - anything one of my biggest hopes with
02:06 - computer science connections is that it
02:08 - reaches a student who might have never
02:09 - seen themselves as somebody who would
02:12 - take a computer science class
02:14 - I'm really proud of what I created
02:18 - foreign
