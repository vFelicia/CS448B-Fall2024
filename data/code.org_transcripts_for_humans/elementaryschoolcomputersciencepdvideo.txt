00:05 - let's talk about what we mean when we
00:07 - say computer science
00:09 - computer science is a field where people
00:11 - use the power of computers to solve big
00:13 - problems
00:15 - so is there a difference between
00:16 - computer science and coding
00:19 - the answer is yes
00:20 - coding is the set of instructions you
00:22 - give to a computer
00:24 - but computer science is a more holistic
00:27 - view of a field which includes coding
00:30 - but also includes things like what to do
00:32 - with a really big set of data how the
00:34 - internet works and its societal impacts
00:37 - and how to prepare and break down
00:39 - problems for solutions that use coding
00:43 - also as a note code.org is all about the
00:45 - promotion of the computer science field
00:47 - not just coding
00:49 - we're called code.org because it's short
00:51 - and snappy
00:53 - computer science.org does not have the
00:55 - same ring
00:56 - so coding or programming is instructions
01:00 - that you give to a computer
01:02 - and there are two primary categories of
01:04 - programming languages
01:06 - text-based programming languages and
01:08 - visual programming languages
01:11 - languages like javascript or python are
01:14 - text based but we'll be learning to
01:16 - program with blockly which uses visual
01:19 - blocks that you drag and drop to write
01:21 - programs
01:22 - it's easier to learn programming using a
01:24 - visual language versus a text based
01:26 - language because when you're learning to
01:28 - program you're up against two things
01:31 - learning the logic of how to write
01:33 - programs and also the syntax of writing
01:35 - programs
01:37 - so in both visual and text-based
01:40 - programming you're learning the logic of
01:42 - writing programs like how to repeat
01:44 - instructions or how to make the computer
01:46 - decide between two instructions
01:49 - syntax is a set of rules on how to
01:52 - combine instructions so the computer can
01:55 - understand them
01:56 - so in visual programming languages
01:58 - syntax is easy because you have a menu
02:01 - of available instructions which you can
02:03 - drag and place next to other
02:05 - instructions and then you're good to go
02:08 - in text-based programming
02:10 - syntax is more difficult because you
02:12 - have to remember what the instructions
02:14 - are called and you have to be very
02:16 - precise in what you type like where you
02:18 - put a semicolon or remembering to
02:20 - include an exclamation point
02:23 - by starting to learn to program with a
02:26 - visual programming language you can
02:28 - focus on the logic without worrying
02:30 - about if you're remembered to put a
02:32 - closed parenthesis or not
02:34 - then once you've got the logic of
02:36 - programming down
02:37 - you can choose to move on to a
02:38 - text-based programming language if you
02:40 - want which can be more powerful and
02:42 - efficient than visual languages if
02:45 - you're experienced with text-based
02:46 - programming
02:48 - so
02:49 - this learning progression is kind of
02:51 - like learning to crawl and get really
02:53 - getting really good at that before you
02:54 - learn to walk
02:56 - but by no means is learning to program
02:58 - with a visual language a cop-out it's
03:01 - even how a lot of big universities like
03:02 - harvard and berkeley teach coding in
03:05 - their intro to computer science classes
03:08 - and just like learning math in
03:09 - elementary school you start with
03:11 - addition and subtraction
03:13 - our courses are the addition and
03:15 - subtraction equivalent for computer
03:17 - science
03:18 - if your students continue to study
03:20 - computer science they'll be on their way
03:22 - to writing apps curing diseases by
03:25 - working with big sets of medical data or
03:27 - writing programs for the rovers on mars
03:31 - computer science affects so many
03:33 - different fields these days
03:35 - it's not limited to writing software
03:37 - it's a way to change the world
03:40 - computer science is creative and
03:42 - empowering
03:44 - and
03:45 - when you learn the foundational skills
03:47 - in elementary school this exposes it to
03:49 - students who might not opt into studying
03:51 - it otherwise
03:53 - not all of your students are going to
03:55 - grow up and become computer scientists
03:57 - but computer science is all about
04:00 - problem solving critical thinking and
04:02 - persistence
04:03 - skills that will definitely be needed no
04:05 - matter what career your students pursue
04:09 - and programming is also about explaining
04:11 - instructions so clearly that something
04:13 - without a brain can understand you
04:16 - and we can all benefit from having
04:18 - better explanation skills
