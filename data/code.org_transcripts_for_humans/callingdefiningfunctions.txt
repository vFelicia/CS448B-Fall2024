00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - in app lab the toolbox now has a tab
00:08 - called functions
00:10 - there are two blocks
00:13 - this one defines a new function
00:17 - and this one
00:18 - calls a function
00:21 - let's make a function that updates the
00:23 - number of likes on the screen and plays
00:25 - a sound
00:26 - we'll call it twice
00:28 - once in each on event block
00:32 - drag a define a function block out
00:37 - notice how on both of these on event
00:39 - blocks have the same last two commands
00:42 - in them
00:45 - to help simplify this program let's take
00:47 - these commands and turn them into a
00:49 - function
00:53 - and let's give the function a name like
00:55 - update screen
00:59 - now we can remove the repeated code from
01:02 - the rest of the program
01:04 - now click run
01:07 - hey we defined a function
01:10 - but nothing happened
01:13 - the reason is we forgot step two
01:16 - we need to call the function
01:20 - to call a function
01:21 - drag out the call a function block from
01:25 - the toolbox and put it in the program
01:28 - now add in the name of the function we
01:30 - just defined
01:33 - now that we have both defined
01:35 - and called our function the code will
01:37 - actually run and the likes will change
01:40 - on the screen check it out
01:45 - it works
01:46 - notice that if i also call the function
01:49 - before its definition it still works
01:54 - [Music]
02:04 - defining a function simply gives a name
02:06 - to a block of code but it doesn't
02:08 - actually run it
02:10 - the definition can be anywhere in your
02:12 - program
02:13 - this means that your code can get messy
02:16 - and really hard to read
02:18 - so we typically put our function
02:20 - definitions at the end of our programs
02:22 - to help keep things organized
02:25 - you can also see why it's important to
02:27 - give your function a meaningful and
02:28 - descriptive name
02:30 - if you call it something like do stuff
02:33 - it'll be unclear what the function is
02:34 - supposed to do and it makes it hard to
02:37 - use in your own code
02:39 - giving a function a meaningful name
02:41 - makes it much easier to understand what
02:43 - it does
02:44 - using functions like this in your
02:45 - program not only makes your code easier
02:47 - to understand it
02:49 - it also makes it easier to fix problems
02:51 - or errors
02:53 - when you fix a problem inside your
02:54 - function that will automatically fix
02:57 - that problem wherever the function is
02:59 - called
03:02 - [Music]
03:12 - you

in app lab the toolbox now has a tab called functions there are two blocks this one defines a new function and this one calls a function let's make a function that updates the number of likes on the screen and plays a sound we'll call it twice once in each on event block drag a define a function block out notice how on both of these on event blocks have the same last two commands in them to help simplify this program let's take these commands and turn them into a function and let's give the function a name like update screen now we can remove the repeated code from the rest of the program now click run hey we defined a function but nothing happened the reason is we forgot step two we need to call the function to call a function drag out the call a function block from the toolbox and put it in the program now add in the name of the function we just defined now that we have both defined and called our function the code will actually run and the likes will change on the screen check it out it works notice that if i also call the function before its definition it still works defining a function simply gives a name to a block of code but it doesn't actually run it the definition can be anywhere in your program this means that your code can get messy and really hard to read so we typically put our function definitions at the end of our programs to help keep things organized you can also see why it's important to give your function a meaningful and descriptive name if you call it something like do stuff it'll be unclear what the function is supposed to do and it makes it hard to use in your own code giving a function a meaningful name makes it much easier to understand what it does using functions like this in your program not only makes your code easier to understand it it also makes it easier to fix problems or errors when you fix a problem inside your function that will automatically fix that problem wherever the function is called you
