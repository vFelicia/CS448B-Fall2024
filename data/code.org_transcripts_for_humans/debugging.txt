00:09 - Debugging is finding and fixing problems.
There are lots of ways to debug problems.
00:14 - One of the easiest is to move step by step
until where you find where something goes wrong.
00:19 - Here I'm trying to do a back handspring
on the beam but I keep falling off. I walked
00:29 - through each part step by step and realized
where my mistake was. I wasn't putting my
00:34 - hands on the beam correctly. So I tried another
back handspring on the beam with my new hand
00:40 - position and I got it. I was really glad I
debugged my back handspring. To learn about
00:47 - debugging, we start with a set of blocks already
on the stage. You'll notice that these blocks
00:52 - won't get you to the goal. We need to debug
the solution and fix it. What went wrong?
00:59 - You'll notice that you needed to keep going
west one more block so let's fix this by adding
01:06 - another west block and hitting run to see
if you got it right. Yay, you got it!
