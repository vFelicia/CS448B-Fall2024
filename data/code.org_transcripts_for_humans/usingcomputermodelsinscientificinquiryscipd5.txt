00:06 - hi everyone i'm melody hageman i'm a
00:09 - science and computer science teacher and
00:11 - i've been working with project guts to
00:13 - help students explore using models in
00:15 - scientific inquiry for a number of years
00:17 - in this presentation we're going to
00:20 - explore how to use models and
00:21 - simulations in scientific inquiry the
00:24 - beauty of developing models is that they
00:26 - can be used as virtual test beds in
00:28 - which to perform your experiments and
00:30 - explore the phenomena you are interested
00:32 - in
00:33 - but first what is a model a model is a
00:36 - simplification of what we want to
00:38 - examine when we create a model we ignore
00:40 - some of the details and focus on what is
00:42 - important to us at the time
00:44 - in computer science we call this
00:46 - simplification an abstraction
00:49 - so just like building a model of a solar
00:51 - system using styrofoam balls is a
00:53 - simplification of the real solar system
00:56 - a computer model is a simplification or
00:58 - abstraction of what we're trying to
01:00 - study
01:01 - but unlike the styrofoam ball physical
01:03 - model once we've created a computer
01:05 - model of what we want to study we can
01:07 - use it to study what we're interested in
01:10 - this is because unlike the styrofoam
01:12 - ball model
01:13 - that just looks like the real thing a
01:16 - computer model can be programmed to act
01:18 - like the real thing
01:19 - a computer model can capture the
01:21 - elements and the behaviors of what we
01:23 - want to study
01:24 - once the computer model is created then
01:27 - we get to use it
01:28 - simulation is using or running the model
01:31 - that we've developed
01:33 - we run the model to simulate the passage
01:35 - of time and explore the behavior of the
01:37 - modeled system
01:38 - this is similar to running an experiment
01:40 - in the lab students might run the
01:42 - experiment observe the behavior collect
01:45 - and analyze the data and develop
01:47 - explanations and or predictions based on
01:50 - their evidence
01:51 - similarly each time we use or run the
01:53 - model we observe the behavior gather the
01:56 - data and make an interpretation or
01:58 - calculation from that data
02:00 - so running a simulation is performing an
02:02 - experiment on your computer
02:04 - why would you want to run simulations on
02:06 - your computer i mean why not want run
02:09 - real experiments in the lab well there
02:11 - are a lot of reasons to run simulations
02:14 - once you develop the model you can run
02:16 - it many times with many different
02:18 - variables or parameters so you can
02:20 - thoroughly explore what you have modeled
02:22 - if you run your model and realize you
02:24 - left something important out then you
02:26 - can modify the model to include it
02:29 - once your model is developed it doesn't
02:31 - really cost you anything to run
02:32 - simulations except your time
02:35 - also you can develop models for
02:37 - situations where experimentation is too
02:39 - difficult
02:40 - perhaps running an experiment is too
02:42 - dangerous or maybe even impossible or
02:45 - maybe lab experiments are just too
02:47 - expensive
02:48 - or maybe experimentation would take too
02:51 - long like exploring the genetic drift of
02:53 - certain mammals
02:55 - so you can see that there are lots of
02:57 - reasons to explore some problems using
02:59 - computer models and simulation
03:01 - we can classify models many different
03:03 - ways
03:04 - one way is to classify models as
03:06 - deterministic or stochastic
03:09 - a deterministic model provides only one
03:11 - output for a set of inputs there's no
03:14 - randomness involved in the model
03:16 - you can think of it as the solution of a
03:18 - mathematical equation
03:20 - a stochastic model on the other hand can
03:22 - produce different outputs for a set of
03:24 - inputs you actually get a variety of
03:27 - outputs
03:28 - that's because some randomness is
03:30 - involved in your model
03:32 - the agent-based models of complex
03:34 - adaptive systems we will be using in our
03:37 - curriculum activities all include some
03:39 - randomness and therefore they are
03:42 - stochastic and produce distribution of
03:44 - possible outcomes repetition is
03:47 - important when using a stochastic model
03:49 - because for each set of input variables
03:52 - you may get somewhat different results
03:55 - you need to repeat the model at the same
03:57 - settings or with the same parameters to
04:00 - see the distribution of outcomes
04:03 - there are some similarities and
04:05 - differences between lab experiments and
04:07 - computational science experiments
04:10 - one experimental design
04:13 - in both lab and computational science is
04:16 - the design of controlled experiments
04:18 - these experiments are designed to
04:20 - produce evidence of causal relationships
04:23 - by isolating variables
04:25 - two
04:26 - in computational science experiments we
04:29 - can use abstraction and include only
04:31 - those factors and components we think
04:33 - are important
04:34 - three in computational science
04:36 - experiments we can change the underlying
04:39 - behavior of components whereas in real
04:41 - life this is rarely possible code is
04:44 - flexible
04:45 - four
04:46 - in computational science experiments we
04:48 - can use automation to repeat experiments
04:51 - easily quickly and exactly whereas in
04:53 - real life there is human error and
04:55 - replication of experiments is difficult
04:58 - five manipulations and observations of
05:01 - the real world can proceed or lead up to
05:04 - hypothesis building your experimentation
05:07 - might involve testing the whole space of
05:08 - variables called the parameter space to
05:11 - look for patterns that may lead to
05:13 - hypotheses
05:14 - rather than coming to the test bed with
05:16 - a hypothesis
05:18 - i hope this introduction to using
05:20 - computer models in scientific inquiry
05:22 - has given you a picture of why models
05:24 - and simulations are valuable tools in
05:26 - modern scientific research
