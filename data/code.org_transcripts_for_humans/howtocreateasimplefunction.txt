00:05 - You've already learned to use and edit
functions as a part of an efficient
00:09 - program. Now, let's learn how to create
and use a function from scratch. To do
00:16 - this, look for the category called
functions in the toolbox. Here, you'll see
00:21 - a block called "do something". Drag that
block out into your workspace and rename
00:26 - it to something new that better
describes what your function will do. I'm
00:30 - calling this one "make a square". From here,
you can drag blocks into the function to
00:36 - specify what you want to happen when the
function is used. With our function
00:45 - created, you can see that a new make a
square block appears under the functions
00:50 - label in the toolbox, so that we can
actually use, or "call", our created function
00:55 - from our program. This is an important
step that's easy to forget. Okay, time to
01:00 - continue on and get creative with your
own functions!
