00:15 - hello out there
00:16 - thank you for joining us my name is dan
00:20 - and i am a curriculum development
00:21 - manager here at code.org
00:23 - and thank you so much for joining us for
00:25 - our afternoon session of
00:27 - code bytes i'll make a little camera
00:29 - adjustment so that you can see my
00:31 - wonderful um
00:32 - head accessory going on up here um thank
00:35 - you so much for joining us
00:36 - in this episode of code bytes we are
00:38 - going to be talking about artificial
00:39 - intelligence
00:40 - or ai and we're going to teach a
00:42 - computer to classify different
00:44 - images um and i'm super excited because
00:46 - you're coded or we believe that
00:48 - anyone can code and so i am excited to
00:51 - be joined by my
00:52 - father eric and together we're going to
00:55 - learn about artificial intelligence
00:57 - you want to come join me up on the stage
00:58 - round of applause
01:00 - round of applause for eric here hey
01:03 - folks
01:03 - there we go right here we have been this
01:06 - is very important we are now
01:07 - matching a little bit i have my code
01:09 - chart and he is of course the code
01:12 - guest and so we are very excited to be
01:14 - um
01:15 - facilitating this investigation into
01:17 - artificial intelligence
01:19 - um so first of all so welcome pops it's
01:21 - good to see you it's been a long time
01:22 - yes
01:23 - absolutely can you share how old you are
01:25 - with the world
01:27 - i i know i look young but um i'm really
01:30 - 72.
01:31 - 70 to accept generations and we're going
01:34 - to talk about ai have you
01:35 - have you done any work with ai before
01:39 - not knowingly not knowingly what are
01:40 - some ways you think ai
01:42 - is like impacting your life right now
01:49 - the news in what way well i get my daily
01:52 - news brief
01:53 - and i notice that it's geared
01:56 - specifically to me
01:58 - so like the recommendations yeah the
01:59 - recommendation it's saying things like
02:01 - we think you'll like this we think
02:02 - you'll like that you know what you're
02:03 - exactly right
02:04 - any of those recommendations things like
02:06 - on netflix or spotify we think you'll
02:07 - like this we think you'll like that
02:09 - that's ai okay um so thank you so much
02:12 - for joining us
02:13 - here um and we know that you out there
02:15 - in the world are joining us as well we'd
02:16 - love to know where you're from
02:18 - there's a couple of ways you can tell us
02:20 - there's this link that you can
02:22 - go to code.org map and you can tell us
02:25 - where you're from
02:27 - and i think we're going to switch over
02:28 - and take a look at all the folks who are
02:30 - joining us right now
02:32 - we have over 400 viewers tuning in
02:35 - a look at all these people from all over
02:38 - not just the us all over the world
02:39 - wait down in antarctica we have someone
02:42 - who do you know in antarctica
02:43 - santa claus that's very true
02:47 - so we probably have antarctica on the
02:49 - screen we have the us i see i'm we're in
02:51 - arizona i live in tucson so i wonder if
02:53 - there's some arizona folks
02:55 - oh and i see people in the chat sharing
02:57 - where they're from thank you so much
02:59 - oh this is wonderful well we are going
03:01 - to go ahead and get started
03:03 - and so this week we're celebrating the
03:05 - hour of code which is when millions of
03:07 - students like yourselves are learning
03:08 - the basics of computer science
03:10 - and this event has passed over 1 billion
03:12 - student engagements did you know that 1
03:14 - billion people
03:15 - that's crazy right yeah pretty amazing
03:18 - pretty amazing
03:18 - reaching students in every city around
03:21 - the world
03:22 - and so we are going to do a couple of
03:24 - things today we're going to train an ai
03:26 - to recognize different fish to help it
03:28 - clean up the ocean
03:29 - we're going to train an ai from our
03:31 - webcam in order to recognize sign
03:33 - language which is going to be really
03:34 - cool
03:35 - and we're talking about some strategies
03:36 - involving bias and harm
03:38 - to avoid those when we're working with
03:40 - artificial intelligence
03:41 - some really deep stuff going on wait so
03:43 - are we teaching the people about
03:45 - sign or are we teaching the fish we're
03:47 - going to teach
03:48 - well that's a good question here i can
03:49 - tell you exactly who we're going to
03:50 - teach
03:51 - okay so we're going to teach our friend
03:54 - ai bot
03:55 - right here this is a i bought floating
03:56 - in the world and his job is to clean up
03:59 - the ocean
04:00 - but ai bot has a problem you see so
04:02 - we're going to start with ourselves
04:04 - first
04:04 - all right so like because we have
04:06 - intelligence we have natural
04:07 - intelligence and one of the ways we know
04:08 - that is
04:09 - [Laughter]
04:12 - okay do i not always have natural no no
04:13 - no no no
04:15 - thank you so much so other things
04:19 - we can do this thing as human beings we
04:21 - can close our eyes
04:22 - and when i say the word fish i want you
04:25 - to think of the first thing that pops
04:26 - into your head and those of you
04:27 - participating as well in the chat
04:29 - i want you to try that too close your
04:31 - eyes and when i say the word
04:32 - fish type in the chat what type of fish
04:36 - do you see
04:37 - ready three two one fish what kind of
04:40 - fish did you see when you closed your
04:41 - eyes and thought of a fish
04:42 - soda fish you know one of those tropical
04:44 - fish with the
04:46 - the appendages that go up and down and
04:49 - and
04:49 - uh they look superfluous but they're not
04:51 - uh i guess they have some function
04:53 - you know it's beautiful but small very
04:56 - colorful
04:57 - with like the extra little like
04:58 - appendages and things there's like those
04:59 - deep sea fish that are all the way down
05:00 - to the ocean
05:01 - coral reef the coral reef fish see
05:03 - that's that's a fish when we think of it
05:05 - yes i thought of like nemo from finding
05:07 - nemo i thought of the little clownfish
05:08 - design
05:09 - but important thing is that we have
05:11 - these mental models for what a fish is
05:14 - and our ai bot does not have the same
05:17 - model
05:18 - he has no idea what a fish is so one of
05:21 - the first things that we need to do is
05:22 - give it a machine
05:24 - learning model just like we have a
05:25 - mental model it needs a machine learning
05:28 - model
05:28 - to know what a fish is so what do you
05:30 - think about this is that a fish
05:31 - yeah i think so too that's a fish what
05:34 - about this one
05:34 - uh yeah yeah what about this is that
05:36 - fish well
05:38 - as far as i know no i agree with you
05:40 - that is not a fish
05:41 - so we're going to say that this is not a
05:43 - fish now what about this
05:45 - no i think so too i'm going to kind of
05:47 - click through some others fish and not
05:49 - fish and what we're doing
05:51 - is we're giving ai bot these mental
05:53 - images we're letting it figure out what
05:55 - are the things that are fish
05:57 - versus not fish and it might start to
05:58 - notice some patterns it'll notice
06:00 - patterns with like
06:01 - how the the image is shaped it'll notice
06:05 - patterns with the colors it'll notice
06:07 - patterns with the features
06:09 - fish have eyes and mouth and trash does
06:12 - not
06:12 - and when we've done this for a while we
06:14 - can have aibot
06:16 - test out and see how it does based on
06:19 - this machine learning model that it's
06:20 - done
06:21 - you ready to see how it does yeah so
06:22 - this so what should it do with this this
06:24 - light bulb should keep it get rid of it
06:25 - get rid of it should get rid of it let's
06:26 - find out okay
06:28 - what right away it made a mistake
06:33 - well this is good though it's getting
06:34 - rid of that that's a fish that's a nope
06:38 - clearly we made some mistakes in here
06:40 - somewhere ai bot does not have a very
06:42 - clear mental model
06:43 - of what or rather a machine learning
06:44 - model of what a fish is versus not a
06:46 - fish
06:47 - we can even investigate a little bit and
06:49 - take a look at the things that ai bot
06:51 - has learned
06:52 - so ai bot thinks all of these things are
06:55 - fish
06:56 - and over here it thinks all of these
06:58 - things
06:59 - are not fish
07:03 - and so what's happened is aibot has
07:04 - noticed patterns
07:06 - it's noticed some commonalities it's
07:08 - maybe tried to figure out with its
07:09 - mental model what a fish is
07:11 - for example like most of these fish look
07:12 - round right yeah so i think that's why i
07:14 - thought the light bulb was the fish
07:15 - because light bubbles around
07:16 - my boat so how do you think we can fix
07:18 - this with ai bot how can we make sure
07:20 - that it doesn't make those same mistakes
07:21 - we need more fish
07:22 - examples we need more fish examples but
07:25 - isn't like there's more than just fish
07:27 - in the sea right yeah there's like
07:29 - seahorses and starfish
07:30 - even if we trained it to recognize all
07:32 - the fish wouldn't it still get rid of
07:33 - those other ocean creatures too
07:37 - i think that'd be like a problem i don't
07:39 - know so okay so with my ai experience i
07:42 - know but i'm sure that if you
07:43 - put enough information in it'll be able
07:45 - to discern the difference
07:47 - i agree with that enough and varied
07:49 - information
07:50 - it can figure it out that's like the key
07:52 - principle of ai look at you you can go
07:54 - apply for ai jobs now you can go work at
07:56 - like amazon or google or microsoft
07:58 - look at that so
08:01 - we have just trained this little ai bot
08:03 - in order to tell the difference between
08:05 - fish
08:06 - and not fish and it's built its own
08:08 - little machine learning model
08:10 - and this process where we gave it some
08:11 - data we
08:13 - let it train on itself and then we
08:15 - tested it to see how it does
08:16 - that's the really common process that
08:18 - happens with ai
08:19 - all the time if you wanted to play
08:22 - around and keep going with this little
08:24 - tutorial
08:25 - you can find all that information here
08:26 - at code.org
08:28 - oceans which is pretty cool but we're
08:30 - going to switch gears a little bit and
08:31 - we're going to go to a different program
08:33 - we're going to go to a program called
08:34 - teachable machine
08:36 - and the thing that teachable machine
08:38 - does which is really cool is instead of
08:40 - training images just on the fish on
08:42 - there
08:43 - we can have it train on our webcam up
08:45 - here okay
08:46 - so in order to do that if you decided to
08:48 - do this at home and you wanted to play
08:49 - around
08:50 - i would recommend just googling
08:51 - teachable machine which is a nice thing
08:53 - to do because google makes this program
08:55 - so then you'll find it really easy
08:56 - google will point you right there
08:58 - and so one thing that we can do is we
09:01 - can use our webcam to train things now i
09:03 - need to do something special that you
09:05 - won't have to do at home i need to turn
09:06 - off my video here
09:08 - so that i can turn on the webcam here
09:12 - and then you can see me on this website
09:15 - there we go
09:15 - we're right there see we're back yes
09:17 - we're back okay so we're gonna do now
09:19 - we're gonna do something that was
09:20 - inspired by an experience i had when i
09:22 - was still teaching
09:23 - and so when i was still teaching at the
09:24 - high school classroom we had a student
09:26 - enroll a couple of years ago
09:28 - and she was a deaf student and when she
09:30 - enrolled a lot of the students in our
09:32 - community started to realize
09:33 - there were some accessibility problems
09:35 - in our
09:36 - in terms of this person participating in
09:38 - high school and engaging in high school
09:40 - and being able to get the education they
09:42 - deserved and we started to realize that
09:44 - there's a lot of things about
09:46 - our environment that wasn't very
09:47 - inclusive to the deaf and hard of
09:49 - hearing community
09:50 - and so what the students did is they
09:52 - made a petition and they rallied the
09:54 - administration and they said hey
09:55 - instead of french and spanish and these
09:58 - other world languages
09:59 - you should offer american sign language
10:01 - too and they listened and they found a
10:03 - teacher
10:04 - and they started a program and now that
10:06 - school has a thriving american sign
10:08 - language program
10:09 - did you know that this is a true story
10:10 - no i didn't i know it's pretty cool
10:12 - right
10:12 - yeah so i was inspired by these students
10:15 - and i was really motivated to try and
10:17 - continue to build an inclusive community
10:19 - for the deaf and hard of hearing
10:21 - and i wanted to make something with ai
10:23 - that could recognize sign language
10:25 - because then i could help communicate
10:27 - with folks in the deaf and hard of
10:29 - hearing community
10:30 - so we're going to do we're going to use
10:33 - american sign language
10:34 - which is these features here and so you
10:37 - can use your hand to form different
10:39 - letters of the alphabet
10:41 - and we're going to spell the three
10:43 - letters e
10:45 - v and a
10:48 - so again we're gonna do e v
10:52 - and a do you know why we're gonna do eva
10:54 - it's my favorite word one of my favorite
10:56 - words why is it one of your favorite
10:57 - words
10:57 - uh your daughter i have a daughter named
10:59 - ava isn't that so cute we're going to
11:01 - teach you if there are any avas out
11:03 - there in the world this is for you
11:04 - same name as my daughter same name as
11:06 - lots of folks out here at code.org
11:08 - we're very excited so if i want to use
11:10 - this website to do that
11:12 - first i need to say i'm going to train
11:14 - this
11:15 - on the letter e oops
11:20 - and then down here i need to let it know
11:21 - i'm going to train on the letter
11:24 - v and then i need to add one more
11:27 - section to let it know i need to train
11:29 - on the letter a
11:33 - oops i misspelled something that's okay
11:34 - we all make mistakes cool
11:36 - eva so the way this works is we have to
11:40 - hold up our hands to represent
11:42 - the letter e so e was like this all
11:44 - right so i'm going to do it first you
11:45 - ready i'm going to use the same let's go
11:46 - ahead okay
11:47 - so i'm going to press and hold record
11:50 - i'm going to move this around a little
11:51 - bit
11:52 - and what's happening is this machine is
11:54 - learning i've given it 99 images
11:57 - all representing the letter e now i need
12:00 - to do the same thing with the letter
12:02 - v and so when this loads up
12:05 - okay are you ready yeah that's my big
12:07 - moment this is your big moment big
12:08 - moment folks all right so you're going
12:09 - to hold up the v
12:10 - you ready v there you go okay now
12:14 - there you go you kind of move it all
12:15 - over the place
12:18 - no not sideways that's your voguing now
12:20 - v for voguing okay there you go
12:22 - that's a good one right there okay great
12:24 - so we're moving in all those different
12:25 - places so it can learn that it's the v
12:27 - that's important and not all the other
12:28 - stuff that's going on
12:30 - now we're going to go down here to a and
12:32 - i'll do the a again
12:36 - so as i go to do this here is a
12:39 - and i have my a right over here
12:42 - and i've given it about a hundred images
12:45 - so i made sure that i've given it the
12:47 - same amount of training images i got 99
12:49 - i got 120 i got 99 right here
12:52 - and now that i've trained it on all
12:53 - these images i can press this button
12:55 - and this is when it starts to do the
12:57 - work of training the machine
12:59 - of learning the differences between the
13:01 - e and the v
13:03 - in the a and so as it's going through
13:05 - and doing this
13:07 - i got to stay in this tab and it's going
13:10 - to click through and do these pieces
13:13 - i'm going to try and share my video
13:14 - again oh look at us over here on the
13:15 - side
13:16 - um in preparation for this i reached out
13:19 - to my
13:20 - old high school and i asked the american
13:21 - sign language club there to share some
13:23 - facts about the
13:24 - um deaf and hard of hearing community in
13:26 - asl i want to share some of them with
13:27 - you can i do that
13:28 - right ahead so did you know that
13:31 - 90 of deaf babies are born to hearing
13:35 - parents
13:36 - no i didn't know that either until they
13:38 - told me i was going to share some more i
13:40 - have a couple more that i'll share in a
13:41 - little bit but right now
13:43 - i want to go back to this and i want to
13:46 - test out this model that got trained
13:49 - so here we are right there okay so you
13:51 - see us here in the middle and then down
13:53 - here we have these predictions of what
13:54 - it's trying to do
13:56 - okay so i'm going to hold up this was e
13:59 - i'm going to do an e right here it's
14:01 - getting a little confused a little
14:04 - confused
14:05 - it keeps thinking that it's an a oh
14:08 - there we go
14:09 - so down here at the bottom it has these
14:10 - little percentages of what it's trying
14:12 - to predict why don't you try your v
14:14 - why don't you hold the v very strongly
14:17 - thinks it's a v you did a much better
14:18 - job of training than i did that probably
14:19 - because you moved it all around the
14:21 - place
14:21 - because i'm older it's because you just
14:23 - have more experience more wisens
14:25 - hopefully hopefully i think so too and
14:27 - then if i do the a
14:28 - out here there we go pretty strongly
14:31 - down here knows that it's an a
14:32 - down here i'm not sure what happened
14:34 - with the v i'm a little sad that the v
14:36 - didn't show maybe i'm like holding it
14:38 - the wrong way
14:39 - oh no well the e oh wait hold on come
14:41 - back into the picture a little bit
14:42 - because you were like oh see that makes
14:44 - a difference
14:45 - because it's learned that you're in the
14:46 - picture when i do the e and the v
14:48 - and the a i have a lot of troubles with
14:50 - some people
14:51 - um even though this is kind of a silly
14:53 - example where i can't tell the
14:54 - difference between an e and a v
14:55 - and an a sometimes artificial
14:57 - intelligence is used in things like
14:58 - facial recognition
14:59 - where telling the difference between one
15:01 - person or another
15:02 - it's not as silly as just these asl
15:04 - letters it can mean the difference for
15:06 - someone it can be very impactful
15:08 - for the people when it doesn't work as
15:10 - expected so we always want to be careful
15:12 - when we're doing things with artificial
15:14 - intelligence and things like image
15:15 - recognition
15:16 - to make sure we get the most accurate
15:18 - models possible
15:19 - when you follow along at home there's a
15:21 - couple of extra cool steps that you can
15:23 - do to make sure that you can share this
15:25 - out
15:25 - if you decide to make an app that uses
15:28 - eva
15:29 - or you decide to train on other asl
15:31 - symbols once you've done that you can go
15:33 - into this menu
15:34 - and click upload my model
15:38 - and when you do that it'll take a second
15:40 - but then you'll get this
15:41 - link here and when you get this link
15:44 - here
15:44 - one thing that you can do is you can
15:46 - copy and paste it
15:48 - into a new window and you'll get this
15:52 - other website that you can send to your
15:55 - friends and your family and you can use
15:57 - out in the world
15:59 - that has your same trained model in it
16:01 - down here
16:02 - so then if i wanted to there's your v
16:04 - why don't i try a it was over here a is
16:06 - working
16:07 - i don't know what happened with e oh
16:08 - wait e's a little bit i didn't maybe
16:10 - it's because like you know what it is i
16:12 - blame these guys that must be what it is
16:14 - ai isn't always perfect another cool
16:17 - thing that you can do with this same
16:18 - model as well
16:20 - is you can use a website called p5js
16:24 - and if you've done things with web
16:26 - design or web editing
16:28 - this is a way that you can import your
16:29 - model into this other website
16:32 - we can click on that top one there and
16:35 - if i press this play button right here
16:38 - it loads a website that i can also share
16:40 - with people
16:41 - that will also use our machine learning
16:44 - model
16:44 - you see how down here it says daytime
16:47 - yeah
16:47 - it's not what i want because it's using
16:49 - someone else's machine learning model
16:51 - so instead i'm going to go in here and
16:54 - i'm going to copy
16:55 - this line of code that has my model with
16:58 - it
16:59 - and i'm going to paste it right here
17:02 - instead
17:04 - and i'm gonna paste oh i lost paste
17:07 - where's paste
17:08 - i'll just use my keyboard for it instead
17:13 - and then i'm gonna stop and refresh the
17:16 - page
17:18 - and now if we did it correctly see
17:20 - letter v
17:21 - letter v then i'm gonna hold up the a
17:23 - letter a
17:25 - so if you were to do other sort of hour
17:27 - of code tutorials involving websites or
17:29 - things like that
17:30 - you can then build more out of this as
17:32 - well
17:33 - so cool we made an artificial
17:36 - intelligence machine learning model
17:38 - brave for ava um at this point
17:41 - actually i think what i'm going to do
17:42 - now is i'm going to jump ahead
17:45 - to this website i'm going to stop
17:48 - sharing my screen so that you all can
17:50 - see me
17:51 - on the big window here oops
17:55 - i didn't mean to do that i'm going to
17:56 - have to go back to the screen that i was
17:58 - at before
17:58 - there we go um one of the things that
18:01 - we're about to do now is we were going
18:02 - to have ava join us
18:04 - um but ava is asleep so you don't get to
18:06 - meet my baby
18:07 - i know so that's very sad we weren't
18:08 - going to wake her up just for code bites
18:10 - um but we were going to have her come
18:12 - and join us as well
18:14 - but in the meantime we have honored
18:16 - ava's memory
18:17 - and made her letters here if you wanted
18:20 - to look up other american sign language
18:22 - symbols and make your own app around it
18:24 - you can totally do that that just about
18:27 - wraps up our code byte episode so
18:28 - hopefully now you know a little bit more
18:30 - about artificial intelligence and the
18:31 - machine learning process
18:33 - where we gather data we train a model we
18:35 - test it out
18:36 - and if we had more time i would go back
18:38 - and retrain it because
18:40 - oh boy that e still isn't going very
18:42 - well do you learn some things about
18:43 - artificial intelligence
18:45 - i think so yeah what's like what's like
18:47 - your takeaway you're like your five word
18:48 - summary
18:50 - my five word summary sure oh gosh
18:54 - um um
18:58 - you're less than 10 words and that's in
19:00 - some word summary but you wanted a quick
19:01 - answer i don't know if i have a quick
19:02 - answer i'll come back to you
19:03 - okay um i want to share with you
19:06 - if you would like to learn more about
19:09 - artificial intelligence
19:10 - we've got this really awesome panel
19:12 - coming up
19:13 - that you can participate in tomorrow as
19:16 - well
19:16 - i've got a website for you that you can
19:19 - check out
19:20 - it's code.org slash ai and we have
19:24 - this ethics of ai panel that's happening
19:26 - tomorrow
19:27 - that you can participate in and so when
19:30 - you go to that website code.org
19:32 - ai you can see this ai for oceans you
19:34 - can learn more about that and help train
19:36 - the fish
19:37 - you can learn more about what's
19:38 - happening behind the scenes with this
19:39 - how ai works
19:41 - and we've got this awesome exploring the
19:43 - ethics of ai panel
19:44 - that happens tomorrow at 10 30 pacific
19:47 - and i think it's 1
19:48 - 30 eastern those are about those times
19:51 - which is pretty cool
19:53 - all right do you have your do you have
19:54 - your do you have your thoughts around
19:56 - artificial intelligence
19:58 - [Laughter]
20:00 - no i want to say that i'm suffering from
20:02 - a 72 year old
20:05 - sense of memory and uh you'd have to
20:08 - repeat the question again
20:09 - well hopefully advances in artificial
20:11 - intelligence can help with things like
20:13 - memory like those are some of the things
20:14 - that they're doing yeah definitely
20:15 - definitely i would need that
20:16 - you need like a little ai um you need a
20:19 - little ai
20:21 - assistant or something right right right
20:24 - well
20:24 - i am going to close out of these things
20:26 - really enjoyed my time with you all
20:28 - thank you all for coming
20:29 - go make some artificial intelligence
20:32 - machine learning
20:32 - apps go use them to improve the world
20:35 - around us and be careful with the data
20:37 - that you use
20:38 - thank you all so much
20:47 - what happened to the people who raised
20:48 - their hands

Cleaned transcript:

hello out there thank you for joining us my name is dan and i am a curriculum development manager here at code.org and thank you so much for joining us for our afternoon session of code bytes i'll make a little camera adjustment so that you can see my wonderful um head accessory going on up here um thank you so much for joining us in this episode of code bytes we are going to be talking about artificial intelligence or ai and we're going to teach a computer to classify different images um and i'm super excited because you're coded or we believe that anyone can code and so i am excited to be joined by my father eric and together we're going to learn about artificial intelligence you want to come join me up on the stage round of applause round of applause for eric here hey folks there we go right here we have been this is very important we are now matching a little bit i have my code chart and he is of course the code guest and so we are very excited to be um facilitating this investigation into artificial intelligence um so first of all so welcome pops it's good to see you it's been a long time yes absolutely can you share how old you are with the world i i know i look young but um i'm really 72. 70 to accept generations and we're going to talk about ai have you have you done any work with ai before not knowingly not knowingly what are some ways you think ai is like impacting your life right now the news in what way well i get my daily news brief and i notice that it's geared specifically to me so like the recommendations yeah the recommendation it's saying things like we think you'll like this we think you'll like that you know what you're exactly right any of those recommendations things like on netflix or spotify we think you'll like this we think you'll like that that's ai okay um so thank you so much for joining us here um and we know that you out there in the world are joining us as well we'd love to know where you're from there's a couple of ways you can tell us there's this link that you can go to code.org map and you can tell us where you're from and i think we're going to switch over and take a look at all the folks who are joining us right now we have over 400 viewers tuning in a look at all these people from all over not just the us all over the world wait down in antarctica we have someone who do you know in antarctica santa claus that's very true so we probably have antarctica on the screen we have the us i see i'm we're in arizona i live in tucson so i wonder if there's some arizona folks oh and i see people in the chat sharing where they're from thank you so much oh this is wonderful well we are going to go ahead and get started and so this week we're celebrating the hour of code which is when millions of students like yourselves are learning the basics of computer science and this event has passed over 1 billion student engagements did you know that 1 billion people that's crazy right yeah pretty amazing pretty amazing reaching students in every city around the world and so we are going to do a couple of things today we're going to train an ai to recognize different fish to help it clean up the ocean we're going to train an ai from our webcam in order to recognize sign language which is going to be really cool and we're talking about some strategies involving bias and harm to avoid those when we're working with artificial intelligence some really deep stuff going on wait so are we teaching the people about sign or are we teaching the fish we're going to teach well that's a good question here i can tell you exactly who we're going to teach okay so we're going to teach our friend ai bot right here this is a i bought floating in the world and his job is to clean up the ocean but ai bot has a problem you see so we're going to start with ourselves first all right so like because we have intelligence we have natural intelligence and one of the ways we know that is [Laughter] okay do i not always have natural no no no no no thank you so much so other things we can do this thing as human beings we can close our eyes and when i say the word fish i want you to think of the first thing that pops into your head and those of you participating as well in the chat i want you to try that too close your eyes and when i say the word fish type in the chat what type of fish do you see ready three two one fish what kind of fish did you see when you closed your eyes and thought of a fish soda fish you know one of those tropical fish with the the appendages that go up and down and and uh they look superfluous but they're not uh i guess they have some function you know it's beautiful but small very colorful with like the extra little like appendages and things there's like those deep sea fish that are all the way down to the ocean coral reef the coral reef fish see that's that's a fish when we think of it yes i thought of like nemo from finding nemo i thought of the little clownfish design but important thing is that we have these mental models for what a fish is and our ai bot does not have the same model he has no idea what a fish is so one of the first things that we need to do is give it a machine learning model just like we have a mental model it needs a machine learning model to know what a fish is so what do you think about this is that a fish yeah i think so too that's a fish what about this one uh yeah yeah what about this is that fish well as far as i know no i agree with you that is not a fish so we're going to say that this is not a fish now what about this no i think so too i'm going to kind of click through some others fish and not fish and what we're doing is we're giving ai bot these mental images we're letting it figure out what are the things that are fish versus not fish and it might start to notice some patterns it'll notice patterns with like how the the image is shaped it'll notice patterns with the colors it'll notice patterns with the features fish have eyes and mouth and trash does not and when we've done this for a while we can have aibot test out and see how it does based on this machine learning model that it's done you ready to see how it does yeah so this so what should it do with this this light bulb should keep it get rid of it get rid of it should get rid of it let's find out okay what right away it made a mistake well this is good though it's getting rid of that that's a fish that's a nope clearly we made some mistakes in here somewhere ai bot does not have a very clear mental model of what or rather a machine learning model of what a fish is versus not a fish we can even investigate a little bit and take a look at the things that ai bot has learned so ai bot thinks all of these things are fish and over here it thinks all of these things are not fish and so what's happened is aibot has noticed patterns it's noticed some commonalities it's maybe tried to figure out with its mental model what a fish is for example like most of these fish look round right yeah so i think that's why i thought the light bulb was the fish because light bubbles around my boat so how do you think we can fix this with ai bot how can we make sure that it doesn't make those same mistakes we need more fish examples we need more fish examples but isn't like there's more than just fish in the sea right yeah there's like seahorses and starfish even if we trained it to recognize all the fish wouldn't it still get rid of those other ocean creatures too i think that'd be like a problem i don't know so okay so with my ai experience i know but i'm sure that if you put enough information in it'll be able to discern the difference i agree with that enough and varied information it can figure it out that's like the key principle of ai look at you you can go apply for ai jobs now you can go work at like amazon or google or microsoft look at that so we have just trained this little ai bot in order to tell the difference between fish and not fish and it's built its own little machine learning model and this process where we gave it some data we let it train on itself and then we tested it to see how it does that's the really common process that happens with ai all the time if you wanted to play around and keep going with this little tutorial you can find all that information here at code.org oceans which is pretty cool but we're going to switch gears a little bit and we're going to go to a different program we're going to go to a program called teachable machine and the thing that teachable machine does which is really cool is instead of training images just on the fish on there we can have it train on our webcam up here okay so in order to do that if you decided to do this at home and you wanted to play around i would recommend just googling teachable machine which is a nice thing to do because google makes this program so then you'll find it really easy google will point you right there and so one thing that we can do is we can use our webcam to train things now i need to do something special that you won't have to do at home i need to turn off my video here so that i can turn on the webcam here and then you can see me on this website there we go we're right there see we're back yes we're back okay so we're gonna do now we're gonna do something that was inspired by an experience i had when i was still teaching and so when i was still teaching at the high school classroom we had a student enroll a couple of years ago and she was a deaf student and when she enrolled a lot of the students in our community started to realize there were some accessibility problems in our in terms of this person participating in high school and engaging in high school and being able to get the education they deserved and we started to realize that there's a lot of things about our environment that wasn't very inclusive to the deaf and hard of hearing community and so what the students did is they made a petition and they rallied the administration and they said hey instead of french and spanish and these other world languages you should offer american sign language too and they listened and they found a teacher and they started a program and now that school has a thriving american sign language program did you know that this is a true story no i didn't i know it's pretty cool right yeah so i was inspired by these students and i was really motivated to try and continue to build an inclusive community for the deaf and hard of hearing and i wanted to make something with ai that could recognize sign language because then i could help communicate with folks in the deaf and hard of hearing community so we're going to do we're going to use american sign language which is these features here and so you can use your hand to form different letters of the alphabet and we're going to spell the three letters e v and a so again we're gonna do e v and a do you know why we're gonna do eva it's my favorite word one of my favorite words why is it one of your favorite words uh your daughter i have a daughter named ava isn't that so cute we're going to teach you if there are any avas out there in the world this is for you same name as my daughter same name as lots of folks out here at code.org we're very excited so if i want to use this website to do that first i need to say i'm going to train this on the letter e oops and then down here i need to let it know i'm going to train on the letter v and then i need to add one more section to let it know i need to train on the letter a oops i misspelled something that's okay we all make mistakes cool eva so the way this works is we have to hold up our hands to represent the letter e so e was like this all right so i'm going to do it first you ready i'm going to use the same let's go ahead okay so i'm going to press and hold record i'm going to move this around a little bit and what's happening is this machine is learning i've given it 99 images all representing the letter e now i need to do the same thing with the letter v and so when this loads up okay are you ready yeah that's my big moment this is your big moment big moment folks all right so you're going to hold up the v you ready v there you go okay now there you go you kind of move it all over the place no not sideways that's your voguing now v for voguing okay there you go that's a good one right there okay great so we're moving in all those different places so it can learn that it's the v that's important and not all the other stuff that's going on now we're going to go down here to a and i'll do the a again so as i go to do this here is a and i have my a right over here and i've given it about a hundred images so i made sure that i've given it the same amount of training images i got 99 i got 120 i got 99 right here and now that i've trained it on all these images i can press this button and this is when it starts to do the work of training the machine of learning the differences between the e and the v in the a and so as it's going through and doing this i got to stay in this tab and it's going to click through and do these pieces i'm going to try and share my video again oh look at us over here on the side um in preparation for this i reached out to my old high school and i asked the american sign language club there to share some facts about the um deaf and hard of hearing community in asl i want to share some of them with you can i do that right ahead so did you know that 90 of deaf babies are born to hearing parents no i didn't know that either until they told me i was going to share some more i have a couple more that i'll share in a little bit but right now i want to go back to this and i want to test out this model that got trained so here we are right there okay so you see us here in the middle and then down here we have these predictions of what it's trying to do okay so i'm going to hold up this was e i'm going to do an e right here it's getting a little confused a little confused it keeps thinking that it's an a oh there we go so down here at the bottom it has these little percentages of what it's trying to predict why don't you try your v why don't you hold the v very strongly thinks it's a v you did a much better job of training than i did that probably because you moved it all around the place because i'm older it's because you just have more experience more wisens hopefully hopefully i think so too and then if i do the a out here there we go pretty strongly down here knows that it's an a down here i'm not sure what happened with the v i'm a little sad that the v didn't show maybe i'm like holding it the wrong way oh no well the e oh wait hold on come back into the picture a little bit because you were like oh see that makes a difference because it's learned that you're in the picture when i do the e and the v and the a i have a lot of troubles with some people um even though this is kind of a silly example where i can't tell the difference between an e and a v and an a sometimes artificial intelligence is used in things like facial recognition where telling the difference between one person or another it's not as silly as just these asl letters it can mean the difference for someone it can be very impactful for the people when it doesn't work as expected so we always want to be careful when we're doing things with artificial intelligence and things like image recognition to make sure we get the most accurate models possible when you follow along at home there's a couple of extra cool steps that you can do to make sure that you can share this out if you decide to make an app that uses eva or you decide to train on other asl symbols once you've done that you can go into this menu and click upload my model and when you do that it'll take a second but then you'll get this link here and when you get this link here one thing that you can do is you can copy and paste it into a new window and you'll get this other website that you can send to your friends and your family and you can use out in the world that has your same trained model in it down here so then if i wanted to there's your v why don't i try a it was over here a is working i don't know what happened with e oh wait e's a little bit i didn't maybe it's because like you know what it is i blame these guys that must be what it is ai isn't always perfect another cool thing that you can do with this same model as well is you can use a website called p5js and if you've done things with web design or web editing this is a way that you can import your model into this other website we can click on that top one there and if i press this play button right here it loads a website that i can also share with people that will also use our machine learning model you see how down here it says daytime yeah it's not what i want because it's using someone else's machine learning model so instead i'm going to go in here and i'm going to copy this line of code that has my model with it and i'm going to paste it right here instead and i'm gonna paste oh i lost paste where's paste i'll just use my keyboard for it instead and then i'm gonna stop and refresh the page and now if we did it correctly see letter v letter v then i'm gonna hold up the a letter a so if you were to do other sort of hour of code tutorials involving websites or things like that you can then build more out of this as well so cool we made an artificial intelligence machine learning model brave for ava um at this point actually i think what i'm going to do now is i'm going to jump ahead to this website i'm going to stop sharing my screen so that you all can see me on the big window here oops i didn't mean to do that i'm going to have to go back to the screen that i was at before there we go um one of the things that we're about to do now is we were going to have ava join us um but ava is asleep so you don't get to meet my baby i know so that's very sad we weren't going to wake her up just for code bites um but we were going to have her come and join us as well but in the meantime we have honored ava's memory and made her letters here if you wanted to look up other american sign language symbols and make your own app around it you can totally do that that just about wraps up our code byte episode so hopefully now you know a little bit more about artificial intelligence and the machine learning process where we gather data we train a model we test it out and if we had more time i would go back and retrain it because oh boy that e still isn't going very well do you learn some things about artificial intelligence i think so yeah what's like what's like your takeaway you're like your five word summary my five word summary sure oh gosh um um you're less than 10 words and that's in some word summary but you wanted a quick answer i don't know if i have a quick answer i'll come back to you okay um i want to share with you if you would like to learn more about artificial intelligence we've got this really awesome panel coming up that you can participate in tomorrow as well i've got a website for you that you can check out it's code.org slash ai and we have this ethics of ai panel that's happening tomorrow that you can participate in and so when you go to that website code.org ai you can see this ai for oceans you can learn more about that and help train the fish you can learn more about what's happening behind the scenes with this how ai works and we've got this awesome exploring the ethics of ai panel that happens tomorrow at 10 30 pacific and i think it's 1 30 eastern those are about those times which is pretty cool all right do you have your do you have your do you have your thoughts around artificial intelligence [Laughter] no i want to say that i'm suffering from a 72 year old sense of memory and uh you'd have to repeat the question again well hopefully advances in artificial intelligence can help with things like memory like those are some of the things that they're doing yeah definitely definitely i would need that you need like a little ai um you need a little ai assistant or something right right right well i am going to close out of these things really enjoyed my time with you all thank you all for coming go make some artificial intelligence machine learning apps go use them to improve the world around us and be careful with the data that you use thank you all so much what happened to the people who raised their hands
