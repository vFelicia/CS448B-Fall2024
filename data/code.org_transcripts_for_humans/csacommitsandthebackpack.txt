00:05 - software engineers commit code to create
00:07 - different versions of a program and save
00:09 - code that they want to reuse in a
00:11 - different program
00:12 - a commit is an individual change to a
00:15 - file or set of files
00:19 - commits help you keep track of the
00:20 - changes that you've made to your program
00:24 - to commit your code in java lab we click
00:26 - the commit code button
00:29 - then write a short description of the
00:31 - work you've done
00:34 - make sure that this note is helpful for
00:36 - yourself
00:37 - you want to remember in the future what
00:39 - code you wrote in this commit
00:42 - you can also save your code to the
00:44 - backpack
00:46 - the backpack saves entire classes so you
00:49 - can reuse them and other projects
00:53 - now that we've committed our code
00:55 - we can see our commit history by
00:57 - clicking on the version history
01:00 - if you ever wanted to see what your code
01:01 - looked like previously you can click on
01:03 - the preview button
01:06 - you can also restore your code by
01:09 - clicking the restore button
01:13 - finally you can import classes from the
01:15 - backpack
01:17 - when you click the backpack icon
01:20 - you can select the class you want to use
01:22 - and import it right into your program
01:26 - with commits and the backpack
01:28 - you have more tools to help you develop
01:30 - your software engineering skills
