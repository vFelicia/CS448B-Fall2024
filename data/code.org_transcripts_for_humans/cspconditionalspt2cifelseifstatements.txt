00:13 - where we want to check whether the
00:15 - highest reading you can go see alone is
00:17 - an r-rated movie
00:19 - a pg-13 movie or just a g-rated movie to
00:23 - check between these three different
00:24 - cases we can add an LC of statements an
00:28 - else--if statement is another condition
00:31 - that a program checks only if the
00:33 - previous if statements were false
00:35 - so if age is greater than or equal to 17
00:40 - right that user can see an r-rated movie
00:43 - alone else if the age is greater than or
00:47 - equal to 13 right that the user can see
00:50 - a pg-13 movie alone else right that the
00:55 - user can see a g-rated movie alone the
00:59 - elf condition becomes the default
01:00 - condition because when all the previous
01:03 - if an else if statements are false it
01:05 - will default to the else statement be
01:08 - careful as you can struck longer
01:10 - sequences of Alice if statements if you
01:12 - mix up the order you might not get the
01:15 - behavior you intended in our example
01:18 - imagine we had switched the code so that
01:20 - the first condition checked if the user
01:22 - was old enough to see pg-13 movies like
01:25 - this this would mean that everyone who
01:29 - is 13 or older would be told they can
01:32 - only see pg-13 movies even the adults
01:35 - and with the next elsif line the
01:38 - computer would be looking for people 17
01:40 - or older in the remaining group this
01:43 - code misses the adults because they were
01:45 - true in that first condition this won't
01:48 - work the computer checks the conditions
01:51 - from top to bottom so it is important to
01:54 - enter the most specific condition first
01:59 - [Music]
