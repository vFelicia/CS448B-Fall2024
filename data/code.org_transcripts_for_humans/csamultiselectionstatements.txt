00:00 - [Music]
00:10 - we have used one-way and two-way
00:12 - selection statements to check if one
00:14 - condition is true sometimes we need to
00:17 - check multiple conditions
00:19 - for example if the temperature is
00:21 - greater than 75 we turn on the ac
00:24 - if the temperature is less than 70 we
00:27 - turn on the heat
00:28 - otherwise we leave the thermostat alone
00:32 - we could write nested if statements to
00:34 - do this or we can use a multi-selection
00:36 - statement
00:38 - a multi-selection statement is a
00:40 - statement that selects a single action
00:43 - from three or more conditional
00:44 - statements based on which boolean
00:47 - expression is true
00:49 - in java we write multi-selection
00:51 - statements using
00:53 - if
00:54 - else if
00:55 - else
00:57 - we can specify the outcomes we want to
00:59 - happen and their conditions so our
01:01 - programs can make these decisions for us
01:05 - let's say we want to check if a number
01:06 - was positive negative or zero
01:10 - we can use a multi-selection statement
01:12 - to check each of these conditions
01:15 - first
01:16 - we start with the if statement
01:18 - [Music]
01:19 - our condition will check if a number is
01:21 - less than zero
01:23 - if it is less than zero we'll print
01:25 - number is negative
01:27 - to check the next condition we add an
01:29 - else if statement
01:31 - this condition will check if a number is
01:34 - greater than 0.
01:35 - if it is greater than 0 we print number
01:38 - is positive
01:39 - then we add the else statement
01:42 - this will print number is zero
01:45 - because none of the conditions were true
01:48 - now we have three different outcomes
01:49 - that can occur depending on which
01:51 - condition is true
01:53 - with a multi-selection statement each
01:55 - condition is checked from the top down
01:58 - if the first condition is true its block
02:00 - of code is executed and the rest of the
02:02 - conditions are ignored
02:04 - [Music]
02:06 - if the first condition is false
02:08 - the second condition is evaluated if it
02:11 - is true its block of code is executed
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - if none of the conditions are true then
02:18 - the final else statement will be
02:20 - executed
02:24 - you can have as many else if statements
02:26 - as you need for a program
02:29 - multi-selection statements are useful
02:31 - when we need to check multiple
02:32 - conditions to determine the specific
02:34 - task we want to execute
02:37 - they simplify our code making it easier
02:39 - to read and maintain

Cleaned transcript:

we have used oneway and twoway selection statements to check if one condition is true sometimes we need to check multiple conditions for example if the temperature is greater than 75 we turn on the ac if the temperature is less than 70 we turn on the heat otherwise we leave the thermostat alone we could write nested if statements to do this or we can use a multiselection statement a multiselection statement is a statement that selects a single action from three or more conditional statements based on which boolean expression is true in java we write multiselection statements using if else if else we can specify the outcomes we want to happen and their conditions so our programs can make these decisions for us let's say we want to check if a number was positive negative or zero we can use a multiselection statement to check each of these conditions first we start with the if statement our condition will check if a number is less than zero if it is less than zero we'll print number is negative to check the next condition we add an else if statement this condition will check if a number is greater than 0. if it is greater than 0 we print number is positive then we add the else statement this will print number is zero because none of the conditions were true now we have three different outcomes that can occur depending on which condition is true with a multiselection statement each condition is checked from the top down if the first condition is true its block of code is executed and the rest of the conditions are ignored if the first condition is false the second condition is evaluated if it is true its block of code is executed if none of the conditions are true then the final else statement will be executed you can have as many else if statements as you need for a program multiselection statements are useful when we need to check multiple conditions to determine the specific task we want to execute they simplify our code making it easier to read and maintain
