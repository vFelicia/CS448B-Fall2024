00:10 - let's say we're deciding whether we
00:12 - should have a picnic outside with
00:13 - friends or stay home and read a book we
00:16 - can have a picnic if it's sunny outside
00:20 - otherwise we'll stay home and read a
00:22 - book
00:22 - there's a special type of control
00:24 - structure to distinguish between these
00:26 - two different options it's called an
00:28 - if-else statement
00:30 - an if-else statement specifies a block
00:33 - of code to execute when a condition is
00:35 - true and a different block of code to
00:37 - execute when a condition is false
00:40 - if it is sunny we have our picnic
00:44 - else we stay home and read a book
00:47 - let's write an fl statement to help us
00:49 - decide what to do
00:52 - first we write the keyword if
00:54 - and an open set of parentheses
00:57 - this is just like the if statements
00:59 - we've written before
01:00 - to check if it's sunny let's call an is
01:04 - sunny method as our condition
01:06 - if it's sunny outside the condition
01:08 - returns true
01:10 - in the body of our statement we can
01:11 - write the code we want to execute if the
01:14 - condition is true
01:16 - let's add an else statement to determine
01:17 - what code to execute in case the
01:19 - condition is false
01:21 - in the body of the else let's put stay
01:24 - home
01:25 - if it's not sunny outside let's stay
01:27 - home and get comfy reading
01:29 - [Music]
01:32 - there is another way we can write this
01:34 - we can check if it's not sunny by using
01:37 - a logical operator
01:38 - a logical operator is an operator that
01:41 - returns a boolean value
01:43 - the not operator
01:45 - is a logical operator that returns true
01:48 - when the operand is false
01:50 - and returns false when the operand is
01:53 - true
01:55 - we will write using the not operator by
01:57 - using the exclamation point in front of
01:59 - the condition
02:01 - if it is not sunny outside we'll stay
02:04 - home
02:06 - else we'll have a picnic
02:09 - so
02:10 - if is sunny returns true
02:13 - the not operator makes the condition
02:14 - false
02:16 - if is sunny returns false the not
02:18 - operator makes the condition true
02:21 - we can check if a condition is true
02:22 - first or we can check if a condition is
02:25 - not true first
02:27 - both ways of writing this are correct
02:28 - solutions they do the exact same thing
02:32 - if else statements give us options
02:35 - we can choose to do a task if a
02:38 - condition is true and another task to do
02:40 - if the condition is false
02:42 - this provides more flexibility in our
02:44 - programs
02:46 - [Music]
02:54 - you
