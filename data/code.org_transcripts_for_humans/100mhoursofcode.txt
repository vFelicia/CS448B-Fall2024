week millions of students across the country
00:06 - will try their hand at an hour of computer
programming. The WHOLE school will be doing
00:11 - an Hour of Code!
00:16 - Take an hour to learn more
about the technology that touches every part
00:21 - of our lives. Computer science can unlock
the best opportunities in the world, no matter
00:28 - where you are. If you can change technology,
you can change the world. We've seen tens
00:34 - of millions of kids learn how to code. I'm
so excited that all of you are participating
00:38 - in the Hour of Code. On it's face, it looks
like it's this daunting, scary thing that
00:44 - you don't know how to do. But it can be learned.
The Hour of Code isn't just about one hour
00:49 - of one week, organizers are hoping it has
a more lasting effect by motivating schools
00:54 - to change what they teach in computer classes.
So your traditional computer class that teaches
00:59 - you just how to use technology is increasingly
irrelevant. Computer programming, computer
01:04 - science, and how to create technology, that's
what we need to be teaching our kids.
01:09 - In 2014 alone, 60 million students tried the Hour of Code
01:11 - 1 in 3 U.S. students have tried the Hour of Code
01:14 - Over 1 million girls and over
