00:05 - I'm Amara. I'm a student at Dartmouth
College and I love to code and dance.
00:10 - People always thought I was good with
technical stuff, with computers and
00:14 - phones and then I did Girls Who Code and
yeah seeing other girls interested
00:18 - and realizing that it was more accessible
than I think I thought was a good
00:22 - gateway into computer science.
00:26 - Welcome to Game Lab!
00:28 - Game Lab is a tool that let's you draw pictures, design animations, and build your own games with code.
00:34 - To create these animations and games you'll be
learning and using the programming language JavaScript.
00:40 - Game Lab is designed
with the beginning programmer in mind,
00:43 - but it also includes many powerful
features to help you bring your creations to life.
00:47 - Let's get started!
00:51 - In game lab, you can add lines of code to
00:53 - your programs by dragging blocks out
from the toolbox and snapping them together.
00:58 - Then click the 'Run' button to
see the result.
01:01 - The output of the program will show up on the left in the display area.
01:06 - If you prefer, you can also type the commands yourself.
01:09 - Either way, you write your code you can always flip between block mode and text mode.
01:14 - In fact, you can work in text mode and drag blocks out to insert the text.
01:19 - If you make an error, you can use the blocks as a way to check if it's the right command.
01:24 - If you want to
get rid of a line of code, just drag the
01:27 - block off the screen. You can also delete
it from the text.
01:32 - To start out, you'll be drawing with simple shapes like rectangles and ellipses.
01:37 - That's a fancy name for an oval.
01:39 - To change where shapes show up on the screen, you can change the numbers given to each command.
01:44 - The first two numbers set the position of the shape.
01:48 - The last two numbers change the size.
01:51 - Let's check out an example where we want
to move our rectangle down the screen
01:54 - and then make it wider.
01:57 - In Game Lab, the 'X'
and 'Y' position starts at the top left corner.
02:01 - If we want to move the rectangle down the screen, we actually need to increase the 'Y' value.
02:06 - To make the
rectangle wider, we'll also need to increase its width
02:11 - Learning how to use
new commands doesn't have to be trial and error.
02:14 - If you hover over any of the
blocks, you can read more about how to
02:18 - use it and see detailed examples of each
command.
02:22 - I don't know what I want to do after college, but I know that computer science will give me a lot of
02:26 - opportunities to work in many different
industries which is why I like it so much.
