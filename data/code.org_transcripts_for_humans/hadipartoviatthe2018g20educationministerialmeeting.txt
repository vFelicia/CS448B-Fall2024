00:00 - So to the G20 organizers, the Ministry of Education of Argentina, and all of the educators present,
00:06 - thank you for hosting me.
00:08 - It is a pleasure and honor to be here today.
00:10 - I would like to start my short presentation with a personal story.
00:14 - This is my story of growing up.
00:16 - That's a picture of me and my twin brother when we were young.
00:19 - We grew up and were born in Tehran in Iran
00:22 - and a few years after this photo was taken,
00:25 - our country broke out into a revolution in a bloody war with the neighboring country of Iraq.
00:30 - I spent most of my childhood in the basement of my house,
00:34 - hoping my home wouldn't get destroyed by bombs.
00:37 - But one day my father brought home a magical gift that changed my life.
00:42 - He gave me a Commodore 64 computer,
00:45 - but this wasn't the magical gift because it had no software, no apps, no games.
00:50 - The magical gift was a book, an introduction to computer programming.
00:54 - And by the time I was 12, 13 years old, I became really good at it.
00:59 - I came to the United States as an
immigrant,
01:01 - and by the age of 15, I was working at technology companies to help pay my way through school.
01:07 - And by the time I was 21, I graduated from Harvard as a computer scientist,
01:11 - and by age 30 I had sold my first company and was on to starting my second.
01:16 - I'm really an embodiment and a believer of the idea that the American Dream is a global idea about opportunity,
01:22 - that if you study hard and work hard, you can do whatever you want.
01:26 - But this idea is increasingly feeling like it doesn't work for everybody because of technology's impact on our workforce.
01:33 - We all see the projections about how the workforce is changing.
01:37 - Every year, more and more jobs are getting automated or impacted.
01:41 - Projections are that by the middle of the century,
01:43 - half of all jobs will be automated by
technology.
01:47 - The multi-trillion dollar question we need to answer is:
01:50 - what will the future be for these students?
01:52 - What work will they be able to have?
01:55 - Now we don't need a crystal ball to answer this question. We know the answer.
01:59 - If you look just 15 years back and compare to today,
02:02 - you see a dramatic increase in highly digital jobs,
02:06 - an increase in moderately digital jobs,
02:09 - and a rapid decline of non-digital jobs.
02:13 - Advanced computing skills are increasingly important across all industries, not just STEM fields.
02:21 - So what's the role of education in all this?
02:24 - When we gather together as educators, all the debates about the future of education talk about how we teach.
02:30 - How will we change to use technology in the classroom or do personalized education?
02:36 - We need to have a greater debate about what we teach.
02:41 - When we think about what we teach, what are the students learning?
02:44 - If you go to any school in 2018, most schools teach the same topics that they used to teach in 1918.
02:51 - In every school in the world, students spend six months of their life learning how to calculate this equation.
02:58 - Now, I'm not saying that math isn't important,
03:01 - and it's critical to understand division, to understand fractions, to understand algebra.
03:06 - But six months to learn how to do this,
03:08 - we did that because a hundred years ago, this was a critical, vocational skill.
03:13 - Hundreds, millions of jobs in accounting, finance, engineering required rote calculation.
03:20 - Many of the things we teach students today are preparing them for the jobs of the past, and we need to think ahead.
03:27 - In a world of today, students have to learn science.
03:30 - They learn about the digestive system,
03:33 - they learn about how electricity works,
03:35 - they learn Pythagorean theorem
03:37 - regardless of whether they want to become a surgeon, an electrician, or a mathematician.
03:43 - In the 21st century, it is just as important to teach a student how to create an algorithm, or how the internet works.
03:50 - In a world of rapidly advancing technological change,
03:54 - we need to teach students the ability to learn and adapt to new technology.
03:58 - Now, in all of your schools,
04:01 - every school in most countries has an ICT course,
04:04 - but most of these courses only teach students how to use technology,
04:08 - which, increasingly, young kids learn on their own.
04:11 - We need to teach students how to create technology, how to understand and harness technology.
04:17 - This is more important, and imagine what your children will be able to create if they learn this.
04:23 - Now, this is not about coding, even though my hat says "code."
04:27 - This is about computer science.
04:29 - Computer science is a field that includes computer programming, data science, networking, cyber security, robotics, machine learning.
04:38 - It is a full academic field that is changing our world and deserves to be a peer of biology, chemistry, and algebra
04:45 - as a part of the core curriculum in schools.
04:49 - Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science.
04:57 - But most schools don't teach computer science.
05:00 - So the question is, how can we change the global education system?
05:04 - It takes four steps.
05:06 - Step one to global change begins by inspiring students and teachers,
05:10 - and I hope that's something we can start today.
05:13 - 5 years ago we started a movement called the Hour of Code that has engaged 10% of all students in every country.
05:21 - Step 2 is changing policies to encourage or even require schools to offer computer science.
05:28 - This is something all the Ministries of Education in this room can do.
05:32 - Step 3 is to identify free online courses to make computer science accessible.
05:37 - Starting from block-based programming in first grade
05:41 - all the way to more advanced app creation and physical computing in secondary school.
05:46 - And step 4, possibly the hardest part, is workforce programs to retrain today's schoolteachers to become computer science teachers.
05:54 - We don't need to hire computer scientists or software engineers to teach this skill.
06:00 - We need to retrain our existing teachers.
06:03 - Now, I get asked all the time:
06:05 - Can today's public school teachers teach computer science?
06:09 - Now we've been doing this for 5 years in the United States,
06:11 - and from Code.org's work, we have that answer.
06:15 - In five years, we've prepared 80,000 new computer science teachers.
06:19 - And these teachers, thanks to their work --
06:22 - 1 out of every 4 students in the entire country is enrolled on Code.org,
06:27 - and the majority of them are young women and minorities.
06:30 - And what have we learned from this?
06:32 - There are three things we've learned.
06:34 - Number 1: Our studies show among participating schools there's a fivefold increase in students studying the field and passing university-level exams in the field.
06:45 - And a tenfold increase among underrepresented minorities.
06:48 - Number 2 is probably most interesting to people in this room.
06:52 - Resourceful teachers in our classrooms see a direct connection
06:56 - between increased teaching of coding and computer science to increased scores in reading, math, and science.
07:02 - We don't need to fight about reducing one thing to increase the other.
07:06 - When we teach computer science, we lift all boats.
07:09 - And number 3 -- this is nearest and dearest to my heart.
07:13 - The students themselves report that they enjoy their class in computer science more than the rest of school.
07:18 - 70% of them want to continue learning computer science after they graduate from secondary school.
07:26 - In the United States students now rank computer science their favorite subject behind only the arts.
07:32 - And that's because of its creativity,
07:34 - because in elementary school they're creating animations,
07:38 - by 7th grade they're creating their own games,
07:41 - by high school they're creating apps.
07:44 - Creativity is what drives us. Imagine what the students in your countries will create.
07:48 - In the words of the students themselves, one 7th grader wrote:
07:52 - "I loved it. It was fun, I want to do it over and over again because I enjoyed what I could do."
07:57 - "I enjoyed the interactivity and how it felt to control what happened, it felt really satisfying."
08:02 - "I wish we could do that every day."
08:05 - Imagine if students reacted that way about school.
08:08 - They want to do it every day. That is what is possible.
08:13 - Now, the movement to add computer science to schools is the most uncontroversial and fastest-growing movement in education.
08:21 - It's supported by all political parties, by business leaders and teacher unions alike,
08:27 - and this is a movement that started with the teachers.
08:29 - Individual teachers, now almost one million of them, have begun teaching computer science in their schools.
08:35 - They've changed curriculum in their own classrooms in their schools.
08:39 - Entire districts and regions have changed courses.
08:42 - In the United States 44 states have changed policies to embrace computer science.
08:47 - And globally, 25 countries have announced national plans to either expand computer science or add it to the core curriculum.
08:54 - Hopefully, Argentina is going to make this move next week, uh, knock on wood.
09:00 - But still, most schools don't teach computer science.
09:05 - This is a problem we'd like to change.
09:07 - I'm going to to back to my own personal story.
09:10 - When I moved to the United States, I was 12 years old, my family was poor,
09:15 - I was much poorer than the rest of the students in my classroom,
09:18 - I had trouble speaking the new language,
09:20 - I had a funny accent,
09:22 - and worst of all, I didn't know how to dress properly to make friends.
09:25 - [laughter]
09:26 - But what I did have is a really good ability to program a computer
09:30 - and a great handle on what became the most valued subject in the entire economy.
09:36 - And, as a result, I've actually built a life for myself far ahead of my dreams.
09:40 - So think about the students in your own countries --
09:42 - the ones who need the opportunity the most.
09:44 - Think about how work is changing in the next 20 years.
09:48 - A student that begins school today will be in the workforce 20, 30 years from now.
09:53 - The jobs of today are disappearing.
09:55 - To prepare them for the jobs of the future, we must teach computer science as part of the core curriculum.
10:01 - Thank you very much.
10:03 - [applause]

So to the G20 organizers, the Ministry of Education of Argentina, and all of the educators present, thank you for hosting me. It is a pleasure and honor to be here today.
