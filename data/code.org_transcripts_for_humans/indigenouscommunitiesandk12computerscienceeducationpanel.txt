With timestamps:

00:12 - all right so i think everyone's in from
00:14 - the waiting room uh i want to let
00:16 - everyone know right now that uh there is
00:19 - a group of folks from la that are taking
00:21 - part or in la that are taking part of c
00:23 - with cs edcon um so we have an in-person
00:27 - and a virtual audience here it's just
00:29 - everyone kind of knows what's going on
00:31 - um for those of you that are online if
00:34 - you
00:35 - or actually i'll add this to the chat
00:37 - for some instructions for how you may
00:38 - want to rename yourself to help us keep
00:41 - track of things
00:42 - um and are we all good to get going
00:49 - okay awesome um so hello everyone um
00:54 - we're
00:55 - welcome to our panel uh my name is ian
00:57 - her many horses i am the moderator i'm
00:59 - an assistant teaching professor at cu
01:01 - boulder
01:03 - and i focus on computer science ed and
01:06 - mathed and kind of the whole spectrum of
01:09 - uh
01:10 - things within education i work with
01:12 - pre-service teachers in my role at cu
01:15 - boulder but then also do you know uh pd
01:18 - support for practicing teachers and then
01:19 - work with k-12 students as well
01:22 - and i'm gonna let each of our panelists
01:24 - introduce themselves
01:26 - uh i see elizabeth first so maybe we
01:29 - could start off with you
01:31 - all right um hello everybody my name is
01:32 - elizabeth holm i'm the founder of sonak
01:35 - which is the sisterhood of native
01:37 - american coders
01:38 - but usually we just kind of shorten it
01:40 - to sonar because it's kind of a mouthful
01:42 - um
01:44 - yeah and uh i guess just kind of a
01:46 - little bit of background i've been
01:47 - coding and kind of been an advocate for
01:50 - uh women in stem for the past seven
01:52 - years um and
01:54 - yeah and i started sonar because i
01:57 - wanted to
01:58 - kind of connect my my passion with stem
02:01 - with my indigenous ancestry
02:03 - so that's just kind of a bit of
02:04 - background
02:09 - uh zoe would you mind going next
02:12 - um
02:16 - no islands nor scotland nor togo
02:34 - um is the mountain i grew up under waipa
02:38 - the river i grew up beside i'm from
02:41 - aotearoa new zealand my ancestors are
02:44 - from ireland scotland and togo i'm a
02:46 - tawiwi in aotearoa and i'm committed to
02:49 - the partnership of fertility of waitangi
02:52 - i'm the founder of omg tech and i
02:54 - acknowledge the tangata of the area that
02:56 - i'm on today
02:57 - um orangey tech is a charity in aotearoa
03:00 - new zealand that was established about
03:02 - seven years ago to ensure every child or
03:05 - young person gets access to the
03:07 - technology that shapes their future
03:09 - we have a focus on ensuring young people
03:12 - can think creatively critically
03:14 - computationally and culturally
03:17 - and we believe that exploring all of our
03:19 - own indigeneity is the key to a
03:22 - prosperous future for everybody
03:28 - thank you jen would you mind going next
03:30 - yes happy to hello everybody my name is
03:33 - jennifer flanagan i am joining from the
03:37 - traditional unseated territory of the
03:40 - algonquin people uh i also called ottawa
03:44 - uh ontario canada so the capital of
03:46 - canada
03:48 - and i'm the ceo of an organization
03:50 - called actua we are a national uh
03:54 - charitable organization that engages
03:56 - youth in building the skills and
03:57 - confidence they need to thrive
04:01 - in
04:01 - in stem but
04:03 - generally across the board we
04:05 - specifically focus on removing barriers
04:08 - that continue to exist for participation
04:10 - in these fields and our largest program
04:12 - is the work that we do in partnership
04:15 - with
04:16 - uh indigenous communities so first
04:17 - nations inuit and metis communities
04:20 - across
04:21 - canada so very happy to be here
04:27 - yes
04:28 - yeah you go for it
04:33 - so i just greeted you in my native
04:34 - language when you're back uh hey
04:36 - everyone my name is frida or you can
04:37 - call me nick
04:38 - which is my new black name i'm here on
04:41 - traditional territories of the sean and
04:43 - chichen yoloni people i'm going to go
04:45 - ahead and drop the shumi land tax link
04:47 - into the chat if you live in the bay
04:50 - area if you've been in the bay area you
04:51 - don't have to be in the bay area to
04:53 - support uh indigenous rematriation of
04:55 - the land so um that's one way to do it
04:58 - as an as an ally um
05:00 - so yeah i've been with the k-port center
05:02 - for
05:03 - nearly seven years it'd be seven years
05:04 - in january and uh for the past two of
05:07 - them have been co-leading a project with
05:09 - the american indian science and
05:10 - engineering society
05:12 - similar to elizabeth i've been working
05:14 - with native girls in computing the
05:17 - model's slightly different we're working
05:19 - to bring in culturally revitalizing
05:22 - computing education curricula into
05:24 - native serving schools designed
05:25 - specifically to engage native girls um
05:28 - and i came to that work because um i did
05:30 - my cs and bachelor's
05:32 - my bachelor's in cs and it was as a
05:34 - native american woman as a native
05:35 - alaskan woman it was so challenging in
05:38 - so many different ways and so to
05:40 - understand that i started to work on
05:43 - better representation for
05:44 - black and other indigenous people and
05:46 - women in stem and mcs
05:52 - all right thank you all
05:54 - um so we'll get into our first question
05:56 - uh quick reminder the goal is three
05:59 - minutes a piece and we'll kind of round
06:02 - robin it
06:03 - so the first question is in your
06:04 - experience what has been the biggest
06:07 - challenge of doing cs ed work with and
06:10 - or in indigenous communities
06:14 - and i'll throw that in the chat as well
06:16 - to help you
06:22 - anybody like to take that on first
06:28 - i'm happy to go first if you want
06:31 - awesome thank you
06:33 - uh great so um
06:36 - from uh and obviously speaking from a
06:38 - canadian context um you know we we've
06:41 - got two uh pretty significant
06:44 - challenges i mean many challenges but
06:46 - two in particular that i'm going to
06:48 - speak about one is this that i think
06:49 - will be very common among panelists and
06:52 - certainly understood among among the
06:54 - audience which is just a
06:55 - a significant and growing digital divide
06:58 - so you know straight up access
07:01 - we know that you know the the access to
07:04 - the internet is it's been designated by
07:06 - the un as a human right
07:08 - um and you know canada is obviously a
07:10 - very super developed country but we
07:13 - still have massive access issues so
07:15 - rural remote communities only about half
07:18 - have
07:19 - actual access to
07:21 - um high-speed broadband and in our
07:24 - indigenous communities across the
07:26 - country about three-quarters of them
07:28 - don't have access to a reliable internet
07:32 - so that's just internet access then
07:33 - technology and hardware is is a whole
07:35 - other
07:37 - whole other
07:38 - challenge so one that we
07:41 - kind of work around so we do a lot of
07:43 - unplugged activities in in computer
07:45 - science
07:46 - and through the pandemic this has been
07:49 - massively exacerbated because of the
07:51 - challenges of connecting to communities
07:53 - that we normally connect with face to
07:55 - face to do this content where we bring
07:57 - in technology
07:58 - um really not being able to do that the
08:00 - other piece is around
08:02 - um the cultural uh divide and the in the
08:05 - the the ongoing focus which is still
08:07 - important on access and
08:09 - um and physical infrastructure which is
08:11 - needed but uh a real lack of focus on
08:15 - uh you know how we build from the very
08:18 - core
08:19 - build in indigenous perspective and
08:21 - leadership in how
08:23 - content and
08:25 - computing systems are actually
08:28 - designed so a big um
08:31 - part of the work that we're doing is
08:32 - really to
08:34 - uh create a platform and space for um
08:38 - you know changing the way that cs
08:40 - education has developed so that the
08:42 - unique and critical perspectives of of
08:45 - indigenous people are uh brought into it
08:48 - many of the indigenous communities we
08:50 - work with are
08:52 - um
08:53 - uh
08:54 - you know nervous or uh kind of resisting
08:57 - in terms of the the digital
08:59 - um
09:00 - evolution and and for good reason
09:02 - because they don't see themselves in it
09:04 - and and certainly from a youth
09:05 - perspective they're uh in canada anyway
09:08 - there's a huge focus on revitalizing and
09:10 - maintaining and celebrating traditional
09:13 - culture and language um so that that's a
09:15 - big um a big gap that we're also uh
09:18 - working very actively to to address
09:22 - through the way that we incorporate
09:24 - multiple world views in the programming
09:25 - that we deliver
09:27 - i'll leave it there
09:32 - thank you would anybody else like to
09:34 - jump in again the the question is in
09:36 - your experience what has been the
09:37 - biggest challenge of doing cs ed work
09:39 - with and or in indigenous communities
09:44 - um i can hop in next if you like
09:47 - um and apologies my my voice is a little
09:49 - bit uh shaky because we're a little
09:51 - under the weather right now but
09:53 - um yeah so i guess one of the um the big
09:56 - issues is
09:57 - having kind of a concentrated um
10:00 - initial interest in
10:03 - so
10:04 - you know there's obviously two formats
10:06 - of in person and online or like a resume
10:09 - um
10:10 - and sonar personally um so we teach
10:13 - indigenous girls um around the country
10:15 - how to code and we are an online based
10:16 - uh platform um
10:19 - but
10:19 - uh what we found is that there's
10:22 - there's there's quite a diverse um
10:25 - kind of range of uh girls from um you
10:29 - know they're from a bunch of different
10:30 - tribes um but that also uh kind of shows
10:33 - us that there's not a lot of um
10:36 - you know there's not a concentrated
10:38 - interest in cs um
10:40 - uh in you know one specific area or
10:42 - tribe it can be maybe one to two girls
10:44 - per area um
10:47 - and i think
10:48 - for cs programs um
10:50 - in general i think it's really important
10:52 - to have a
10:54 - um
10:55 - kind of that in person connection and be
10:57 - coding alongside other girls that's kind
11:00 - of like what makes it engaging and fun
11:02 - um
11:03 - but i think on with the online platform
11:06 - it can be a little bit tough to do that
11:08 - um but you kind of have to to strike a
11:10 - balance between um having that that more
11:13 - engaging in-person program um and like
11:16 - kind of working with your peers um but
11:18 - also native communities usually don't
11:20 - have enough interest to make a
11:21 - substantial program within one area or
11:25 - tribe
11:26 - um
11:26 - so i feel like that's something that
11:28 - we've
11:29 - kind of uh we've overcome with the
11:32 - online format um bringing together girls
11:34 - onto a virtual space but
11:36 - it's been definitely hard to um
11:39 - kind of have that that
11:41 - connection that you usually would um
11:43 - with a traditional
11:45 - kind of cs or stem program
11:48 - where they're doing projects together
11:50 - working alongside each other and kind of
11:52 - um helping each other out and making
11:54 - those those computer science triumphs
11:56 - together
11:57 - um
11:58 - yeah so it can definitely be a
12:00 - tough balance
12:01 - between
12:02 - uh
12:03 - the the group work and that kind of
12:05 - collaboration um and also
12:08 - kind of bringing together um native
12:10 - communities but
12:12 - um yeah
12:16 - i'm gonna go ahead and jump in and
12:17 - piggyback off of what has already been
12:19 - said just from like a very basic like
12:21 - native perspective
12:23 - i feel like native communities are still
12:26 - undergoing quite a lot of genocide and
12:27 - that's not something i'm sure that's new
12:29 - to the native folks here but
12:31 - that's not the narrative that's
12:32 - discussed in education often
12:35 - so what i tend to talk about is that my
12:37 - mother was a boarding school survivor um
12:39 - this is something that you know impacted
12:41 - her life um and and lifespan and has
12:43 - impacted me as intergenerational trauma
12:46 - um so we don't often like see education
12:48 - in schooling as part of that narrative
12:50 - of colonization um and so we're tending
12:52 - to couch it in different terms right you
12:54 - know you can hear terms about a cultural
12:56 - difference or um you know this kind of
12:58 - lack of access of things which is true
13:01 - um but seeing from a native perspective
13:03 - these are all parts of the ways that
13:05 - we're still enduring under difficult
13:08 - conditions right under conditions of
13:09 - colonization so
13:11 - um you know that can be
13:12 - some of our school sites have had you
13:14 - know issues like uh environmental
13:16 - disasters you know over this past year
13:19 - um you know fires when there shouldn't
13:20 - be fires or floods when they're normally
13:22 - not floods um you know tornadoes um that
13:25 - they've never had so you know they're
13:27 - they're going through a lot just on a
13:28 - physical level even um that's disrupting
13:31 - a lot of their school life as well
13:33 - and just their their family structure um
13:35 - so so that's part of it i think the
13:37 - cultural part that um elizabeth and jen
13:39 - talked about i mean i think the the
13:41 - thing that we're seeing um on the ground
13:43 - with the schools that we're working with
13:45 - is that there's a huge interest on the
13:48 - part of the native students to connect
13:50 - with their traditional cultures and
13:52 - again school has often been the opposite
13:54 - experience for them right of being
13:56 - acculturated and assimilated into
13:58 - different disciplines that are
14:00 - led by uh by white folks but
14:03 - here we're trying to try to try to
14:04 - integrate uh traditional knowledges on a
14:07 - tri-by-tribe basis
14:09 - um into computing curricula and that
14:12 - means working much more closely with the
14:13 - tribe and understanding their concerns
14:15 - their desires for their kids their their
14:17 - young people um what do they want to see
14:19 - for their future um and how do they want
14:21 - to see them in the world so
14:23 - it's a very different approach and i
14:25 - think um you know really tries to to get
14:27 - to grips with this reversing this um the
14:30 - colonization aspect of school trying to
14:32 - at least get at some of that um you
14:35 - can't completely in a goal setting
14:36 - probably for lots of reasons but
14:38 - trying at least to bring back language
14:40 - bring back traditions in some cases you
14:42 - know the tribes were working with were
14:44 - matriarchies originally before
14:46 - colonization right so working with
14:48 - native girls um is is a part of that
14:50 - focus of well this is actually a
14:52 - traditional part of your tribe in some
14:54 - cases um so yeah this is these are some
14:57 - of the things that we're trying to bring
14:58 - into the work but i appreciate all that
15:00 - everyone said it's it's definitely i'm
15:01 - just trying to frame it in a way i think
15:03 - if there are any native folks on the
15:04 - call um joining us today that that
15:06 - they'll maybe understand a little bit of
15:08 - what what we're trying to do
15:15 - zoe go ahead and jump in
15:17 - okay yeah so just to um total call that
15:20 - um
15:22 - for us and aotearoa the biggest problem
15:24 - of cs education is that it's a microcosm
15:28 - of the biggest problem in general
15:29 - education and that is our education
15:32 - systems are incredibly colonized and
15:36 - until we and you can't just think around
15:38 - the edges and change a few things 90
15:41 - percent of our indigenous and young
15:43 - people go to school in mainstream
15:45 - schools so we have
15:47 - maori um kotakobapa which are incredible
15:51 - places of learning but the majority of
15:53 - our indigenous young people don't get to
15:56 - have that kind of education and so until
15:59 - we
16:00 - really look at not just culturally
16:02 - responsive practice in education but
16:04 - culturally sustaining where our young
16:06 - people have success as maori
16:09 - um
16:10 - themselves and that's not success maori
16:12 - being successful at success as maori
16:14 - success as samoan is tongan in these
16:16 - spaces and our
16:18 - teaching workforce is on a really big
16:21 - journey and we're very fortunate in
16:23 - aotearoa that um our ministry of
16:25 - education has recognized this and is
16:28 - putting focus into it but it's a really
16:30 - big thing to look at and face into all
16:34 - of our own unconscious biases how that
16:37 - plays out and what we value in education
16:41 - and there's a really cool
16:43 - bit of work by dr ann milne who is a
16:46 - lead educator in aotearoa around
16:49 - coloring in the white spaces and she's
16:51 - got a one for digital that looks at
16:53 - coloring in your digital white spaces
16:56 - which is a training course to make you
16:58 - really face
16:59 - into
17:00 - how much your whole school the way that
17:03 - your website looks the way everything
17:05 - looks is
17:06 - recolonizing our students
17:09 - and
17:10 - so for us the biggest challenge is just
17:13 - the biggest educational challenge how do
17:15 - we ensure that everything we're doing
17:17 - isn't recolonizing and doing more harm
17:20 - how are we
17:22 - from
17:23 - um how we've been critical of ourselves
17:25 - and our teaching and we work with a
17:27 - large percentage of schools in our
17:29 - theater i'm looking at that question
17:31 - looking at
17:32 - how do we all continue to um
17:35 - because it has to be the mainstream and
17:38 - we can't just
17:39 - we can't just tinker and create little
17:41 - bits here anymore because it's about
17:43 - every young person
17:45 - um yeah so i think that would be
17:48 - for us the biggest challenge in cs
17:50 - biggest challenge in everything
17:54 - if i could also just jump in um
17:56 - i feel like
17:57 - a really important part of designing the
17:59 - cs curriculum or stem curriculum
18:02 - is to incorporate that
18:04 - indigenous kind of heritage and culture
18:07 - into it um you know it could be
18:09 - something as small as using an
18:11 - indigenous word as an example um like if
18:14 - you're if you just have to plug in some
18:15 - random word um it could be some
18:17 - indigenous word um
18:19 - but i think
18:20 - yeah
18:21 - a really important part of kind of
18:23 - maintaining that heritage is kind of a
18:27 - an easy integration between um
18:30 - between the like kind of indigenous side
18:32 - and the stem side because they don't
18:34 - they don't have to be separate um and
18:36 - uh in doing that you can kind of show
18:38 - them how they can apply
18:40 - uh what they're learning in cs or stem
18:43 - backed into their communities and kind
18:45 - of connecting it back to their own their
18:47 - own heritage
18:53 - thank you all i'm gonna try to
18:56 - pull us up now from here where like
18:58 - challenges are daunting in a way but
19:01 - that we have to have successes that come
19:03 - out of these right and we're working
19:04 - within these systems and you know there
19:07 - are bright shining lights so
19:09 - what has been the greatest success you
19:11 - have seen either in your own
19:12 - organization's work
19:14 - or in the larger work with cs education
19:16 - in indigenous communities
19:21 - anybody that wants to jump in
19:24 - i can't i could go first again
19:27 - um okay i love what what all the other
19:30 - panelists said so much and and
19:33 - just in canada for example um
19:36 - you know we're working on a massive we
19:40 - canada is working on a massive
19:42 - reconciliation um
19:45 - priority or focus it's a huge as it is
19:47 - in other jurisdictions in the world a
19:49 - huge uh topic of conversation and energy
19:52 - and momentum
19:54 - and we specifically
19:57 - design and build our work around the
19:59 - recommendations that came out of
20:02 - a large commission called the truth and
20:04 - reconciliation commission there were
20:06 - over 90 calls to action for the
20:08 - government
20:09 - to to take on and a
20:11 - section of that was around education and
20:13 - language preservation um and so we
20:16 - worked directly under the direction of
20:18 - of
20:19 - leaders um in this country we also sort
20:22 - of work at both ends of some of my
20:24 - colleagues on the panel have spoken
20:26 - about we take the view of one kid at a
20:29 - time one child at a time because it's
20:31 - overwhelming there's so so much work to
20:33 - do but
20:34 - one child at a time but also how do we
20:37 - change the system we can't do the work
20:39 - unless we're working as well on the
20:41 - system we also as an organization
20:44 - can't do the work unless we as an
20:46 - organization walk the reconciliation
20:49 - talk ourselves so that means
20:52 - in you know significant indigenous
20:53 - representation from our board to our
20:56 - staff to the people that we work with on
20:58 - the ground to the companies that we work
21:00 - with so
21:01 - our programs are all led by
21:04 - indigenous
21:07 - undergraduate students across the
21:09 - country so that has been a huge success
21:12 - for us because it is there's a huge
21:14 - amount of competition for those students
21:16 - um
21:17 - and um so we have been able to engage a
21:20 - lot of them in the delivery of these
21:22 - programs um
21:24 - and
21:25 - we've been doing this work for
21:27 - goodness since i was in undergraduate
21:29 - like 25 years ago
21:32 - and
21:33 - what our goal is is to build a continuum
21:35 - of support for these youth so they might
21:38 - see a workshop in a school they might
21:40 - have a
21:41 - summer program in digital skills and
21:43 - stem in their community
21:45 - then they have the opportunity to see us
21:47 - again at school they then as they get
21:50 - older can become
21:52 - an instructor or a volunteer in one of
21:54 - our programs and we're now actually
21:56 - taking that a step further where um
21:58 - we're doing land-based
22:00 - programming it's a huge area of focus
22:03 - for us so actually um taking our our
22:05 - content and
22:07 - going out with youth uh for 15 days it's
22:10 - just an example
22:12 - where youth are getting high school
22:14 - credits so they're actually getting
22:16 - formal school credits
22:18 - they are being paid
22:20 - to then kind of mentor and do the work
22:23 - with younger youth they're getting
22:24 - leadership training
22:26 - and then the step after that is that we
22:28 - actually work to get them internships uh
22:30 - like work integrated learning type
22:32 - things so that could be with a
22:33 - corporation that they're interested in
22:35 - that could be with a local
22:36 - community-based organization
22:38 - so it's recognizing that you know we we
22:41 - do if we want to see the kind of systems
22:43 - change that we're out for have to
22:45 - provide that support along the way
22:48 - and all of it
22:49 - all of it is at the direction and design
22:52 - of
22:53 - our indigenous partners and our
22:54 - indigenous staff so it we're changing
22:57 - the system as we deliver the programming
22:59 - on the ground
23:05 - thank you uh who would like to go in
23:08 - next in terms of sharing uh greatest
23:10 - success or positive things you're seeing
23:12 - in cs and indigenous communities
23:18 - i'll just add one tiny thing i think um
23:22 - yeah i mean we we
23:24 - we definitely it's been challenging
23:26 - getting this started over the pandemic
23:28 - um but i would say that something that
23:30 - gives me a lot of heart is
23:32 - part of part of the challenge of the
23:34 - pandemic has been that students were
23:36 - working at home the first year
23:39 - um and so all of our classes were
23:40 - virtual and
23:42 - you know they we had to send kits
23:43 - individually home for them to work on on
23:46 - their cs projects
23:47 - but one of the beauty
23:49 - points of that was that they actually
23:51 - had a chance to show their relatives and
23:53 - often it lived in intergenerational
23:55 - households so it was like aunties and
23:57 - grandparents also seeing what they could
24:00 - do with these led light strips they got
24:02 - to play with or make bead work on or you
24:04 - know had had their culturally you know
24:06 - at the time we were using the culturally
24:08 - relevant model of curriculum development
24:11 - not culturally revitalizing um but yes
24:13 - they they enjoyed showing um off what
24:16 - they could do and and
24:19 - one student in a sharing circle we had
24:21 - on the site um the end of last year had
24:23 - said that
24:24 - when he was you know doing his project
24:27 - in his room or you know out in the
24:28 - living room somebody came by his you
24:31 - know his auntie came by and said you
24:33 - know what are you doing and watched him
24:35 - do his thing watch the lights blink and
24:37 - flash and and how he was explaining you
24:39 - know how it worked
24:41 - and um she just looked at him and said
24:44 - yeah good
24:45 - make it think like an apache you know
24:47 - like make that computer think like an
24:49 - apache and that was such a beautiful
24:51 - moment for us as a team because we
24:54 - realized that you know this is an
24:56 - opportunity for
24:57 - um for elders for for uh family members
25:00 - for parents uh for intergenerational
25:02 - learning to happen for younger siblings
25:04 - um to get a chance to be exposed to this
25:06 - at the same time and it's a more sort of
25:08 - community wide effect than we would have
25:10 - seen otherwise um so really appreciated
25:14 - that comment from that auntie um
25:17 - and
25:18 - also just the vision that it gave us
25:20 - right the sort of alignment it gave us
25:22 - about what we were trying to do right in
25:23 - terms of what elizabeth was talking
25:25 - about and and others here talking about
25:27 - using indigenous languages and coding um
25:29 - you know there's no need for it to be in
25:31 - english right it comes down to binary
25:33 - code at the end of the day so
25:34 - um you know coding in their language
25:37 - things like that that they can show
25:38 - others um
25:39 - that they're learning how to do two
25:41 - things at the same time makes makes
25:43 - their families incredibly proud
25:49 - yeah thank you i like that that is a
25:51 - particular challenge right where there's
25:53 - you know there's not a lot of visibility
25:55 - of computer science within the
25:56 - communities right there's a recognition
25:58 - that it's important and we want students
26:00 - to expose it but raising that level of
26:02 - understanding across the entire
26:04 - community is
26:05 - always a challenge
26:07 - um and so yeah the little blessing
26:10 - underneath the mess of the pandemic
26:12 - there
26:15 - uh zoey elizabeth uh
26:17 - greatest things you you've seen going on
26:19 - successes
26:21 - i see you muted go ahead
26:23 - um so
26:24 - in aotearoa one of the biggest successes
26:27 - generally has been around language
26:29 - revitalization as a tool for cultural
26:31 - revitalization so
26:33 - um the maori
26:35 - people of aotearoa almost lost their
26:38 - language completely and there was a big
26:41 - effort generally for language
26:42 - revitalization and the 80s that was
26:44 - really flourishing now
26:46 - a lot of work we do
26:49 - feeds onto that that freda was just
26:51 - talking about that the computers don't
26:53 - speak english computers speak binary and
26:56 - we speak english to computers
26:58 - and that um
27:00 - there's an awful lot of ideas that
27:03 - cannot be translated into english
27:05 - because they just don't exist in it
27:07 - particularly coming from our indigenous
27:09 - people
27:10 - and
27:11 - so we do a lot of work um around
27:13 - identity and computing
27:15 - around being really critical of what
27:17 - you're being served up in a digital
27:19 - space and when you're creating with
27:21 - technology
27:22 - and we have an indigenous game design
27:24 - course that unpacks the values that
27:27 - exist in technology we find that really
27:29 - successful with young people using
27:31 - gaming as a tool to look at the fact
27:34 - that technology is not valueless it's
27:37 - not this cold artifact that it has and
27:39 - represents the values of the people that
27:41 - created it
27:43 - and so for our wider whanau mindset we
27:47 - talk a lot about
27:48 - whose values do you want represented and
27:52 - the things that are controlling our
27:53 - future so i'm looking at how our health
27:56 - care system will work as technology
27:59 - comes into it more and more as our
28:01 - democracy works and then
28:03 - where do these value systems come from
28:06 - and often we talk about the difference
28:08 - between american
28:10 - values and the private health care
28:12 - sector versus aotearoa where we have a
28:14 - public health care sector and what's
28:16 - that robot that's caring for your auntie
28:19 - or your um grandma going to look like
28:22 - and how is it going to interact because
28:24 - like you said like give it an apache
28:26 - mindset give it a pacific mindset
28:29 - because they're very different and the
28:31 - idea of what that technology should do
28:34 - is comes from a different place
28:36 - and
28:37 - so we've found a lot of success in
28:41 - helping our indigenous communities
28:44 - really understand they can they can
28:46 - change technology
28:48 - to be representative of themselves and
28:51 - the first stage of that has been around
28:54 - that deconstruction
28:56 - of it and being able to say
28:58 - for our particularly for our young
29:00 - people they hop into these video games
29:02 - that fortnight what are the values
29:04 - represented in that and how do they
29:06 - align to who you are and are you
29:08 - becoming a different person in the
29:09 - digital world from who you are
29:12 - and how would you fix that like what
29:14 - would you do instead and so our young
29:16 - people create the most incredible
29:18 - um games in the world they're just super
29:21 - cool
29:22 - because they're representative and
29:23 - they're being allowed to represent
29:25 - themselves and then the other side of
29:27 - that is around the resource creation
29:30 - um and we've heard lots of people
29:32 - mention it so we've done a lot of work
29:33 - as the code or partner in aotearoa and
29:36 - working alongside microsoft for years to
29:38 - translate the hour of code site into
29:41 - today maori we believe that for our
29:43 - young people their first experience
29:45 - coding should be in their indigenous
29:47 - language this year we're going to be
29:50 - translating into some of our pacifica
29:51 - languages
29:53 - as well because
29:54 - that also allows them to take that back
29:57 - into their homes for their aunties and
29:59 - their parents and their grandparents who
30:01 - have these
30:02 - traditional who speak first language and
30:05 - indigenous languages and so then they
30:08 - can share in that because it's quite a
30:09 - big gap that whanau connection to
30:12 - technology can be very big
30:14 - so that's kind of where our biggest
30:16 - success has been and is really just that
30:19 - helping our young people
30:20 - be critical of the technology that
30:22 - they're served up and create better
30:24 - solutions
30:30 - thank you i
30:31 - really
30:32 - i like the idea of like your first
30:33 - experience should be something that is
30:35 - of you right something where where you
30:38 - come from right this can be part of you
30:40 - uh awesome
30:42 - uh elizabeth uh would you like to share
30:44 - a great success you're seeing within
30:46 - your work or in other's work that you're
30:48 - noticing
30:49 - yeah sure
30:50 - um i mean i think uh jen might have
30:52 - mentioned um kind of looking at things
30:54 - on an individual level
30:56 - um like
30:58 - each individual um girl i think
31:01 - one of the the greatest successes or i
31:04 - guess the most rewarding moments is um
31:06 - when you see that kind of that moment of
31:08 - switch um in the girls when their eyes
31:11 - just light up um and
31:13 - they see
31:14 - uh the code running and doing that kind
31:17 - of computer magic
31:19 - right before their eyes
31:20 - i think um they kind of they have this
31:22 - moment of um like i did that i'm smart
31:26 - i'm capable i'm a coder um and i think
31:29 - that moment is really just it's what all
31:32 - coders live for but i think like
31:34 - particularly as an educator that
31:37 - is just such a rewarding moment um
31:40 - and i think to be able to create that
31:43 - moment in as many girls as possible is
31:45 - really the goal of um of sonic and other
31:49 - you know kind of cs education
31:51 - programs
31:52 - um
31:53 - i think
31:54 - through sonak we've been able to
31:56 - genuinely change some girls outlook on
31:58 - stem
32:00 - and with even just one girl we can kind
32:03 - of start a chain of the next generation
32:05 - of indigenous female innovators in stem
32:08 - so i feel like
32:09 - even though it seems small to to change
32:12 - just one girl's mindset you know they're
32:14 - gonna pass that on to their little
32:15 - sister or their friend um or when they
32:18 - get older maybe they'll start a program
32:20 - kind of similar to sonak um to spread
32:22 - their their passion so i think
32:24 - um those those individual sparks they
32:26 - seem sometimes you know they seem a
32:29 - little bit
32:31 - on a smaller scale but they can really
32:34 - start a wildfire um and i think that's
32:38 - probably one of the the biggest impacts
32:39 - that we can have
32:43 - yeah like
32:44 - we in like these very formal informal
32:46 - roles right but in some way where we're
32:48 - separated right and that peer support or
32:51 - that peer guidance and like what could
32:53 - this mean for you my friend or my cousin
32:56 - or whoever uh is just so powerful and we
33:00 - just we just can't speak and have those
33:02 - conversations in the positions that
33:04 - we're in in a lot of times um
33:07 - yeah so incredibly powerful
33:09 - uh
33:10 - okay so i want to we're we're gonna jen
33:13 - do you have a comment oh i just wanted
33:14 - to say one more thing that is kind of
33:16 - like that in terms of sparks like one of
33:18 - the
33:19 - the most amazing things that happened
33:22 - and this is pre-pandemic we'll get back
33:24 - this summer i hope but
33:26 - um we deliver uh programming with the 24
33:31 - communities across nunavut which is one
33:33 - of our northern arctic territories
33:36 - um with inuit uh people and
33:40 - we it's delivered completely and
33:42 - inducted to it or it's delivered in
33:44 - english but translated completely and
33:46 - enough to it as well some of the kids
33:47 - understand some of them are just
33:48 - learning some of them don't understand
33:50 - it all but they're you know they're
33:51 - they're getting there and we always have
33:54 - local elders engaged in our programs and
33:56 - for the last few years
33:58 - um
33:59 - we have had like the most incredible
34:01 - experiences having
34:03 - elders become so engaged in the content
34:08 - and in fact as they're doing it are kind
34:11 - of co-teaching so they're they're taking
34:13 - the you know the cultural lessons and
34:16 - sort of laying those on top of the work
34:18 - that our team is is delivering
34:21 - around stem or around you know digital
34:23 - skills um and it's just it's incredibly
34:27 - it's incredibly powerful but it is just
34:30 - uh it to me one of the biggest things
34:32 - that we need to
34:33 - continue to facilitate is that
34:36 - intergenerational multi-generational uh
34:38 - experience and where we just
34:41 - sort of create the space and
34:44 - um
34:45 - you know the the rest happens at at the
34:47 - community level
34:51 - yeah community is a driving thing here
34:54 - right like you get the community on
34:55 - board and it becomes part of them
34:58 - um
35:00 - thank you all i'm going to transition us
35:02 - to questions now uh i'm going to first
35:05 - pivot to the people in the room at cs
35:07 - edcon uh are there any questions from
35:10 - that space
35:14 - you all hear us still
35:16 - yes very clear
35:23 - one second
35:31 - my question is is is there any
35:33 - organization organization out there that
35:36 - is working with the tribal elders
35:38 - getting their input or the tribal
35:40 - leaders
35:41 - um i know there's a lot of work at the
35:43 - school level but i think
35:45 - there'd be more success if
35:47 - the elders were included
35:50 - in a lot of these decisions
35:56 - yeah
35:59 - yeah i mean that's a little bit what i
36:01 - was alluding to when we talked about
36:03 - cultural revitalization you can't do
36:04 - that without elders and culture bearers
36:06 - and language bearers
36:08 - um and i think they they play a critical
36:10 - role in and part of what we're trying to
36:12 - do here what some of us have talked
36:14 - about just building
36:16 - something new in place of colonial
36:17 - education
36:18 - [Music]
36:19 - um something more holistic
36:21 - community-based indigenous center and
36:23 - indigenous world view center
36:25 - and so yeah that's definitely what
36:27 - cultural revitalization has brought
36:29 - brought to my program
36:31 - um is more work with the folks who
36:35 - immediately when you meet them they want
36:36 - to tell you stories
36:38 - immediately when you meet them they're
36:39 - you know they're excited because we're
36:41 - both native and you know when you meet
36:43 - them they're just um they're brimming
36:46 - with the the possibilities for what you
36:48 - know what we can do together you know
36:49 - how how we can
36:51 - how we can move forward you know um and
36:54 - taking their community their young folks
36:56 - on a journey with them um to reconnect
36:59 - with those parts of the past that we
37:00 - want to bring with us
37:02 - you know so i think that's those are
37:04 - those are the folks that we that we work
37:06 - with in the tribal communities
37:08 - that we're with and and part of that is
37:10 - the tribal governance itself
37:13 - so
37:14 - one of our tribal partners has a culture
37:16 - committee you know we're working with
37:17 - them
37:18 - to create some of the cultural pieces in
37:21 - other areas it's more it's you know they
37:23 - have a culture and language curriculum
37:25 - inside of the school and we're working
37:26 - with the teachers
37:28 - uh there so it just depends on the
37:30 - community um but yeah absolutely elders
37:33 - are critical they're a critical part of
37:35 - the of the vision for sure thank you for
37:37 - the question
37:39 - so
37:40 - in aotearoa we're very fortunate with
37:42 - our new education changes that they are
37:45 - they've said every school has to go work
37:48 - with the manufa the local people of the
37:50 - area but one thing that we would say is
37:54 - that often that work is seen as being
37:56 - free cultural labor that there's an
37:58 - expectation that the
38:01 - local tribes should for free come every
38:05 - single time they're asked and provide
38:08 - that knowledge over and over again
38:11 - which
38:13 - isn't right and isn't true so when
38:15 - anyone's planning this stuff we have to
38:17 - think about how we're valuing um that
38:20 - knowledge and that relationship and who
38:22 - should be doing the work and how much
38:24 - education we have to do ourselves first
38:26 - before we just go ask
38:29 - so that's a really big that's currently
38:31 - where we are today
38:32 - and new zealanders
38:33 - going on that journey of how do we value
38:36 - that and not just expect it um because
38:39 - it's not like they're getting paid to do
38:41 - it so how do we pay for that knowledge
38:44 - if we want it in many ways
38:55 - i co-signed that the payment part is
38:57 - usually forgotten in those things yeah
38:59 - we built it into our grant but it's
39:01 - definitely something to you know
39:04 - to keep reminding folks of that
39:07 - there's a real value to indigenous
39:08 - knowledge of all fields and all types
39:11 - yeah we we have long been paying for
39:14 - elder engagement and um you know at any
39:17 - time it's never it it's never a question
39:20 - um just to the to the question that was
39:23 - asked um and i'll share the link but we
39:26 - last year did a series of um roundtables
39:30 - right across the country with
39:31 - um elders and knowledge keepers and and
39:35 - chiefs and council and all forms of
39:38 - different leadership to talk about
39:40 - um
39:40 - land-based learning specifically and how
39:42 - land-based learning and stem and and
39:45 - coding could all come together
39:48 - um not just for indigenous youth but for
39:51 - for all youth um
39:53 - uh and that a report was produced out of
39:56 - that in terms of you know that that kind
39:59 - of voice being captured and then
40:01 - our role is then to share that up to
40:04 - the the leadership whether that's the
40:06 - the at the government level federally so
40:09 - or provincially where education is held
40:11 - in canada so i'm happy to share the
40:14 - findings of that
40:15 - report
40:23 - so
40:24 - uh we'd like to take the next question
40:26 - from the zoom room i put it in the chat
40:28 - but just wanted to give a shout out if
40:30 - anyone has one they may feel free to
40:32 - unmute and ask a question um
40:37 - otherwise i'll give you all a question
40:41 - and we also have a second question from
40:43 - the room if you want to take that one
40:44 - too from l.a
40:47 - okay uh let's take the question from la
40:50 - anyone in the zoom room uh please feel
40:52 - free to throw something in there and
40:53 - we'll we'll do our best to get to it we
40:55 - still have some time here for for
40:56 - questions
40:59 - hi thank you um this my name is jeremy
41:02 - i'm faculty at the university of arizona
41:04 - uh also a member of the hopi tewa
41:06 - community so i appreciate your insight i
41:08 - really actually uh value the idea of
41:11 - thinking critically and how we take up
41:13 - this particular kind of work in our
41:15 - communities and
41:16 - i really appreciate the the sort of the
41:20 - centering and reminding us of the
41:21 - intersections between settler
41:23 - colonialism and that history but also
41:25 - uh the possibilities of what this kind
41:28 - of work holds so i'm brand new to this
41:30 - so i really appreciate the dialogue that
41:31 - you're shaping for me it meshes well for
41:33 - what for me in terms of critical
41:35 - indigenous pedagogies and um you know
41:38 - culturally sustaining pedagogies as well
41:40 - so
41:41 - my actually my question is revolves
41:43 - around
41:44 - what are the
41:45 - sort of the processes in which you
41:47 - engage the ethical
41:49 - uh balance in terms of what knowledge
41:51 - should should or shouldn't be included
41:53 - in this process and how is that
41:55 - protected in terms of uh under the lens
41:58 - of let's say maybe sovereignty or tribal
42:00 - uh self-determination etc
42:04 - i'm chomping at the bit to answer this
42:08 - this is something that we were really a
42:10 - native woman-led team in my project and
42:13 - we were really wanting to know what were
42:15 - the protocols
42:17 - for that tribe before we started
42:19 - incorporating knowledge and language and
42:22 - it came up in some of our earlier
42:23 - conversations for some tribes
42:25 - using their language in a computer
42:28 - machine context doesn't doesn't work
42:31 - it's
42:32 - they don't um they don't want their
42:34 - language to be used that way which we
42:35 - have to respond i mean that makes total
42:37 - sense right
42:38 - um how did colonizers get all of our
42:41 - stuff and keep it right they use
42:43 - technology so we didn't have
42:46 - so you know i think there's this this
42:48 - question you know about like where are
42:50 - the lines and we always want to respect
42:51 - those
42:52 - um
42:53 - we also had uh conversations you know
42:56 - about you know specific aspects of the
42:59 - language so is it like words is it the
43:02 - syllabary is it both
43:04 - you know we want to be very clear um
43:06 - with folks and we
43:08 - we respect their protocols
43:10 - you know 100 and i think it's to i think
43:12 - it was zoe's point where we have to
43:14 - learn ourselves we're coming from
43:16 - outside as well we're from different
43:18 - tribes
43:19 - so you know when we go and approach
43:21 - people we have to read up about their
43:23 - culture and their language and their
43:24 - ways you know when i go to the muscular
43:26 - apache i i'm not pointing with my finger
43:29 - you know to anyone um so there's
43:32 - different things that you have to ground
43:34 - yourself in
43:35 - even if you're just another native
43:37 - person just from another another part of
43:40 - turtle island so
43:41 - yeah for sure 100
43:43 - um we have we have to engage with
43:45 - protocol very seriously and and make
43:47 - that part of our um a very gentle
43:49 - relational approach
43:51 - like you know
43:52 - we approach people as other people
43:55 - we engage with them non-transactionally
43:57 - we give them the time they need to
43:58 - respond to us to come you know back with
44:01 - what they need um if we can help them we
44:03 - will
44:04 - and you know we keep offering so
44:07 - you know i mean there's just
44:09 - there's there's a lot of working in
44:10 - native communities i think for
44:11 - non-native people isn't intuitive um
44:14 - and so that's that's something that we
44:15 - try to make a different experience uh
44:17 - for working with us
44:21 - um so data sovereignty is huge in this
44:24 - space and we're very fortunate um
44:27 - microsoft is just committed to building
44:29 - a data center in aotearoa because most
44:32 - of our cloud-based data goes offshore
44:34 - constantly and when we think about where
44:37 - that knowledge is traveling and that
44:39 - localized control over um particularly
44:42 - our indigenous knowledge our whakapapa
44:45 - um so there's they've committed to
44:49 - my understanding as they've committed to
44:50 - creating a section of the data center in
44:53 - aotearoa specifically for the holding of
44:56 - indigenous knowledge
44:58 - in
44:58 - new zealand so that that knowledge will
45:01 - never leave the shores of aotearoa won't
45:03 - digitally travel back and forth which is
45:06 - um
45:07 - due to the incredible work within
45:09 - microsoft of
45:10 - some amazing indigenous leaders who
45:13 - really understand
45:15 - the narratives and the need behind it so
45:19 - um i would say there are some people out
45:21 - there in some of our large organizations
45:23 - that really get
45:25 - and are really exploring these ideas
45:27 - around
45:29 - how and where indigenous knowledge
45:31 - should be transmitted um
45:34 - we do a lot of work with our indigenous
45:36 - community specifically around
45:38 - understanding ip around understanding
45:41 - how data travels online like where it is
45:44 - what does that mean once you've put
45:46 - something because particularly for our
45:48 - young people they share so much
45:51 - without really comprehending
45:53 - what that means in terms of their own
45:57 - assets
45:59 - and then on another note like even
46:01 - the work that we do around translation
46:03 - and even with the work we've done with
46:05 - the hour of code um there is no one
46:07 - maori language
46:09 - there is
46:10 - we have different languages in every
46:12 - tribe
46:13 - and so
46:14 - even in these spaces we're almost
46:17 - colonizing with one tribe the tribes
46:19 - that we work with our translations on
46:21 - becomes the standard online and that's
46:24 - still not right because there are so
46:27 - many different ways of saying and being
46:29 - and so i think that we all need to
46:31 - consistently put pressure in these
46:34 - systems to
46:35 - really understand what the indigenous
46:39 - space is in technology and how we allow
46:42 - that to be reflected not just with a
46:45 - here are the flags of countries but
46:47 - actually being able to understand the
46:48 - nuance of um
46:50 - you know that
46:52 - we one other project we worked on is we
46:55 - have a tokulawan community here to class
46:57 - an island in the pacific that is on the
46:59 - endangered language list and we worked
47:02 - we've been working for three years
47:04 - with the elders and the young people of
47:06 - the atahu tukolau community in porirua
47:09 - to develop a language app because they
47:11 - see technology as a great revitalization
47:14 - tool but it's really hard to
47:16 - consistently take all of the ways of
47:19 - being and working out
47:21 - of working alongside
47:23 - our indigenous elders that don't have
47:25 - experiences in tech and even though
47:27 - we've built language apps with other
47:29 - indigenous people even though our
47:31 - indigenous developers had to still take
47:33 - themselves out to really explore and
47:35 - understand that indigenous knowledge
47:37 - like what is it to learn when you're
47:39 - from the island of a tahoe
47:42 - how do the elders want to communicate
47:44 - that without assuming that it's these
47:46 - ways of being so it just takes
47:49 - a huge amount of
47:51 - self
47:52 - i guess awareness to do this work for
47:55 - people in the space and i think everyone
47:57 - has to be constantly
48:00 - aware of what they're
48:02 - bringing into it so that they don't
48:04 - dominate it
48:09 - yeah i just want to admit this is a
48:11 - conversation that's been happening with
48:12 - the natives in tech around data
48:14 - sovereignty and
48:16 - it is also part of like an
48:17 - infrastructure issue right on one hand
48:19 - we we talk about the cultural knowledge
48:21 - and how that gets incorporated into
48:22 - educational systems but how do we ensure
48:25 - that you know
48:27 - tribal
48:28 - tribal citizens and tribal systems have
48:30 - physical control
48:32 - over what they choose to use and really
48:35 - have that in place so it's you know
48:37 - physical systems it's also you know
48:40 - right maybe a first refusal or licenses
48:43 - around data and
48:45 - these are things that i think are
48:46 - necessary to kind of be brought up to
48:48 - speed around you know
48:50 - what happens in the greater publishing
48:52 - or technological world around how we
48:54 - share things and
48:56 - and use other people's stuff open source
48:58 - is kind of a
49:00 - gold standard within the software
49:02 - community
49:03 - well maybe not gold standard i'm a huge
49:05 - fan of open source uh
49:07 - but that
49:08 - that doesn't quite work when we talk
49:10 - about protecting you know our own
49:12 - knowledge spaces and how we want things
49:15 - to work and how we want people to be
49:16 - able to take them up or not take them up
49:19 - and there's a really cool company aho
49:22 - who's a they're an amazing indigenous
49:24 - data company in aotearoa and they
49:27 - even looking at things like whakapapa
49:28 - which is your ancestors um and that idea
49:32 - that there's no empty fields it's not
49:34 - missing knowledge that your whakapapa is
49:36 - there and it exists and how that but
49:39 - that also your whakapapa can be
49:41 - disagreed on within the tribe and what
49:44 - truth is and data because computer
49:46 - science is so
49:48 - binary
49:49 - but actually these ideas and these
49:51 - structures for data storage and whose
49:54 - truth is right and valid even within a
49:58 - very your own tribe is it's a really
50:01 - interesting space that um will again
50:03 - radically transform what our data what
50:06 - computers look like for the better i
50:08 - think
50:10 - ian i just popped a resource to you into
50:12 - the chat around uh there's an
50:15 - organization in british columbia um
50:18 - called the first nations uh technology
50:20 - council and they're doing a lot of work
50:22 - around digital equity but also including
50:25 - like spectrum
50:26 - sovereignty so like who
50:29 - who actually owns the kind of like space
50:31 - in the internet and and
50:33 - um you know we're working actually to to
50:36 - do some programming around actually
50:38 - getting kids to understand that so that
50:39 - they can start to
50:41 - to understand that kind of
50:43 - potential uh in the future so i put the
50:45 - link in the chat
50:48 - thank you and that's technology council
50:49 - dot ca slash indigenous dash leadership
50:53 - dash in tech
50:54 - technology um for those of you in the
50:57 - room uh and i think we might be able to
50:59 - share something out like that later and
51:01 - i i also want to so you brought up an
51:03 - interesting thing where like what is
51:05 - right and what isn't
51:07 - and in some ways right like
51:09 - i can
51:10 - i can kind of speak for my people where
51:12 - there is no really right or wrong right
51:15 - there is this is what i was taught and
51:17 - part of the cultural thing is you know
51:19 - okay that's what you were taught and i
51:20 - acknowledge that
51:22 - and i'm not going to tell you you're
51:24 - wrong and so it's
51:26 - it's a remnant of colonization
51:28 - in some spaces to say this is right or
51:31 - wrong and that
51:33 - that is
51:35 - difficult interesting all of the things
51:37 - to navigate when we talk about trying to
51:39 - standardize and share and make something
51:42 - that works for everybody so it's kind of
51:44 - blows up a lot of a lot of things that
51:46 - we think are standard assumptions
51:48 - uh and i think we have a question from
51:50 - the chat and i think it'd be great to
51:52 - and from
51:53 - penny are you able to ask your question
51:56 - yes i am um so thank you um
51:59 - i am in north dakota um i work on a um
52:02 - at a small tribal school
52:04 - and
52:06 - we are
52:07 - at the very beginning
52:09 - of this whole process um
52:12 - we had issues with um
52:15 - internet when the pandemic hit um we
52:18 - just recently got um enough devices to
52:21 - be one to one with our students
52:24 - but what would you guys recommend
52:28 - be the first steps that we take
52:31 - um because i mean we do not have a lot
52:33 - of teachers i mean we're short teachers
52:35 - this year
52:36 - um being able to staff positions to
52:39 - teach these things
52:41 - because i mean a lot of the schools are
52:44 - already behind in reading and math
52:46 - and i know that reading and math can be
52:48 - taught within um cs curriculum
52:51 - but what what would you guys recommend
52:54 - be those first steps that so that we can
52:56 - move in the right direction sorry i'm
52:59 - out of breath we have parent teacher
53:00 - conferences and i just had a parent walk
53:02 - in so
53:03 - um but go ahead
53:10 - you want to take that up first first
53:13 - steps you think people could take where
53:15 - you know they may be under resourced or
53:17 - you know trying to figure out how to
53:18 - start
53:21 - um well i mean i think one of the the
53:23 - beauties of the um like the internet and
53:25 - kind of the
53:26 - um yeah the the amount of resources that
53:30 - we have there um is that we
53:33 - have access to a lot of
53:36 - um you know free uh online kind of
53:38 - teaching resources there's khan academy
53:40 - um there's like various things um
53:44 - and i think
53:45 - that is definitely one thing that we
53:47 - could um like you guys could utilize
53:50 - going forward to kind of fill in those
53:52 - gaps
53:52 - um you know those kind of
53:54 - recordings of you know someone else
53:56 - teaching it um
53:58 - but i think it is definitely hard
54:00 - because you know not every student has
54:02 - the same access to tech
54:04 - um and
54:05 - that's kind of one of the issues that
54:07 - that we face in indigenous communities
54:09 - is
54:10 - that
54:11 - access to
54:12 - um a computer or the internet um
54:14 - so
54:15 - i think those online resources are a
54:17 - great um a great way to kind of fill in
54:20 - those gaps if you can um like if you
54:23 - have access to the internet um and those
54:25 - those resources but um i think there's
54:28 - definitely
54:29 - it's a tough tough issue to solve
54:33 - if you have access to the internet it's
54:36 - a great place to start that's easy as
54:37 - hour of code
54:39 - um we start all our schools off with
54:40 - that but it's a
54:42 - self-led for your students and there's
54:43 - so many of them on there and it's super
54:45 - rich but it is
54:47 - very what it is
54:49 - when we work with schools we always do
54:51 - projects so just project-based learning
54:54 - outside of everything else give them
54:56 - something they can connect to in their
54:58 - community and just let them
54:59 - think about a solution and they don't
55:02 - have to
55:02 - build a technology solution but if
55:04 - they're exploring some of those concepts
55:07 - um
55:08 - we do a lot of stuff around like you
55:09 - know if we've got assistive issues in
55:11 - our school or environmental issues is
55:13 - there a stream is there a something that
55:16 - um
55:17 - they can think about and then depending
55:19 - on the age of the kids we do a lot of
55:21 - game design because kids love
55:23 - making games and again there's lots of
55:25 - free resources out there we use scratch
55:28 - we try to use only free stuff i know in
55:30 - america
55:31 - my understanding is it's a little bit
55:33 - different of what tech you can use in
55:34 - your school so there's a bit but we and
55:36 - i'll tell we can just say use go use
55:39 - this and you can just do it the level of
55:41 - state control is i guess a little bit
55:43 - less
55:44 - um
55:45 - but yeah scratch is super cool um the
55:47 - code.org stuff is amazing for self-led
55:50 - stuff for your students but really you
55:52 - have to get their hearts
55:54 - and get them interested in that with
55:56 - something that they're passionate about
55:58 - so project-based stuff that takes all of
56:00 - that other stuff into account i would
56:02 - say
56:03 - annie what age are your kids
56:07 - four grades um we actually are a pre-k
56:11 - we have two schools within our building
56:13 - um we are a
56:15 - um pre-k through eighth grade and then
56:18 - we also have a
56:20 - a public high school that is also on our
56:22 - reservation
56:23 - awesome
56:24 - i mean we'd be interested in talking
56:26 - about partnering in high school
56:28 - so i mean that's one that's one thing is
56:30 - partnerships um because there are
56:34 - groups and orgs um and projects like
56:36 - mine um designed now now that like
56:39 - natives are trending
56:41 - um in our fields um there's there's
56:44 - unprecedented opportunity stuff i wish
56:46 - had been around when i was growing up um
56:49 - the other thing i would say and this
56:51 - gets back to what others have said is
56:52 - that
56:53 - yeah i would see what their interests
56:55 - are and go with what they already like
56:58 - doing with technology often it is gaming
57:01 - um like was said but i think um
57:05 - everyone's a gamer at all ages always
57:08 - um no matter what the game but i i do
57:10 - think yeah um going and polling them to
57:14 - as as as kids and and seeing where their
57:16 - interest is um as well as online
57:19 - resources um
57:21 - trying to think i know that there are
57:23 - curriculum models out there um
57:27 - trying to think of some of the bigger
57:28 - ori project lead the way i know um
57:31 - [Music]
57:32 - has been doing a lot as well
57:35 - there's just so many shops out there
57:38 - i know that ecs is also applicable to
57:42 - elementary and middle school kids
57:44 - um and i know that there's like a
57:46 - version of that in code.org um but also
57:48 - the ecs team in la um
57:51 - are folks to maybe think about too so
57:53 - just tons of opportunity but thank you
57:55 - for your question thanks for your work
57:58 - can i call matt
58:02 - uh sure this is sarah palpatine
58:06 - um to the question about internet and no
58:10 - monies and whatnot of course all the
58:12 - freebie stuff has been covered
58:14 - i'd like to plug in for um
58:18 - exploring computer science
58:20 - i facilitated um
58:23 - a uh
58:24 - i guess the beginning of
58:26 - computer
58:28 - science and i began with um exploring
58:31 - computer science scratch and also
58:34 - code.org
58:35 - but exploring computer science you can
58:37 - do that without computers
58:40 - believe it or not being in a lecture
58:42 - hall
58:43 - it's really
58:45 - um native friendly
58:47 - my one of my favorite parts about that
58:49 - one is um
58:52 - the part where they talk about um
58:54 - there's a
58:55 - lesson plan for problem solving
58:58 - and we go through the pro the the kids
59:01 - have heard that millions of times right
59:03 - problem solving steps
59:05 - but it's very applicable to natives
59:08 - because i can um equate that to our
59:11 - navajo way of living and learning
59:13 - um the four directions and so that and
59:16 - the kids are like oh oh okay so
59:20 - the exploring computer science is really
59:23 - one year i did most of that curriculum
59:25 - without computers and i think that one
59:28 - was very um
59:30 - helpful to me because i i'm not a i'm
59:33 - not a programmer
59:35 - uh
59:36 - they for some reason
59:38 - they gravitated toward me just because
59:40 - i'm a good facilitator i guess and so
59:43 - but now um our school finally hired a
59:45 - mass
59:46 - computer programmer um
59:49 - a teacher
59:51 - so now that got off my hands
59:53 - um but
59:55 - exploring computer science would be
59:57 - awesome at the bie school and and i'll
60:01 - i'll throw out just as a bench because i
60:03 - work in academia i'm i'm working with
60:05 - two projects that are south dakota based
60:07 - so just south of you penny and just as a
60:10 - as a quick mention for anybody looking
60:11 - for
60:12 - partnerships look up who's doing the
60:15 - work and just reach out we're we're
60:18 - interested in making the world better
60:20 - and if it's not something we can do we
60:23 - probably know somebody who is in that
60:26 - space or interested in working in that
60:28 - space and it all just kind of starts
60:30 - from an email um i met frida sitting at
60:32 - a lunch counter one time at a conference
60:35 - and you know it's you have to build
60:37 - those connections and reach out and say
60:39 - hey what's up um and a lot of great
60:42 - stuff happens out of that
60:45 - there's another really cool free one we
60:47 - use which is called hello ruby and it's
60:49 - beautiful for younger kids and it's all
60:51 - offline all worksheets that help young
60:54 - people decide like drawing the internet
60:56 - and stuff like that i know we're out of
60:59 - time but hello ruby i thoroughly
61:01 - recommend everybody
61:02 - developed by a finnish woman i think
61:04 - right
61:05 - yeah yeah
61:07 - i think i saw her keynote
61:09 - really impressive
61:11 - she's really cool yeah
61:13 - also just uh sorry i know we're running
61:15 - a bit on time but a quick plug for mit
61:17 - app inventor it's perfect for
61:20 - kids who don't have any experience
61:23 - it's geared towards a little bit of a
61:24 - younger audience but it's kind of a drag
61:26 - and drop coding system where they can
61:28 - create their own apps and you can
61:30 - actually pull it up
61:31 - on your phone you kind of scan the
61:32 - barcode
61:34 - so
61:34 - that is just a really cool easy to use
61:37 - platform and there are full tutorials
61:39 - for projects so
61:41 - kids can kind of go through them on
61:42 - their own they don't need someone to
61:43 - facilitate
61:46 - okay
61:47 - thank you all for sharing we are
61:49 - overtime great conversation
61:52 - um
61:53 - and thank you everyone for the great
61:55 - questions and for participating thank
61:57 - you to the panelists for for sharing
61:59 - your work and your thoughts
62:01 - um
62:02 - yes
62:03 - sing stuff in chat could use another
62:05 - hour um there are other events going on
62:09 - i believe tomorrow um
62:12 - and the natives and tech conference is
62:14 - also happening uh i believe starting
62:16 - this evening over the weekend so
62:19 - again reach out please
62:22 - and
62:23 - figure out what what we can do
62:26 - thank you all
62:28 - thanks ian thanks everyone
62:32 - all right great talking to you guys
62:33 - today

Cleaned transcript:

all right so i think everyone's in from the waiting room uh i want to let everyone know right now that uh there is a group of folks from la that are taking part or in la that are taking part of c with cs edcon um so we have an inperson and a virtual audience here it's just everyone kind of knows what's going on um for those of you that are online if you or actually i'll add this to the chat for some instructions for how you may want to rename yourself to help us keep track of things um and are we all good to get going okay awesome um so hello everyone um we're welcome to our panel uh my name is ian her many horses i am the moderator i'm an assistant teaching professor at cu boulder and i focus on computer science ed and mathed and kind of the whole spectrum of uh things within education i work with preservice teachers in my role at cu boulder but then also do you know uh pd support for practicing teachers and then work with k12 students as well and i'm gonna let each of our panelists introduce themselves uh i see elizabeth first so maybe we could start off with you all right um hello everybody my name is elizabeth holm i'm the founder of sonak which is the sisterhood of native american coders but usually we just kind of shorten it to sonar because it's kind of a mouthful um yeah and uh i guess just kind of a little bit of background i've been coding and kind of been an advocate for uh women in stem for the past seven years um and yeah and i started sonar because i wanted to kind of connect my my passion with stem with my indigenous ancestry so that's just kind of a bit of background uh zoe would you mind going next um no islands nor scotland nor togo um is the mountain i grew up under waipa the river i grew up beside i'm from aotearoa new zealand my ancestors are from ireland scotland and togo i'm a tawiwi in aotearoa and i'm committed to the partnership of fertility of waitangi i'm the founder of omg tech and i acknowledge the tangata of the area that i'm on today um orangey tech is a charity in aotearoa new zealand that was established about seven years ago to ensure every child or young person gets access to the technology that shapes their future we have a focus on ensuring young people can think creatively critically computationally and culturally and we believe that exploring all of our own indigeneity is the key to a prosperous future for everybody thank you jen would you mind going next yes happy to hello everybody my name is jennifer flanagan i am joining from the traditional unseated territory of the algonquin people uh i also called ottawa uh ontario canada so the capital of canada and i'm the ceo of an organization called actua we are a national uh charitable organization that engages youth in building the skills and confidence they need to thrive in in stem but generally across the board we specifically focus on removing barriers that continue to exist for participation in these fields and our largest program is the work that we do in partnership with uh indigenous communities so first nations inuit and metis communities across canada so very happy to be here yes yeah you go for it so i just greeted you in my native language when you're back uh hey everyone my name is frida or you can call me nick which is my new black name i'm here on traditional territories of the sean and chichen yoloni people i'm going to go ahead and drop the shumi land tax link into the chat if you live in the bay area if you've been in the bay area you don't have to be in the bay area to support uh indigenous rematriation of the land so um that's one way to do it as an as an ally um so yeah i've been with the kport center for nearly seven years it'd be seven years in january and uh for the past two of them have been coleading a project with the american indian science and engineering society similar to elizabeth i've been working with native girls in computing the model's slightly different we're working to bring in culturally revitalizing computing education curricula into native serving schools designed specifically to engage native girls um and i came to that work because um i did my cs and bachelor's my bachelor's in cs and it was as a native american woman as a native alaskan woman it was so challenging in so many different ways and so to understand that i started to work on better representation for black and other indigenous people and women in stem and mcs all right thank you all um so we'll get into our first question uh quick reminder the goal is three minutes a piece and we'll kind of round robin it so the first question is in your experience what has been the biggest challenge of doing cs ed work with and or in indigenous communities and i'll throw that in the chat as well to help you anybody like to take that on first i'm happy to go first if you want awesome thank you uh great so um from uh and obviously speaking from a canadian context um you know we we've got two uh pretty significant challenges i mean many challenges but two in particular that i'm going to speak about one is this that i think will be very common among panelists and certainly understood among among the audience which is just a a significant and growing digital divide so you know straight up access we know that you know the the access to the internet is it's been designated by the un as a human right um and you know canada is obviously a very super developed country but we still have massive access issues so rural remote communities only about half have actual access to um highspeed broadband and in our indigenous communities across the country about threequarters of them don't have access to a reliable internet so that's just internet access then technology and hardware is is a whole other whole other challenge so one that we kind of work around so we do a lot of unplugged activities in in computer science and through the pandemic this has been massively exacerbated because of the challenges of connecting to communities that we normally connect with face to face to do this content where we bring in technology um really not being able to do that the other piece is around um the cultural uh divide and the in the the the ongoing focus which is still important on access and um and physical infrastructure which is needed but uh a real lack of focus on uh you know how we build from the very core build in indigenous perspective and leadership in how content and computing systems are actually designed so a big um part of the work that we're doing is really to uh create a platform and space for um you know changing the way that cs education has developed so that the unique and critical perspectives of of indigenous people are uh brought into it many of the indigenous communities we work with are um uh you know nervous or uh kind of resisting in terms of the the digital um evolution and and for good reason because they don't see themselves in it and and certainly from a youth perspective they're uh in canada anyway there's a huge focus on revitalizing and maintaining and celebrating traditional culture and language um so that that's a big um a big gap that we're also uh working very actively to to address through the way that we incorporate multiple world views in the programming that we deliver i'll leave it there thank you would anybody else like to jump in again the the question is in your experience what has been the biggest challenge of doing cs ed work with and or in indigenous communities um i can hop in next if you like um and apologies my my voice is a little bit uh shaky because we're a little under the weather right now but um yeah so i guess one of the um the big issues is having kind of a concentrated um initial interest in so you know there's obviously two formats of in person and online or like a resume um and sonar personally um so we teach indigenous girls um around the country how to code and we are an online based uh platform um but uh what we found is that there's there's there's quite a diverse um kind of range of uh girls from um you know they're from a bunch of different tribes um but that also uh kind of shows us that there's not a lot of um you know there's not a concentrated interest in cs um uh in you know one specific area or tribe it can be maybe one to two girls per area um and i think for cs programs um in general i think it's really important to have a um kind of that in person connection and be coding alongside other girls that's kind of like what makes it engaging and fun um but i think on with the online platform it can be a little bit tough to do that um but you kind of have to to strike a balance between um having that that more engaging inperson program um and like kind of working with your peers um but also native communities usually don't have enough interest to make a substantial program within one area or tribe um so i feel like that's something that we've kind of uh we've overcome with the online format um bringing together girls onto a virtual space but it's been definitely hard to um kind of have that that connection that you usually would um with a traditional kind of cs or stem program where they're doing projects together working alongside each other and kind of um helping each other out and making those those computer science triumphs together um yeah so it can definitely be a tough balance between uh the the group work and that kind of collaboration um and also kind of bringing together um native communities but um yeah i'm gonna go ahead and jump in and piggyback off of what has already been said just from like a very basic like native perspective i feel like native communities are still undergoing quite a lot of genocide and that's not something i'm sure that's new to the native folks here but that's not the narrative that's discussed in education often so what i tend to talk about is that my mother was a boarding school survivor um this is something that you know impacted her life um and and lifespan and has impacted me as intergenerational trauma um so we don't often like see education in schooling as part of that narrative of colonization um and so we're tending to couch it in different terms right you know you can hear terms about a cultural difference or um you know this kind of lack of access of things which is true um but seeing from a native perspective these are all parts of the ways that we're still enduring under difficult conditions right under conditions of colonization so um you know that can be some of our school sites have had you know issues like uh environmental disasters you know over this past year um you know fires when there shouldn't be fires or floods when they're normally not floods um you know tornadoes um that they've never had so you know they're they're going through a lot just on a physical level even um that's disrupting a lot of their school life as well and just their their family structure um so so that's part of it i think the cultural part that um elizabeth and jen talked about i mean i think the the thing that we're seeing um on the ground with the schools that we're working with is that there's a huge interest on the part of the native students to connect with their traditional cultures and again school has often been the opposite experience for them right of being acculturated and assimilated into different disciplines that are led by uh by white folks but here we're trying to try to try to integrate uh traditional knowledges on a tribytribe basis um into computing curricula and that means working much more closely with the tribe and understanding their concerns their desires for their kids their their young people um what do they want to see for their future um and how do they want to see them in the world so it's a very different approach and i think um you know really tries to to get to grips with this reversing this um the colonization aspect of school trying to at least get at some of that um you can't completely in a goal setting probably for lots of reasons but trying at least to bring back language bring back traditions in some cases you know the tribes were working with were matriarchies originally before colonization right so working with native girls um is is a part of that focus of well this is actually a traditional part of your tribe in some cases um so yeah this is these are some of the things that we're trying to bring into the work but i appreciate all that everyone said it's it's definitely i'm just trying to frame it in a way i think if there are any native folks on the call um joining us today that that they'll maybe understand a little bit of what what we're trying to do zoe go ahead and jump in okay yeah so just to um total call that um for us and aotearoa the biggest problem of cs education is that it's a microcosm of the biggest problem in general education and that is our education systems are incredibly colonized and until we and you can't just think around the edges and change a few things 90 percent of our indigenous and young people go to school in mainstream schools so we have maori um kotakobapa which are incredible places of learning but the majority of our indigenous young people don't get to have that kind of education and so until we really look at not just culturally responsive practice in education but culturally sustaining where our young people have success as maori um themselves and that's not success maori being successful at success as maori success as samoan is tongan in these spaces and our teaching workforce is on a really big journey and we're very fortunate in aotearoa that um our ministry of education has recognized this and is putting focus into it but it's a really big thing to look at and face into all of our own unconscious biases how that plays out and what we value in education and there's a really cool bit of work by dr ann milne who is a lead educator in aotearoa around coloring in the white spaces and she's got a one for digital that looks at coloring in your digital white spaces which is a training course to make you really face into how much your whole school the way that your website looks the way everything looks is recolonizing our students and so for us the biggest challenge is just the biggest educational challenge how do we ensure that everything we're doing isn't recolonizing and doing more harm how are we from um how we've been critical of ourselves and our teaching and we work with a large percentage of schools in our theater i'm looking at that question looking at how do we all continue to um because it has to be the mainstream and we can't just we can't just tinker and create little bits here anymore because it's about every young person um yeah so i think that would be for us the biggest challenge in cs biggest challenge in everything if i could also just jump in um i feel like a really important part of designing the cs curriculum or stem curriculum is to incorporate that indigenous kind of heritage and culture into it um you know it could be something as small as using an indigenous word as an example um like if you're if you just have to plug in some random word um it could be some indigenous word um but i think yeah a really important part of kind of maintaining that heritage is kind of a an easy integration between um between the like kind of indigenous side and the stem side because they don't they don't have to be separate um and uh in doing that you can kind of show them how they can apply uh what they're learning in cs or stem backed into their communities and kind of connecting it back to their own their own heritage thank you all i'm gonna try to pull us up now from here where like challenges are daunting in a way but that we have to have successes that come out of these right and we're working within these systems and you know there are bright shining lights so what has been the greatest success you have seen either in your own organization's work or in the larger work with cs education in indigenous communities anybody that wants to jump in i can't i could go first again um okay i love what what all the other panelists said so much and and just in canada for example um you know we're working on a massive we canada is working on a massive reconciliation um priority or focus it's a huge as it is in other jurisdictions in the world a huge uh topic of conversation and energy and momentum and we specifically design and build our work around the recommendations that came out of a large commission called the truth and reconciliation commission there were over 90 calls to action for the government to to take on and a section of that was around education and language preservation um and so we worked directly under the direction of of leaders um in this country we also sort of work at both ends of some of my colleagues on the panel have spoken about we take the view of one kid at a time one child at a time because it's overwhelming there's so so much work to do but one child at a time but also how do we change the system we can't do the work unless we're working as well on the system we also as an organization can't do the work unless we as an organization walk the reconciliation talk ourselves so that means in you know significant indigenous representation from our board to our staff to the people that we work with on the ground to the companies that we work with so our programs are all led by indigenous undergraduate students across the country so that has been a huge success for us because it is there's a huge amount of competition for those students um and um so we have been able to engage a lot of them in the delivery of these programs um and we've been doing this work for goodness since i was in undergraduate like 25 years ago and what our goal is is to build a continuum of support for these youth so they might see a workshop in a school they might have a summer program in digital skills and stem in their community then they have the opportunity to see us again at school they then as they get older can become an instructor or a volunteer in one of our programs and we're now actually taking that a step further where um we're doing landbased programming it's a huge area of focus for us so actually um taking our our content and going out with youth uh for 15 days it's just an example where youth are getting high school credits so they're actually getting formal school credits they are being paid to then kind of mentor and do the work with younger youth they're getting leadership training and then the step after that is that we actually work to get them internships uh like work integrated learning type things so that could be with a corporation that they're interested in that could be with a local communitybased organization so it's recognizing that you know we we do if we want to see the kind of systems change that we're out for have to provide that support along the way and all of it all of it is at the direction and design of our indigenous partners and our indigenous staff so it we're changing the system as we deliver the programming on the ground thank you uh who would like to go in next in terms of sharing uh greatest success or positive things you're seeing in cs and indigenous communities i'll just add one tiny thing i think um yeah i mean we we we definitely it's been challenging getting this started over the pandemic um but i would say that something that gives me a lot of heart is part of part of the challenge of the pandemic has been that students were working at home the first year um and so all of our classes were virtual and you know they we had to send kits individually home for them to work on on their cs projects but one of the beauty points of that was that they actually had a chance to show their relatives and often it lived in intergenerational households so it was like aunties and grandparents also seeing what they could do with these led light strips they got to play with or make bead work on or you know had had their culturally you know at the time we were using the culturally relevant model of curriculum development not culturally revitalizing um but yes they they enjoyed showing um off what they could do and and one student in a sharing circle we had on the site um the end of last year had said that when he was you know doing his project in his room or you know out in the living room somebody came by his you know his auntie came by and said you know what are you doing and watched him do his thing watch the lights blink and flash and and how he was explaining you know how it worked and um she just looked at him and said yeah good make it think like an apache you know like make that computer think like an apache and that was such a beautiful moment for us as a team because we realized that you know this is an opportunity for um for elders for for uh family members for parents uh for intergenerational learning to happen for younger siblings um to get a chance to be exposed to this at the same time and it's a more sort of community wide effect than we would have seen otherwise um so really appreciated that comment from that auntie um and also just the vision that it gave us right the sort of alignment it gave us about what we were trying to do right in terms of what elizabeth was talking about and and others here talking about using indigenous languages and coding um you know there's no need for it to be in english right it comes down to binary code at the end of the day so um you know coding in their language things like that that they can show others um that they're learning how to do two things at the same time makes makes their families incredibly proud yeah thank you i like that that is a particular challenge right where there's you know there's not a lot of visibility of computer science within the communities right there's a recognition that it's important and we want students to expose it but raising that level of understanding across the entire community is always a challenge um and so yeah the little blessing underneath the mess of the pandemic there uh zoey elizabeth uh greatest things you you've seen going on successes i see you muted go ahead um so in aotearoa one of the biggest successes generally has been around language revitalization as a tool for cultural revitalization so um the maori people of aotearoa almost lost their language completely and there was a big effort generally for language revitalization and the 80s that was really flourishing now a lot of work we do feeds onto that that freda was just talking about that the computers don't speak english computers speak binary and we speak english to computers and that um there's an awful lot of ideas that cannot be translated into english because they just don't exist in it particularly coming from our indigenous people and so we do a lot of work um around identity and computing around being really critical of what you're being served up in a digital space and when you're creating with technology and we have an indigenous game design course that unpacks the values that exist in technology we find that really successful with young people using gaming as a tool to look at the fact that technology is not valueless it's not this cold artifact that it has and represents the values of the people that created it and so for our wider whanau mindset we talk a lot about whose values do you want represented and the things that are controlling our future so i'm looking at how our health care system will work as technology comes into it more and more as our democracy works and then where do these value systems come from and often we talk about the difference between american values and the private health care sector versus aotearoa where we have a public health care sector and what's that robot that's caring for your auntie or your um grandma going to look like and how is it going to interact because like you said like give it an apache mindset give it a pacific mindset because they're very different and the idea of what that technology should do is comes from a different place and so we've found a lot of success in helping our indigenous communities really understand they can they can change technology to be representative of themselves and the first stage of that has been around that deconstruction of it and being able to say for our particularly for our young people they hop into these video games that fortnight what are the values represented in that and how do they align to who you are and are you becoming a different person in the digital world from who you are and how would you fix that like what would you do instead and so our young people create the most incredible um games in the world they're just super cool because they're representative and they're being allowed to represent themselves and then the other side of that is around the resource creation um and we've heard lots of people mention it so we've done a lot of work as the code or partner in aotearoa and working alongside microsoft for years to translate the hour of code site into today maori we believe that for our young people their first experience coding should be in their indigenous language this year we're going to be translating into some of our pacifica languages as well because that also allows them to take that back into their homes for their aunties and their parents and their grandparents who have these traditional who speak first language and indigenous languages and so then they can share in that because it's quite a big gap that whanau connection to technology can be very big so that's kind of where our biggest success has been and is really just that helping our young people be critical of the technology that they're served up and create better solutions thank you i really i like the idea of like your first experience should be something that is of you right something where where you come from right this can be part of you uh awesome uh elizabeth uh would you like to share a great success you're seeing within your work or in other's work that you're noticing yeah sure um i mean i think uh jen might have mentioned um kind of looking at things on an individual level um like each individual um girl i think one of the the greatest successes or i guess the most rewarding moments is um when you see that kind of that moment of switch um in the girls when their eyes just light up um and they see uh the code running and doing that kind of computer magic right before their eyes i think um they kind of they have this moment of um like i did that i'm smart i'm capable i'm a coder um and i think that moment is really just it's what all coders live for but i think like particularly as an educator that is just such a rewarding moment um and i think to be able to create that moment in as many girls as possible is really the goal of um of sonic and other you know kind of cs education programs um i think through sonak we've been able to genuinely change some girls outlook on stem and with even just one girl we can kind of start a chain of the next generation of indigenous female innovators in stem so i feel like even though it seems small to to change just one girl's mindset you know they're gonna pass that on to their little sister or their friend um or when they get older maybe they'll start a program kind of similar to sonak um to spread their their passion so i think um those those individual sparks they seem sometimes you know they seem a little bit on a smaller scale but they can really start a wildfire um and i think that's probably one of the the biggest impacts that we can have yeah like we in like these very formal informal roles right but in some way where we're separated right and that peer support or that peer guidance and like what could this mean for you my friend or my cousin or whoever uh is just so powerful and we just we just can't speak and have those conversations in the positions that we're in in a lot of times um yeah so incredibly powerful uh okay so i want to we're we're gonna jen do you have a comment oh i just wanted to say one more thing that is kind of like that in terms of sparks like one of the the most amazing things that happened and this is prepandemic we'll get back this summer i hope but um we deliver uh programming with the 24 communities across nunavut which is one of our northern arctic territories um with inuit uh people and we it's delivered completely and inducted to it or it's delivered in english but translated completely and enough to it as well some of the kids understand some of them are just learning some of them don't understand it all but they're you know they're they're getting there and we always have local elders engaged in our programs and for the last few years um we have had like the most incredible experiences having elders become so engaged in the content and in fact as they're doing it are kind of coteaching so they're they're taking the you know the cultural lessons and sort of laying those on top of the work that our team is is delivering around stem or around you know digital skills um and it's just it's incredibly it's incredibly powerful but it is just uh it to me one of the biggest things that we need to continue to facilitate is that intergenerational multigenerational uh experience and where we just sort of create the space and um you know the the rest happens at at the community level yeah community is a driving thing here right like you get the community on board and it becomes part of them um thank you all i'm going to transition us to questions now uh i'm going to first pivot to the people in the room at cs edcon uh are there any questions from that space you all hear us still yes very clear one second my question is is is there any organization organization out there that is working with the tribal elders getting their input or the tribal leaders um i know there's a lot of work at the school level but i think there'd be more success if the elders were included in a lot of these decisions yeah yeah i mean that's a little bit what i was alluding to when we talked about cultural revitalization you can't do that without elders and culture bearers and language bearers um and i think they they play a critical role in and part of what we're trying to do here what some of us have talked about just building something new in place of colonial education um something more holistic communitybased indigenous center and indigenous world view center and so yeah that's definitely what cultural revitalization has brought brought to my program um is more work with the folks who immediately when you meet them they want to tell you stories immediately when you meet them they're you know they're excited because we're both native and you know when you meet them they're just um they're brimming with the the possibilities for what you know what we can do together you know how how we can how we can move forward you know um and taking their community their young folks on a journey with them um to reconnect with those parts of the past that we want to bring with us you know so i think that's those are those are the folks that we that we work with in the tribal communities that we're with and and part of that is the tribal governance itself so one of our tribal partners has a culture committee you know we're working with them to create some of the cultural pieces in other areas it's more it's you know they have a culture and language curriculum inside of the school and we're working with the teachers uh there so it just depends on the community um but yeah absolutely elders are critical they're a critical part of the of the vision for sure thank you for the question so in aotearoa we're very fortunate with our new education changes that they are they've said every school has to go work with the manufa the local people of the area but one thing that we would say is that often that work is seen as being free cultural labor that there's an expectation that the local tribes should for free come every single time they're asked and provide that knowledge over and over again which isn't right and isn't true so when anyone's planning this stuff we have to think about how we're valuing um that knowledge and that relationship and who should be doing the work and how much education we have to do ourselves first before we just go ask so that's a really big that's currently where we are today and new zealanders going on that journey of how do we value that and not just expect it um because it's not like they're getting paid to do it so how do we pay for that knowledge if we want it in many ways i cosigned that the payment part is usually forgotten in those things yeah we built it into our grant but it's definitely something to you know to keep reminding folks of that there's a real value to indigenous knowledge of all fields and all types yeah we we have long been paying for elder engagement and um you know at any time it's never it it's never a question um just to the to the question that was asked um and i'll share the link but we last year did a series of um roundtables right across the country with um elders and knowledge keepers and and chiefs and council and all forms of different leadership to talk about um landbased learning specifically and how landbased learning and stem and and coding could all come together um not just for indigenous youth but for for all youth um uh and that a report was produced out of that in terms of you know that that kind of voice being captured and then our role is then to share that up to the the leadership whether that's the the at the government level federally so or provincially where education is held in canada so i'm happy to share the findings of that report so uh we'd like to take the next question from the zoom room i put it in the chat but just wanted to give a shout out if anyone has one they may feel free to unmute and ask a question um otherwise i'll give you all a question and we also have a second question from the room if you want to take that one too from l.a okay uh let's take the question from la anyone in the zoom room uh please feel free to throw something in there and we'll we'll do our best to get to it we still have some time here for for questions hi thank you um this my name is jeremy i'm faculty at the university of arizona uh also a member of the hopi tewa community so i appreciate your insight i really actually uh value the idea of thinking critically and how we take up this particular kind of work in our communities and i really appreciate the the sort of the centering and reminding us of the intersections between settler colonialism and that history but also uh the possibilities of what this kind of work holds so i'm brand new to this so i really appreciate the dialogue that you're shaping for me it meshes well for what for me in terms of critical indigenous pedagogies and um you know culturally sustaining pedagogies as well so my actually my question is revolves around what are the sort of the processes in which you engage the ethical uh balance in terms of what knowledge should should or shouldn't be included in this process and how is that protected in terms of uh under the lens of let's say maybe sovereignty or tribal uh selfdetermination etc i'm chomping at the bit to answer this this is something that we were really a native womanled team in my project and we were really wanting to know what were the protocols for that tribe before we started incorporating knowledge and language and it came up in some of our earlier conversations for some tribes using their language in a computer machine context doesn't doesn't work it's they don't um they don't want their language to be used that way which we have to respond i mean that makes total sense right um how did colonizers get all of our stuff and keep it right they use technology so we didn't have so you know i think there's this this question you know about like where are the lines and we always want to respect those um we also had uh conversations you know about you know specific aspects of the language so is it like words is it the syllabary is it both you know we want to be very clear um with folks and we we respect their protocols you know 100 and i think it's to i think it was zoe's point where we have to learn ourselves we're coming from outside as well we're from different tribes so you know when we go and approach people we have to read up about their culture and their language and their ways you know when i go to the muscular apache i i'm not pointing with my finger you know to anyone um so there's different things that you have to ground yourself in even if you're just another native person just from another another part of turtle island so yeah for sure 100 um we have we have to engage with protocol very seriously and and make that part of our um a very gentle relational approach like you know we approach people as other people we engage with them nontransactionally we give them the time they need to respond to us to come you know back with what they need um if we can help them we will and you know we keep offering so you know i mean there's just there's there's a lot of working in native communities i think for nonnative people isn't intuitive um and so that's that's something that we try to make a different experience uh for working with us um so data sovereignty is huge in this space and we're very fortunate um microsoft is just committed to building a data center in aotearoa because most of our cloudbased data goes offshore constantly and when we think about where that knowledge is traveling and that localized control over um particularly our indigenous knowledge our whakapapa um so there's they've committed to my understanding as they've committed to creating a section of the data center in aotearoa specifically for the holding of indigenous knowledge in new zealand so that that knowledge will never leave the shores of aotearoa won't digitally travel back and forth which is um due to the incredible work within microsoft of some amazing indigenous leaders who really understand the narratives and the need behind it so um i would say there are some people out there in some of our large organizations that really get and are really exploring these ideas around how and where indigenous knowledge should be transmitted um we do a lot of work with our indigenous community specifically around understanding ip around understanding how data travels online like where it is what does that mean once you've put something because particularly for our young people they share so much without really comprehending what that means in terms of their own assets and then on another note like even the work that we do around translation and even with the work we've done with the hour of code um there is no one maori language there is we have different languages in every tribe and so even in these spaces we're almost colonizing with one tribe the tribes that we work with our translations on becomes the standard online and that's still not right because there are so many different ways of saying and being and so i think that we all need to consistently put pressure in these systems to really understand what the indigenous space is in technology and how we allow that to be reflected not just with a here are the flags of countries but actually being able to understand the nuance of um you know that we one other project we worked on is we have a tokulawan community here to class an island in the pacific that is on the endangered language list and we worked we've been working for three years with the elders and the young people of the atahu tukolau community in porirua to develop a language app because they see technology as a great revitalization tool but it's really hard to consistently take all of the ways of being and working out of working alongside our indigenous elders that don't have experiences in tech and even though we've built language apps with other indigenous people even though our indigenous developers had to still take themselves out to really explore and understand that indigenous knowledge like what is it to learn when you're from the island of a tahoe how do the elders want to communicate that without assuming that it's these ways of being so it just takes a huge amount of self i guess awareness to do this work for people in the space and i think everyone has to be constantly aware of what they're bringing into it so that they don't dominate it yeah i just want to admit this is a conversation that's been happening with the natives in tech around data sovereignty and it is also part of like an infrastructure issue right on one hand we we talk about the cultural knowledge and how that gets incorporated into educational systems but how do we ensure that you know tribal tribal citizens and tribal systems have physical control over what they choose to use and really have that in place so it's you know physical systems it's also you know right maybe a first refusal or licenses around data and these are things that i think are necessary to kind of be brought up to speed around you know what happens in the greater publishing or technological world around how we share things and and use other people's stuff open source is kind of a gold standard within the software community well maybe not gold standard i'm a huge fan of open source uh but that that doesn't quite work when we talk about protecting you know our own knowledge spaces and how we want things to work and how we want people to be able to take them up or not take them up and there's a really cool company aho who's a they're an amazing indigenous data company in aotearoa and they even looking at things like whakapapa which is your ancestors um and that idea that there's no empty fields it's not missing knowledge that your whakapapa is there and it exists and how that but that also your whakapapa can be disagreed on within the tribe and what truth is and data because computer science is so binary but actually these ideas and these structures for data storage and whose truth is right and valid even within a very your own tribe is it's a really interesting space that um will again radically transform what our data what computers look like for the better i think ian i just popped a resource to you into the chat around uh there's an organization in british columbia um called the first nations uh technology council and they're doing a lot of work around digital equity but also including like spectrum sovereignty so like who who actually owns the kind of like space in the internet and and um you know we're working actually to to do some programming around actually getting kids to understand that so that they can start to to understand that kind of potential uh in the future so i put the link in the chat thank you and that's technology council dot ca slash indigenous dash leadership dash in tech technology um for those of you in the room uh and i think we might be able to share something out like that later and i i also want to so you brought up an interesting thing where like what is right and what isn't and in some ways right like i can i can kind of speak for my people where there is no really right or wrong right there is this is what i was taught and part of the cultural thing is you know okay that's what you were taught and i acknowledge that and i'm not going to tell you you're wrong and so it's it's a remnant of colonization in some spaces to say this is right or wrong and that that is difficult interesting all of the things to navigate when we talk about trying to standardize and share and make something that works for everybody so it's kind of blows up a lot of a lot of things that we think are standard assumptions uh and i think we have a question from the chat and i think it'd be great to and from penny are you able to ask your question yes i am um so thank you um i am in north dakota um i work on a um at a small tribal school and we are at the very beginning of this whole process um we had issues with um internet when the pandemic hit um we just recently got um enough devices to be one to one with our students but what would you guys recommend be the first steps that we take um because i mean we do not have a lot of teachers i mean we're short teachers this year um being able to staff positions to teach these things because i mean a lot of the schools are already behind in reading and math and i know that reading and math can be taught within um cs curriculum but what what would you guys recommend be those first steps that so that we can move in the right direction sorry i'm out of breath we have parent teacher conferences and i just had a parent walk in so um but go ahead you want to take that up first first steps you think people could take where you know they may be under resourced or you know trying to figure out how to start um well i mean i think one of the the beauties of the um like the internet and kind of the um yeah the the amount of resources that we have there um is that we have access to a lot of um you know free uh online kind of teaching resources there's khan academy um there's like various things um and i think that is definitely one thing that we could um like you guys could utilize going forward to kind of fill in those gaps um you know those kind of recordings of you know someone else teaching it um but i think it is definitely hard because you know not every student has the same access to tech um and that's kind of one of the issues that that we face in indigenous communities is that access to um a computer or the internet um so i think those online resources are a great um a great way to kind of fill in those gaps if you can um like if you have access to the internet um and those those resources but um i think there's definitely it's a tough tough issue to solve if you have access to the internet it's a great place to start that's easy as hour of code um we start all our schools off with that but it's a selfled for your students and there's so many of them on there and it's super rich but it is very what it is when we work with schools we always do projects so just projectbased learning outside of everything else give them something they can connect to in their community and just let them think about a solution and they don't have to build a technology solution but if they're exploring some of those concepts um we do a lot of stuff around like you know if we've got assistive issues in our school or environmental issues is there a stream is there a something that um they can think about and then depending on the age of the kids we do a lot of game design because kids love making games and again there's lots of free resources out there we use scratch we try to use only free stuff i know in america my understanding is it's a little bit different of what tech you can use in your school so there's a bit but we and i'll tell we can just say use go use this and you can just do it the level of state control is i guess a little bit less um but yeah scratch is super cool um the code.org stuff is amazing for selfled stuff for your students but really you have to get their hearts and get them interested in that with something that they're passionate about so projectbased stuff that takes all of that other stuff into account i would say annie what age are your kids four grades um we actually are a prek we have two schools within our building um we are a um prek through eighth grade and then we also have a a public high school that is also on our reservation awesome i mean we'd be interested in talking about partnering in high school so i mean that's one that's one thing is partnerships um because there are groups and orgs um and projects like mine um designed now now that like natives are trending um in our fields um there's there's unprecedented opportunity stuff i wish had been around when i was growing up um the other thing i would say and this gets back to what others have said is that yeah i would see what their interests are and go with what they already like doing with technology often it is gaming um like was said but i think um everyone's a gamer at all ages always um no matter what the game but i i do think yeah um going and polling them to as as as kids and and seeing where their interest is um as well as online resources um trying to think i know that there are curriculum models out there um trying to think of some of the bigger ori project lead the way i know um has been doing a lot as well there's just so many shops out there i know that ecs is also applicable to elementary and middle school kids um and i know that there's like a version of that in code.org um but also the ecs team in la um are folks to maybe think about too so just tons of opportunity but thank you for your question thanks for your work can i call matt uh sure this is sarah palpatine um to the question about internet and no monies and whatnot of course all the freebie stuff has been covered i'd like to plug in for um exploring computer science i facilitated um a uh i guess the beginning of computer science and i began with um exploring computer science scratch and also code.org but exploring computer science you can do that without computers believe it or not being in a lecture hall it's really um native friendly my one of my favorite parts about that one is um the part where they talk about um there's a lesson plan for problem solving and we go through the pro the the kids have heard that millions of times right problem solving steps but it's very applicable to natives because i can um equate that to our navajo way of living and learning um the four directions and so that and the kids are like oh oh okay so the exploring computer science is really one year i did most of that curriculum without computers and i think that one was very um helpful to me because i i'm not a i'm not a programmer uh they for some reason they gravitated toward me just because i'm a good facilitator i guess and so but now um our school finally hired a mass computer programmer um a teacher so now that got off my hands um but exploring computer science would be awesome at the bie school and and i'll i'll throw out just as a bench because i work in academia i'm i'm working with two projects that are south dakota based so just south of you penny and just as a as a quick mention for anybody looking for partnerships look up who's doing the work and just reach out we're we're interested in making the world better and if it's not something we can do we probably know somebody who is in that space or interested in working in that space and it all just kind of starts from an email um i met frida sitting at a lunch counter one time at a conference and you know it's you have to build those connections and reach out and say hey what's up um and a lot of great stuff happens out of that there's another really cool free one we use which is called hello ruby and it's beautiful for younger kids and it's all offline all worksheets that help young people decide like drawing the internet and stuff like that i know we're out of time but hello ruby i thoroughly recommend everybody developed by a finnish woman i think right yeah yeah i think i saw her keynote really impressive she's really cool yeah also just uh sorry i know we're running a bit on time but a quick plug for mit app inventor it's perfect for kids who don't have any experience it's geared towards a little bit of a younger audience but it's kind of a drag and drop coding system where they can create their own apps and you can actually pull it up on your phone you kind of scan the barcode so that is just a really cool easy to use platform and there are full tutorials for projects so kids can kind of go through them on their own they don't need someone to facilitate okay thank you all for sharing we are overtime great conversation um and thank you everyone for the great questions and for participating thank you to the panelists for for sharing your work and your thoughts um yes sing stuff in chat could use another hour um there are other events going on i believe tomorrow um and the natives and tech conference is also happening uh i believe starting this evening over the weekend so again reach out please and figure out what what we can do thank you all thanks ian thanks everyone all right great talking to you guys today
