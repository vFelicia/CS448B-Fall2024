00:10 - let's say i run a sandwich shop i only
00:12 - sell turkey sandwiches without cheese
00:15 - i use a program to manage the sandwiches
00:17 - in my shop
00:18 - it has a sandwich class to represent the
00:21 - sandwiches i sell
00:23 - this sandwich class has instance
00:25 - variables for meat
00:27 - has cheese
00:28 - and price
00:30 - when a customer orders a sandwich at my
00:32 - shop the sandwich is created in my
00:34 - program by calling its constructor
00:37 - a constructor tells java how to create a
00:39 - new object and set the initial state of
00:42 - an object
00:43 - all constructors are public and have the
00:45 - same name as the class
00:48 - this constructor is a no argument
00:50 - constructor because it has no parameters
00:52 - inside the parentheses
00:54 - i chose the default values for the
00:56 - instance variables of my sandwiches in
00:58 - this case that means all sandwiches will
01:00 - have turkey for the meat
01:03 - false for has cheese
01:05 - and 299 for price
01:08 - now when i instantiate a my sandwich
01:10 - object using the no argument constructor
01:13 - i am creating a new sandwich object with
01:15 - these specific attributes
01:17 - if i create another sandwich object
01:19 - called your sandwich it will have the
01:21 - same values as the my sandwich object
01:26 - what happens when we call the sandwich
01:28 - constructor
01:30 - the my sandwich reference variable
01:32 - stores a pointer to the sandwich
01:33 - object's address in memory
01:36 - the my sandwich object gets a copy of
01:38 - the instance variables set up in the
01:40 - sandwich class
01:42 - when we call the constructor the
01:44 - instance variables are given value
01:47 - now that we can build our own
01:48 - constructors we can tell the computer
01:50 - exactly how an object should be
01:52 - instantiated
01:53 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

let's say i run a sandwich shop i only sell turkey sandwiches without cheese i use a program to manage the sandwiches in my shop it has a sandwich class to represent the sandwiches i sell this sandwich class has instance variables for meat has cheese and price when a customer orders a sandwich at my shop the sandwich is created in my program by calling its constructor a constructor tells java how to create a new object and set the initial state of an object all constructors are public and have the same name as the class this constructor is a no argument constructor because it has no parameters inside the parentheses i chose the default values for the instance variables of my sandwiches in this case that means all sandwiches will have turkey for the meat false for has cheese and 299 for price now when i instantiate a my sandwich object using the no argument constructor i am creating a new sandwich object with these specific attributes if i create another sandwich object called your sandwich it will have the same values as the my sandwich object what happens when we call the sandwich constructor the my sandwich reference variable stores a pointer to the sandwich object's address in memory the my sandwich object gets a copy of the instance variables set up in the sandwich class when we call the constructor the instance variables are given value now that we can build our own constructors we can tell the computer exactly how an object should be instantiated
