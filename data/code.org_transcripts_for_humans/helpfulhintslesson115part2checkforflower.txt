00:00 - you can solve this puzzle the same way
00:03 - that you would solve it if there were
00:04 - clouds over every space
00:06 - you'll let the computer check to see if
00:08 - there's a flower for you even though you
00:11 - know where a flower is and where a
00:13 - flower isn't you're simply going to have
00:15 - the beam move forward
00:17 - check to see if it's at a flower and if
00:20 - it is at a flower you'll need to get
00:22 - nectar now just have the bee do this six
00:24 - more times and your code will be
00:26 - finished
00:27 - but don't forget to keep it to five
00:28 - blocks or under
