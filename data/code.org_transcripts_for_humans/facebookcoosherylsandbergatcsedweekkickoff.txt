00:00 - well i am so um honored and excited to
00:02 - be here today with this community who
00:05 - are really leading the investment in
00:07 - computer science in our area
00:10 - and we all know how important that is
00:14 - um joining peggy and joining susan i'm
00:17 - grateful for your friendship and your
00:18 - leadership
00:19 - we all are here to make
00:22 - feels weird to have this i guess i could
00:24 - put this
00:26 - i guess i could just put that right in
00:27 - there you see
00:28 - the kind of expertise you get when you
00:30 - work in technology
00:33 - we all know how important this field of
00:36 - study is both in what computer science
00:39 - gives us
00:40 - in terms of the products we build the
00:43 - impact the products have in the world
00:44 - but also opportunity for people
00:47 - i am just so proud of hadi and alice and
00:50 - the team of code.org hattie and ali have
00:53 - been long-term friends of mine really
00:55 - helped me transition
00:57 - to silicon valley and the work code.org
01:00 - is doing which is really transforming
01:01 - education and giving millions of
01:03 - students who otherwise would have no
01:05 - access and no exposure to computer
01:08 - science i really believe can change our
01:09 - country so congratulations to both of
01:11 - you and your team for your leadership
01:19 - the thing about jobs and technology is
01:21 - they are incredibly high impact
01:24 - incredibly high paying and incredibly
01:26 - flexible and when you think about what
01:28 - people entering the workforce want they
01:30 - really want the ability to make a
01:31 - difference and i think all of us in this
01:33 - room know that there's probably no
01:35 - better field to do that than the field
01:37 - of technology
01:39 - people also want in increasingly
01:41 - economic uncertain times
01:44 - job stability and the ability to know
01:46 - that they can always get a job and no
01:48 - matter what's happening really in any
01:50 - economy right now anywhere in the world
01:52 - the people who have more than full
01:54 - employment are the people with these
01:56 - technical degrees despite all of the
01:59 - concerns about unemployment we have in
02:01 - our economy and so many others there is
02:04 - a huge gap in unfilled technology jobs
02:08 - not just here but all around the world
02:10 - so if we're looking for the answer for
02:12 - economic growth for financial stability
02:15 - for families
02:16 - getting more of our children into these
02:18 - fields we know is a huge part of the
02:20 - answer it's also the case that when i
02:23 - think about what families need women and
02:25 - men
02:26 - to be flexible to have both careers and
02:29 - personal lives so that women are no
02:31 - longer no longer say to women you can't
02:34 - do both something we never say to men
02:37 - these are
02:38 - always these are almost always the most
02:41 - flexible jobs you can have we used to
02:44 - have a joke at facebook that we it's not
02:46 - sure anymore but for many many years we
02:48 - had this unbelievable programmer that
02:50 - really no one had ever met
02:52 - because he didn't like to work in the
02:54 - office with other people
02:55 - but he was
02:57 - unbelievably productive
02:59 - and four people in this field who are
03:01 - unbelievably productive the type of
03:04 - flexibility we are willing to offer them
03:06 - and all the companies are willing to
03:08 - offer them
03:09 - shows how you can really integrate both
03:11 - a personal life and a professional life
03:13 - so really on any metric on anything we
03:16 - care about whether it's society or
03:18 - opportunity or impact or having jobs or
03:21 - being able to balance a work and family
03:23 - this is an unbelievable field
03:25 - the problem is
03:27 - we do not give equal access to people to
03:30 - get in there 98
03:32 - of the people majoring in computer
03:34 - science and colleges were exposed to
03:36 - computer science before they went to
03:38 - college
03:39 - that's an amazing statistic and that
03:41 - shows how important the work code.org
03:43 - and so many people
03:45 - in this room are doing we also have to
03:47 - think about
03:48 - not just getting the usual suspects into
03:50 - this field but getting everyone into
03:52 - this field
03:53 - women were 35 of computer science majors
03:56 - in the 1980s it's 18 today
04:00 - many years ago i hosted a summer party
04:02 - for
04:03 - a bunch of the facebook summer interns
04:05 - and there were so many boys like eight
04:07 - years ago and i said to one of them like
04:09 - where are all the girls
04:10 - and he looked up into me and said
04:12 - there are more daves than girls in my
04:16 - major in college and i looked at him i
04:18 - thought he was joking he was like no i
04:19 - counted
04:20 - there are this many people named dave
04:22 - and this many girls majoring in computer
04:25 - science at my school
04:27 - that's a problem and unfortunately one
04:29 - we are not making progress against
04:32 - same situation for the black and
04:33 - hispanic communities only 15 of the
04:35 - people majoring in these fields
04:37 - are black or hispanic and so what we
04:40 - need is equal access to computer science
04:43 - education and to motivate and excite
04:45 - everyone and let them know that this is
04:47 - a field they can excel in
04:49 - this is a field where they can really
04:51 - achieve and this is important so that we
04:54 - get to equal representation
04:56 - so that the products we build reflect
04:58 - the diversity not just of the people who
05:00 - use them but of the people who build
05:03 - them
05:04 - this is a really big priority for
05:06 - facebook we are putting large
05:08 - investments into funding into training
05:10 - support and jobs
05:12 - uh there we have lots and lots of lots
05:13 - of programs but i'll mention two i'm
05:15 - most proud of the first is we launched
05:17 - computer science and engineering lean in
05:20 - circles with facebook linkedin the anita
05:22 - borg foundation and my foundation the
05:24 - lean in foundation and the idea lean in
05:27 - circles are small groups that meet to
05:29 - support each other
05:31 - i think eight or ten people even though
05:33 - we have one in houston that they say
05:35 - they have 200 and they say everything's
05:37 - bigger in texas so they don't have eight
05:39 - they have 200. but it's any group of
05:41 - women or men who meet once a month
05:43 - together using the materials we provide
05:45 - for free to lean in to support each
05:47 - other and their ambitions a few years
05:49 - ago we launched computer science and
05:51 - engineering specific lean in circles to
05:54 - solve the problem for girls that they
05:56 - are surrounded by daves and not by girls
05:59 - so if there's only a few girls or one in
06:02 - their computer science class they're in
06:05 - a group that meets regularly to support
06:06 - them we now have over 250 circles and
06:09 - we're covering a huge number of campuses
06:12 - and we're grateful for the opportunity
06:14 - to work with those folks we also are
06:16 - working on tech prep with mckinsey we
06:18 - really studied what leads to a computer
06:20 - science path
06:21 - 90 of parents who want their children to
06:24 - learn cs but 77 have no idea how to
06:28 - pursue it so this is an online resource
06:30 - hub designed to reach parents we've now
06:32 - reached 1 million people in 50 states
06:35 - and i know that google and microsoft and
06:37 - other companies are talking about making
06:39 - really important investments and again
06:41 - i'm so grateful to susan and peggy for
06:43 - the partnership our companies have had
06:44 - on this
06:46 - we're at the beginning of our journey
06:48 - and the opportunity for us to come here
06:50 - and celebrate the people in this
06:52 - community who are leading who are making
06:54 - computer science accessible and open
06:57 - to the usual suspects we want everyone
07:00 - but also to more women and traditionally
07:02 - underrepresented minorities
07:04 - i'm really grateful
07:06 - when i think about all the problems we
07:08 - face and there are real problems right
07:10 - now
07:11 - i think about what makes me optimistic
07:14 - and what is core to being a technologist
07:18 - is that we believe that the future will
07:20 - be better than the past
07:22 - not perfect
07:23 - not the technology will solve every
07:25 - problem not the technology doesn't cause
07:27 - some of the problems we're realists and
07:29 - we understand all that
07:31 - but we believe fundamentally deep in our
07:33 - hearts
07:34 - that the power of technology is one that
07:36 - lifts people out of poverty gives people
07:38 - opportunity and brings us closer
07:40 - together
07:41 - and
07:42 - that will continue to happen due to the
07:44 - great work of the people in this room
07:46 - for which we are super grateful thank
07:48 - you
