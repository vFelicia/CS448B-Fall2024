00:14 - and communities across the united states
00:17 - are seeing the importance of computer
00:19 - science they want it in their schools
00:21 - and they want more computer science
00:23 - education opportunities for their
00:25 - students i'm having such a good
00:26 - experience this year that i might want
00:28 - to do it next year
00:29 - i tell my friends about this class like
00:31 - they should take it
00:33 - when you have your friends there it's so
00:34 - much easier to like understand like the
00:36 - material
00:39 - advanced placement computer science
00:41 - principle covers a wide variety of
00:42 - topics in computer science and it's
00:44 - designed with equity in mind it's
00:46 - designed for students with all kinds of
00:49 - backgrounds to be successful in it the
00:51 - way that the course is set up it makes
00:53 - it more approachable it's accessible to
00:55 - everybody and that's the coolest thing
00:57 - it's like anybody can take the
00:58 - curriculum and be successful
01:01 - a school needs to have teachers
01:04 - that are willing to teach computer
01:06 - science principles and go through the
01:07 - professional learning to learn the
01:09 - content
01:10 - the professional development that our
01:13 - teachers have gotten has been
01:15 - really a game changer they make it so
01:17 - that you can understand the material
01:20 - and they make it so you want to come
01:22 - back
01:24 - when a school puts in computer science
01:26 - principles it gets a lot of attention
01:30 - it's just opening a whole bunch of doors
01:32 - for these students that weren't they
01:33 - weren't open before their confidence is
01:35 - growing they are now seeing
01:38 - opportunities in the future that perhaps
01:39 - they hadn't seen before students want
01:41 - computer science they want to know about
01:43 - it so we need to find a way to make it
01:45 - happen so let's equip them to do it
01:47 - right and then let's just set our kids
01:49 - off to innovate and create
01:58 - you
