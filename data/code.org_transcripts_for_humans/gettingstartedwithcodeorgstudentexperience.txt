00:04 - hi I'm Ariana and I'm on the
00:06 - professional learning team at code.org
00:07 - in this video you will learn about the
00:10 - student experience using code.org I'll
00:13 - show you what happens when students use
00:15 - our site from when they sign in to when
00:17 - they start a coding activity what
00:20 - students see when they sign in depends
00:22 - on whether or not you have assigned
00:23 - curriculum material yet students will be
00:26 - taken to their homepage if you have not
00:28 - assigned them curriculum material here
00:30 - students can find a course on their own
00:32 - or they can start a project
00:35 - directly if you have already assigned
00:37 - material to your students they will be
00:39 - taken directly to the overview page for
00:42 - more information about creating a
00:44 - section or assigning curriculum to your
00:46 - students check out our video creating a
00:48 - class section on the overview page
00:51 - students can find all the chapters or
00:53 - lessons they've already begun working on
00:55 - in the course if they've already begun
00:58 - course content they can quickly continue
01:00 - where they left off by pressing the
01:02 - continue lesson button students can also
01:06 - click each lesson's purple lesson
01:08 - resources button to access the lesson's
01:12 - resources note that this is called
01:15 - student resources when viewing the
01:16 - button on your teacher
01:19 - account looking at the students view of
01:22 - the overview page we can see that for
01:24 - each lesson there are multiple types of
01:26 - levels some levels show information or
01:29 - videos
01:30 - others show multiple choice questions or
01:33 - free response questions others show
01:35 - coding activities and choice levels
01:38 - allow the student to choose between
01:40 - various activities this gives you as the
01:42 - teacher a chance to differentiate
01:45 - learning let's look at the most common
01:47 - type of activity coding
01:49 - activities this large area for coding is
01:52 - called the workspace there's also a
01:55 - display area and an area for
01:57 - instructions
02:00 - depending on the coding activity the
02:02 - experience will look slightly different
02:04 - because the material will be geared
02:05 - toward learning different skills as we
02:08 - look at the different coding activities
02:10 - notice how the layouts can change you
02:13 - can use the three dot borders in most
02:15 - work spaces to resize
02:23 - sections coding activities like this one
02:27 - targeted at younger students allow them
02:29 - to drag and drop blocks of
02:32 - code AS students learn more they can
02:35 - code using text or blocks when coding
02:38 - with blocks students can hover over them
02:40 - and see additional information and
02:43 - sometimes additional
02:45 - documentation some levels will tell
02:47 - students if their work is right or wrong
02:49 - as they code these validated levels are
02:52 - often found in computer science
02:54 - fundamentals and apcsa curricula and
02:57 - within our hour of code activities when
03:00 - students get incorrect answers these
03:02 - levels provide feedback in the
03:04 - instructions
03:05 - window in CS fundamentals you'll often
03:08 - find hints or helpful tips for students
03:11 - you can find these in the instructions
03:13 - panel typically signified by a light
03:17 - bulb other levels are more open-ended
03:20 - and require students to decide when
03:22 - they've completed the task in these
03:24 - levels students will click the orange
03:26 - finish button
03:30 - help and tips are often found in the
03:33 - instructions panel which is a separate
03:36 - tab one last thing remember that if you
03:39 - ever want to see what a student
03:41 - experience looks like as a teacher you
03:43 - can use the blue teacher panel on the
03:45 - right hand side of your screen simply
03:47 - open it up and click
03:50 - student if you have any questions about
03:52 - features you saw in this video or need
03:55 - additional support while teaching you
03:57 - can click the question mark in the upper
03:59 - right hand corner of your screen to
04:01 - access additional support and resources
