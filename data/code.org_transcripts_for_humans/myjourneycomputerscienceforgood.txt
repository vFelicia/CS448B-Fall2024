00:17 - good morning everyone i am so excited to
00:20 - be with you this morning my name is
00:22 - alexis minoka harrigan i work at
00:25 - code.org and i am so thrilled to be here
00:27 - with my
00:28 - colleagues maureen sturgeon and aaron
00:31 - bond for one of our several uh one of
00:34 - our many class chats that we're doing
00:36 - for our cs journey series
00:39 - um
00:40 - i want to get us started with some tough
00:42 - hitting questions right from the
00:44 - beginning but before i do um anybody who
00:47 - has questions or is tuning in from
00:48 - either their classroom or their office
00:51 - or their home please go ahead and feel
00:54 - free to put questions in the chat we'll
00:56 - try to get to as many of them as
00:57 - possible throughout today's discussion
01:00 - um
01:01 - but i want to start with an icebreaker
01:03 - and this morning i was chatting with
01:05 - some members of my team and we found out
01:07 - there's this company that exists that
01:09 - actually will carve
01:12 - people's faces and heads into blocks of
01:15 - cheese
01:16 - so my question for you is
01:18 - if you could have in your kitchen on
01:20 - your counter someone's head anybody's
01:23 - anybody's had anybody's face carved into
01:25 - a block of cheese
01:26 - knowing that you would eventually have
01:27 - to eat part of it
01:29 - whose head
01:30 - would you want sitting on your kitchen
01:32 - counter as a block of cheese
01:35 - i'll start with maureen
01:38 - all right that's a hilarious question um
01:41 - off the top of my head i'd probably say
01:43 - my roommate brian because i think it
01:46 - would be quite the shock for him to come
01:48 - into the kitchen and discover that he is
01:50 - a block of cheese so
01:52 - uh that's probably who i'd pick
01:55 - that's great
01:56 - aaron how about you
01:58 - this is so silly um
02:02 - i think i would
02:04 - go with my grandfather um because he has
02:08 - a very strange sense of humor he's from
02:10 - wisconsin so it would be fitting um and
02:12 - i would just like having him in my
02:14 - kitchen all the time
02:16 - that's great thank you both for humoring
02:18 - me with that fun and silly question this
02:20 - morning
02:21 - uh so let's dive into the first question
02:23 - i would love for you to eat yourselves
02:26 - share what your role is currently
02:28 - and how you got to the place you're at
02:31 - and we'll go ahead and start with
02:33 - maureen
02:34 - cool
02:35 - so hi i'm maureen i am a software
02:38 - engineer at code.org and let me tell you
02:42 - a little bit about my journey to become
02:44 - a software engineer
02:46 - um
02:50 - okay
02:50 - so
02:52 - let's go all the way back um in middle
02:54 - and high school i really did not know
02:57 - what i wanted to do
02:58 - i thought you know maybe i'll be an
03:00 - engineer maybe i'll do something in like
03:04 - the sciences um i probably want to go to
03:07 - college but i really didn't know what i
03:10 - wanted to do
03:12 - so i got into college and i started
03:15 - taking some classes a variety of classes
03:18 - i took on some chemistry classes some
03:21 - general requirements that i needed to
03:23 - take for my university i worked in the
03:25 - engineering department the first year
03:27 - and i took some math classes and what i
03:30 - discovered was uh quarter after quarter
03:33 - i kept wanting to take more math classes
03:35 - because my professor was just super
03:37 - awesome they were really fun it was a
03:39 - lot more fun than like high school math
03:41 - or other math classes i'd taken in the
03:43 - past it was super engaging and
03:45 - challenging in a way i hadn't
03:46 - experienced before and so about a year
03:49 - and a half two years in i was like you
03:50 - know what i'm going to study math like
03:52 - this is fun i want to keep taking math
03:54 - classes this is what i'm going to study
03:57 - followed by a moment of panic of like
03:59 - whoa what do you do with a math degree
04:01 - like who studies math that seems a
04:03 - little bit crazy
04:05 - and so i got a little stressed out about
04:07 - you know what kind of job am i gonna
04:09 - have by studying math
04:11 - um so i ended up chatting with a
04:13 - professor and said it was a math
04:16 - professor and i said hey i want to study
04:18 - math but like i don't know what i would
04:20 - do with a math degree
04:22 - and he was super nice and was like okay
04:24 - well let me connect you with some of my
04:26 - old students who have graduated with a
04:28 - math degree
04:29 - and you can talk to them about what
04:31 - they're doing so i connected with a few
04:33 - different people a lot of them had like
04:35 - a data analysis type jobs and i got a
04:38 - little bit more of an idea of what they
04:40 - do day to day and then the other people
04:42 - that i talked to were like my friends
04:45 - and the other students in my major and
04:47 - was like hey you know what are you guys
04:48 - gonna do with this major like what are
04:50 - your plans after school
04:52 - and what i discovered is a lot of those
04:53 - people in my classes were also taking
04:56 - computer science classes and at that
04:58 - time in college i'd never taken a
05:00 - computer science class that wasn't
05:02 - offered at my high school i really
05:03 - didn't know what computer science was
05:06 - but i was like you know what if they can
05:07 - do it i can do it so i started taking
05:10 - computer science classes
05:12 - and
05:13 - i loved them but this was kind of late
05:16 - into my college i was probably about 21
05:18 - when i took my first computer science
05:20 - class
05:21 - and
05:22 - so i didn't have time to do an entire
05:24 - computer science major so i ended up
05:27 - graduating um with a degree in math and
05:29 - a minor in computer science and i popped
05:32 - out into the real world
05:34 - and still didn't know what i wanted to
05:36 - do so
05:37 - i had an internship out of college um
05:42 - doing data analysis at a credit union
05:45 - and i really didn't enjoy that
05:48 - internship
05:49 - i didn't like
05:51 - the cubicle life i didn't like getting
05:53 - dressed up in uncomfortable clothing
05:55 - every day the time went by really slow i
05:57 - thought it was boring it wasn't very
05:59 - engaging
06:01 - and i thought you know this isn't making
06:03 - me happy i gotta find something else i
06:05 - really miss the computer science like
06:07 - the programming that i was doing in
06:09 - school i wonder if i can get a job
06:12 - programming but i only have a minor
06:15 - so
06:16 - i'll probably have to look for a junior
06:18 - or internship position
06:20 - so i started studying really hard this
06:23 - little guy in the blue with the blue
06:25 - faces me panicking trying to study
06:28 - um to get my foot in the door somewhere
06:30 - and luckily i had a friend from school
06:32 - who already had a job and
06:35 - a company reached out to her and said
06:37 - hey we have a software engineering
06:39 - internship and she's like oh i already
06:41 - have a job but my friend is looking for
06:43 - a job
06:44 - and so i interviewed for that internship
06:47 - that software engineering internship and
06:49 - got that internship and that was my foot
06:51 - in the door
06:52 - and
06:53 - i totally loved it it was like really
06:56 - cool office space i could wear whatever
06:59 - i wanted it was very relaxed it was
07:02 - really fun it was engaging the days went
07:04 - by really quickly
07:05 - and
07:06 - that sort of led me to where i am today
07:14 - it's uh really great to hear
07:16 - how people end up in their current roles
07:18 - both at code.org but particularly in the
07:20 - software field as well
07:22 - erin would love to ask you the same
07:23 - question who are you how did you get to
07:26 - where you are and what are you doing now
07:28 - sure um so i'm erin bond i'm also a
07:30 - software engineer at code.org i'm
07:32 - actually on the same team as maureen but
07:33 - have a very different path
07:35 - um to getting there so i'll share my
07:38 - screen and tell you a little bit about
07:39 - my journey
07:42 - um
07:43 - in middle school
07:44 - i really loved two things i loved
07:47 - reading and i loved dissecting things um
07:50 - my eighth grade science class had an
07:53 - award for most enthusiastic dissector
07:55 - and i wanted and i just thought it was
07:57 - fun and interesting to look inside of
07:58 - things and to see how how they worked
08:00 - and so from there i thought
08:03 - i should be a doctor so my plan was i
08:06 - was going to be meredith gray i was
08:07 - going to get to wear scrubs i was going
08:09 - to go leverage this background in
08:11 - sciences that i had and um
08:13 - made it to college and decided to major
08:15 - in neuroscience with that intent um to
08:19 - go be a physician
08:21 - until i got a summer internship at the
08:24 - science center and realized
08:27 - that i loved interacting with kids and
08:30 - explaining science to people and seeing
08:32 - that wonder and spark um
08:35 - in them and so i thought okay this is
08:38 - fine this is fine i like kids i'll just
08:40 - be a pediatrician
08:42 - but when i went back to my junior year i
08:45 - took an education course
08:47 - just as a humanities requirement that
08:49 - had a fuel service component where i was
08:50 - in schools elementary schools um working
08:53 - with students uh in order to get credit
08:56 - for this class i really really liked it
08:58 - and so after some hard thinking i sort
09:01 - of hummed and had and really i wasn't
09:04 - totally sure what i wanted to do but
09:05 - decided that i would try teaching so i
09:08 - taught elementary school um for a few
09:11 - years i had first and second graders
09:13 - which was really fun i even got to have
09:15 - my face on a cake one year for end of
09:17 - the year celebration this is my teaching
09:20 - team
09:20 - um and it was great but for me it was
09:23 - very exhausting um because i was with
09:28 - other people all day every day and 30
09:30 - different small humans needed my
09:31 - attention i just found out that it was
09:33 - really wearing out my energy stores i
09:35 - was just tired um and so i decided that
09:38 - i instead was going to switch to work
09:40 - one-on-one with students um so i started
09:42 - a tutoring company this is me on my
09:45 - scooter that i drove all around the city
09:47 - meeting with families and students
09:49 - helping folks who were struggling with
09:51 - reading and writing and um sort of
09:53 - staying organized and focused in school
09:55 - and what i liked about it was that
09:57 - one-on-one connection and i liked
10:00 - helping people who were having the
10:02 - roughest time in school and i liked
10:04 - finding ways to motivate students
10:08 - but i had one particular student who was
10:10 - not motivated not interested really
10:12 - obstinate didn't did not want to hang
10:14 - out with me
10:15 - and so we brokered a deal and i said
10:18 - look
10:19 - when you have a cooperative minute with
10:21 - me if you get your stuff done for the
10:22 - amount of time that we have to do then
10:24 - you um can have screen time and he just
10:27 - became a totally different student and
10:29 - so i had to ask him
10:30 - what are you doing on your screen that
10:32 - you love so much and he told me about
10:34 - this game
10:35 - called lightbot i don't know if any of
10:37 - you have ever played it you get a little
10:39 - robot to go through a maze and jump on
10:41 - these squares
10:43 - i started playing it all of a sudden it
10:45 - was three o'clock in the morning and i
10:47 - wanted to solve the last level and i was
10:48 - super into it um and so i understood
10:51 - like why is this so engaging and i
10:53 - learned more and more about this game
10:54 - and found out that it teaches
10:56 - introductory computer programming
10:57 - concepts and it kind of blew my mind i
11:00 - had never considered computer science it
11:03 - wasn't offered at my high school it
11:04 - wasn't offered at my college i just
11:06 - never been exposed to that possibility
11:10 - um and once i did i wanted more of it i
11:12 - wanted that problem solving that puzzle
11:16 - that sort of engagement
11:18 - and so learned to code as a grown-up i
11:20 - didn't write my first line of code until
11:22 - i was 28 years old at an organization
11:24 - called ada developers academy which is
11:26 - for folks who are interested in changing
11:28 - careers and as part of that got an
11:31 - internship at code.org um and have been
11:34 - there ever since so it's been about four
11:35 - and a half years um so far no one has
11:38 - put my face on a cake but i didn't get
11:40 - this cute picture from a school visit uh
11:43 - where we were beta testing some new
11:44 - tools and it's just been a really
11:48 - really interesting fun um satisfying
11:51 - blend of education and technology to be
11:54 - here at code code.org building tools for
11:56 - teachers and students in a way that
11:57 - suits how my brain works
12:02 - thank you both so much those were great
12:04 - responses and very different journeys to
12:06 - get to where you are
12:07 - i would love to hear a little bit about
12:09 - what
12:10 - george day looks like for you um i
12:12 - obviously i'm not a software engineer i
12:14 - said on our advocacy team where i get to
12:16 - talk to policymakers and try to pass
12:18 - computer science education policies i
12:21 - would love to hear what does a typical
12:23 - day look like for a software engineer at
12:25 - code.org uh maureen i will throw this
12:28 - question to you
12:30 - awesome all right i created a little
12:32 - diagram of what i think my typical day
12:35 - looks like
12:36 - so
12:38 - let me see all right so i would say
12:41 - actually the majority of my time is
12:44 - actually spent um researching and
12:46 - reading this might be googling for how
12:49 - other people have solved problems online
12:51 - or how to write
12:53 - logic in a specific coding language or
12:55 - something like that
12:57 - it's also
12:58 - i spend a lot of time reading our code
13:00 - base you know we have a really big code
13:03 - base there's a lot of code and in order
13:05 - to write new code and add features you
13:08 - kind of need to understand the whole
13:10 - picture you need to understand how that
13:12 - code is going to fit in with the code
13:13 - that already exists so i spend a lot of
13:16 - time researching and reading
13:18 - and then i spend a little bit of time
13:20 - like 10 of my time reviewing code it's a
13:23 - peer review kind of like you would do in
13:25 - school when you're reviewing each
13:27 - other's papers in english or something
13:29 - like that um we review each other's code
13:31 - and try to catch errors and for um for
13:34 - each other
13:36 - and then about 30 of my time is spent um
13:39 - actually writing code for the features
13:41 - that i'm building
13:43 - um then we got this little chunk up here
13:45 - about 15 of my time is spent in meetings
13:48 - where we plan and what we're going to
13:49 - build how we're going to build it how
13:51 - long it's going to take stuff like that
13:53 - and then i have 10 of my time is spent
13:56 - um collaborating with my co-workers
13:59 - maybe we're trying to solve a hard
14:00 - problem together or
14:02 - coding together or something like that
14:06 - so i kind of split this pie up into
14:09 - a blue section and a green section
14:11 - because i wanted to show that actually
14:14 - most of my day is spent working
14:16 - independently
14:17 - which works really well for me as an
14:19 - introvert i love you know collaborating
14:21 - with other people but it makes me really
14:23 - tired so i really like having this
14:26 - independent working time and then you
14:29 - know it's nice to be able to collaborate
14:30 - with other people every once in a while
14:32 - too
14:35 - thanks maureen and as a reminder for
14:37 - those who are tuning in from classrooms
14:39 - around the us please feel free to pop a
14:41 - question into the chat under the q a
14:43 - feature
14:44 - and we would love to get to your
14:46 - questions
14:47 - while we wait for those questions to
14:48 - come in erin i'd love to hear from you
14:51 - we heard a little bit
14:55 - things that you enjoy doing outside of
14:57 - your work day
14:59 - outside of work i love um being outside
15:03 - i have a toddler so we spend a lot of
15:05 - time going on little hikes and going to
15:08 - the farm and playing at playgrounds i
15:10 - also love scuba diving my husband's a
15:12 - marine biologist and so we spend a lot
15:14 - of time going on adventures when we can
15:15 - and looking at tide pools um and in
15:18 - general i also love
15:20 - writing so that passion that i had early
15:22 - on of reading
15:23 - has now stayed with me and it's
15:25 - something that i do uh outside of work
15:27 - as well
15:30 - anything interesting that you have
15:32 - written in the last year or two
15:35 - i write mostly picture books so i used
15:37 - to write stories when i was teaching uh
15:40 - to help sort of reinforce concepts or
15:41 - teach ideas
15:42 - and then have sense just do it for fun
15:46 - that's great
15:47 - thank you
15:48 - um one of the questions that came in
15:50 - from ann gorman
15:52 - are you happy with your career choices
15:55 - and i'll pose this to both of you aaron
15:57 - since we're we're with you let's just
15:58 - stick with you how are are you happy
16:00 - with your career choices
16:02 - i am i think one of the things that i
16:04 - always been mindful about as i'm
16:06 - thinking about my career is how it fits
16:08 - in with the rest of my life i knew that
16:10 - i wasn't going to be the kind of person
16:12 - who wanted to do my job all day every
16:14 - day and have it be the only thing that
16:16 - existed as part of my identity
16:18 - and so every choice that i have made has
16:20 - been one where i get to
16:23 - help people in some way i get to have a
16:25 - life that feels well-rounded and i get
16:28 - to challenge myself
16:30 - to learn and grow and so those are three
16:32 - criteria and so if you make your choices
16:34 - based on your values i think it's hard
16:35 - not to be happy with what you end up
16:37 - with
16:38 - you completely agree
16:40 - maureen knowing that your boss is
16:42 - probably watching
16:43 - are you happy with your career choice
16:46 - i am so happy with my career choice it's
16:49 - funny i like if you would have asked me
16:51 - what i was going to be
16:52 - you know 10 years ago i
16:54 - wouldn't i don't even know what computer
16:56 - science was so this is a really kind of
16:59 - unexpected path for me
17:01 - um but i i think a lot about like just
17:04 - how grateful i am to have found a career
17:06 - where i really do love what i do day to
17:08 - day i'm like super engaged um i'm just
17:12 - super grateful to have found the career
17:14 - that i've found
17:16 - i'd love to stick with you for the next
17:18 - question as well what are some of the
17:20 - challenges you faced along the way and
17:22 - how have you approached overcoming some
17:24 - of those challenges to get where you are
17:25 - today
17:27 - definitely um you know like
17:31 - my journey sort of showed for a long
17:33 - time i didn't know what i wanted to do
17:35 - and there was a lot of like trial and
17:37 - error to get through that
17:39 - um i think also getting my foot in the
17:42 - door with computer science was hard you
17:44 - have to have a lot of persistence to
17:46 - learn computer science and then also to
17:49 - get a job in computer science and you
17:51 - know i've had interviews that the
17:53 - interviews are hard and i've had
17:54 - interviews i haven't passed and you take
17:57 - a moment and you're like is this the
17:58 - right career path for me you know but
18:01 - you got to realize that when something
18:03 - doesn't work out it's just redirecting
18:05 - you
18:06 - to something better and to keep going
18:09 - for it
18:13 - thanks maureen
18:14 - uh one of the questions in one of the
18:16 - classrooms was asking
18:18 - another student is curious if
18:21 - most of your time in front of a computer
18:24 - and do you like spending most of your
18:25 - time in front of a computer um aaron
18:28 - we'd love to hear from you
18:30 - i have mixed feelings about this um i
18:33 - spend a lot of time you can see the
18:35 - corner of a
18:36 - cork board over there i've got a white
18:38 - board over here so in addition to
18:39 - spending time at the computer i'm also
18:41 - spending time
18:42 - mapping out how systems work or how i
18:44 - want things to fit together or what my
18:46 - plan for what i'm going to code is going
18:47 - to be
18:48 - i also do a lot of my best thinking when
18:50 - i'm out and walking so if i'm sort of
18:52 - mulling over a problem i might do that
18:54 - while i'm taking a stroll around my
18:56 - neighborhood um so
18:57 - yes and no i mean my actual coding time
19:00 - is clearly spent sitting in front of a
19:02 - screen but a lot of my thinking and
19:03 - planning and organizing and even some of
19:05 - my collaborating happens away from a
19:07 - screen
19:09 - aaron maureen same question are you in
19:11 - front of a computer all day long and do
19:13 - you enjoy that
19:15 - yeah this is a great question because
19:18 - you know i don't really enjoy the
19:20 - sitting in front of a screen part of my
19:22 - job but i feel that during the day i'm
19:25 - so engaged by problem solving that i
19:28 - don't
19:29 - you know my mind is somewhere else i'm
19:31 - imagining like all the potential
19:33 - solutions i'm super engaged so the
19:35 - sitting in front of a screen
19:37 - is sort of
19:38 - not a big deal i guess um and then of
19:41 - course there's things that you can do
19:42 - during the day you can go out take a
19:44 - walk you can get a standing desk where
19:46 - you're standing up
19:48 - um there's a lot and you know after work
19:50 - i'm not at the computer anymore so
19:52 - there's lots of ways to balance it
19:56 - thank you
19:57 - erin i'm curious what is a project that
20:00 - you're working on right now or a project
20:01 - you've worked on recently that you're
20:03 - really proud of or most proud of
20:05 - oh i'm excited to tell you i'll share my
20:08 - screen again um i recently worked on a
20:11 - project
20:12 - to teach ai and machine learning to
20:15 - students
20:16 - um
20:18 - and so oh gosh
20:20 - hang on um and so the way that it worked
20:24 - is for the first time code.org was
20:26 - teaching
20:27 - uh
20:28 - we taught computer science
20:31 - with um
20:34 - we did ai for oceans and so after that
20:37 - we decided that we wanted to expand more
20:39 - i'll just tell you about it um we wanted
20:41 - to expand more into
20:43 - uh ai and machine learning and so we
20:45 - decided to build out a middle school
20:47 - unit i don't know if any of you have
20:49 - done it
20:50 - where you can train a machine learning
20:52 - model and then
20:54 - use it in an app lab project to get
20:56 - predictions back
20:58 - and it was really exciting for me to
20:59 - work on because i didn't know anything
21:01 - about ar machine learning before i
21:02 - started this project and i also got to
21:05 - collaborate very closely with the
21:06 - curriculum team which with my background
21:08 - in education was very very fun for me um
21:10 - so it was a brand new space and i had a
21:13 - lot of collaboration and um we got to be
21:15 - very creative and so that was a really
21:17 - exciting project for me um you should go
21:19 - try it out it's in the csd curriculum uh
21:23 - yeah
21:24 - thanks erin we uh at code.org all got um
21:28 - little
21:33 - and my um i have two young children and
21:35 - they both love cuddling with a little ai
21:37 - robot and a great way for them to
21:39 - interact sort of in real life but then
21:40 - also
21:46 - um so we have another question from uh
21:48 - someone else on the chat
21:50 - uh marquez
21:52 - uh garrett
21:53 - as a software engineer how much time is
21:56 - spent in office with other people
21:59 - versus at home and remotely now this is
22:02 - tough given covet times but
22:04 - um
22:05 - maybe
22:06 - pre-coveted and post-covered um how much
22:10 - time is spent at home versus versus
22:12 - remote and
22:13 - how are you interacting with folks in an
22:15 - office
22:17 - uh let's go with maureen
22:19 - cool
22:20 - um well i actually started at code.org
22:23 - less than a year ago so i started remote
22:26 - i've been remote the whole time but um
22:28 - at a previous job i was full-time in the
22:30 - office so i was in the office
22:33 - you know five days a week and i i
22:36 - thought that was a lot of fun because
22:37 - you get to like you know swivel your
22:39 - chair around hang out with your
22:41 - co-workers and problem solve at your
22:43 - desk and usually the tech
22:45 - tech company offices are really fun
22:47 - there's like snacks and games and stuff
22:49 - like that um but there's pros and cons
22:52 - like i i like working at home you get to
22:54 - sleep in a little later which i like
22:56 - um and you have a little bit more
22:58 - freedom if you need to like do laundry
23:00 - during the day or you want to you know
23:02 - go out and grab lunch or something like
23:04 - that it gives you a little bit more
23:05 - freedom
23:08 - thanks maureen i really do like at least
23:10 - once a day taking a call over the phone
23:13 - and just walking around my neighborhood
23:14 - it's a nice way to get out and still be
23:16 - collaborative
23:18 - erin what about you um thinking kind of
23:21 - pre-covered post covid
23:23 - how do you um enjoy or dislike sort of
23:27 - the balance between
23:29 - office
23:31 - i used to be in an office um and then
23:35 - moved during the pandemic so now that i
23:37 - am fully remote i like being remote um
23:41 - i was doing it one or two days a week to
23:43 - begin with um and i find that
23:46 - it's nice to be able to collaborate with
23:48 - co-workers in person but i can get what
23:51 - i need to get done
23:52 - um from home fairly easily we also get
23:54 - together a few times a year as a whole
23:56 - organization
23:58 - so you have this really fun bonding time
24:00 - that's primarily social activities and
24:03 - so to have a little bit of a balance of
24:06 - spending time in person but mostly at
24:08 - home works really well for me
24:12 - thank you
24:13 - second to last question for maureen and
24:15 - then the last question will go to both
24:16 - of you um actually if we have time i
24:19 - want to ask both of you what has been
24:25 - in your and i'm going to say at code.org
24:27 - so
24:28 - maureen will start with you oh sorry you
24:31 - cut out for a moment can you repeat the
24:32 - question no what is the heart what was
24:34 - the hardest code for you to write
24:36 - oh
24:38 - oh my gosh
24:40 - this is going to be a hard one
24:43 - um
24:46 - you know i'll just i'll just think to
24:47 - some code that i had to write recently
24:50 - how about that um there's a lot of hard
24:52 - code that i've had to write but recently
24:54 - i was trying to
24:56 - uh solve a problem where it was sort of
24:59 - a data problem um there was a bug caused
25:02 - because we were needing a little bit
25:05 - more data in one of our databases
25:08 - um so there was already a bunch of
25:10 - existing data and then we needed to fill
25:12 - it in with
25:13 - a new column of some information to
25:17 - kind of complete the picture
25:19 - so i had to write a script that would
25:22 - run
25:23 - and fill in this missing information and
25:26 - i had to determine what is the right
25:28 - missing information for each of these
25:30 - rows in the database
25:32 - and that was that took me some time and
25:35 - also because our database table was
25:37 - really big there was like over 300
25:40 - million rows you know how am i going to
25:42 - fill in all of this data
25:44 - and do it in an efficient way and
25:47 - um
25:48 - do it correctly so that
25:50 - you know there wasn't any sort of bug
25:52 - that was created on the website so that
25:54 - nobody even notices that the data was
25:56 - filled in
25:57 - um so that was a challenge that i was
25:59 - working on recently
26:03 - thanks maureen and aaron i'm going to
26:04 - switch it up on you um we actually just
26:06 - got another great question again from
26:08 - ann gorman's class you didn't major in
26:10 - computer science do you wish you had
26:12 - majored in computer science
26:16 - i like this question
26:19 - my answer is no but
26:22 - um it is because
26:24 - i think
26:26 - for me personally i am interested in
26:28 - intersections right like how does
26:30 - neuroscience overlap with education how
26:31 - does education overlap with technology
26:33 - what are the places where ideas sort of
26:35 - cross and fuse together because i think
26:38 - those are the most interesting spaces
26:39 - for me to work in and so
26:42 - having this really varied background
26:44 - allows me to come to computer science
26:46 - and to the job that i'm doing now in a
26:48 - way that gives me skills and a
26:50 - perspective that's different than other
26:52 - software engineers and through that
26:54 - diversity of thought we then come to
26:56 - better solutions i think
26:57 - there's a ton of value in majoring in
26:59 - computer science and if you're
27:00 - interested in that absolutely go for it
27:03 - you shouldn't be deterred because you
27:04 - think it's hard or scary or not for you
27:07 - but also think about what are my other
27:09 - ideas and interests and curiosities and
27:12 - how can i fuse them together whatever
27:14 - they may be because i think that's where
27:16 - you're going to find the most
27:17 - interesting satisfying places to work or
27:20 - things to study
27:22 - thanks erin and the final question for
27:24 - both of you and i would ask that you try
27:25 - to keep it to 30 seconds or less
27:28 - what are some of the next steps that
27:30 - students can take that are tuning in
27:33 - if they're interested in pursuing
27:34 - similar career paths if they want to be
27:36 - a software engineer
27:38 - that's what they start doing now maureen
27:40 - i'll start with you
27:42 - sorry um i would say start taking some
27:45 - classes look at what sorts of options
27:47 - there are at your school or maybe
27:48 - outside of your school
27:50 - and explore some options i would say um
27:54 - listen to what engages you think about
27:56 - like that thing where you're like oh
27:58 - that's kind of interesting listen to
27:59 - that because that'll lead you in a
28:01 - direction to do something that you
28:03 - really enjoy
28:04 - um and then also ask for help like
28:07 - you're there are people around you that
28:09 - want to help you there are teachers
28:11 - there are parents there are friends
28:14 - um
28:15 - you know sometimes reaching out and
28:16 - being like how can you help me get to
28:17 - this goal um you'll you'll get some
28:20 - surprising help
28:21 - thanks maureen how about you aaron
28:25 - i think the other thing that you can do
28:28 - is
28:28 - start cataloging what your strengths are
28:31 - so not just what you're interested in
28:33 - but what are you good at how do you
28:34 - leverage them what could that look like
28:35 - for you um ask a lot of questions be
28:38 - open be curious um i think maureen said
28:40 - like i didn't even know it was an option
28:41 - 10 years ago i was super similar like i
28:43 - didn't you would ask me i would not have
28:45 - say said that i was going to be a
28:46 - software engineer um so be open to
28:48 - possibilities in different paths
28:50 - and um also
28:53 - yeah just
28:55 - follow those little tendrils of ideas i
28:56 - think that's where you're going to find
28:58 - what suits you
29:00 - thank you both so much and thank you
29:01 - both for being with me here today and
29:04 - all of the folks that tuned in from all
29:05 - over the u.s and around the world i saw
29:07 - we had some folks internationally
29:10 - uh thanks for answering these questions
29:12 - and i hope that the students who are
29:14 - tuning in
29:15 - um hopefully have one more option to
29:17 - consider in their career path and please
29:19 - tune in to future cs journeys class
29:22 - chats and with that i will go ahead and
29:24 - close have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

good morning everyone i am so excited to be with you this morning my name is alexis minoka harrigan i work at code.org and i am so thrilled to be here with my colleagues maureen sturgeon and aaron bond for one of our several uh one of our many class chats that we're doing for our cs journey series um i want to get us started with some tough hitting questions right from the beginning but before i do um anybody who has questions or is tuning in from either their classroom or their office or their home please go ahead and feel free to put questions in the chat we'll try to get to as many of them as possible throughout today's discussion um but i want to start with an icebreaker and this morning i was chatting with some members of my team and we found out there's this company that exists that actually will carve people's faces and heads into blocks of cheese so my question for you is if you could have in your kitchen on your counter someone's head anybody's anybody's had anybody's face carved into a block of cheese knowing that you would eventually have to eat part of it whose head would you want sitting on your kitchen counter as a block of cheese i'll start with maureen all right that's a hilarious question um off the top of my head i'd probably say my roommate brian because i think it would be quite the shock for him to come into the kitchen and discover that he is a block of cheese so uh that's probably who i'd pick that's great aaron how about you this is so silly um i think i would go with my grandfather um because he has a very strange sense of humor he's from wisconsin so it would be fitting um and i would just like having him in my kitchen all the time that's great thank you both for humoring me with that fun and silly question this morning uh so let's dive into the first question i would love for you to eat yourselves share what your role is currently and how you got to the place you're at and we'll go ahead and start with maureen cool so hi i'm maureen i am a software engineer at code.org and let me tell you a little bit about my journey to become a software engineer um okay so let's go all the way back um in middle and high school i really did not know what i wanted to do i thought you know maybe i'll be an engineer maybe i'll do something in like the sciences um i probably want to go to college but i really didn't know what i wanted to do so i got into college and i started taking some classes a variety of classes i took on some chemistry classes some general requirements that i needed to take for my university i worked in the engineering department the first year and i took some math classes and what i discovered was uh quarter after quarter i kept wanting to take more math classes because my professor was just super awesome they were really fun it was a lot more fun than like high school math or other math classes i'd taken in the past it was super engaging and challenging in a way i hadn't experienced before and so about a year and a half two years in i was like you know what i'm going to study math like this is fun i want to keep taking math classes this is what i'm going to study followed by a moment of panic of like whoa what do you do with a math degree like who studies math that seems a little bit crazy and so i got a little stressed out about you know what kind of job am i gonna have by studying math um so i ended up chatting with a professor and said it was a math professor and i said hey i want to study math but like i don't know what i would do with a math degree and he was super nice and was like okay well let me connect you with some of my old students who have graduated with a math degree and you can talk to them about what they're doing so i connected with a few different people a lot of them had like a data analysis type jobs and i got a little bit more of an idea of what they do day to day and then the other people that i talked to were like my friends and the other students in my major and was like hey you know what are you guys gonna do with this major like what are your plans after school and what i discovered is a lot of those people in my classes were also taking computer science classes and at that time in college i'd never taken a computer science class that wasn't offered at my high school i really didn't know what computer science was but i was like you know what if they can do it i can do it so i started taking computer science classes and i loved them but this was kind of late into my college i was probably about 21 when i took my first computer science class and so i didn't have time to do an entire computer science major so i ended up graduating um with a degree in math and a minor in computer science and i popped out into the real world and still didn't know what i wanted to do so i had an internship out of college um doing data analysis at a credit union and i really didn't enjoy that internship i didn't like the cubicle life i didn't like getting dressed up in uncomfortable clothing every day the time went by really slow i thought it was boring it wasn't very engaging and i thought you know this isn't making me happy i gotta find something else i really miss the computer science like the programming that i was doing in school i wonder if i can get a job programming but i only have a minor so i'll probably have to look for a junior or internship position so i started studying really hard this little guy in the blue with the blue faces me panicking trying to study um to get my foot in the door somewhere and luckily i had a friend from school who already had a job and a company reached out to her and said hey we have a software engineering internship and she's like oh i already have a job but my friend is looking for a job and so i interviewed for that internship that software engineering internship and got that internship and that was my foot in the door and i totally loved it it was like really cool office space i could wear whatever i wanted it was very relaxed it was really fun it was engaging the days went by really quickly and that sort of led me to where i am today it's uh really great to hear how people end up in their current roles both at code.org but particularly in the software field as well erin would love to ask you the same question who are you how did you get to where you are and what are you doing now sure um so i'm erin bond i'm also a software engineer at code.org i'm actually on the same team as maureen but have a very different path um to getting there so i'll share my screen and tell you a little bit about my journey um in middle school i really loved two things i loved reading and i loved dissecting things um my eighth grade science class had an award for most enthusiastic dissector and i wanted and i just thought it was fun and interesting to look inside of things and to see how how they worked and so from there i thought i should be a doctor so my plan was i was going to be meredith gray i was going to get to wear scrubs i was going to go leverage this background in sciences that i had and um made it to college and decided to major in neuroscience with that intent um to go be a physician until i got a summer internship at the science center and realized that i loved interacting with kids and explaining science to people and seeing that wonder and spark um in them and so i thought okay this is fine this is fine i like kids i'll just be a pediatrician but when i went back to my junior year i took an education course just as a humanities requirement that had a fuel service component where i was in schools elementary schools um working with students uh in order to get credit for this class i really really liked it and so after some hard thinking i sort of hummed and had and really i wasn't totally sure what i wanted to do but decided that i would try teaching so i taught elementary school um for a few years i had first and second graders which was really fun i even got to have my face on a cake one year for end of the year celebration this is my teaching team um and it was great but for me it was very exhausting um because i was with other people all day every day and 30 different small humans needed my attention i just found out that it was really wearing out my energy stores i was just tired um and so i decided that i instead was going to switch to work oneonone with students um so i started a tutoring company this is me on my scooter that i drove all around the city meeting with families and students helping folks who were struggling with reading and writing and um sort of staying organized and focused in school and what i liked about it was that oneonone connection and i liked helping people who were having the roughest time in school and i liked finding ways to motivate students but i had one particular student who was not motivated not interested really obstinate didn't did not want to hang out with me and so we brokered a deal and i said look when you have a cooperative minute with me if you get your stuff done for the amount of time that we have to do then you um can have screen time and he just became a totally different student and so i had to ask him what are you doing on your screen that you love so much and he told me about this game called lightbot i don't know if any of you have ever played it you get a little robot to go through a maze and jump on these squares i started playing it all of a sudden it was three o'clock in the morning and i wanted to solve the last level and i was super into it um and so i understood like why is this so engaging and i learned more and more about this game and found out that it teaches introductory computer programming concepts and it kind of blew my mind i had never considered computer science it wasn't offered at my high school it wasn't offered at my college i just never been exposed to that possibility um and once i did i wanted more of it i wanted that problem solving that puzzle that sort of engagement and so learned to code as a grownup i didn't write my first line of code until i was 28 years old at an organization called ada developers academy which is for folks who are interested in changing careers and as part of that got an internship at code.org um and have been there ever since so it's been about four and a half years um so far no one has put my face on a cake but i didn't get this cute picture from a school visit uh where we were beta testing some new tools and it's just been a really really interesting fun um satisfying blend of education and technology to be here at code code.org building tools for teachers and students in a way that suits how my brain works thank you both so much those were great responses and very different journeys to get to where you are i would love to hear a little bit about what george day looks like for you um i obviously i'm not a software engineer i said on our advocacy team where i get to talk to policymakers and try to pass computer science education policies i would love to hear what does a typical day look like for a software engineer at code.org uh maureen i will throw this question to you awesome all right i created a little diagram of what i think my typical day looks like so let me see all right so i would say actually the majority of my time is actually spent um researching and reading this might be googling for how other people have solved problems online or how to write logic in a specific coding language or something like that it's also i spend a lot of time reading our code base you know we have a really big code base there's a lot of code and in order to write new code and add features you kind of need to understand the whole picture you need to understand how that code is going to fit in with the code that already exists so i spend a lot of time researching and reading and then i spend a little bit of time like 10 of my time reviewing code it's a peer review kind of like you would do in school when you're reviewing each other's papers in english or something like that um we review each other's code and try to catch errors and for um for each other and then about 30 of my time is spent um actually writing code for the features that i'm building um then we got this little chunk up here about 15 of my time is spent in meetings where we plan and what we're going to build how we're going to build it how long it's going to take stuff like that and then i have 10 of my time is spent um collaborating with my coworkers maybe we're trying to solve a hard problem together or coding together or something like that so i kind of split this pie up into a blue section and a green section because i wanted to show that actually most of my day is spent working independently which works really well for me as an introvert i love you know collaborating with other people but it makes me really tired so i really like having this independent working time and then you know it's nice to be able to collaborate with other people every once in a while too thanks maureen and as a reminder for those who are tuning in from classrooms around the us please feel free to pop a question into the chat under the q a feature and we would love to get to your questions while we wait for those questions to come in erin i'd love to hear from you we heard a little bit things that you enjoy doing outside of your work day outside of work i love um being outside i have a toddler so we spend a lot of time going on little hikes and going to the farm and playing at playgrounds i also love scuba diving my husband's a marine biologist and so we spend a lot of time going on adventures when we can and looking at tide pools um and in general i also love writing so that passion that i had early on of reading has now stayed with me and it's something that i do uh outside of work as well anything interesting that you have written in the last year or two i write mostly picture books so i used to write stories when i was teaching uh to help sort of reinforce concepts or teach ideas and then have sense just do it for fun that's great thank you um one of the questions that came in from ann gorman are you happy with your career choices and i'll pose this to both of you aaron since we're we're with you let's just stick with you how are are you happy with your career choices i am i think one of the things that i always been mindful about as i'm thinking about my career is how it fits in with the rest of my life i knew that i wasn't going to be the kind of person who wanted to do my job all day every day and have it be the only thing that existed as part of my identity and so every choice that i have made has been one where i get to help people in some way i get to have a life that feels wellrounded and i get to challenge myself to learn and grow and so those are three criteria and so if you make your choices based on your values i think it's hard not to be happy with what you end up with you completely agree maureen knowing that your boss is probably watching are you happy with your career choice i am so happy with my career choice it's funny i like if you would have asked me what i was going to be you know 10 years ago i wouldn't i don't even know what computer science was so this is a really kind of unexpected path for me um but i i think a lot about like just how grateful i am to have found a career where i really do love what i do day to day i'm like super engaged um i'm just super grateful to have found the career that i've found i'd love to stick with you for the next question as well what are some of the challenges you faced along the way and how have you approached overcoming some of those challenges to get where you are today definitely um you know like my journey sort of showed for a long time i didn't know what i wanted to do and there was a lot of like trial and error to get through that um i think also getting my foot in the door with computer science was hard you have to have a lot of persistence to learn computer science and then also to get a job in computer science and you know i've had interviews that the interviews are hard and i've had interviews i haven't passed and you take a moment and you're like is this the right career path for me you know but you got to realize that when something doesn't work out it's just redirecting you to something better and to keep going for it thanks maureen uh one of the questions in one of the classrooms was asking another student is curious if most of your time in front of a computer and do you like spending most of your time in front of a computer um aaron we'd love to hear from you i have mixed feelings about this um i spend a lot of time you can see the corner of a cork board over there i've got a white board over here so in addition to spending time at the computer i'm also spending time mapping out how systems work or how i want things to fit together or what my plan for what i'm going to code is going to be i also do a lot of my best thinking when i'm out and walking so if i'm sort of mulling over a problem i might do that while i'm taking a stroll around my neighborhood um so yes and no i mean my actual coding time is clearly spent sitting in front of a screen but a lot of my thinking and planning and organizing and even some of my collaborating happens away from a screen aaron maureen same question are you in front of a computer all day long and do you enjoy that yeah this is a great question because you know i don't really enjoy the sitting in front of a screen part of my job but i feel that during the day i'm so engaged by problem solving that i don't you know my mind is somewhere else i'm imagining like all the potential solutions i'm super engaged so the sitting in front of a screen is sort of not a big deal i guess um and then of course there's things that you can do during the day you can go out take a walk you can get a standing desk where you're standing up um there's a lot and you know after work i'm not at the computer anymore so there's lots of ways to balance it thank you erin i'm curious what is a project that you're working on right now or a project you've worked on recently that you're really proud of or most proud of oh i'm excited to tell you i'll share my screen again um i recently worked on a project to teach ai and machine learning to students um and so oh gosh hang on um and so the way that it worked is for the first time code.org was teaching uh we taught computer science with um we did ai for oceans and so after that we decided that we wanted to expand more i'll just tell you about it um we wanted to expand more into uh ai and machine learning and so we decided to build out a middle school unit i don't know if any of you have done it where you can train a machine learning model and then use it in an app lab project to get predictions back and it was really exciting for me to work on because i didn't know anything about ar machine learning before i started this project and i also got to collaborate very closely with the curriculum team which with my background in education was very very fun for me um so it was a brand new space and i had a lot of collaboration and um we got to be very creative and so that was a really exciting project for me um you should go try it out it's in the csd curriculum uh yeah thanks erin we uh at code.org all got um little and my um i have two young children and they both love cuddling with a little ai robot and a great way for them to interact sort of in real life but then also um so we have another question from uh someone else on the chat uh marquez uh garrett as a software engineer how much time is spent in office with other people versus at home and remotely now this is tough given covet times but um maybe precoveted and postcovered um how much time is spent at home versus versus remote and how are you interacting with folks in an office uh let's go with maureen cool um well i actually started at code.org less than a year ago so i started remote i've been remote the whole time but um at a previous job i was fulltime in the office so i was in the office you know five days a week and i i thought that was a lot of fun because you get to like you know swivel your chair around hang out with your coworkers and problem solve at your desk and usually the tech tech company offices are really fun there's like snacks and games and stuff like that um but there's pros and cons like i i like working at home you get to sleep in a little later which i like um and you have a little bit more freedom if you need to like do laundry during the day or you want to you know go out and grab lunch or something like that it gives you a little bit more freedom thanks maureen i really do like at least once a day taking a call over the phone and just walking around my neighborhood it's a nice way to get out and still be collaborative erin what about you um thinking kind of precovered post covid how do you um enjoy or dislike sort of the balance between office i used to be in an office um and then moved during the pandemic so now that i am fully remote i like being remote um i was doing it one or two days a week to begin with um and i find that it's nice to be able to collaborate with coworkers in person but i can get what i need to get done um from home fairly easily we also get together a few times a year as a whole organization so you have this really fun bonding time that's primarily social activities and so to have a little bit of a balance of spending time in person but mostly at home works really well for me thank you second to last question for maureen and then the last question will go to both of you um actually if we have time i want to ask both of you what has been in your and i'm going to say at code.org so maureen will start with you oh sorry you cut out for a moment can you repeat the question no what is the heart what was the hardest code for you to write oh oh my gosh this is going to be a hard one um you know i'll just i'll just think to some code that i had to write recently how about that um there's a lot of hard code that i've had to write but recently i was trying to uh solve a problem where it was sort of a data problem um there was a bug caused because we were needing a little bit more data in one of our databases um so there was already a bunch of existing data and then we needed to fill it in with a new column of some information to kind of complete the picture so i had to write a script that would run and fill in this missing information and i had to determine what is the right missing information for each of these rows in the database and that was that took me some time and also because our database table was really big there was like over 300 million rows you know how am i going to fill in all of this data and do it in an efficient way and um do it correctly so that you know there wasn't any sort of bug that was created on the website so that nobody even notices that the data was filled in um so that was a challenge that i was working on recently thanks maureen and aaron i'm going to switch it up on you um we actually just got another great question again from ann gorman's class you didn't major in computer science do you wish you had majored in computer science i like this question my answer is no but um it is because i think for me personally i am interested in intersections right like how does neuroscience overlap with education how does education overlap with technology what are the places where ideas sort of cross and fuse together because i think those are the most interesting spaces for me to work in and so having this really varied background allows me to come to computer science and to the job that i'm doing now in a way that gives me skills and a perspective that's different than other software engineers and through that diversity of thought we then come to better solutions i think there's a ton of value in majoring in computer science and if you're interested in that absolutely go for it you shouldn't be deterred because you think it's hard or scary or not for you but also think about what are my other ideas and interests and curiosities and how can i fuse them together whatever they may be because i think that's where you're going to find the most interesting satisfying places to work or things to study thanks erin and the final question for both of you and i would ask that you try to keep it to 30 seconds or less what are some of the next steps that students can take that are tuning in if they're interested in pursuing similar career paths if they want to be a software engineer that's what they start doing now maureen i'll start with you sorry um i would say start taking some classes look at what sorts of options there are at your school or maybe outside of your school and explore some options i would say um listen to what engages you think about like that thing where you're like oh that's kind of interesting listen to that because that'll lead you in a direction to do something that you really enjoy um and then also ask for help like you're there are people around you that want to help you there are teachers there are parents there are friends um you know sometimes reaching out and being like how can you help me get to this goal um you'll you'll get some surprising help thanks maureen how about you aaron i think the other thing that you can do is start cataloging what your strengths are so not just what you're interested in but what are you good at how do you leverage them what could that look like for you um ask a lot of questions be open be curious um i think maureen said like i didn't even know it was an option 10 years ago i was super similar like i didn't you would ask me i would not have say said that i was going to be a software engineer um so be open to possibilities in different paths and um also yeah just follow those little tendrils of ideas i think that's where you're going to find what suits you thank you both so much and thank you both for being with me here today and all of the folks that tuned in from all over the u.s and around the world i saw we had some folks internationally uh thanks for answering these questions and i hope that the students who are tuning in um hopefully have one more option to consider in their career path and please tune in to future cs journeys class chats and with that i will go ahead and close have a great day
