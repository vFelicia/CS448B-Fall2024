puzzle challenge.
00:04 - This is the Code Studio artist puzzle.
00:07 - Your goal is the write the code the draw the
image in the run space on the left.
00:12 - Do this by selecting the correct blocks from

going to select 100 pixels.
00:41 - I can delete a block by dragging it into the
toolbox or the trash can.
00:46 - Let's put it back.
00:50 - Run the code by pressing run.

01:37 - Reset, run, awesome!
01:42 - Here's another puzzle.
01:45 - Sometimes you are given starter code to complete.
01:48 - Here I need to add the appropriate lengths
and degrees.
01:53 - You may sometimes accidentally trash the starter
code.
01:57 - What do you do then?
01:59 - You can press clear puzzle and start all over
