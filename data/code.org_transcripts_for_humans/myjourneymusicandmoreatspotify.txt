00:08 - hello everyone my name is meg i am an
00:10 - engineer at code.org and i will be
00:13 - moderating today's chat
00:15 - thanks to all the classrooms for coming
00:17 - out to our first my journeys clash chats
00:20 - of the spring
00:21 - teachers we have enabled live closed
00:24 - captioning for all of our class chats
00:25 - going forward
00:27 - today we are fortunate to have not one
00:29 - but two guests puja and himanshu joining
00:32 - us from spotify to tell us about their
00:35 - journey to where they are now what they
00:37 - do at spotify and how they use computer
00:39 - science in their jobs they'll also share
00:41 - helpful advice for students who might be
00:43 - thinking about a career in computer
00:45 - science
00:46 - teachers please please please put
00:49 - questions in the chat that come up and
00:51 - we will try our best to get to some of
00:53 - those at the end of the talk
00:55 - so we're going to start with some
00:57 - introductions and an icebreaker
00:59 - the ice breaker for today is because you
01:02 - all work at spotify who or what is on
01:04 - your favorite spotify playlist right now
01:08 - so i'll go first my name is meg i will
01:10 - be moderating i personally have been

01:35 - so so excited and happy
01:37 - to be here with all of you today i work
01:40 - at spotify i'm a senior engineering
01:43 - manager in the spotify advertising space
01:47 - so myself and my team we run
01:51 - what the ads that you see on the spotify
01:53 - app so if you are using a spotify and
01:56 - listening to music
01:58 - on the free uh version uh you will get
02:00 - ads while you're listening whether
02:02 - that's an ad you see or whether that's
02:05 - an ad you hear
02:07 - that's what my team works on we work on
02:09 - the engineering side where we write a
02:11 - lot of code to make that happen uh in
02:14 - terms of when you're listening what
02:16 - would be
02:18 - an ad that would be relevant to you when
02:20 - should we show that ad what should that
02:22 - ad be how should that ad look like
02:25 - um uh or sound like is uh what my team
02:28 - is responsible for it's a very exciting
02:30 - space to be in
02:32 - um i've been at spotify for five years
02:34 - prior to that i was working at microsoft
02:38 - for seven years and about 12 years ago i
02:41 - graduated
02:42 - from carnegie mellon university in
02:44 - pittsburgh and i did my master's in
02:46 - electrical and computer engineering
02:49 - uh icebreaker question love that
02:50 - question
02:51 - uh
02:52 - my spotify app actually has been
02:55 - hijacked by my two kids right now
02:58 - and what's on the playlist is baby shark
03:01 - for my
03:02 - little one uh she loves it she keeps
03:05 - listening to it over and over again
03:08 - whether or not i like it i also listen
03:10 - to it so that's what on my spotify app
03:12 - and playlist right now
03:14 - uh with that over to you
03:16 - himanshu thanks puja um
03:19 - so i just looked up my spotify's uh
03:22 - light songs and the top one is a song
03:24 - called doves
03:25 - from a band called we are all astronauts
03:29 - i love spotify for its discover weekly
03:32 - thing so every week there's new songs
03:34 - which i love to my heart
03:36 - but i have never heard of it so grateful
03:38 - to work um you know work here and you
03:41 - know contribute to the part of the
03:42 - journey so hey everyone my name is
03:44 - himanshu i'm tuning in from stockholm
03:46 - sweden it's about evening time right now
03:50 - i came here to work for spotify about
03:52 - one and a half years ago
03:55 - i'm a software engineer here but
03:56 - recently transitioning into this new
03:58 - role called developer advocate and which
04:01 - i can talk about later but i had not
04:03 - heard of this role when i was in college
04:06 - um so grateful to the all the people who
04:08 - help you know
04:10 - people like me
04:11 - trying to explore new things and hoping
04:14 - i can do the same today
04:16 - um i graduated from india about three
04:19 - years ago
04:20 - and i studied mathematics and computer
04:22 - science
04:23 - uh over there and at spotify i've been
04:27 - so you can imagine spotify is a huge app
04:30 - you can play it on your tv on your
04:33 - playstation phone laptop you know so
04:35 - many devices there's got to be like
04:37 - thousands of engineers
04:39 - putting in code to make that happen so i
04:42 - work on a software which helps those
04:44 - engineers do their daily job
04:46 - um and
04:48 - that's it over to you meg
04:51 - thank you all so much for being here and
04:54 - for sharing himanshu i want to throw it
04:55 - back to you could you maybe share a cool
04:58 - project that you've worked on with code
05:02 - sure uh let me share my screen um
05:10 - so
05:11 - i'm not sure if you all
05:12 - can you see the right screen uh you
05:14 - should have yeah you got it awesome
05:16 - thank you
05:17 - so uh
05:18 - when i was in college i got to know
05:20 - about this thing called github and open
05:23 - source um
05:25 - so the whole philosophy was that you can
05:27 - create anything you want
05:30 - and work with other people um so
05:33 - yeah i love open source i've been
05:35 - creating multiple projects when i was in
05:37 - college and most often than not not
05:40 - those projects came out of my own
05:42 - personal interest
05:43 - i'm not sure if you if you
05:45 - if you remember him
05:47 - but this this tv series called friends
05:49 - and i'm obsessed with it and i was
05:51 - obsessed with it as well and there's
05:54 - like 200 over 200 episodes and i've
05:57 - watched them the whole entire season
05:59 - couple of times
06:01 - but i wanted to watch more like random
06:03 - episodes from the from the series and i
06:06 - found that i when i was going into my
06:09 - directory and click finding the right
06:11 - season and clicking a random episode it
06:14 - wasn't so random at all i was always
06:16 - clicking in the middle and always
06:18 - clicking you know somewhere somewhere in
06:20 - the middle of my screen and i was
06:22 - watching the same episodes again and
06:24 - again
06:25 - so this is a tool i created
06:27 - to help me binge watch things so i
06:30 - loaded up all all the
06:32 - tv series that i wanted to watch and uh
06:35 - just i used to open this up and click on
06:37 - something and i wish to get like a new
06:39 - episode just like in the in the gif
06:42 - um
06:43 - so yeah and i also wanted to explore a
06:45 - new technology
06:47 - that's one of the reasons why i like
06:49 - open source and doing multiple projects
06:51 - is that
06:52 - you have to build something new why
06:54 - don't you build it in a new programming
06:56 - language and new framework for example
06:59 - so i wanted to learn javascript back
07:01 - then and this is what i created um
07:04 - and i put it up on reddit there's this
07:06 - website um not sure if if um there's an
07:10 - age limitation but i put it up on the
07:12 - programming subreddit and i said hey i'm
07:15 - new to javascript give me feedback
07:18 - and i got people commenting on my code
07:20 - helping me like you know refactor stuff
07:23 - and you know adjust things and make it
07:26 - better and all so
07:27 - overall this is the project i wanted to
07:29 - share um i think
07:32 - yeah if you're if you're in college and
07:34 - want to learn new things i think doing
07:36 - projects is a great way to do that
07:38 - what do you meg
07:40 - thanks for sharing him on you puja i
07:42 - want to throw it back to you and ask can
07:45 - you walk us through how you got from
07:47 - puja in school to puja at spotify so
07:50 - what courses you took what learning you
07:52 - had both in school and after school
07:55 - yeah i would love to share my journey um
07:57 - i do have some visuals so i will also
08:00 - take the liberty of uh sharing my screen
08:04 - um
08:05 - give me one second here
08:09 - and can you guys see megan yes we got it
08:12 - thanks that is me
08:14 - this is when i graduated um over a
08:17 - decade ago um
08:20 - from cmu
08:21 - um so my journey has been
08:24 - you know when i was in high school um i
08:27 - was very interested in uh
08:30 - engineering and logic in programming and
08:33 - physics math those were my favorite
08:35 - subjects um so while i was uh trying to
08:38 - see what do i want to do next
08:40 - a team that has been in my entire
08:42 - journey is
08:44 - learning from others interacting from
08:46 - other with others and seeing what
08:47 - they're doing that for me was
08:49 - exploration to see what is out there in
08:51 - the world what are all my options um and
08:54 - what excites me the most what makes me
08:57 - uh very happy within when i'm doing that
09:00 - um so i spoke with a lot of family
09:02 - members with a lot of peers my own
09:04 - friends people who were working in the
09:06 - industry joining sessions like these
09:09 - um to see what is out there what does
09:11 - software engineering even mean in the
09:13 - real world and that's where i learned
09:15 - more and i was clear that after high
09:18 - school i wanted to go into undergraduate
09:19 - and do my engineering so that led me to
09:22 - do electrical engineering i started off
09:24 - being very interested in the hardware
09:27 - behind the scenes what happens when um
09:29 - you're working with the you know the the
09:32 - actual hardware of computer systems what
09:35 - is inside the laptop how do you work
09:37 - with that i i remember tampering with
09:39 - back in the day we used to have walkmans
09:42 - um you know as a as the audio device no
09:45 - no spotify so i would just tinker with
09:47 - that i would open it i would start
09:49 - seeing all the capacitors start
09:50 - soldering it etc so that led me to
09:53 - electrical engineering and then after
09:55 - the first two years of being so involved
09:58 - in the hardware
09:59 - i got exposed to software and the power
10:02 - that programming had
10:04 - to operate those devices um
10:07 - so i started taking courses like
10:10 - objective oriented programming which is
10:13 - around java and c sharp
10:16 - sql databases i started getting my hands
10:19 - dirty into programming uh starting from
10:21 - very simple code whether that's with
10:23 - python and just you know make with
10:25 - astrix make a christmas tree um solving
10:28 - those kind of things got me excited uh
10:30 - and that led me to
10:32 - hey i want to do more of this two years
10:34 - is not enough
10:36 - in the last four years of my engineering
10:38 - so i decided to do masters in computer
10:40 - science and that's when i came to the
10:42 - united states
10:44 - in the master's program i got deeper
10:47 - into all of these programming concepts
10:49 - um and i took courses like you know uh
10:52 - operating systems
10:54 - um wireless networks um
10:57 - packet switching i was very interested
10:59 - back then in
11:01 - in wireless communications etc i spoke
11:04 - with as i said a theme was talking to
11:07 - people so i spoke with my professors my
11:09 - tas my classmates my peers
11:12 - where do they come from what excites
11:14 - them what are they doing
11:16 - what are my options basically that to
11:19 - explore and learn
11:20 - with which is the path forward
11:23 - that led me to my first job which is at
11:26 - microsoft then i became a software
11:28 - developer there
11:30 - um and i got an exposure into how do you
11:33 - do all of that programming in the real
11:35 - world building things that people are
11:38 - using
11:39 - um so that was a very very interesting
11:41 - and fun experience to be exposed to all
11:43 - of that i remember my first day sitting
11:45 - on the computer and be like i don't know
11:47 - what i'm supposed to do here um and
11:50 - there were things uh i still don't know
11:52 - you always learn um so the first few
11:55 - months i had to learn a new programming
11:57 - language c sharp which was similar to
11:59 - java um so i rely a lot on the 70 2010
12:02 - model uh a leadership model which means
12:05 - 70 of what you learn
12:07 - is uh by doing so you know stuff like
12:10 - assignments or projects is most of the
12:13 - learning happens there
12:14 - twenty percent is what you learn by uh
12:17 - you know talking to other people
12:19 - listening to their experiences uh how do
12:21 - they approach problem solving um etc and
12:25 - then 10 is through books through
12:28 - academics to trainings for courses so
12:30 - you know books like headfirst java uh
12:32 - for java and i had to learn c plus plus
12:35 - so essential c plus plus i took that
12:37 - book up design patterns i took a lot of
12:40 - courses
12:41 - to just teach myself on the job
12:44 - and after spending seven years at
12:46 - microsoft i am now at spotify
12:49 - um this is actually in the stockholm
12:52 - office himanshu where you are i'm i'm
12:54 - working from new jersey uh
12:57 - and i at spotify i've been here for five
12:59 - years still still very much learning all
13:01 - the time learning and doing software
13:04 - engineering so now my job is as i said
13:07 - earlier is these are the ads that i was
13:09 - talking about so when you're listening
13:11 - to spotify
13:13 - the ads that you see or hear what is the
13:15 - engineering and the programming that
13:17 - goes behind it
13:18 - so that's what me and my team um develop
13:21 - um so how do you see these ads what does
13:24 - the um experience look like um you know
13:27 - whether it should be a visual ad when
13:30 - should it play when you're listening to
13:31 - the song should it be at the 10th second
13:33 - should it be at the 20th second what
13:35 - happens when you click on the ad does it
13:37 - go and navigate to some place else and
13:39 - there's a lot that goes on
13:41 - uh from a software engineering point of
13:43 - view
13:44 - um
13:44 - [Music]
13:46 - and yeah that's been my journey i'll
13:47 - cover this later actually
13:49 - but uh
13:50 - the two things i would say a takeaway
13:52 - that has always helped me in that
13:54 - journey is uh trying to seek that
13:56 - clarity uh it is okay if you do not know
13:59 - what you want to do
14:00 - but attempting to explore and see what
14:02 - are my options out there and what
14:04 - excites me the most is my calling uh in
14:07 - the 12 years i did not know i would be
14:10 - here today um i did not know i would be
14:13 - in software engineering but it was a
14:15 - journey of trials and errors and seeing
14:18 - what works for me
14:19 - and learning uh
14:21 - during that journey and the second thing
14:23 - i would say is believe in yourself
14:25 - uh it's okay to make mistakes it's okay
14:28 - to not know what you're doing um but
14:30 - that's the fun that's the challenge uh
14:33 - each one of you bring a very unique
14:35 - quality um to everything that you work
14:38 - on and that's what in the real world
14:40 - matters everything that we're making at
14:42 - the end of the day is being used by
14:44 - people like us uh by people like you you
14:47 - are listening to spotify and that's what
14:49 - we want when we are building those
14:51 - things when we're creating those things
14:52 - we want that diversity to show in what
14:55 - we're building um so whether you're from
14:57 - a different part of the world whether
14:59 - you speak another language uh you come
15:02 - from a different background all of that
15:04 - is uh what makes you and what teams like
15:07 - us and people like us at spotify or any
15:09 - any other company looks for
15:12 - so try to seek that clarity and try to
15:14 - believe believe in yourself you can do
15:16 - it and that's been my journey where i am
15:17 - today and i'm very fortunate and blessed
15:20 - uh to be here
15:24 - thanks so much for sharing y'all we've
15:26 - got some good comments and questions in
15:28 - the chat so keep them coming i do want
15:30 - to shout out maureen garda's class they
15:33 - are in pittsburgh and cmu is in their
15:36 - hometown so it's very exciting
15:40 - we also got a question in the chat this
15:42 - is from uh lorenda hints
15:45 - um himachal i'm gonna ask this to you
15:47 - and then puja if you want to add on you
15:48 - can so you mentioned learning a new
15:51 - coding language do you find that
15:53 - learning a new coding language is easier
15:55 - if you already know another coding
15:57 - language
15:59 - um
16:00 - yes and no
16:02 - yes it's easier if you have worked in
16:04 - that area before so for example when i
16:07 - had learned
16:08 - java in school
16:10 - um
16:11 - and when i had to learn c plus plus on
16:14 - the job
16:15 - they were different but the principles
16:18 - of those two languages were very similar
16:21 - so it did help me understand that a lot
16:23 - faster
16:24 - but uh
16:26 - the know of my answer is
16:28 - sometimes there's so many programming
16:30 - languages
16:32 - that are out there python react node.js
16:34 - javascript and conceptually uh they're
16:37 - not always the same and that's okay
16:40 - so i've also had to teach myself uh
16:43 - python or scripting languages like
16:45 - javascript which are very different from
16:47 - uh object oriented you know
16:49 - objective-oriented languages like java
16:51 - um
16:53 - but it is you learn you learn in the
16:55 - process uh conceptually software
16:57 - engineer it's all within the same
16:59 - umbrella um so you you learn over time
17:03 - so i would say if you know uh
17:06 - something similar that helps but if you
17:08 - don't know that's fine too
17:13 - sure i think that that's spot on um i
17:16 - would something that i'm finding out
17:17 - recently is that there are families of
17:20 - programming languages so whenever
17:22 - someone is creating a new one um they
17:24 - are already influenced by something
17:26 - existing
17:27 - um so for example this thing called
17:29 - golang
17:30 - something that all the creators shared
17:33 - between them was they all hated c
17:34 - business i'm just saying that there is
17:36 - an influence um coming coming from pre
17:39 - existing languages so for example if you
17:42 - if you like javascript uh you would find
17:44 - that it depends or it takes inspiration
17:47 - a lot from python
17:49 - that just happened but if you want to
17:51 - learn something called erlang you'd like
17:54 - you'll be like what there's no for loop
17:56 - in here um so it's like a functional
17:58 - programming language
18:00 - tree and it's very hard to break into it
18:02 - if you already know like let's say c
18:04 - plus plus java or python because it's a
18:06 - different family of languages so it does
18:08 - help to you know if you know one
18:10 - in that family so i would i would
18:12 - recommend like trying out a very low
18:14 - level language like c for example but
18:16 - then try out something which is very
18:18 - high level like python for example
18:20 - um learning things from different
18:22 - families will help you uh understand
18:25 - like
18:26 - new if something new is thrown at you
18:28 - you can actually make connections and
18:30 - you know try to understand something um
18:33 - in in in this new thing that's being
18:34 - thrown at you that's just something to
18:36 - add
18:39 - thanks both for sharing i want to move
18:41 - to something outside of tech so i'm
18:44 - curious what do you enjoy doing outside
18:46 - of work what's something interesting
18:47 - about yourself himanshu can we start
18:49 - with you
18:51 - sure absolutely um
18:53 - so what do i do outside of work a lot of
18:56 - things i found out that i don't have
18:58 - like one or two hobbies and i'm
19:00 - kind of the person who likes to try out
19:02 - multiple things for example recently i'm
19:04 - doing a lot of gaming and there's this
19:06 - new pc that you can see in the
19:07 - background just arrived two weeks ago
19:09 - and all my weekends are just being
19:11 - sucked on on that computer um
19:14 - i like cooking a lot so i live in
19:16 - stockholm and my parents live in india
19:19 - and they like to know that i'm eating
19:20 - well so i cook indian food and just send
19:23 - pictures to make sure you know they're
19:25 - they're happy
19:26 - when i was in school i got into poetry
19:29 - um i found out that
19:31 - writing is a very
19:34 - writing is a great way to express
19:35 - yourself and sometimes you know it's
19:38 - it's very hard uh so yeah poetry writing
19:40 - short stories i had like unpublished
19:43 - short novels uh in school i no longer
19:46 - write that much but i found out that
19:48 - that really helps me
19:49 - um what else uh i like to play a lot of
19:52 - football soccer for you folks uh in the
19:54 - us um to play fifa and then when it's
19:57 - summer in stockholm also like meet my
20:00 - fellow spotifyers and we play together
20:02 - on a field
20:03 - um yeah i like to do different things i
20:06 - i think um looking at world from
20:08 - different perceptions is super helpful
20:10 - uh i would like to know how an artist
20:12 - thinks of the world and not just and how
20:15 - engineer looks at the world so that's
20:17 - why i'd like to try out things i'm not
20:19 - good at any of those things
20:22 - puja over to you
20:25 - yeah i can screen share again the sneak
20:28 - peek that i gave you the last time
20:30 - um
20:31 - just to give you an insight into can you
20:35 - guys see my screen
20:38 - not yet
20:39 - uh
20:41 - all right you see what's going on here
20:46 - okay this should work now yes we got it
20:51 - perfect
20:52 - so
20:52 - for me um
20:54 - it's traveling um
20:57 - which is changed in the last
20:59 - year or two but before that um i love to
21:03 - travel i love to explore different parts
21:06 - of the world so i've put a few pictures
21:08 - here together um
21:10 - where you know i'm excited there in the
21:13 - swiss alps
21:15 - to see the modern lights in um in
21:17 - finland uh that was a fun experience
21:20 - to do ice fishing as well uh in finland
21:24 - uh so i like doing things that the
21:25 - locals uh like doing i did catch a fish
21:28 - and i was the only one who did that day
21:31 - um
21:33 - the one below there with me and the
21:35 - camera i was into photography a few
21:38 - years ago uh was me in africa we were
21:40 - taking a safari in tanzania and i got
21:43 - some amazing pictures in that trip
21:46 - and to see you know almost lion king
21:48 - being played in real life
21:51 - and then we i have a few pictures here
21:53 - that's my son there enjoying pizza in
21:55 - naples
21:57 - or uh you know in greece all of this to
22:00 - say i just love love love traveling i
22:03 - think that to me um
22:05 - you know gives me that exposure to how
22:07 - things are in different parts of the
22:09 - world
22:11 - um outside of that i love uh you know
22:14 - spending time with my family um i have
22:16 - two uh wonderful kids and um
22:20 - i just enjoy spending time with them
22:23 - and what else i like running um that's
22:27 - that's where i think um i can just break
22:30 - from everything else especially when
22:31 - problem solving and coding it really
22:33 - helps me to put my mind at ease you know
22:36 - when you are stuck in a problem and you
22:38 - don't know how to get past it just
22:41 - taking that break going for a quick run
22:43 - uh when the weather is
22:44 - nice and warm uh and then come back and
22:46 - then you're able to solve it so i'm not
22:49 - a
22:49 - not a runner they're doing marathons but
22:51 - i just enjoy my you know few miles here
22:54 - and there um but that's that's me
22:58 - yay such a wide variety of interest
23:00 - thanks for sharing y'all uh we have so
23:02 - many questions uh i don't know if we can
23:05 - get to all of them but
23:06 - kevin braun's class asks we are watching
23:10 - from an all-girls school in dallas texas
23:14 - puja can you share your experiences
23:16 - being a woman in a male-dominated field
23:20 - that's amazing kevin uh thanks for this
23:23 - wonderful question i would love to share
23:25 - my experiences being a woman um
23:28 - um
23:29 - you know i think it goes back to what i
23:31 - mentioned earlier is just being just
23:34 - believing in yourself that has been my
23:37 - motto uh all along doesn't mean it came
23:40 - easy
23:41 - in the beginning um you know there were
23:43 - moments where i wasn't believing in
23:44 - myself i wasn't sure what i'm doing um i
23:48 - would be in you know classes where that
23:51 - ratio was off or be the only person in
23:53 - the room um being in a male dominated
23:56 - field a lot of that has changed now
23:58 - which i'm so happy about um
24:01 - uh but it really comes down to you know
24:03 - is believing in yourself as i said
24:07 - each in software engineering
24:09 - we build products we build code that is
24:12 - used by
24:14 - uh people those people are children
24:17 - those people are women those people are
24:19 - men
24:19 - um so if if we lack that diversity when
24:23 - we're building that code we will not be
24:25 - able to be successful
24:27 - for people who are using that code
24:29 - so when i understood that and realized
24:32 - that that was it that was the point for
24:34 - me where it doesn't matter you know uh i
24:37 - need to i need to bring that unique
24:39 - perspective uh when we are coding uh
24:42 - that only i have that no one else might
24:44 - have whoever else is in the room uh and
24:47 - that holds true to you know any other
24:49 - group it doesn't it's not just true to
24:51 - being a woman in a male dominated field
24:54 - it's where you come from as i said it's
24:56 - the languages you speak
24:58 - um all of that is to me very important
25:01 - it's a sense of belonging um i'm so
25:03 - proud and happy to where the industry
25:05 - has come to today
25:07 - um and i like to give back i'd like to
25:09 - make sure that um you know i am
25:12 - accessible um to those people who feel
25:15 - that way in the beginning um or at any
25:17 - point in their career now how can
25:20 - i help and support um grow that
25:22 - community even more
25:24 - um so to me it has been i will say it's
25:27 - it's all for me it was within that how
25:29 - do i gain that confidence uh to be out
25:32 - there and give give my best and
25:34 - everything else follows
25:37 - i've had a lot of sponsors uh
25:39 - women in senior
25:41 - leadership roles that i've looked up to
25:44 - i've reached out to them i still do
25:46 - um you know i i watch a lot of videos a
25:49 - lot listen to a lot of podcasts of
25:52 - ceos of companies who are women and that
25:54 - inspires me that keeps me motivated um
25:57 - so i think that that has been my
25:59 - experience it's actually been um very
26:01 - positive uh because it's the confidence
26:04 - that helps
26:07 - great thanks y'all we have another shout
26:09 - out from five mile town college
26:12 - and they're in northern ireland and they
26:16 - say it's really useful to get the idea
26:18 - of working in i.t beyond our we country
26:21 - so uh i wanna we only have a few minutes
26:24 - left so i wanna wrap up by asking if you
26:27 - could give one piece of advice to
26:29 - students who are listening it could be
26:31 - work related or not work related what
26:33 - would it be himanshu can we start with
26:35 - you
26:38 - sure um i think uh something that has
26:41 - worked well for me is uh
26:44 - the phrase goes by ask for forgiveness
26:47 - and not permission um it's a core
26:49 - concept in python as well sorry for
26:51 - getting too geeky at times but i have
26:54 - used it a lot of times by when i'm like
26:56 - reaching out to people for help uh so
26:58 - when i was in college in my first year
27:00 - let's say or freshman as you call it um
27:03 - they were seniors like who were
27:05 - graduating or who were joining companies
27:07 - and i wanted to know like how much
27:09 - academia is going to help me and how
27:11 - what should i do in projects and whatnot
27:13 - but they they were seniors and it's very
27:16 - daunting to talk to them at
27:18 - times sorry
27:21 - am i wasting their time are they even
27:23 - interested in you know talking to me
27:26 - so i've tried to you know just
27:27 - um assume that it's okay if they don't
27:30 - want to talk to and you know i'll just
27:31 - move on and ask someone else um so yeah
27:34 - ask for forgiveness and not permission
27:37 - when it comes to you know improving
27:39 - yourself and search
27:40 - so it has worked for me so that's
27:42 - something i would like to say puja
27:44 - what's uh what's your advice
27:47 - i think the two things that i mentioned
27:49 - earlier are according to me um so have
27:51 - try to seek that clarity what you want
27:53 - to do what makes you happy and believe
27:55 - in yourself so the new one that i'll
27:57 - throw in is have fun uh enjoy the
28:00 - process um you know there's
28:02 - there's a lot to do uh in software
28:05 - engineering um uh just make sure that
28:08 - you know every time you learn something
28:09 - new every time your code fails it does
28:12 - not build
28:13 - it's it's fun it's it's that process
28:15 - that you need to enjoy and
28:18 - uh make sure you're happy when you're
28:20 - doing it so just just have fun you know
28:22 - it's uh it's a very very amazing amazing
28:25 - field software engineering and computer
28:27 - science you can have so much impact
28:29 - whether whatever you choose to do work
28:31 - at spotify work it another company work
28:34 - it you know
28:35 - nasa or wherever
28:37 - code is everywhere um
28:40 - it's just enjoy that process
28:45 - great thanks so much uh we do have one
28:47 - question more and i think we have time
28:49 - for it this is from the shorter's class
28:51 - from in greenville south carolina uh the
28:54 - question is about was it hard to adjust
28:55 - to a new country in your field when you
28:58 - had to move and get a new job and it's
29:00 - coming from a female student who is a a
29:03 - asian american i'm guessing
29:06 - yeah i can uh take that on and i know
29:08 - himanshu you also probably have
29:10 - experiences you can share is it hard
29:12 - when you move to a new country uh yes
29:15 - uh it is hard um you know it takes it
29:18 - takes some time to
29:20 - understand the different cultures the
29:22 - different ways in which people think
29:25 - communicate
29:27 - etc
29:28 - i think the biggest challenge for me was
29:31 - in the beginning i was trying to fit in
29:34 - um and that made it harder but the
29:36 - moment i realized i don't need to try to
29:38 - fit in i need to be me
29:41 - and that's what people will appreciate i
29:44 - need to be real uh because
29:46 - it's for the people here in this new
29:48 - country they want to learn from me too
29:51 - and the moment i stopped trying to fit
29:53 - in is when everything changed it became
29:55 - so easy uh on myself
29:58 - and on others and that's when i started
30:00 - building relationships um
30:03 - uh
30:03 - in in those you know the networking with
30:06 - people
30:06 - that became a lot more authentic um
30:10 - that would be my response himanshu over
30:12 - there
30:13 - sure um
30:15 - i've had like multiple experiences of
30:17 - search being in us and now in europe and
30:20 - previously in japan so i've seen like
30:22 - different types of cultures and i'm just
30:24 - i'm amazed by how different they can be
30:27 - like you know east versus west uh kind
30:29 - of thing um so one thing that has helped
30:31 - me is to actually like do my research
30:33 - you know just on the history of the
30:35 - country like why do they behave like
30:37 - this and why is it this thing is
30:39 - important to them and this thing is not
30:41 - um just talking to people from the
30:43 - origin has also helped me you know just
30:44 - get that um
30:46 - perspective so i don't take things for
30:48 - granted you know something is important
30:50 - to me doesn't mean it's also important
30:52 - to other people um so that that
30:54 - mindfulness has helped me a lot language
30:57 - is tricky um so glad that
31:00 - a lot of people in sweden speak english
31:03 - but language gets tricky and if you're
31:05 - moving to a new country definitely try
31:08 - to learn the language i think that it
31:10 - will help you a lot you know just in d
31:12 - today task and you won't
31:14 - feel like a tourist
31:16 - in in the place where you're living and
31:18 - the last thing that i am always mindful
31:20 - of is that this is
31:22 - this might be temporary so i'm not here
31:24 - and stuck here for like years and years
31:26 - and i have control of like where i want
31:28 - to live um so yeah enjoy the ride maybe
31:32 - it's maybe you'll be somewhere else in
31:33 - two years so enjoy this new country take
31:36 - it as a challenge but you know also as
31:38 - an opportunity to know something else um
31:41 - know about new culture and new people
31:44 - all right thank you we do have to wrap
31:45 - it up i do want to say that student was
31:47 - african-american not asian american so
31:48 - qualities that student but thank you
31:50 - both so much for joining and for sharing
31:52 - all of your wisdom and advice teachers
31:55 - and classes thank you all so much for
31:57 - joining
31:58 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone my name is meg i am an engineer at code.org and i will be moderating today's chat thanks to all the classrooms for coming out to our first my journeys clash chats of the spring teachers we have enabled live closed captioning for all of our class chats going forward today we are fortunate to have not one but two guests puja and himanshu joining us from spotify to tell us about their journey to where they are now what they do at spotify and how they use computer science in their jobs they'll also share helpful advice for students who might be thinking about a career in computer science teachers please please please put questions in the chat that come up and we will try our best to get to some of those at the end of the talk so we're going to start with some introductions and an icebreaker the ice breaker for today is because you all work at spotify who or what is on your favorite spotify playlist right now so i'll go first my name is meg i will be moderating i personally have been listening to lots of broadway lots of disney recently moana's how far i go has been on repeat if you know that song so puja and himanchu please share a little bit about your role at spotify and give us your answer to the icebreaker puja could you start us off thank you so much meg first of all hi everybody my name is puja dave and i'm so so excited and happy to be here with all of you today i work at spotify i'm a senior engineering manager in the spotify advertising space so myself and my team we run what the ads that you see on the spotify app so if you are using a spotify and listening to music on the free uh version uh you will get ads while you're listening whether that's an ad you see or whether that's an ad you hear that's what my team works on we work on the engineering side where we write a lot of code to make that happen uh in terms of when you're listening what would be an ad that would be relevant to you when should we show that ad what should that ad be how should that ad look like um uh or sound like is uh what my team is responsible for it's a very exciting space to be in um i've been at spotify for five years prior to that i was working at microsoft for seven years and about 12 years ago i graduated from carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh and i did my master's in electrical and computer engineering uh icebreaker question love that question uh my spotify app actually has been hijacked by my two kids right now and what's on the playlist is baby shark for my little one uh she loves it she keeps listening to it over and over again whether or not i like it i also listen to it so that's what on my spotify app and playlist right now uh with that over to you himanshu thanks puja um so i just looked up my spotify's uh light songs and the top one is a song called doves from a band called we are all astronauts i love spotify for its discover weekly thing so every week there's new songs which i love to my heart but i have never heard of it so grateful to work um you know work here and you know contribute to the part of the journey so hey everyone my name is himanshu i'm tuning in from stockholm sweden it's about evening time right now i came here to work for spotify about one and a half years ago i'm a software engineer here but recently transitioning into this new role called developer advocate and which i can talk about later but i had not heard of this role when i was in college um so grateful to the all the people who help you know people like me trying to explore new things and hoping i can do the same today um i graduated from india about three years ago and i studied mathematics and computer science uh over there and at spotify i've been so you can imagine spotify is a huge app you can play it on your tv on your playstation phone laptop you know so many devices there's got to be like thousands of engineers putting in code to make that happen so i work on a software which helps those engineers do their daily job um and that's it over to you meg thank you all so much for being here and for sharing himanshu i want to throw it back to you could you maybe share a cool project that you've worked on with code sure uh let me share my screen um so i'm not sure if you all can you see the right screen uh you should have yeah you got it awesome thank you so uh when i was in college i got to know about this thing called github and open source um so the whole philosophy was that you can create anything you want and work with other people um so yeah i love open source i've been creating multiple projects when i was in college and most often than not not those projects came out of my own personal interest i'm not sure if you if you if you remember him but this this tv series called friends and i'm obsessed with it and i was obsessed with it as well and there's like 200 over 200 episodes and i've watched them the whole entire season couple of times but i wanted to watch more like random episodes from the from the series and i found that i when i was going into my directory and click finding the right season and clicking a random episode it wasn't so random at all i was always clicking in the middle and always clicking you know somewhere somewhere in the middle of my screen and i was watching the same episodes again and again so this is a tool i created to help me binge watch things so i loaded up all all the tv series that i wanted to watch and uh just i used to open this up and click on something and i wish to get like a new episode just like in the in the gif um so yeah and i also wanted to explore a new technology that's one of the reasons why i like open source and doing multiple projects is that you have to build something new why don't you build it in a new programming language and new framework for example so i wanted to learn javascript back then and this is what i created um and i put it up on reddit there's this website um not sure if if um there's an age limitation but i put it up on the programming subreddit and i said hey i'm new to javascript give me feedback and i got people commenting on my code helping me like you know refactor stuff and you know adjust things and make it better and all so overall this is the project i wanted to share um i think yeah if you're if you're in college and want to learn new things i think doing projects is a great way to do that what do you meg thanks for sharing him on you puja i want to throw it back to you and ask can you walk us through how you got from puja in school to puja at spotify so what courses you took what learning you had both in school and after school yeah i would love to share my journey um i do have some visuals so i will also take the liberty of uh sharing my screen um give me one second here and can you guys see megan yes we got it thanks that is me this is when i graduated um over a decade ago um from cmu um so my journey has been you know when i was in high school um i was very interested in uh engineering and logic in programming and physics math those were my favorite subjects um so while i was uh trying to see what do i want to do next a team that has been in my entire journey is learning from others interacting from other with others and seeing what they're doing that for me was exploration to see what is out there in the world what are all my options um and what excites me the most what makes me uh very happy within when i'm doing that um so i spoke with a lot of family members with a lot of peers my own friends people who were working in the industry joining sessions like these um to see what is out there what does software engineering even mean in the real world and that's where i learned more and i was clear that after high school i wanted to go into undergraduate and do my engineering so that led me to do electrical engineering i started off being very interested in the hardware behind the scenes what happens when um you're working with the you know the the actual hardware of computer systems what is inside the laptop how do you work with that i i remember tampering with back in the day we used to have walkmans um you know as a as the audio device no no spotify so i would just tinker with that i would open it i would start seeing all the capacitors start soldering it etc so that led me to electrical engineering and then after the first two years of being so involved in the hardware i got exposed to software and the power that programming had to operate those devices um so i started taking courses like objective oriented programming which is around java and c sharp sql databases i started getting my hands dirty into programming uh starting from very simple code whether that's with python and just you know make with astrix make a christmas tree um solving those kind of things got me excited uh and that led me to hey i want to do more of this two years is not enough in the last four years of my engineering so i decided to do masters in computer science and that's when i came to the united states in the master's program i got deeper into all of these programming concepts um and i took courses like you know uh operating systems um wireless networks um packet switching i was very interested back then in in wireless communications etc i spoke with as i said a theme was talking to people so i spoke with my professors my tas my classmates my peers where do they come from what excites them what are they doing what are my options basically that to explore and learn with which is the path forward that led me to my first job which is at microsoft then i became a software developer there um and i got an exposure into how do you do all of that programming in the real world building things that people are using um so that was a very very interesting and fun experience to be exposed to all of that i remember my first day sitting on the computer and be like i don't know what i'm supposed to do here um and there were things uh i still don't know you always learn um so the first few months i had to learn a new programming language c sharp which was similar to java um so i rely a lot on the 70 2010 model uh a leadership model which means 70 of what you learn is uh by doing so you know stuff like assignments or projects is most of the learning happens there twenty percent is what you learn by uh you know talking to other people listening to their experiences uh how do they approach problem solving um etc and then 10 is through books through academics to trainings for courses so you know books like headfirst java uh for java and i had to learn c plus plus so essential c plus plus i took that book up design patterns i took a lot of courses to just teach myself on the job and after spending seven years at microsoft i am now at spotify um this is actually in the stockholm office himanshu where you are i'm i'm working from new jersey uh and i at spotify i've been here for five years still still very much learning all the time learning and doing software engineering so now my job is as i said earlier is these are the ads that i was talking about so when you're listening to spotify the ads that you see or hear what is the engineering and the programming that goes behind it so that's what me and my team um develop um so how do you see these ads what does the um experience look like um you know whether it should be a visual ad when should it play when you're listening to the song should it be at the 10th second should it be at the 20th second what happens when you click on the ad does it go and navigate to some place else and there's a lot that goes on uh from a software engineering point of view um and yeah that's been my journey i'll cover this later actually but uh the two things i would say a takeaway that has always helped me in that journey is uh trying to seek that clarity uh it is okay if you do not know what you want to do but attempting to explore and see what are my options out there and what excites me the most is my calling uh in the 12 years i did not know i would be here today um i did not know i would be in software engineering but it was a journey of trials and errors and seeing what works for me and learning uh during that journey and the second thing i would say is believe in yourself uh it's okay to make mistakes it's okay to not know what you're doing um but that's the fun that's the challenge uh each one of you bring a very unique quality um to everything that you work on and that's what in the real world matters everything that we're making at the end of the day is being used by people like us uh by people like you you are listening to spotify and that's what we want when we are building those things when we're creating those things we want that diversity to show in what we're building um so whether you're from a different part of the world whether you speak another language uh you come from a different background all of that is uh what makes you and what teams like us and people like us at spotify or any any other company looks for so try to seek that clarity and try to believe believe in yourself you can do it and that's been my journey where i am today and i'm very fortunate and blessed uh to be here thanks so much for sharing y'all we've got some good comments and questions in the chat so keep them coming i do want to shout out maureen garda's class they are in pittsburgh and cmu is in their hometown so it's very exciting we also got a question in the chat this is from uh lorenda hints um himachal i'm gonna ask this to you and then puja if you want to add on you can so you mentioned learning a new coding language do you find that learning a new coding language is easier if you already know another coding language um yes and no yes it's easier if you have worked in that area before so for example when i had learned java in school um and when i had to learn c plus plus on the job they were different but the principles of those two languages were very similar so it did help me understand that a lot faster but uh the know of my answer is sometimes there's so many programming languages that are out there python react node.js javascript and conceptually uh they're not always the same and that's okay so i've also had to teach myself uh python or scripting languages like javascript which are very different from uh object oriented you know objectiveoriented languages like java um but it is you learn you learn in the process uh conceptually software engineer it's all within the same umbrella um so you you learn over time so i would say if you know uh something similar that helps but if you don't know that's fine too sure i think that that's spot on um i would something that i'm finding out recently is that there are families of programming languages so whenever someone is creating a new one um they are already influenced by something existing um so for example this thing called golang something that all the creators shared between them was they all hated c business i'm just saying that there is an influence um coming coming from pre existing languages so for example if you if you like javascript uh you would find that it depends or it takes inspiration a lot from python that just happened but if you want to learn something called erlang you'd like you'll be like what there's no for loop in here um so it's like a functional programming language tree and it's very hard to break into it if you already know like let's say c plus plus java or python because it's a different family of languages so it does help to you know if you know one in that family so i would i would recommend like trying out a very low level language like c for example but then try out something which is very high level like python for example um learning things from different families will help you uh understand like new if something new is thrown at you you can actually make connections and you know try to understand something um in in in this new thing that's being thrown at you that's just something to add thanks both for sharing i want to move to something outside of tech so i'm curious what do you enjoy doing outside of work what's something interesting about yourself himanshu can we start with you sure absolutely um so what do i do outside of work a lot of things i found out that i don't have like one or two hobbies and i'm kind of the person who likes to try out multiple things for example recently i'm doing a lot of gaming and there's this new pc that you can see in the background just arrived two weeks ago and all my weekends are just being sucked on on that computer um i like cooking a lot so i live in stockholm and my parents live in india and they like to know that i'm eating well so i cook indian food and just send pictures to make sure you know they're they're happy when i was in school i got into poetry um i found out that writing is a very writing is a great way to express yourself and sometimes you know it's it's very hard uh so yeah poetry writing short stories i had like unpublished short novels uh in school i no longer write that much but i found out that that really helps me um what else uh i like to play a lot of football soccer for you folks uh in the us um to play fifa and then when it's summer in stockholm also like meet my fellow spotifyers and we play together on a field um yeah i like to do different things i i think um looking at world from different perceptions is super helpful uh i would like to know how an artist thinks of the world and not just and how engineer looks at the world so that's why i'd like to try out things i'm not good at any of those things puja over to you yeah i can screen share again the sneak peek that i gave you the last time um just to give you an insight into can you guys see my screen not yet uh all right you see what's going on here okay this should work now yes we got it perfect so for me um it's traveling um which is changed in the last year or two but before that um i love to travel i love to explore different parts of the world so i've put a few pictures here together um where you know i'm excited there in the swiss alps to see the modern lights in um in finland uh that was a fun experience to do ice fishing as well uh in finland uh so i like doing things that the locals uh like doing i did catch a fish and i was the only one who did that day um the one below there with me and the camera i was into photography a few years ago uh was me in africa we were taking a safari in tanzania and i got some amazing pictures in that trip and to see you know almost lion king being played in real life and then we i have a few pictures here that's my son there enjoying pizza in naples or uh you know in greece all of this to say i just love love love traveling i think that to me um you know gives me that exposure to how things are in different parts of the world um outside of that i love uh you know spending time with my family um i have two uh wonderful kids and um i just enjoy spending time with them and what else i like running um that's that's where i think um i can just break from everything else especially when problem solving and coding it really helps me to put my mind at ease you know when you are stuck in a problem and you don't know how to get past it just taking that break going for a quick run uh when the weather is nice and warm uh and then come back and then you're able to solve it so i'm not a not a runner they're doing marathons but i just enjoy my you know few miles here and there um but that's that's me yay such a wide variety of interest thanks for sharing y'all uh we have so many questions uh i don't know if we can get to all of them but kevin braun's class asks we are watching from an allgirls school in dallas texas puja can you share your experiences being a woman in a maledominated field that's amazing kevin uh thanks for this wonderful question i would love to share my experiences being a woman um um you know i think it goes back to what i mentioned earlier is just being just believing in yourself that has been my motto uh all along doesn't mean it came easy in the beginning um you know there were moments where i wasn't believing in myself i wasn't sure what i'm doing um i would be in you know classes where that ratio was off or be the only person in the room um being in a male dominated field a lot of that has changed now which i'm so happy about um uh but it really comes down to you know is believing in yourself as i said each in software engineering we build products we build code that is used by uh people those people are children those people are women those people are men um so if if we lack that diversity when we're building that code we will not be able to be successful for people who are using that code so when i understood that and realized that that was it that was the point for me where it doesn't matter you know uh i need to i need to bring that unique perspective uh when we are coding uh that only i have that no one else might have whoever else is in the room uh and that holds true to you know any other group it doesn't it's not just true to being a woman in a male dominated field it's where you come from as i said it's the languages you speak um all of that is to me very important it's a sense of belonging um i'm so proud and happy to where the industry has come to today um and i like to give back i'd like to make sure that um you know i am accessible um to those people who feel that way in the beginning um or at any point in their career now how can i help and support um grow that community even more um so to me it has been i will say it's it's all for me it was within that how do i gain that confidence uh to be out there and give give my best and everything else follows i've had a lot of sponsors uh women in senior leadership roles that i've looked up to i've reached out to them i still do um you know i i watch a lot of videos a lot listen to a lot of podcasts of ceos of companies who are women and that inspires me that keeps me motivated um so i think that that has been my experience it's actually been um very positive uh because it's the confidence that helps great thanks y'all we have another shout out from five mile town college and they're in northern ireland and they say it's really useful to get the idea of working in i.t beyond our we country so uh i wanna we only have a few minutes left so i wanna wrap up by asking if you could give one piece of advice to students who are listening it could be work related or not work related what would it be himanshu can we start with you sure um i think uh something that has worked well for me is uh the phrase goes by ask for forgiveness and not permission um it's a core concept in python as well sorry for getting too geeky at times but i have used it a lot of times by when i'm like reaching out to people for help uh so when i was in college in my first year let's say or freshman as you call it um they were seniors like who were graduating or who were joining companies and i wanted to know like how much academia is going to help me and how what should i do in projects and whatnot but they they were seniors and it's very daunting to talk to them at times sorry am i wasting their time are they even interested in you know talking to me so i've tried to you know just um assume that it's okay if they don't want to talk to and you know i'll just move on and ask someone else um so yeah ask for forgiveness and not permission when it comes to you know improving yourself and search so it has worked for me so that's something i would like to say puja what's uh what's your advice i think the two things that i mentioned earlier are according to me um so have try to seek that clarity what you want to do what makes you happy and believe in yourself so the new one that i'll throw in is have fun uh enjoy the process um you know there's there's a lot to do uh in software engineering um uh just make sure that you know every time you learn something new every time your code fails it does not build it's it's fun it's it's that process that you need to enjoy and uh make sure you're happy when you're doing it so just just have fun you know it's uh it's a very very amazing amazing field software engineering and computer science you can have so much impact whether whatever you choose to do work at spotify work it another company work it you know nasa or wherever code is everywhere um it's just enjoy that process great thanks so much uh we do have one question more and i think we have time for it this is from the shorter's class from in greenville south carolina uh the question is about was it hard to adjust to a new country in your field when you had to move and get a new job and it's coming from a female student who is a a asian american i'm guessing yeah i can uh take that on and i know himanshu you also probably have experiences you can share is it hard when you move to a new country uh yes uh it is hard um you know it takes it takes some time to understand the different cultures the different ways in which people think communicate etc i think the biggest challenge for me was in the beginning i was trying to fit in um and that made it harder but the moment i realized i don't need to try to fit in i need to be me and that's what people will appreciate i need to be real uh because it's for the people here in this new country they want to learn from me too and the moment i stopped trying to fit in is when everything changed it became so easy uh on myself and on others and that's when i started building relationships um uh in in those you know the networking with people that became a lot more authentic um that would be my response himanshu over there sure um i've had like multiple experiences of search being in us and now in europe and previously in japan so i've seen like different types of cultures and i'm just i'm amazed by how different they can be like you know east versus west uh kind of thing um so one thing that has helped me is to actually like do my research you know just on the history of the country like why do they behave like this and why is it this thing is important to them and this thing is not um just talking to people from the origin has also helped me you know just get that um perspective so i don't take things for granted you know something is important to me doesn't mean it's also important to other people um so that that mindfulness has helped me a lot language is tricky um so glad that a lot of people in sweden speak english but language gets tricky and if you're moving to a new country definitely try to learn the language i think that it will help you a lot you know just in d today task and you won't feel like a tourist in in the place where you're living and the last thing that i am always mindful of is that this is this might be temporary so i'm not here and stuck here for like years and years and i have control of like where i want to live um so yeah enjoy the ride maybe it's maybe you'll be somewhere else in two years so enjoy this new country take it as a challenge but you know also as an opportunity to know something else um know about new culture and new people all right thank you we do have to wrap it up i do want to say that student was africanamerican not asian american so qualities that student but thank you both so much for joining and for sharing all of your wisdom and advice teachers and classes thank you all so much for joining bye
