03:04 - my my good sorry we're muted we're
03:07 - M thank you Kendall for telling us that
03:11 - um we will not repeat and start at the
03:12 - beginning
03:14 - again thank you all right GNA rewind try
03:18 - that
03:19 - again AL righty all right I'm c i
03:22 - coordinate our hour of code campaign
03:24 - code.org I'm Tanya Parker I am a product
03:27 - manager and engineer here at cator hi
03:30 - I'm Alice I run our product and
03:32 - marketing teams here at code.org all
03:34 - right well thank you so much everybody
03:35 - thank you especially the people who gave
03:37 - us a heads up we were muted we're
03:38 - excited to jump back in um our quick
03:41 - agenda as we're going to go over what to
03:43 - do before your hour of code what to do
03:45 - in the classroom um and then we can do a
03:48 - bit of questions and answers you guys
03:49 - have already found the Q&A part and then
03:52 - the other app you might want to look at
03:53 - is our showcase that's where we are
03:55 - showing links that might be helpful for
03:56 - you so hopefully everyone on this
03:59 - webinar has already been contacted by a
04:01 - teacher and you've already started
04:02 - coordinating Alice is going to go over a
04:04 - few tips if you haven't yet been
04:06 - contacted but you still want to
04:07 - volunteer okay so we know some of you
04:09 - guys have not been contacted um it's a
04:12 - tough one because a lot of our
04:14 - volunteers tend to be in Tech regions
04:16 - like Seattle or San Francisco um whereas
04:19 - I was just talking to a teacher
04:20 - yesterday in rural Georgia who has not
04:22 - managed to find a volunteer yet for her
04:24 - classroom and so we're encouraging those
04:25 - teachers that are spread out all over
04:27 - the world to reach out remotely because
04:29 - you know where the teachers are is not
04:31 - necessarily where the volunteers are um
04:33 - if you are in a remote place and um some
04:36 - of the teachers have said they've
04:37 - reached out but they volunteer was
04:39 - already volunteering in another
04:40 - classroom if you can volunteer in more
04:42 - than one classroom I know the teachers
04:43 - would appreciate it if you are in a tech
04:46 - Hub and you haven't been reached um two
04:48 - things you can do one is um please uh
04:51 - you know just hang on we're trying to
04:54 - encourage the teachers to reach out
04:55 - doing remote uh chats they may or may
04:57 - not want to do that um thank you for
04:59 - volunteering we really appreciate it if
05:01 - you don't get contacted now um we'll be
05:03 - in contact with you maybe you can
05:04 - volunteer for hour of code next year um
05:06 - we'll also ask you if you're interested
05:07 - in other opportunities and we'll see if
05:08 - there's other ways you can help a school
05:11 - um the other thing you can do is you can
05:12 - proactively reach out to a school uh we
05:15 - can't list for privacy reasons all of
05:17 - the school addresses that are doing hour
05:18 - of code on our website but if you just
05:20 - reach out to your local school
05:22 - oftentimes they will be doing the hour
05:23 - of code and they would love your help or
05:26 - um maybe they're not doing the hour of
05:27 - code and you reaching out to them will
05:30 - you can help them figure out how to do
05:31 - the hour of code and do it with a
05:33 - classroom I've done you know in my
05:35 - experience I personally have reached out
05:36 - to a bunch of schools classrooms and
05:39 - they've always been excited about the
05:41 - idea of of having somebody come in and
05:43 - do an hour of code with the classroom so
05:46 - um I'd recommend you just try reaching
05:47 - out to a local school but thank you
05:48 - again for volunteering if you have not
05:50 - been contacted all right so thank you so
05:53 - much Alice for kind of going watch if
05:54 - you haven't been contacted if you're
05:56 - already in contact with your school we
05:58 - want to review kind of the step you need
06:00 - to make sure you've taken care of before
06:01 - you show up next week so first and
06:03 - foremost it's really important that
06:05 - you've identified with your teacher a
06:06 - day and a time you can you can go to her
06:09 - class um be sure to give yourself a
06:11 - little bit of time to show up before
06:13 - you'll need to sign in at the front
06:14 - office even before you get to the
06:16 - classroom every school's most likely
06:19 - going to have you fill out some sort of
06:20 - form before you arrive for outside
06:22 - volunteers if you haven't done that
06:24 - already it's really important that you
06:25 - contact your teacher today to make sure
06:27 - you filled out all the paperwork so you
06:29 - can show up without a hitch next week um
06:32 - be sure you've talked to your teacher
06:34 - about kind of what he or she is
06:35 - expecting when you're in the classroom
06:37 - um this volunteer program is first and
06:39 - foremost an opportunity for you to show
06:41 - students what all of the opportunities
06:43 - are with computer science and so it's
06:44 - much more of an inspirational and a
06:46 - mentorship opportunity than necessarily
06:48 - providing technical help in the
06:50 - classroom so we want to make sure that
06:52 - expectation is clear with teachers as
06:53 - well and then finally this weekend is
06:55 - your chance to try the hour of code
06:57 - tutorials so we've got a awesome brand
06:59 - new tutorials for students who can read
07:02 - our Minecraft and Star Wars tutorials
07:04 - have been a hit we're already seeing
07:05 - students who've tried them and teachers
07:07 - who've tried them loving it um if you're
07:09 - working with pre-readers um the foods is
07:11 - another great opportunity and all of our
07:13 - tutorials are listed at code.org learn
07:16 - so please do check it out so that you're
07:17 - not totally um lost in the woods when
07:20 - you show up next week the last thing
07:22 - we've linked to in our showcase bar is
07:25 - um kind of a list of tips that we
07:27 - another one of our partners has put
07:29 - together this is an awesome document you
07:30 - can review to think about what you want
07:32 - to do in your classroom um it's kind of
07:34 - a sample agenda some things they suggest
07:36 - when you show up are talking about um
07:39 - both what you do professionally and how
07:40 - computer science interacts with your
07:42 - day-to-day but also what you're doing
07:44 - outside of work to kind of showcase that
07:46 - you know people who are doing computer
07:47 - science are doing all sorts of things
07:49 - beyond computer science as well Kate I'm
07:51 - confused I thought people do computer
07:53 - science just sit in a basement all day
07:55 - in the dark preferably well that's all
07:57 - they do Alice that's exactly why we have
07:59 - this volunteer program is the our of
08:01 - code is all about smashing stereotypes
08:03 - of computer science and so we really
08:05 - want to show students that computer
08:07 - science is not just a nerdy activity
08:09 - although if you want to sit in the
08:10 - basement and code away you have that's
08:14 - the option but our code is so much about
08:16 - introducing students especially students
08:18 - who may be not as inclined to try
08:20 - computer science because they don't
08:21 - usually see people who look like them or
08:23 - do things that are interesting for them
08:25 - and so you know talk about what computer
08:27 - science is not just from a coding
08:28 - perspective but what kind of products
08:29 - are you creating what kind of
08:31 - experiences are you creating what kind
08:32 - of what's your favorite fun project
08:35 - you've created with computer science um
08:37 - we really want to show students that you
08:38 - know this is a discipline that's not
08:40 - just for the Nerds it's not just for you
08:43 - know the people who've been doing it for
08:44 - the last 30 years anybody can learn and
08:46 - everybody should learn yeah one of the
08:47 - things I like to do when I go into a
08:48 - classroom is I start out like I tell the
08:51 - story I'm sure a lot of you guys have a
08:53 - similar story of what the first program
08:54 - you ever made was um and um and the
08:58 - reason to share that is often times it's
08:59 - a game or something fun or something
09:01 - that really relates to kids because
09:02 - they're the same age uh my first one was
09:05 - uh when I was in seventh grade and I
09:06 - figured out how to make my computer if
09:08 - my brother my little brother tried to
09:10 - break into it um it would beep really
09:12 - loudly and then a big letters ask Art
09:15 - would say SES you are trying to break
09:17 - into my computer this incursion has been
09:19 - logged um and so you know that kind of
09:21 - story is just fun it makes it seem more
09:23 - relatable um or if you know you build an
09:25 - app or if you done something that
09:27 - relates something youd actually want to
09:28 - do um those are really fun and you can
09:30 - also share happy outside of work you
09:32 - know like hey I'm really into whatever
09:34 - it is um knitting art you know you name
09:37 - it whatever you do outside of work
09:38 - photography um and then and then that
09:41 - just makes you seem more human which is
09:42 - great absolutely um so like again we've
09:45 - listed in our showcase tab this list of
09:49 - it's the Vol it's a volunteer file that
09:51 - you can see us teaching chips so please
09:53 - check that out um now we're GNA I see we
09:57 - already have some questions in there
09:58 - we're just going to go through a quick
09:59 - little more on the agenda and then we'll
10:01 - get to everybody's questions um when
10:04 - you're thinking about what to bring to
10:05 - your day of if you're working for a
10:07 - company um it'd be awesome if you want
10:09 - to bring some swag students pretty much
10:11 - of all ages love stickers pens anything
10:14 - else you want to bring to the classroom
10:16 - um again like Elsa bring your personal
10:18 - story how did you get into computer
10:20 - science um and definitely bring your
10:23 - enthusiasm so we're going to do a brief
10:26 - section on kind of day of what does it
10:27 - look like while you're actually there um
10:30 - so sign in to your school and greet the
10:32 - teacher um and just confirm the agreed
10:34 - schedule spend 5 to 10 minutes talking
10:37 - about computer science with the
10:39 - introduction share a short story share
10:41 - how CS has many broad implications um
10:45 - actually you know before you do that
10:46 - there's a u before you actually start
10:48 - talking I think the best way to start
10:50 - off is we've got a bunch of videos these
10:51 - inspirational videos um and okay so
10:55 - depending on the age of the classroom
10:56 - you got a bunch of kids they're loud
10:58 - they're noisy they're s everywhere the
10:59 - teacher usually pretty good at getting
11:00 - them to like pay attention um if you
11:02 - haven't been in a classroom in a long
11:04 - time it's kind of fun you know there'll
11:06 - be a little bit of like you know you
11:08 - know uh one two three look at me you
11:11 - know kind of thing that they cootes
11:12 - quiet coyotes um yes uh so you know it
11:16 - play along with the teacher so the
11:17 - teacher's like everybody do a little do
11:19 - and silence then you get to do it
11:22 - too um and that was the last costume I
11:25 - was in that was their silence move um so
11:27 - yeah so you do something like that and I
11:29 - love to start with a video because it
11:30 - takes the pressure off you it gets the
11:32 - kids all looking at something it gets
11:33 - them all quiet they start with the video
11:35 - we've got a bunch of inspirational
11:36 - videos on the site they're 60 seconds
11:39 - five minutes long really short things
11:41 - and just gets everybody like oh this is
11:42 - what computer science is about and then
11:44 - you can do your little five minute intro
11:46 - you don't want to go too long because
11:48 - the point of it is to let the kids try
11:50 - actually coding um so definitely don't
11:52 - talk for 30 minutes like the kids the
11:54 - the goal is to get them in front of a
11:56 - computer and get them experiencing it
11:58 - and then you can walk around the
11:59 - classroom once they're going you know
12:00 - helping out but um but yeah really you
12:02 - know usually a short video and then a
12:04 - really quick uh intro is the best way to
12:06 - kick things off and you can also bring
12:08 - them back at the end sure you getting
12:09 - there um to come back and talk so you
12:11 - don't feel like you have to say
12:12 - everything at the beginning just quick
12:13 - quick intro is the best way to go
12:15 - absolutely so once you've given your
12:17 - quick intro um what you'll definitely
12:19 - want to do is dive into the tutorial so
12:21 - classrooms are going to have different
12:22 - needs you might be in a computer lab
12:24 - where every student's on their own
12:25 - computer you might be in a classroom
12:26 - where there's a limited number of
12:27 - computers and we're doing ha programming
12:29 - they have a laptop cart maybe they don't
12:31 - have any computers and they're actually
12:32 - doing one of our super fun unplugged
12:35 - activities where everybody's up and
12:36 - moving around um again to make sure you
12:38 - talk to your teacher ahead of time so
12:40 - you have an expectation of kind of what
12:41 - you're going to be working with but once
12:43 - you dive into the tutorials help you
12:45 - know play a supporting role for the
12:46 - students learning so make sure we're
12:48 - letting students you know we want to see
12:50 - students learn for themselves and kind
12:51 - of puzzle through the tutorials they're
12:52 - definitely going to certain levels will
12:54 - be easier certain levels will be harder
12:56 - so it's kind of we love having the
12:57 - volunteer there to say oh okay you know
12:59 - well what might the answer be um
13:01 - definitely letting the students learn
13:02 - for themselves and then like Al said
13:05 - once you've kind of gone through your
13:06 - hour of code maybe some of the students
13:07 - have finished maybe all of them have
13:09 - finished you maybe come back do another
13:11 - kind of brief talk you know maybe what
13:12 - did we learn today ask a few questions
13:14 - you know maybe have the students say
13:16 - like what was your favorite part about
13:17 - today what are you excited to create
13:19 - with code
13:20 - next and then do we want to make a quick
13:23 - notice about photos and pictures oh
13:26 - right if you do want to take pictures of
13:28 - the event please please check with the
13:29 - teacher that this is okay you need to be
13:31 - have approval from the teacher and the
13:34 - students parents for legal reasons and
13:37 - privacy reasons you shouldn't be posting
13:39 - to your social media accounts unless you
13:41 - do have prior permission but we're we're
13:43 - very very interested in getting pictures
13:46 - so please do take some pictures if you
13:47 - do get approval send them into us we
13:49 - love sharing that um it'd be great to to
13:52 - see how your events with yeah tag them
13:54 - hashtag hour of code so we can see them
13:55 - and everybody else can see them all
13:58 - right so that's kind of our brief
13:59 - overview of what the agenda looks like
14:01 - else do you have any final wrap-up
14:02 - comments or should we dive into
14:03 - answering questions I think we can dive
14:05 - in let's answer some questions um so
14:07 - let's the first question if you don't
14:09 - get contacted by a school your choice
14:10 - can you volunteer for a school
14:12 - absolutely you can volunteer for a
14:13 - school if you don't get contacted I said
14:15 - this earlier they missed it um we know a
14:17 - lot of you haven't been contacted
14:18 - especially if you live in a tech Hub
14:20 - because there's a lot of a lot of
14:22 - Volunteers in San Francisco and not a
14:25 - lot of Volunteers in Arkansas but if you
14:28 - live in a tech Hub and you have not been
14:31 - contacted um go go contact the school I
14:34 - have done this multiple times teachers
14:36 - love it schools love it um sometimes
14:38 - they're already doing an hour of code
14:39 - they would love to have somebody help
14:41 - them out um sometimes they are not doing
14:42 - an hour of code and I have you know talk
14:45 - to so many teachers I'm like first grade
14:46 - teacher I reach out and I'm like hey are
14:48 - you doing the hour of code would you
14:49 - like me to come in and just spend an
14:50 - hour with your classroom doing the
14:52 - coding exercise and they're thrilled
14:54 - they're thrilled to have somebody come
14:56 - in and do it they didn't think they
14:57 - could do it um I was last year I was
14:59 - working with this teacher who was like I
15:01 - we can do it but I don't know anything
15:03 - about the computer so you have to be in
15:05 - charge and I'm afraid of it and as long
15:07 - as you've got the whole thing we can do
15:08 - it and she was just nervous all the way
15:09 - up through it we finished it and at the
15:11 - end of it she said to me she said that
15:12 - was really fun can I do a coding Club um
15:15 - and so just being there and being that
15:16 - support can help trigger for that
15:18 - teacher the ability to feel confident to
15:20 - go do it on their own after that so yes
15:22 - please reach out please out time code is
15:25 - as much a learning experience for
15:26 - teachers as it is for students because
15:27 - we have so many teachers like wow I
15:29 - didn't even know I could teach computer
15:30 - science and now they're signed up to
15:31 - teach like our 20 hour course for 8
15:33 - through five yeah um so which video
15:36 - works best um I think they're really
15:39 - short you can just watch them um and see
15:41 - what you think makes sense for different
15:42 - age groups um there's a new one that we
15:44 - have this year that's about inspiring
15:46 - girls if you're in a like an all girl
15:48 - school or something that's more girls
15:50 - oriented like a Girls Club um that would
15:52 - be the one I would show it's all about
15:54 - encouraging women in computer science if
15:56 - you're at a school that's you know boys
15:58 - and girls um I recommend one of the
16:00 - other ones and we have um what I like to
16:03 - do is typically I'm bring them up so I
16:04 - can remember the exact name of it but I
16:06 - like to play uh so change the world
16:09 - which is the first one that you'll see
16:10 - on the Inspire students video page um is
16:13 - the is the um um is the one for all
16:16 - girls um and then what I like to play is
16:21 - uh the first one here um either the
16:25 - computer science intro which is one
16:26 - minute long um or um the hour of code is
16:31 - here um which is also a really fun one
16:33 - for classes so you can try watch those
16:36 - po you one you like more um and try try
16:39 - one of those yeah if you have longer it
16:41 - depends if you have more time in the
16:42 - classroom you can play a longer one um
16:44 - so it really just depends how long you
16:46 - know a lot of classes it's an hour of
16:48 - code but you actually have more like 40
16:50 - minutes because you've got a you know
16:52 - you get started the kids have to get
16:54 - there they have to open their laptops
16:55 - they have to get started you play the
16:57 - video you do a quick intro the kids have
16:59 - like 30 minutes to code before class is
17:01 - over um in which case you really want to
17:03 - compress it as more so you have more
17:04 - time for the kids to actually do the
17:07 - activity absolutely so do we have any
17:09 - more questions if you want to submit
17:11 - them to our Q&A little tab we can answer
17:13 - any final wrap up questions uh you might
17:16 - have about volunteering next
17:19 - week so I know while we're waiting to
17:21 - see if anybody else has question oh here
17:23 - it is um next question what if the
17:25 - school does not provide access to
17:26 - computers at all what would you success
17:28 - suggest yes um so you don't actually
17:32 - need computers at all to do the hour of
17:34 - code you can do the hour of code with no
17:36 - computers um we have a lot of un if you
17:39 - go to our site code.org learn there's a
17:41 - section on unplugged lessons and um and
17:46 - so if you look at those there are a
17:47 - bunch of activities that teach the
17:48 - concepts of computer science without
17:50 - actually needing any computers uh so I
17:52 - would recommend you look through those
17:53 - now when you do those you do need to be
17:55 - prepared to do them in the class so some
17:57 - of them require you to have cups for the
17:59 - kids to do a cup stacking activity so
18:00 - make sure either you or the teacher is
18:02 - bringing the cups into the classroom
18:04 - because you don't want to get there and
18:05 - um not be ready to teach those and those
18:07 - do require a little bit more work from
18:08 - you because if you're teaching an
18:10 - unplugged lesson there's it's not just
18:11 - put the kids in front of the computer
18:12 - let the computer teach it you've got to
18:14 - run that in front of the classroom so um
18:16 - if you are doing an unplugged lesson and
18:18 - you don't have computers uh it is
18:20 - important that you read through that and
18:22 - go through it and get ready and bring
18:23 - your materials um if you're doing with
18:26 - computers another way to think about it
18:27 - is you can do it uh you don't need a
18:30 - computer for every student PA
18:31 - programming is tons of fun the kids
18:32 - really learn from each other um so go
18:35 - ahead and try bringing you know two kids
18:37 - per student two students per computer or
18:41 - um you can do things like uh try
18:44 - different devices so if you guys have
18:46 - tablets instead of computers or you have
18:49 - um we really have stuff that works on
18:50 - the tutorials will work on any different
18:52 - device type
18:53 - so uh we had a question about which URL
18:56 - for the videos so that's code. org
18:59 - educate Inspire and I've also posted the
19:02 - link in the Showcase if you click the
19:04 - yellow little Post-it Note Tab um you'll
19:07 - be able to have a quick link to to go to
19:09 - see the videos listed videos it's also
19:11 - in the agenda doc um which is listed in
19:13 - our chat box which is listed in our chat
19:15 - box I take the next
19:18 - question this is a great question about
19:20 - what tutorials are more appropriate for
19:22 - high school students and what would you
19:23 - recommend for students um maybe in
19:25 - elementary school yeah so um if you look
19:28 - on code.org
19:30 - ulearn at the very top there are
19:32 - tutorials that um we've made at code.org
19:35 - those are designed to work from grades
19:38 - uh basically as soon as they can read so
19:40 - grade one or two depending on when the
19:41 - kids read all the way through some
19:43 - kindergarteners all the way through high
19:45 - school and um if you do them with second
19:47 - graders they won't finish in an hour and
19:50 - that's fine they'll just get a really
19:52 - fun experience for an hour and they'll
19:53 - be done and they'll get partway through
19:55 - the experience if you do them with high
19:57 - school students they probably will
19:58 - finish in an hour and then they of time
20:00 - is pre-play levels at the end so and say
20:02 - the Star Wars one they get to the end
20:04 - and they can make their own Star Wars
20:05 - game and so I watched one group of high
20:07 - school students get through the whole
20:08 - thing and then they went over the time
20:10 - they spent an extra hour just making
20:12 - Star Wars games um and that's totally
20:15 - fine the kids had a great time with it
20:17 - uh the Star Wars one actually has two
20:19 - versions one version if the kids can't
20:21 - type yet um and you'll see when you go
20:22 - there there's two go buttons one for
20:24 - blocks for younger kids and then one for
20:25 - older students it's in JavaScript and
20:27 - the kids who can type can go um even
20:30 - further with that and we've tested them
20:32 - on all those grades so we know that they
20:34 - do work um all the way up through high
20:36 - school and then if you go below our
20:39 - section the other tutorials are grouped
20:41 - by age and so the very top section there
20:43 - says JavaScript those tutorials um it's
20:46 - KH Academy I think we have code academy
20:49 - in there code HS all of those tutorials
20:51 - are designed for older students um they
20:53 - all involve typing and they're great for
20:55 - high school students so if you're
20:56 - looking for high school students that's
20:57 - right start if you are looking for
21:00 - younger students um it's also ask about
21:03 - middle school or elementary school kids
21:05 - uh grades four to five again the ones at
21:08 - the top will work great you can also
21:09 - where it says grades k through eight um
21:11 - there are great activities in there um
21:14 - my son is in fourth grade and he had a
21:16 - blast with the Tinker um the Tinker
21:18 - tutorial uh scratch is also great
21:20 - there's lots of great tutorials in there
21:22 - so just flip through that list and um
21:24 - you can play with them but we've
21:26 - pre-selected everything in there should
21:28 - be a good tutorial or it wouldn't be on
21:30 - the
21:31 - site now have a good oh oh that what
21:34 - you're about to talk about yeah own
21:36 - lessons yes yeah so we there is a new
21:39 - section at the bottom of code.org learn
21:41 - for teacher-led lesson plans and there's
21:43 - a curated list of uh customized lesson
21:47 - plans that teachers have written so
21:48 - you're definitely uh encouraged to
21:51 - create your own custom uh hour of code
21:54 - event that works best for your students
21:56 - in your classroom so if if you scroll
21:58 - down to codor learn you'll see it's
22:00 - called teacher Le lesson plans and
22:01 - you'll have a big long list of of um
22:04 - Inspire yourselves to create your own um
22:06 - but yes absolutely you can create your
22:07 - own lesson plans yeah and actually it's
22:09 - worth pointing out so our all of our
22:11 - lesson plans are designed for um except
22:14 - for the teacher Le once everything else
22:16 - is designed for teachers who don't know
22:17 - computer science um and so it is they
22:20 - self-led the students go in front of the
22:22 - computer and so a teacher who has no
22:23 - computer science can do this with their
22:24 - students you guys know computer science
22:27 - so um you actually can do more than
22:29 - what's in the uh the activities you also
22:32 - it's I know computer science and I still
22:34 - have tons of fun with the student Le
22:36 - lesson plan so I that's what I plan to
22:38 - do this year it's just one of the
22:39 - student L ones and help them out and let
22:41 - the kids have fun with it but if you
22:42 - want to do something more custom because
22:43 - you know computer science go for it um
22:46 - you're totally you could do that um this
22:49 - is just a good question of what's a good
22:50 - way to get in contact with the local
22:52 - school so we just recommend if you go to
22:53 - hourofcode.com you'll see our big
22:56 - ginormous map with all of our events
22:58 - we've actually hit our event cap so
23:01 - we're we can't even add more new events
23:03 - because we've hit
23:04 - 150,000 um which is pretty pretty
23:07 - incredible we're about triple what we
23:08 - had last year um so yeah if you go to
23:10 - the map and you find a school that's
23:11 - listed in your area just look them up
23:13 - and you know maybe give their front
23:15 - office a call and say hey I saw that
23:17 - you're doing the RF code I'm a volunteer
23:19 - um could you put me in contact with the
23:20 - teacher who's participating and see if I
23:22 - could help help out in the classroom and
23:23 - you can also contact the school that's
23:25 - not doing it um if you have a kid um
23:28 - start with your own kids school because
23:29 - your parents you know the school that's
23:30 - a great place to start if you don't have
23:32 - a student at the school if you just call
23:34 - the school um you can ask to you can
23:36 - start with the front desk or ask if
23:38 - there's a science teacher at the school
23:39 - or a technology teacher at the school if
23:41 - it's a younger school like an elementary
23:42 - school they probably won't have one of
23:44 - those um so you can just ask for you
23:46 - know like a contact for you know third
23:48 - grade teachers or something that you
23:49 - want to work with um and see if they'll
23:51 - put you in touch or see if they'll
23:52 - forward your message that you're a
23:54 - volunteer and we also have a list of the
23:56 - events so you don't have to go clicking
23:57 - on each dot in your area you can also go
24:00 - to ARF cod.com events to see all the
24:02 - events that are happening in your state
24:04 - um and it'll also say which city they're
24:06 - in so you can search by that so we just
24:09 - have a few minutes left um we'll do some
24:11 - wrap-up questions so this is a good
24:13 - question our schools only happening
24:15 - offline in schools are going to happen
24:16 - online as well definitely both it's just
24:18 - going to depend on each school's
24:20 - capacity for getting laptops into the
24:22 - classroom or the internet connectivity
24:24 - so um definitely just talk to your
24:26 - teachers so you know and they know kind
24:27 - of what the expectation is what tutorial
24:29 - you're going to do if it's online or
24:31 - offline if you have the choice at your
24:33 - school um in my experience what's the
24:36 - easiest to get working and working well
24:38 - is to do one of the online tutorials and
24:40 - use the computers uh the school's
24:42 - computers um if you haven't been to a
24:44 - school recently a lot of schools these
24:46 - days won't have computers in the
24:48 - classroom if you just go in there but if
24:50 - you ask the teacher can get computers
24:52 - into the classroom because they have
24:53 - things like laptop cards that they bring
24:55 - between the classroom so if the teacher
24:56 - reserves it in advance you can have
24:58 - computers and internet connectivity in
25:00 - the classroom so um trying to coordinate
25:02 - with the teacher on that is a good
25:04 - idea great so do we have any final
25:07 - wrap-up questions and otherwise I think
25:09 - we're this has been recorded it's online
25:12 - um we've put a lot of links in the
25:13 - Showcase sidebar so please check them
25:15 - out um just a highlight again code.org
25:17 - learn is where you can find all of the
25:20 - tutorials um we've highlighted a handy
25:22 - kind of PDF of tips for what to do when
25:24 - you're in the classroom we've linked to
25:26 - our inspirational videos which you might
25:28 - want to show before you get started and
25:30 - we've also linked to hourofcode.com
25:32 - events to find an event in your area if
25:35 - you haven't um been in contact with a
25:37 - teacher
25:39 - yet um Alice do you have any final
25:41 - remarks before I wrap up thanks for
25:43 - volunteering we really appreciate it um
25:45 - and I know the teachers really
25:46 - appreciate it we um we've got a ton of
25:48 - requests this year for volunteers so
25:50 - really appreciate you guys stepping up
25:51 - and doing that hope you have fun yeah
25:53 - thanks so much everybody have a good day
25:56 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

my my good sorry we're muted we're M thank you Kendall for telling us that um we will not repeat and start at the beginning again thank you all right GNA rewind try that again AL righty all right I'm c i coordinate our hour of code campaign code.org I'm Tanya Parker I am a product manager and engineer here at cator hi I'm Alice I run our product and marketing teams here at code.org all right well thank you so much everybody thank you especially the people who gave us a heads up we were muted we're excited to jump back in um our quick agenda as we're going to go over what to do before your hour of code what to do in the classroom um and then we can do a bit of questions and answers you guys have already found the Q&A part and then the other app you might want to look at is our showcase that's where we are showing links that might be helpful for you so hopefully everyone on this webinar has already been contacted by a teacher and you've already started coordinating Alice is going to go over a few tips if you haven't yet been contacted but you still want to volunteer okay so we know some of you guys have not been contacted um it's a tough one because a lot of our volunteers tend to be in Tech regions like Seattle or San Francisco um whereas I was just talking to a teacher yesterday in rural Georgia who has not managed to find a volunteer yet for her classroom and so we're encouraging those teachers that are spread out all over the world to reach out remotely because you know where the teachers are is not necessarily where the volunteers are um if you are in a remote place and um some of the teachers have said they've reached out but they volunteer was already volunteering in another classroom if you can volunteer in more than one classroom I know the teachers would appreciate it if you are in a tech Hub and you haven't been reached um two things you can do one is um please uh you know just hang on we're trying to encourage the teachers to reach out doing remote uh chats they may or may not want to do that um thank you for volunteering we really appreciate it if you don't get contacted now um we'll be in contact with you maybe you can volunteer for hour of code next year um we'll also ask you if you're interested in other opportunities and we'll see if there's other ways you can help a school um the other thing you can do is you can proactively reach out to a school uh we can't list for privacy reasons all of the school addresses that are doing hour of code on our website but if you just reach out to your local school oftentimes they will be doing the hour of code and they would love your help or um maybe they're not doing the hour of code and you reaching out to them will you can help them figure out how to do the hour of code and do it with a classroom I've done you know in my experience I personally have reached out to a bunch of schools classrooms and they've always been excited about the idea of of having somebody come in and do an hour of code with the classroom so um I'd recommend you just try reaching out to a local school but thank you again for volunteering if you have not been contacted all right so thank you so much Alice for kind of going watch if you haven't been contacted if you're already in contact with your school we want to review kind of the step you need to make sure you've taken care of before you show up next week so first and foremost it's really important that you've identified with your teacher a day and a time you can you can go to her class um be sure to give yourself a little bit of time to show up before you'll need to sign in at the front office even before you get to the classroom every school's most likely going to have you fill out some sort of form before you arrive for outside volunteers if you haven't done that already it's really important that you contact your teacher today to make sure you filled out all the paperwork so you can show up without a hitch next week um be sure you've talked to your teacher about kind of what he or she is expecting when you're in the classroom um this volunteer program is first and foremost an opportunity for you to show students what all of the opportunities are with computer science and so it's much more of an inspirational and a mentorship opportunity than necessarily providing technical help in the classroom so we want to make sure that expectation is clear with teachers as well and then finally this weekend is your chance to try the hour of code tutorials so we've got a awesome brand new tutorials for students who can read our Minecraft and Star Wars tutorials have been a hit we're already seeing students who've tried them and teachers who've tried them loving it um if you're working with prereaders um the foods is another great opportunity and all of our tutorials are listed at code.org learn so please do check it out so that you're not totally um lost in the woods when you show up next week the last thing we've linked to in our showcase bar is um kind of a list of tips that we another one of our partners has put together this is an awesome document you can review to think about what you want to do in your classroom um it's kind of a sample agenda some things they suggest when you show up are talking about um both what you do professionally and how computer science interacts with your daytoday but also what you're doing outside of work to kind of showcase that you know people who are doing computer science are doing all sorts of things beyond computer science as well Kate I'm confused I thought people do computer science just sit in a basement all day in the dark preferably well that's all they do Alice that's exactly why we have this volunteer program is the our of code is all about smashing stereotypes of computer science and so we really want to show students that computer science is not just a nerdy activity although if you want to sit in the basement and code away you have that's the option but our code is so much about introducing students especially students who may be not as inclined to try computer science because they don't usually see people who look like them or do things that are interesting for them and so you know talk about what computer science is not just from a coding perspective but what kind of products are you creating what kind of experiences are you creating what kind of what's your favorite fun project you've created with computer science um we really want to show students that you know this is a discipline that's not just for the Nerds it's not just for you know the people who've been doing it for the last 30 years anybody can learn and everybody should learn yeah one of the things I like to do when I go into a classroom is I start out like I tell the story I'm sure a lot of you guys have a similar story of what the first program you ever made was um and um and the reason to share that is often times it's a game or something fun or something that really relates to kids because they're the same age uh my first one was uh when I was in seventh grade and I figured out how to make my computer if my brother my little brother tried to break into it um it would beep really loudly and then a big letters ask Art would say SES you are trying to break into my computer this incursion has been logged um and so you know that kind of story is just fun it makes it seem more relatable um or if you know you build an app or if you done something that relates something youd actually want to do um those are really fun and you can also share happy outside of work you know like hey I'm really into whatever it is um knitting art you know you name it whatever you do outside of work photography um and then and then that just makes you seem more human which is great absolutely um so like again we've listed in our showcase tab this list of it's the Vol it's a volunteer file that you can see us teaching chips so please check that out um now we're GNA I see we already have some questions in there we're just going to go through a quick little more on the agenda and then we'll get to everybody's questions um when you're thinking about what to bring to your day of if you're working for a company um it'd be awesome if you want to bring some swag students pretty much of all ages love stickers pens anything else you want to bring to the classroom um again like Elsa bring your personal story how did you get into computer science um and definitely bring your enthusiasm so we're going to do a brief section on kind of day of what does it look like while you're actually there um so sign in to your school and greet the teacher um and just confirm the agreed schedule spend 5 to 10 minutes talking about computer science with the introduction share a short story share how CS has many broad implications um actually you know before you do that there's a u before you actually start talking I think the best way to start off is we've got a bunch of videos these inspirational videos um and okay so depending on the age of the classroom you got a bunch of kids they're loud they're noisy they're s everywhere the teacher usually pretty good at getting them to like pay attention um if you haven't been in a classroom in a long time it's kind of fun you know there'll be a little bit of like you know you know uh one two three look at me you know kind of thing that they cootes quiet coyotes um yes uh so you know it play along with the teacher so the teacher's like everybody do a little do and silence then you get to do it too um and that was the last costume I was in that was their silence move um so yeah so you do something like that and I love to start with a video because it takes the pressure off you it gets the kids all looking at something it gets them all quiet they start with the video we've got a bunch of inspirational videos on the site they're 60 seconds five minutes long really short things and just gets everybody like oh this is what computer science is about and then you can do your little five minute intro you don't want to go too long because the point of it is to let the kids try actually coding um so definitely don't talk for 30 minutes like the kids the the goal is to get them in front of a computer and get them experiencing it and then you can walk around the classroom once they're going you know helping out but um but yeah really you know usually a short video and then a really quick uh intro is the best way to kick things off and you can also bring them back at the end sure you getting there um to come back and talk so you don't feel like you have to say everything at the beginning just quick quick intro is the best way to go absolutely so once you've given your quick intro um what you'll definitely want to do is dive into the tutorial so classrooms are going to have different needs you might be in a computer lab where every student's on their own computer you might be in a classroom where there's a limited number of computers and we're doing ha programming they have a laptop cart maybe they don't have any computers and they're actually doing one of our super fun unplugged activities where everybody's up and moving around um again to make sure you talk to your teacher ahead of time so you have an expectation of kind of what you're going to be working with but once you dive into the tutorials help you know play a supporting role for the students learning so make sure we're letting students you know we want to see students learn for themselves and kind of puzzle through the tutorials they're definitely going to certain levels will be easier certain levels will be harder so it's kind of we love having the volunteer there to say oh okay you know well what might the answer be um definitely letting the students learn for themselves and then like Al said once you've kind of gone through your hour of code maybe some of the students have finished maybe all of them have finished you maybe come back do another kind of brief talk you know maybe what did we learn today ask a few questions you know maybe have the students say like what was your favorite part about today what are you excited to create with code next and then do we want to make a quick notice about photos and pictures oh right if you do want to take pictures of the event please please check with the teacher that this is okay you need to be have approval from the teacher and the students parents for legal reasons and privacy reasons you shouldn't be posting to your social media accounts unless you do have prior permission but we're we're very very interested in getting pictures so please do take some pictures if you do get approval send them into us we love sharing that um it'd be great to to see how your events with yeah tag them hashtag hour of code so we can see them and everybody else can see them all right so that's kind of our brief overview of what the agenda looks like else do you have any final wrapup comments or should we dive into answering questions I think we can dive in let's answer some questions um so let's the first question if you don't get contacted by a school your choice can you volunteer for a school absolutely you can volunteer for a school if you don't get contacted I said this earlier they missed it um we know a lot of you haven't been contacted especially if you live in a tech Hub because there's a lot of a lot of Volunteers in San Francisco and not a lot of Volunteers in Arkansas but if you live in a tech Hub and you have not been contacted um go go contact the school I have done this multiple times teachers love it schools love it um sometimes they're already doing an hour of code they would love to have somebody help them out um sometimes they are not doing an hour of code and I have you know talk to so many teachers I'm like first grade teacher I reach out and I'm like hey are you doing the hour of code would you like me to come in and just spend an hour with your classroom doing the coding exercise and they're thrilled they're thrilled to have somebody come in and do it they didn't think they could do it um I was last year I was working with this teacher who was like I we can do it but I don't know anything about the computer so you have to be in charge and I'm afraid of it and as long as you've got the whole thing we can do it and she was just nervous all the way up through it we finished it and at the end of it she said to me she said that was really fun can I do a coding Club um and so just being there and being that support can help trigger for that teacher the ability to feel confident to go do it on their own after that so yes please reach out please out time code is as much a learning experience for teachers as it is for students because we have so many teachers like wow I didn't even know I could teach computer science and now they're signed up to teach like our 20 hour course for 8 through five yeah um so which video works best um I think they're really short you can just watch them um and see what you think makes sense for different age groups um there's a new one that we have this year that's about inspiring girls if you're in a like an all girl school or something that's more girls oriented like a Girls Club um that would be the one I would show it's all about encouraging women in computer science if you're at a school that's you know boys and girls um I recommend one of the other ones and we have um what I like to do is typically I'm bring them up so I can remember the exact name of it but I like to play uh so change the world which is the first one that you'll see on the Inspire students video page um is the is the um um is the one for all girls um and then what I like to play is uh the first one here um either the computer science intro which is one minute long um or um the hour of code is here um which is also a really fun one for classes so you can try watch those po you one you like more um and try try one of those yeah if you have longer it depends if you have more time in the classroom you can play a longer one um so it really just depends how long you know a lot of classes it's an hour of code but you actually have more like 40 minutes because you've got a you know you get started the kids have to get there they have to open their laptops they have to get started you play the video you do a quick intro the kids have like 30 minutes to code before class is over um in which case you really want to compress it as more so you have more time for the kids to actually do the activity absolutely so do we have any more questions if you want to submit them to our Q&A little tab we can answer any final wrap up questions uh you might have about volunteering next week so I know while we're waiting to see if anybody else has question oh here it is um next question what if the school does not provide access to computers at all what would you success suggest yes um so you don't actually need computers at all to do the hour of code you can do the hour of code with no computers um we have a lot of un if you go to our site code.org learn there's a section on unplugged lessons and um and so if you look at those there are a bunch of activities that teach the concepts of computer science without actually needing any computers uh so I would recommend you look through those now when you do those you do need to be prepared to do them in the class so some of them require you to have cups for the kids to do a cup stacking activity so make sure either you or the teacher is bringing the cups into the classroom because you don't want to get there and um not be ready to teach those and those do require a little bit more work from you because if you're teaching an unplugged lesson there's it's not just put the kids in front of the computer let the computer teach it you've got to run that in front of the classroom so um if you are doing an unplugged lesson and you don't have computers uh it is important that you read through that and go through it and get ready and bring your materials um if you're doing with computers another way to think about it is you can do it uh you don't need a computer for every student PA programming is tons of fun the kids really learn from each other um so go ahead and try bringing you know two kids per student two students per computer or um you can do things like uh try different devices so if you guys have tablets instead of computers or you have um we really have stuff that works on the tutorials will work on any different device type so uh we had a question about which URL for the videos so that's code. org educate Inspire and I've also posted the link in the Showcase if you click the yellow little Postit Note Tab um you'll be able to have a quick link to to go to see the videos listed videos it's also in the agenda doc um which is listed in our chat box which is listed in our chat box I take the next question this is a great question about what tutorials are more appropriate for high school students and what would you recommend for students um maybe in elementary school yeah so um if you look on code.org ulearn at the very top there are tutorials that um we've made at code.org those are designed to work from grades uh basically as soon as they can read so grade one or two depending on when the kids read all the way through some kindergarteners all the way through high school and um if you do them with second graders they won't finish in an hour and that's fine they'll just get a really fun experience for an hour and they'll be done and they'll get partway through the experience if you do them with high school students they probably will finish in an hour and then they of time is preplay levels at the end so and say the Star Wars one they get to the end and they can make their own Star Wars game and so I watched one group of high school students get through the whole thing and then they went over the time they spent an extra hour just making Star Wars games um and that's totally fine the kids had a great time with it uh the Star Wars one actually has two versions one version if the kids can't type yet um and you'll see when you go there there's two go buttons one for blocks for younger kids and then one for older students it's in JavaScript and the kids who can type can go um even further with that and we've tested them on all those grades so we know that they do work um all the way up through high school and then if you go below our section the other tutorials are grouped by age and so the very top section there says JavaScript those tutorials um it's KH Academy I think we have code academy in there code HS all of those tutorials are designed for older students um they all involve typing and they're great for high school students so if you're looking for high school students that's right start if you are looking for younger students um it's also ask about middle school or elementary school kids uh grades four to five again the ones at the top will work great you can also where it says grades k through eight um there are great activities in there um my son is in fourth grade and he had a blast with the Tinker um the Tinker tutorial uh scratch is also great there's lots of great tutorials in there so just flip through that list and um you can play with them but we've preselected everything in there should be a good tutorial or it wouldn't be on the site now have a good oh oh that what you're about to talk about yeah own lessons yes yeah so we there is a new section at the bottom of code.org learn for teacherled lesson plans and there's a curated list of uh customized lesson plans that teachers have written so you're definitely uh encouraged to create your own custom uh hour of code event that works best for your students in your classroom so if if you scroll down to codor learn you'll see it's called teacher Le lesson plans and you'll have a big long list of of um Inspire yourselves to create your own um but yes absolutely you can create your own lesson plans yeah and actually it's worth pointing out so our all of our lesson plans are designed for um except for the teacher Le once everything else is designed for teachers who don't know computer science um and so it is they selfled the students go in front of the computer and so a teacher who has no computer science can do this with their students you guys know computer science so um you actually can do more than what's in the uh the activities you also it's I know computer science and I still have tons of fun with the student Le lesson plan so I that's what I plan to do this year it's just one of the student L ones and help them out and let the kids have fun with it but if you want to do something more custom because you know computer science go for it um you're totally you could do that um this is just a good question of what's a good way to get in contact with the local school so we just recommend if you go to hourofcode.com you'll see our big ginormous map with all of our events we've actually hit our event cap so we're we can't even add more new events because we've hit 150,000 um which is pretty pretty incredible we're about triple what we had last year um so yeah if you go to the map and you find a school that's listed in your area just look them up and you know maybe give their front office a call and say hey I saw that you're doing the RF code I'm a volunteer um could you put me in contact with the teacher who's participating and see if I could help help out in the classroom and you can also contact the school that's not doing it um if you have a kid um start with your own kids school because your parents you know the school that's a great place to start if you don't have a student at the school if you just call the school um you can ask to you can start with the front desk or ask if there's a science teacher at the school or a technology teacher at the school if it's a younger school like an elementary school they probably won't have one of those um so you can just ask for you know like a contact for you know third grade teachers or something that you want to work with um and see if they'll put you in touch or see if they'll forward your message that you're a volunteer and we also have a list of the events so you don't have to go clicking on each dot in your area you can also go to ARF cod.com events to see all the events that are happening in your state um and it'll also say which city they're in so you can search by that so we just have a few minutes left um we'll do some wrapup questions so this is a good question our schools only happening offline in schools are going to happen online as well definitely both it's just going to depend on each school's capacity for getting laptops into the classroom or the internet connectivity so um definitely just talk to your teachers so you know and they know kind of what the expectation is what tutorial you're going to do if it's online or offline if you have the choice at your school um in my experience what's the easiest to get working and working well is to do one of the online tutorials and use the computers uh the school's computers um if you haven't been to a school recently a lot of schools these days won't have computers in the classroom if you just go in there but if you ask the teacher can get computers into the classroom because they have things like laptop cards that they bring between the classroom so if the teacher reserves it in advance you can have computers and internet connectivity in the classroom so um trying to coordinate with the teacher on that is a good idea great so do we have any final wrapup questions and otherwise I think we're this has been recorded it's online um we've put a lot of links in the Showcase sidebar so please check them out um just a highlight again code.org learn is where you can find all of the tutorials um we've highlighted a handy kind of PDF of tips for what to do when you're in the classroom we've linked to our inspirational videos which you might want to show before you get started and we've also linked to hourofcode.com events to find an event in your area if you haven't um been in contact with a teacher yet um Alice do you have any final remarks before I wrap up thanks for volunteering we really appreciate it um and I know the teachers really appreciate it we um we've got a ton of requests this year for volunteers so really appreciate you guys stepping up and doing that hope you have fun yeah thanks so much everybody have a good day bye
