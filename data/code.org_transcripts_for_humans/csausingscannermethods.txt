00:10 - once we have created our scanner object
00:13 - we are ready to use the methods in the
00:15 - scanner class
00:17 - these are the methods that will wait for
00:20 - a user to enter information while the
00:22 - code is running
00:24 - there are many methods in the scanner
00:26 - class but we will focus
00:29 - mainly on the following three
00:32 - next int
00:33 - next double and next line
00:38 - these methods allow a user to enter an
00:41 - int double or string into the console
00:45 - then the computer can store this input
00:48 - in a variable and use the information
00:51 - later
00:53 - let's say we have already declared and
00:55 - initialized our scanner variable and
00:58 - named it input
01:00 - now we want to know what the user's
01:02 - favorite color is
01:04 - first we print the console message
01:08 - what is your favorite color
01:10 - next we create a variable to store the
01:13 - information that the user enters and
01:15 - tell the computer to collect this
01:17 - information
01:19 - since a color name is a string we use
01:21 - the method input dot next line
01:25 - after the user has entered this
01:27 - information we can use that information
01:30 - later in our code
01:32 - they will see a prompt in the console
01:35 - the computer will wait for an answer
01:38 - the user can enter a string and then in
01:40 - the console the user will see a message
01:44 - using that information they just entered
01:47 - in the same way we could get an integer
01:50 - or a double from the user by using next
01:53 - int or next double
01:55 - you don't need to create a new scanner
01:57 - object every time you collect input from
01:59 - the user you can continue to use the
02:02 - same object
02:03 - however when you are done collecting
02:05 - input it's important to close the
02:07 - scanner because scanner uses computer
02:10 - resources
02:11 - all we have to do is type the name of
02:13 - the scanner followed by dot close
02:17 - think of this like hanging up your phone
02:20 - if you kept the phone connected you'd
02:22 - use up all your battery
02:24 - [Applause]
02:25 - we can collect all kinds of user input
02:27 - information by using the scanner class
02:34 - [Music]
02:37 - you
