00:00 - we are getting started with our first
00:01 - volunteer info session if you're an
00:04 - engineer or work with computer science
00:07 - in your day to day and you volunteer to
00:09 - sign up technology with the RF code this
00:11 - session is for you right now we're just
00:14 - sharing a few links in the sidebar that
00:16 - will be helpful for you we're going to
00:17 - share the agenda what we'll be talking
00:19 - about today and you can add sanu ghal
00:22 - doc you prefer back to at any time and
00:24 - we will also be sharing the link that
00:27 - teachers are using to find volunteers
00:31 - you can see how you're getting matched
00:32 - live on the website so to go through a
00:36 - few items just to get a sense but we're
00:38 - going to chat about we're going to go
00:40 - over how to coordinate with a teacher in
00:42 - your area what to bring to your hour of
00:45 - code what to do at your classroom
00:47 - session is it step by step and how you
00:51 - can further engage other people
00:53 - companies like your company or friends
00:55 - and we will then go to a Q&A session you
01:00 - can see on the right sidebar that we
01:02 - have an option for you to submit
01:03 - questions so after we go through our
01:06 - discussion and then we'll answer
01:08 - questions as you submit them so first
01:12 - and foremost we wanted to start with how
01:14 - do you get connected with the volunteer
01:16 - so everybody here hopefully has already
01:18 - signed up at code.org / volunteer and
01:21 - you should see in our showcase sidebar
01:24 - the link which is coded org slash
01:26 - volunteer / local and that is the map
01:29 - teachers are using to find volunteers so
01:31 - your address whatever address you gave
01:33 - up gave us is showing up as a pin on
01:36 - that map and teachers can select those
01:39 - pins um then they'll fill out a contact
01:42 - form so probably some of you have
01:44 - already received emails from teachers so
01:47 - what you need to do next is reply to
01:49 - that email what you'll want to follow up
01:52 - with is just to reiterate your name your
01:56 - company your job description or if
01:58 - you're a student where you're studying
02:00 - and what you're studying um please
02:02 - provide the days and times you are
02:04 - available to volunteer at the school and
02:07 - it'd be great to share just a little
02:08 - blur but why did why did you sign up to
02:10 - volunteer what's exciting about
02:11 - computers
02:12 - to you what do you want to share with
02:13 - students and then you'll need to ask the
02:16 - teacher what paperwork you need to fill
02:18 - out for the school before you volunteer
02:20 - so the point that you reply to the
02:22 - teacher you can see you are then
02:24 - directly working with that teacher to
02:27 - work with their school and it is your
02:29 - responsibility to work with the future
02:31 - work with the school to find a day and
02:33 - time that works for you if I love the
02:35 - paperwork you need to fill out and we're
02:37 - really excited to be launching this
02:38 - volunteer program but at code.org we
02:40 - don't have the capacity to handle any
02:43 - individual volunteer requests so it's up
02:46 - to you to work with school to set that
02:48 - up before you even arrived at the school
02:51 - is a few things you need to fill out so
02:53 - almost every public school is going to
02:55 - ask you to submit a background check and
02:58 - there might be other paperwork or formed
03:00 - you to fill out as an outside volunteer
03:03 - coming in so you'll need to work with
03:05 - your teacher they might need to ask
03:06 - their principal or administrator what
03:08 - forms they do need to fill out and
03:11 - you'll also want to confirm before you
03:13 - show up with your teacher the day and
03:15 - time you'll be at the school if you're
03:17 - just going to show up for one hour of
03:19 - class if you're going to show it for
03:20 - multiple class periods that day if
03:23 - you're going to an assembly that's all
03:25 - stuff you'll want to set up before and
03:27 - then it's important to establish
03:28 - expectations with the teacher before you
03:30 - arrive of what you'll be doing so we
03:32 - really set up this program as a way to
03:35 - inspire students to keep learning and so
03:37 - it's important that teachers recognize
03:39 - that your role as a volunteer is much
03:40 - more on the side of being a mentor and
03:43 - showing how students can learn and
03:45 - really a less emphasis on providing
03:48 - technical help for the hour of code the
03:50 - RF code is really easy to do teachers
03:52 - love it students love it we're happy to
03:55 - have volunteers answer questions but we
03:58 - really want to help students and
04:00 - teachers learn how to do this themselves
04:02 - so when you go to your hour of code what
04:05 - should you bring um one thing we
04:07 - recommend is that if you're coming from
04:08 - a company it could be great to bring
04:10 - some swags if it's stickers or handouts
04:13 - from your company to share with students
04:14 - students younger tips especially really
04:16 - love stickers your doesn't want to think
04:19 - about in terms of talking points what is
04:22 - your store with computer time
04:24 - and what entire you to learn the first
04:26 - time and why do you continue to stay
04:27 - engaged now let's we're going to move to
04:31 - they of what to do during your classroom
04:34 - visit so at this point you should have
04:36 - established with your teacher what time
04:38 - and day you'll be at the school at that
04:41 - time and day you'll need to sign in at
04:43 - the front office and greet the teacher
04:44 - you'll want to go over your schedule for
04:46 - the day and maybe confirm any talking
04:49 - points um want to spend 5 to 10 minutes
04:52 - talking about computer science so
04:54 - introduce yourself and your story what
04:56 - do you do with computer science in your
04:58 - job or when your studies and maybe share
05:01 - an anecdote of why did you say why what
05:04 - what was the first computer science
05:05 - class you took what was your first
05:06 - exposure why did you decide to keep
05:08 - learning what do you love about your job
05:10 - what kind of opportunities has computer
05:12 - science given you we have a link in our
05:16 - agenda doc which is linked to our
05:18 - inspirational hour of code videos so
05:21 - that's a video you could show to the
05:22 - classroom and then after that brief
05:24 - interruption you'll want to just dive
05:26 - into the tutorials so the tutorials are
05:28 - available at code.org / learn as you may
05:32 - have seen we have some pretty exciting
05:33 - new tutorials this year including Star
05:36 - Wars and then just today we announced
05:38 - minecraft so what people want to work
05:41 - with students through those tutorials
05:43 - make sure that they're learning on their
05:45 - own pace and so you're there to provide
05:47 - support and to answer questions but we
05:49 - really want students to be learning this
05:51 - themselves and then finally what we
05:54 - really like to see is help help how our
05:57 - volunteers can engage even more
05:59 - volunteers so right now we have about
06:01 - 700 sorry seven thousand volunteers
06:05 - signed up but we have seventeen thousand
06:08 - teachers who are still looking for
06:09 - volunteers and so any support we can get
06:11 - from our volunteer community and
06:13 - engaging even more people would be
06:16 - phenomenal so we've got a sample email
06:18 - in this document where you can send that
06:21 - to your co-workers and send it to your
06:23 - boss if you're at a CS program at a
06:25 - university share with your entire
06:26 - department and that's where we can
06:30 - that's how we can recruit even more
06:32 - volunteers so this is a broad overview
06:37 - and that we will be right back okay we
06:40 - actually like to introduce hi acres yeah
06:42 - i mean you come on Jordan um Hadi poor
06:45 - toby of course our co-founder and CEO
06:47 - and Alice Stein glass one of our product
06:50 - managers for our product and engineering
06:52 - team yeah yeah that's what is that roll
06:55 - over everybody hi so we were just going
07:00 - over the road overview of what to do as
07:03 - a volunteer how to connect with the
07:04 - teacher what to do when you sign up and
07:06 - haunting I'll come show a little bit
07:08 - more about why we're introducing this
07:09 - program this year and well you take it
07:12 - from them yeah sure at yeah the goal the
07:15 - hour of code is to get tens of thousands
07:18 - of teachers to try computer science in
07:20 - some format in their classroom and most
07:22 - of them are doing it for the very very
07:23 - first time and their count taking the
07:25 - leap of faith of trying this new field
07:27 - and we've given them tutorials that make
07:30 - it really really easy to do and in fact
07:32 - if you spend just five minutes looking
07:33 - at the tutorial you realize that you can
07:35 - probably wing it and your kids will have
07:37 - a great time have but it's still useful
07:39 - to have somebody there and back up just
07:42 - in case you can't and in fact each of
07:44 - our tutorials have some levels they get
07:46 - difficult enough that somebody might get
07:48 - stuck like if you needed to do a for
07:50 - loop with an if statement inside it
07:52 - that's a concept that people have
07:53 - trouble learning the very first time so
07:55 - I think somebody technical who's run
07:56 - through the tutorial once in advance is
07:58 - really useful the such as their comments
08:01 - with teachers yeah brought in college
08:03 - yeah I remember last year going into the
08:04 - classroom but the teachers like I am
08:06 - really afraid to teach this because I
08:08 - don't know about computers and I don't
08:10 - know what's going to happen and you know
08:12 - but you know before we started she was
08:14 - like okay okay you got it you got it you
08:17 - know are you are you going to make sure
08:18 - there are things okay now halfway
08:20 - through she was fine I bet is how we
08:22 - were done she said to me hey I just
08:24 - teaching after school club with this so
08:25 - it's not actually that intimidating once
08:28 - you get going but having you there
08:29 - knowing that you're a tech person or
08:31 - that you can do it is is it gives a ton
08:33 - of confidence the teacher that this is
08:35 - going to be okay and it might take a
08:36 - teacher who wouldn't have done it and
08:38 - just pushed over the edge so they're
08:40 - like I can do this is my classroom just
08:41 - because you're there so yeah absolutely
08:43 - that confidence is really important yeah
08:45 - the other thing that's super valuable is
08:47 - having if you're attending
08:49 - person in your classroom or via at video
08:52 - conferences helping brought in people's
08:55 - view of the importance of computer
08:57 - science and coding where people
08:59 - stereotypes are that coding is first of
09:03 - all their computer science is only about
09:04 - coding they don't realize that it's
09:06 - about cybersecurity or data analysis or
09:09 - you know network architecture design or
09:12 - those types of things people stereotypes
09:14 - ulcers that this is a field for genius
09:16 - white men they don't realize that you
09:18 - can participate in it regardless of your
09:21 - gender or background and you don't need
09:23 - to be a genius to do the most basic
09:26 - stuff and then the third stereotype is
09:28 - that computer science is basically about
09:29 - websites apps and games they don't
09:32 - realize that it's used for you know soil
09:35 - analysis for agriculture or you know if
09:39 - all that all the banks of the world run
09:41 - on computer systems all
09:43 - telecommunications is run by software
09:45 - own you know helping robbing people
09:47 - sense in general of the importance of
09:49 - computer science in tomorrow's world is
09:52 - something anybody can talk about if
09:53 - you're familiar with tech and if you can
09:55 - bring a personal story about it that
09:57 - also helps a lot because kids can't
09:59 - really quite imagine what it's like to
10:01 - work day to day in a tech company or in
10:03 - a text fear or do be a student in a
10:06 - university program one thing I found
10:08 - really helpful with that was playing a
10:10 - video at the beginning there's a whole
10:12 - bunch of videos online their list is
10:13 - inspirational videos and you can see
10:15 - them right the beginning of the
10:16 - tutorials there's a page on the new
10:19 - tutorials on Star Wars of my cat both
10:20 - know the page of videos you can play and
10:23 - sometimes you get in front of a
10:24 - classroom you don't know what to talk
10:26 - about right I want to say and play the
10:28 - video the kids get really excited
10:30 - because they see you know people they
10:32 - know or you know last year I had a bunch
10:34 - of kids all scream like she here out of
10:36 - the junior came on the street and that
10:38 - was fun and it was exciting for them and
10:40 - then being able to play off of that
10:42 - afterward if you know relate some of the
10:44 - things that they were talking about the
10:45 - things I had done in my job was cool and
10:47 - just gave me a starting point to and you
10:50 - know also just the classroom management
10:52 - or if you play video that it forces the
10:53 - gifts to sit down and be quiet and watch
10:55 - something which is you know helpful with
10:58 - a classroom full of students so that's a
11:00 - great way to get started and you
11:03 - to talk about very long I mean I don't
11:04 - think the at the end of the day you want
11:06 - the Deaf time to actually do the
11:07 - experience so you know three minutes
11:10 - five minutes that's a perfect amount of
11:12 - time to tell them a little bit about
11:14 - what you do there's a question there
11:18 - from Oscar I think saying I signed up as
11:21 - a volunteer but I've actually receive
11:23 - any information on how to select the
11:25 - actual school or their time to volunteer
11:26 - on what we're doing is rat where we've
11:29 - made a map where schools can see the
11:31 - volunteers and schools and teachers will
11:33 - actively reach out to you if you aren't
11:37 - reached out to that maybe because you're
11:38 - in a region where there's either more
11:40 - volunteers than teachers who want
11:42 - volunteers I guess that's the only
11:44 - reason is either more volunteers or not
11:47 - enough teachers participate in yeah but
11:49 - the way we want this is for those
11:51 - schools to reach out to the volunteers
11:52 - we aren't giving any of your email
11:54 - addresses to them they have a form where
11:55 - they can type in stuff and you'll
11:58 - receive an email without your emailed us
11:59 - being disclosed that if you want to
12:01 - respond then you can connect directly
12:03 - with the teacher adamant if nobody
12:05 - reaches out to you at other option fact
12:08 - is to just find a local school and try
12:10 - to convince them to post an hour of code
12:12 - and offer your help and letting them do
12:14 - that you know the way the hour of code
12:16 - spreads from school to school is partly
12:18 - from teacher word of mouth but partly
12:20 - from people from the outside just asking
12:22 - and offered help so if you're if you're
12:24 - not already tied up with an appointment
12:25 - to do this I encourage you to reach out
12:28 - to a local school and try to make it
12:29 - happen and so that multiple times
12:31 - they're pretty excited to hear like if
12:33 - you just reach out you know they
12:34 - probably don't know where to start so if
12:35 - you reach out to your local school of
12:37 - that could be a great way you know teach
12:39 - you a problem you thrilled if you say
12:40 - you're off you offer to do it for them
12:41 - and they may have already heard of the
12:43 - hour of code but not know how to do it
12:44 - themselves so that's really helpful when
12:47 - you reach out I think we have one
12:49 - related to them question about a local
12:50 - makerspace and that's another way of
12:52 - doing is if you have something like a
12:53 - makerspace it's so somebody's asking
12:57 - they have a they have an hour of code
12:59 - class at a local makerspace we already
13:01 - do several cody classes does anything
13:03 - special we need to do for the hour of
13:04 - code and you worked with maker spaces
13:06 - before and yeah I would definitely
13:09 - encourage you to just you know make an
13:11 - event of it you might encourage
13:12 - you don't normally come to your
13:13 - makerspace to come and bite the students
13:16 - who come to bring their friends or you
13:18 - know make it a special activity you can
13:20 - do one of the hours of code on are on
13:21 - our website or if you have a bigger
13:24 - space and you have a bunch of activity
13:26 - you can they go what would be a fun
13:27 - activity to do for an hour in your space
13:30 - thats related to coding it doesn't have
13:31 - to be something on the website you might
13:33 - have great ideas about how to use your
13:34 - makerspace for that our tutorials aren't
13:37 - the required thing to do they're just
13:38 - recommended and fun and awesome if you
13:41 - want to use them and you can do
13:42 - something that you make up yourself as
13:43 - long as it teaches computer science or
13:45 - conviction of thinking or robotics or
13:47 - anything and everything yeah you can
13:50 - also if you want to with your makerspace
13:51 - of I do one where we can do anything on
13:53 - the website but we print out the
13:56 - certificates afterward for all the
13:57 - students and this is place in the
13:59 - website you just go ahead and print out
14:00 - the certificates for all the students
14:02 - whether or not they did this particular
14:04 - tutorial or that particular tutorial and
14:06 - the kids got a blast out of taking their
14:07 - certificates off to show their parents
14:09 - that they dunk hour of code and you can
14:11 - also register your makerspace is being
14:13 - an hour code event so you know you can
14:16 - go ahead and do that as well if you do
14:18 - want to print out a certificate that's a
14:19 - cut out our / certificate and the
14:21 - teacher should have that link to if they
14:23 - don't have it you should let the teacher
14:24 - know that they can't print down
14:25 - certificates for any student /
14:27 - certificate / certificate yeah um we
14:32 - also have another question from Oscar so
14:34 - I didn't receive a link to the Hangout
14:36 - we're on right now except you saw up for
14:38 - YouTube you can check if you're
14:39 - registered correctly if you go to the
14:41 - volunteer map I shared a link in the
14:43 - showcase that's coated or splash
14:45 - volunteer / local and if you search for
14:47 - the location that you entered then you
14:49 - should see your own pin show up and
14:51 - that's how teachers will be contacting
14:53 - you so if you can't find yourself on
14:54 - that map something might be wrong please
14:56 - do send us email at info add code org
14:59 - for indoors or were you register on
15:02 - co.org / volunteer and try again and see
15:05 - if uh if your pic shows up on the map um
15:08 - you should also have received an email
15:11 - after you signed up and that will that
15:14 - should verify that you have signed up
15:15 - correctly so just sit tight if you
15:17 - haven't received an email from teacher
15:18 - yet or reach out to a local school
15:21 - did you finish going through the agenda
15:23 - anything else you want to do I don't
15:25 - think so so just to reiterate on this
15:27 - agenda will be shared on earth how to
15:30 - code our code calm / how to / volunteers
15:34 - will share this agenda which has sample
15:36 - emails a review of what to do to prepare
15:38 - for a classroom you can refer back to it
15:41 - and we just really like to emphasize
15:42 - that we still have almost 10,000
15:45 - teachers looking for engineers in 10,000
15:48 - years who've not yet signed up so please
15:50 - share this with your friends with your
15:51 - company with anybody you know who might
15:53 - be interested in volunteering I know
15:56 - there's a set of the beginning but
15:57 - making sure you're familiar with at
15:59 - least one of our tutorials and that
16:02 - you've run through it from front to back
16:03 - is really important you know you don't
16:06 - need to use one of our tutorials but at
16:08 - it would be unfortunate to show up in
16:10 - our class and the teacher doesn't know
16:11 - what to do and you don't know it's
16:12 - bigger bigger than so and if you're if
16:15 - you don't already have a planet with
16:16 - what you'd like the kids to be doing at
16:18 - either the minecraft tutorial or the
16:20 - Star Wars tutorials that coded or just
16:22 - released in the last week are both
16:23 - fantastic there are also new this year
16:26 - so if you have kids who have done the
16:28 - our code before you can make sure no one
16:30 - in the class has done it which is a
16:31 - great place to start then one benefit of
16:33 - the Star Wars tutorial is that it lets
16:35 - you use either drag and drop coding or
16:37 - JavaScript and we've done classroom
16:40 - testing the JavaScript coding gets
16:42 - challenging quickly kids have trouble
16:44 - with syntax that they you know they'll
16:46 - miss capitalized or forget to use
16:49 - parentheses for semicolons and
16:51 - especially when they're defining
16:52 - functions knowing how to close the curly
16:54 - braces and what goes where they have
16:56 - trouble with eyeshadow semicolons but
16:59 - having somebody actually knows how to do
17:01 - that stuff in the classroom that makes
17:02 - it much more likely to the classroom
17:03 - actually tries the JavaScript version at
17:05 - so if any of you are familiar with
17:08 - JavaScript at consider your role really
17:11 - useful in helping the kids who want to
17:13 - give it a shot trying it that way but I
17:16 - think we're done great thanks so much

Cleaned transcript:

we are getting started with our first volunteer info session if you're an engineer or work with computer science in your day to day and you volunteer to sign up technology with the RF code this session is for you right now we're just sharing a few links in the sidebar that will be helpful for you we're going to share the agenda what we'll be talking about today and you can add sanu ghal doc you prefer back to at any time and we will also be sharing the link that teachers are using to find volunteers you can see how you're getting matched live on the website so to go through a few items just to get a sense but we're going to chat about we're going to go over how to coordinate with a teacher in your area what to bring to your hour of code what to do at your classroom session is it step by step and how you can further engage other people companies like your company or friends and we will then go to a Q&A session you can see on the right sidebar that we have an option for you to submit questions so after we go through our discussion and then we'll answer questions as you submit them so first and foremost we wanted to start with how do you get connected with the volunteer so everybody here hopefully has already signed up at code.org / volunteer and you should see in our showcase sidebar the link which is coded org slash volunteer / local and that is the map teachers are using to find volunteers so your address whatever address you gave up gave us is showing up as a pin on that map and teachers can select those pins um then they'll fill out a contact form so probably some of you have already received emails from teachers so what you need to do next is reply to that email what you'll want to follow up with is just to reiterate your name your company your job description or if you're a student where you're studying and what you're studying um please provide the days and times you are available to volunteer at the school and it'd be great to share just a little blur but why did why did you sign up to volunteer what's exciting about computers to you what do you want to share with students and then you'll need to ask the teacher what paperwork you need to fill out for the school before you volunteer so the point that you reply to the teacher you can see you are then directly working with that teacher to work with their school and it is your responsibility to work with the future work with the school to find a day and time that works for you if I love the paperwork you need to fill out and we're really excited to be launching this volunteer program but at code.org we don't have the capacity to handle any individual volunteer requests so it's up to you to work with school to set that up before you even arrived at the school is a few things you need to fill out so almost every public school is going to ask you to submit a background check and there might be other paperwork or formed you to fill out as an outside volunteer coming in so you'll need to work with your teacher they might need to ask their principal or administrator what forms they do need to fill out and you'll also want to confirm before you show up with your teacher the day and time you'll be at the school if you're just going to show up for one hour of class if you're going to show it for multiple class periods that day if you're going to an assembly that's all stuff you'll want to set up before and then it's important to establish expectations with the teacher before you arrive of what you'll be doing so we really set up this program as a way to inspire students to keep learning and so it's important that teachers recognize that your role as a volunteer is much more on the side of being a mentor and showing how students can learn and really a less emphasis on providing technical help for the hour of code the RF code is really easy to do teachers love it students love it we're happy to have volunteers answer questions but we really want to help students and teachers learn how to do this themselves so when you go to your hour of code what should you bring um one thing we recommend is that if you're coming from a company it could be great to bring some swags if it's stickers or handouts from your company to share with students students younger tips especially really love stickers your doesn't want to think about in terms of talking points what is your store with computer time and what entire you to learn the first time and why do you continue to stay engaged now let's we're going to move to they of what to do during your classroom visit so at this point you should have established with your teacher what time and day you'll be at the school at that time and day you'll need to sign in at the front office and greet the teacher you'll want to go over your schedule for the day and maybe confirm any talking points um want to spend 5 to 10 minutes talking about computer science so introduce yourself and your story what do you do with computer science in your job or when your studies and maybe share an anecdote of why did you say why what what was the first computer science class you took what was your first exposure why did you decide to keep learning what do you love about your job what kind of opportunities has computer science given you we have a link in our agenda doc which is linked to our inspirational hour of code videos so that's a video you could show to the classroom and then after that brief interruption you'll want to just dive into the tutorials so the tutorials are available at code.org / learn as you may have seen we have some pretty exciting new tutorials this year including Star Wars and then just today we announced minecraft so what people want to work with students through those tutorials make sure that they're learning on their own pace and so you're there to provide support and to answer questions but we really want students to be learning this themselves and then finally what we really like to see is help help how our volunteers can engage even more volunteers so right now we have about 700 sorry seven thousand volunteers signed up but we have seventeen thousand teachers who are still looking for volunteers and so any support we can get from our volunteer community and engaging even more people would be phenomenal so we've got a sample email in this document where you can send that to your coworkers and send it to your boss if you're at a CS program at a university share with your entire department and that's where we can that's how we can recruit even more volunteers so this is a broad overview and that we will be right back okay we actually like to introduce hi acres yeah i mean you come on Jordan um Hadi poor toby of course our cofounder and CEO and Alice Stein glass one of our product managers for our product and engineering team yeah yeah that's what is that roll over everybody hi so we were just going over the road overview of what to do as a volunteer how to connect with the teacher what to do when you sign up and haunting I'll come show a little bit more about why we're introducing this program this year and well you take it from them yeah sure at yeah the goal the hour of code is to get tens of thousands of teachers to try computer science in some format in their classroom and most of them are doing it for the very very first time and their count taking the leap of faith of trying this new field and we've given them tutorials that make it really really easy to do and in fact if you spend just five minutes looking at the tutorial you realize that you can probably wing it and your kids will have a great time have but it's still useful to have somebody there and back up just in case you can't and in fact each of our tutorials have some levels they get difficult enough that somebody might get stuck like if you needed to do a for loop with an if statement inside it that's a concept that people have trouble learning the very first time so I think somebody technical who's run through the tutorial once in advance is really useful the such as their comments with teachers yeah brought in college yeah I remember last year going into the classroom but the teachers like I am really afraid to teach this because I don't know about computers and I don't know what's going to happen and you know but you know before we started she was like okay okay you got it you got it you know are you are you going to make sure there are things okay now halfway through she was fine I bet is how we were done she said to me hey I just teaching after school club with this so it's not actually that intimidating once you get going but having you there knowing that you're a tech person or that you can do it is is it gives a ton of confidence the teacher that this is going to be okay and it might take a teacher who wouldn't have done it and just pushed over the edge so they're like I can do this is my classroom just because you're there so yeah absolutely that confidence is really important yeah the other thing that's super valuable is having if you're attending person in your classroom or via at video conferences helping brought in people's view of the importance of computer science and coding where people stereotypes are that coding is first of all their computer science is only about coding they don't realize that it's about cybersecurity or data analysis or you know network architecture design or those types of things people stereotypes ulcers that this is a field for genius white men they don't realize that you can participate in it regardless of your gender or background and you don't need to be a genius to do the most basic stuff and then the third stereotype is that computer science is basically about websites apps and games they don't realize that it's used for you know soil analysis for agriculture or you know if all that all the banks of the world run on computer systems all telecommunications is run by software own you know helping robbing people sense in general of the importance of computer science in tomorrow's world is something anybody can talk about if you're familiar with tech and if you can bring a personal story about it that also helps a lot because kids can't really quite imagine what it's like to work day to day in a tech company or in a text fear or do be a student in a university program one thing I found really helpful with that was playing a video at the beginning there's a whole bunch of videos online their list is inspirational videos and you can see them right the beginning of the tutorials there's a page on the new tutorials on Star Wars of my cat both know the page of videos you can play and sometimes you get in front of a classroom you don't know what to talk about right I want to say and play the video the kids get really excited because they see you know people they know or you know last year I had a bunch of kids all scream like she here out of the junior came on the street and that was fun and it was exciting for them and then being able to play off of that afterward if you know relate some of the things that they were talking about the things I had done in my job was cool and just gave me a starting point to and you know also just the classroom management or if you play video that it forces the gifts to sit down and be quiet and watch something which is you know helpful with a classroom full of students so that's a great way to get started and you to talk about very long I mean I don't think the at the end of the day you want the Deaf time to actually do the experience so you know three minutes five minutes that's a perfect amount of time to tell them a little bit about what you do there's a question there from Oscar I think saying I signed up as a volunteer but I've actually receive any information on how to select the actual school or their time to volunteer on what we're doing is rat where we've made a map where schools can see the volunteers and schools and teachers will actively reach out to you if you aren't reached out to that maybe because you're in a region where there's either more volunteers than teachers who want volunteers I guess that's the only reason is either more volunteers or not enough teachers participate in yeah but the way we want this is for those schools to reach out to the volunteers we aren't giving any of your email addresses to them they have a form where they can type in stuff and you'll receive an email without your emailed us being disclosed that if you want to respond then you can connect directly with the teacher adamant if nobody reaches out to you at other option fact is to just find a local school and try to convince them to post an hour of code and offer your help and letting them do that you know the way the hour of code spreads from school to school is partly from teacher word of mouth but partly from people from the outside just asking and offered help so if you're if you're not already tied up with an appointment to do this I encourage you to reach out to a local school and try to make it happen and so that multiple times they're pretty excited to hear like if you just reach out you know they probably don't know where to start so if you reach out to your local school of that could be a great way you know teach you a problem you thrilled if you say you're off you offer to do it for them and they may have already heard of the hour of code but not know how to do it themselves so that's really helpful when you reach out I think we have one related to them question about a local makerspace and that's another way of doing is if you have something like a makerspace it's so somebody's asking they have a they have an hour of code class at a local makerspace we already do several cody classes does anything special we need to do for the hour of code and you worked with maker spaces before and yeah I would definitely encourage you to just you know make an event of it you might encourage you don't normally come to your makerspace to come and bite the students who come to bring their friends or you know make it a special activity you can do one of the hours of code on are on our website or if you have a bigger space and you have a bunch of activity you can they go what would be a fun activity to do for an hour in your space thats related to coding it doesn't have to be something on the website you might have great ideas about how to use your makerspace for that our tutorials aren't the required thing to do they're just recommended and fun and awesome if you want to use them and you can do something that you make up yourself as long as it teaches computer science or conviction of thinking or robotics or anything and everything yeah you can also if you want to with your makerspace of I do one where we can do anything on the website but we print out the certificates afterward for all the students and this is place in the website you just go ahead and print out the certificates for all the students whether or not they did this particular tutorial or that particular tutorial and the kids got a blast out of taking their certificates off to show their parents that they dunk hour of code and you can also register your makerspace is being an hour code event so you know you can go ahead and do that as well if you do want to print out a certificate that's a cut out our / certificate and the teacher should have that link to if they don't have it you should let the teacher know that they can't print down certificates for any student / certificate / certificate yeah um we also have another question from Oscar so I didn't receive a link to the Hangout we're on right now except you saw up for YouTube you can check if you're registered correctly if you go to the volunteer map I shared a link in the showcase that's coated or splash volunteer / local and if you search for the location that you entered then you should see your own pin show up and that's how teachers will be contacting you so if you can't find yourself on that map something might be wrong please do send us email at info add code org for indoors or were you register on co.org / volunteer and try again and see if uh if your pic shows up on the map um you should also have received an email after you signed up and that will that should verify that you have signed up correctly so just sit tight if you haven't received an email from teacher yet or reach out to a local school did you finish going through the agenda anything else you want to do I don't think so so just to reiterate on this agenda will be shared on earth how to code our code calm / how to / volunteers will share this agenda which has sample emails a review of what to do to prepare for a classroom you can refer back to it and we just really like to emphasize that we still have almost 10,000 teachers looking for engineers in 10,000 years who've not yet signed up so please share this with your friends with your company with anybody you know who might be interested in volunteering I know there's a set of the beginning but making sure you're familiar with at least one of our tutorials and that you've run through it from front to back is really important you know you don't need to use one of our tutorials but at it would be unfortunate to show up in our class and the teacher doesn't know what to do and you don't know it's bigger bigger than so and if you're if you don't already have a planet with what you'd like the kids to be doing at either the minecraft tutorial or the Star Wars tutorials that coded or just released in the last week are both fantastic there are also new this year so if you have kids who have done the our code before you can make sure no one in the class has done it which is a great place to start then one benefit of the Star Wars tutorial is that it lets you use either drag and drop coding or JavaScript and we've done classroom testing the JavaScript coding gets challenging quickly kids have trouble with syntax that they you know they'll miss capitalized or forget to use parentheses for semicolons and especially when they're defining functions knowing how to close the curly braces and what goes where they have trouble with eyeshadow semicolons but having somebody actually knows how to do that stuff in the classroom that makes it much more likely to the classroom actually tries the JavaScript version at so if any of you are familiar with JavaScript at consider your role really useful in helping the kids who want to give it a shot trying it that way but I think we're done great thanks so much everybody thanks guys thank you
