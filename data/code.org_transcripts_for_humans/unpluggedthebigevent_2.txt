00:06 - this lesson is called the big event it's
all about how we can control our
00:10 - programs and actually change the way a
program runs on the fly using events
00:15 - like the push of a button or the click
of a mouse for this lesson you'll be
00:21 - controlled with a paper remote control
yeah it's just like a real live video
00:26 - game an event is an action that causes
something to happen it's like when you
00:32 - click the button on a mouse and a
webpage loads that's an event when you
00:35 - touch your screen on a tablet to scroll
that's an event also events are a great
00:41 - way of letting the user direct your
program whenever they need or want to
00:45 - you know they're there things that that
that happened that we all respond to we
00:51 - we feel hungry and we go to the fridge
we hear the mailman come and he puts our
00:56 - mail in the mailbox and then we go get
our mail those are just like the events
01:00 - of pushing a button or moving a joystick
they are something that happens that
01:04 - triggers us to do something most people
who program video games there's just
01:10 - there's just one event that everyone
calls update and it happens 30 or 60
01:14 - times a second and so for video game
programmers that's almost more important
01:19 - as an event than the buttons are the
joystick because what we tend to do is
01:23 - the main event we're watching for is
that tic happening and then we check the
01:28 - joystick in the tic so we say oh has
somebody pushed the button this frame
01:33 - yes or no
without events you couldn't you know the
01:37 - player couldn't move he couldn't
couldn't
01:41 - your player couldn't jump you wouldn't
be able to control what's going on the
01:46 - video game wouldn't be able to animate
anything because it's only because of
01:50 - the events of time passing that we're
able to to make animations things move
