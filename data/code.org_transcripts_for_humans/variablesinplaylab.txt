00:05 - a variable is a container that you can
00:07 - store a value in when you use that
00:09 - variable in an algorithm it opens up the
00:11 - container and looks at the value inside
00:14 - this lets you write smarter algorithms
00:16 - that behave differently depending on the
00:18 - values stored in the variable for
00:20 - example if you wanted to write an
00:22 - algorithm to say happy birthday you're
00:24 - turning 10 to my little brother
00:28 - that's great now but when i run it next
00:30 - year i'd wanted to say happy birthday
00:32 - you're turning 11.
00:34 - i could create a variable called age
00:37 - store my brother's age and write my
00:39 - algorithm and say happy birthday you're
00:41 - turning age instead because variables
00:44 - can change each year i can update the
00:46 - variable age to equal age plus one
00:51 - now you're going to try a play lab where
00:53 - you're given different games and you can
00:56 - change the values of variables like
00:58 - speed height score in order to change
01:01 - the game you won't have to change the
01:03 - algorithm of the game to change how it
01:04 - plays just the variable
01:07 - in my work for kindle and on x-ray for
01:09 - books we apply variables in many
01:11 - different ways
01:12 - one way that you can use a variable is
01:14 - to store page numbers of a book a user
01:17 - can increase and decrease the size of
01:19 - the font in the page
01:21 - based on the font size the number of
01:23 - pages in the book can change
01:25 - we can adjust it by storing the page
01:27 - numbers in a variable

Cleaned transcript:

a variable is a container that you can store a value in when you use that variable in an algorithm it opens up the container and looks at the value inside this lets you write smarter algorithms that behave differently depending on the values stored in the variable for example if you wanted to write an algorithm to say happy birthday you're turning 10 to my little brother that's great now but when i run it next year i'd wanted to say happy birthday you're turning 11. i could create a variable called age store my brother's age and write my algorithm and say happy birthday you're turning age instead because variables can change each year i can update the variable age to equal age plus one now you're going to try a play lab where you're given different games and you can change the values of variables like speed height score in order to change the game you won't have to change the algorithm of the game to change how it plays just the variable in my work for kindle and on xray for books we apply variables in many different ways one way that you can use a variable is to store page numbers of a book a user can increase and decrease the size of the font in the page based on the font size the number of pages in the book can change we can adjust it by storing the page numbers in a variable
