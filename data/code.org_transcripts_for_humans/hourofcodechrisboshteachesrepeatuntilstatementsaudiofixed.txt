00:00 - Every athlete knows that you get good by practicing,
00:03 - by repeating the same moves until you get really good, 
or until you reach your goal.
00:07 - When I was in high school,
00:09 - I wouldn't leave practice until I made 10 free throws in a row.
00:12 - Similarly, when you get to a computer program and repeat a command
00:16 - you can give it an exact number of times to repeat,
00:19 - or you can define a goal,
00:21 - and tell it to repeat the command until it reaches some goal.
00:25 - In the next example, the "repeat" block is changed,
00:29 - instead of specifying how many times you want it to repeat
00:32 - you can use the "repeat until" block 
to tell the angry bird to do the same thing
00:36 - until it gets the pig or until it crashes into a wall.
00:40 - And again, we can put multiple blocks inside the loop 
and repeat a series of actions.
