With timestamps:

00:07 - With just a couple of sprites,
00:08 - you can make fun and interactive 
projects like animations,
00:13 - stories, greeting cards and more.
00:20 - To make more complex games 
and simulations,
00:23 - you're probably going to want 
a lot of sprites.
00:27 - When you have a group of sprites 
with the same costume,
00:30 - actions will usually affect all of them.
00:33 - You can make three strawberries like this
00:36 - and then change the size of all of them
with one set size block.
00:41 - If you only want to change 
the size of one of the sprites,
00:45 - you'll need to use events.
00:47 - This event block is triggered
when a sprite is clicked.
00:52 - If we move the set size block 
over to this event,
00:56 - what will happen 
when the user clicks a sprite?
00:59 - The event tells the computer 
to wait for the click
01:03 - and then respond by changing
the size of all the strawberries.
01:08 - That's pretty cool.
01:09 - But that's not exactly what we wanted.
01:11 - Events like this one can be expanded 
with this button.
01:16 - This special block inside
lets you control the single sprite
01:20 - that is actually clicked.
01:23 - Let's change out this block.
01:25 - When we run the program this time,
01:28 - we can change the size 
of each sprite one at a time.
01:33 - You can use this to create 
simple programs
01:36 - like a game that tests 
how fast you can click
01:38 - to remove sprites from the screen.

01:43 - Here's a game in progress.
01:45 - The bunnies are going to wander around 
and eat the carrots.
01:48 - This block says 
"when touches" and it's an event
01:54 - that involves two different sprites.
01:57 - If you have lots of sprites 
with these costumes,
02:01 - the special block inside the event block,
02:04 - makes sure that things only happen 
to the sprites that actually touch.

Cleaned transcript:

With just a couple of sprites, you can make fun and interactive projects like animations, stories, greeting cards and more. To make more complex games and simulations, you're probably going to want a lot of sprites. When you have a group of sprites with the same costume, actions will usually affect all of them. You can make three strawberries like this and then change the size of all of them with one set size block. If you only want to change the size of one of the sprites, you'll need to use events. This event block is triggered when a sprite is clicked. If we move the set size block over to this event, what will happen when the user clicks a sprite? The event tells the computer to wait for the click and then respond by changing the size of all the strawberries. That's pretty cool. But that's not exactly what we wanted. Events like this one can be expanded with this button. This special block inside lets you control the single sprite that is actually clicked. Let's change out this block. When we run the program this time, we can change the size of each sprite one at a time. You can use this to create simple programs like a game that tests how fast you can click to remove sprites from the screen. Let's look at another program. Here's a game in progress. The bunnies are going to wander around and eat the carrots. This block says "when touches" and it's an event that involves two different sprites. If you have lots of sprites with these costumes, the special block inside the event block, makes sure that things only happen to the sprites that actually touch. Understanding groups of sprites can take some practise, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to create amazing games and powerful simulations with just a few blocks of code.
