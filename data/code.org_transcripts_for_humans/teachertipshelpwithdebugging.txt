00:04 - so when it comes to debugging in the
00:05 - classroom the absolute best thing you
00:08 - could do is to just be there with the
00:09 - student if you could sit next to them
00:11 - you don't even have to say much just ask
00:13 - them to talk through their code to you
00:15 - to give them a chance to look through
00:17 - what they wrote and see if they can find
00:18 - any errors see if they can catch any
00:20 - mistakes first that's the best thing you
00:22 - can do just be there for them but in a
00:24 - classroom for students that can be
00:26 - really difficult
00:27 - so the other thing you can do is just
00:28 - give them a little bit of an anchor you
00:30 - tell them hey i'd like you to look at
00:32 - maybe these four or five lines of code
00:34 - and i'm gonna do another lap around the
00:35 - room i'm gonna go help out some other
00:36 - students i will come back to you
00:38 - and when i do if you don't have it
00:40 - figured out yet we'll still work through
00:41 - this together but you give them that
00:43 - time and they'll do something with it
00:46 - some phrases to keep in your back pocket
00:48 - when leading or coaching students
00:51 - uh when they say i don't know what to do
00:54 - i'm stuck say where are you stuck at
00:56 - what point are you stuck and then they
00:58 - walk you through the code and at that
01:00 - point you start to see things that maybe
01:02 - you may not have seen before and another
01:04 - student will pop in and say well
01:05 - actually this is where the air is the
01:07 - other thing i would encourage you to do
01:09 - with your classroom culture is to really
01:11 - embrace mistakes
01:13 - and making sure that students know that
01:15 - it's okay to make mistakes it's normal
01:18 - it's part of computer science the whole
01:20 - thing
01:21 - is
01:22 - making those mistakes banging your head
01:24 - against the wall and figuring it out and
01:27 - feeling that just sense of complete
01:30 - satisfaction that you were able to
01:32 - accomplish something one thing i really
01:34 - love about code.org for debugging is the
01:36 - ability to jump between blocks and text
01:39 - when it comes to code
01:40 - some students especially if they have
01:42 - experience with code kind of have an
01:44 - aversion to block mode and i understand
01:46 - that it's where they started and they
01:47 - think they should be doing something
01:48 - more than that
01:50 - but having the blocks can be really
01:51 - really powerful for helping students
01:53 - understand the way their code is nested
01:55 - and the way code is built on each other
01:57 - when they're writing loops when they're
01:59 - writing if statements and things like
02:01 - that being able to jump into that
02:03 - color-coded block mode lets them see the
02:05 - actual structure of their code and it
02:07 - lets them see why they might be running
02:09 - into some logical errors they can say oh
02:10 - i didn't close this loop properly or i
02:12 - included something in it that i
02:14 - shouldn't have
02:23 - you

so when it comes to debugging in the classroom the absolute best thing you could do is to just be there with the student if you could sit next to them you don't even have to say much just ask them to talk through their code to you to give them a chance to look through what they wrote and see if they can find any errors see if they can catch any mistakes first that's the best thing you can do just be there for them but in a classroom for students that can be really difficult so the other thing you can do is just give them a little bit of an anchor you tell them hey i'd like you to look at maybe these four or five lines of code and i'm gonna do another lap around the room i'm gonna go help out some other students i will come back to you and when i do if you don't have it figured out yet we'll still work through this together but you give them that time and they'll do something with it some phrases to keep in your back pocket when leading or coaching students uh when they say i don't know what to do i'm stuck say where are you stuck at what point are you stuck and then they walk you through the code and at that point you start to see things that maybe you may not have seen before and another student will pop in and say well actually this is where the air is the other thing i would encourage you to do with your classroom culture is to really embrace mistakes and making sure that students know that it's okay to make mistakes it's normal it's part of computer science the whole thing is making those mistakes banging your head against the wall and figuring it out and feeling that just sense of complete satisfaction that you were able to accomplish something one thing i really love about code.org for debugging is the ability to jump between blocks and text when it comes to code some students especially if they have experience with code kind of have an aversion to block mode and i understand that it's where they started and they think they should be doing something more than that but having the blocks can be really really powerful for helping students understand the way their code is nested and the way code is built on each other when they're writing loops when they're writing if statements and things like that being able to jump into that colorcoded block mode lets them see the actual structure of their code and it lets them see why they might be running into some logical errors they can say oh i didn't close this loop properly or i included something in it that i shouldn't have you
