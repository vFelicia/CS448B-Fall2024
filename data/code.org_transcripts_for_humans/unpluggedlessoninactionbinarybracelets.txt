With timestamps:

00:11 - okay
00:13 - how many of you have heard of
00:17 - binary
00:19 - a couple of you when you're dealing with
00:20 - computers you're dealing with
00:22 - electricity and most specifically it's
00:24 - usually
00:25 - on and off
00:27 - and actually everything you do in a
00:30 - computer
00:31 - can be represented
00:33 - as on
00:35 - or off
00:36 - so you can
00:37 - show information
00:40 - using combinations
00:42 - of on or off or up and down
00:46 - or
00:47 - left and right
00:48 - pretty much any combination of two
00:51 - opposites
00:52 - and when you have these two opposites
00:56 - we call that language
00:58 - binary binary
01:00 - perfect
01:02 - so
01:02 - for every space
01:06 - you can have two options in that space
01:08 - we already talked about having either a
01:11 - zero
01:13 - or a
01:15 - one
01:15 - one
01:17 - right
01:19 - why don't we use on
01:21 - as just a clear box
01:24 - and off would be
01:26 - a dark box in our activity today we're
01:29 - going to say that a dark box means
01:31 - everything is off like all the lights
01:32 - are off in the house
01:34 - dark box means
01:37 - and a
01:38 - empty box or a white box means
01:42 - fun
01:43 - so what we're gonna do next
01:46 - is i'm gonna hand out these worksheets
01:49 - and do you know what they actually are
01:53 - these are
01:55 - yep they're binary codes
01:57 - which means this is how
01:59 - you would represent or show
02:02 - a letter
02:04 - if you were on the inside of a computer
02:06 - all right so
02:09 - i'm going to hand these out real quick
02:11 - so that you can all see the code the
02:13 - decoder key
02:14 - but i'm not going to have you do
02:16 - anything with them yet
02:19 - so right now
02:21 - i'm gonna put a letter on the board
02:41 - how many of these spaces
02:44 - they're called digits
02:49 - they're actually called binary digits
02:52 - which we squish down to the word
02:58 - bit
03:00 - how many of these bits
03:03 - do we need to make up one letter
03:06 - eight yes
03:10 - five how many are on the board
03:12 - eight
03:13 - eight very good
03:15 - so we need eight
03:17 - bits
03:18 - to make a letter
03:20 - and we call that
03:23 - we call that grouping of eight bits
03:31 - a bite how many of you have heard that
03:33 - term
03:34 - a bite yep it's what makes up a gigabyte
03:37 - or a kilobyte or a terabyte or whatever
03:41 - you happen to be using right
03:43 - there's a secret kind of funny name
03:49 - for half of a bite what do you think
03:51 - half of a bite is called
03:54 - i saw your hand first do you have a
03:55 - guess
03:57 - how about you
03:58 - a millibyte no there there is such thing
04:01 - as millibate
04:02 - but half a bite is called
04:08 - a nibble
04:11 - a nibble
04:14 - isn't that what you call it when you
04:15 - take half a bite
04:17 - some people spell it like this so that
04:19 - it's the same as
04:21 - bite
04:22 - but that's what it's called i'm not even
04:25 - kidding you
04:26 - all right so i want you to use your
04:28 - super secret decoder key
04:32 - and i want you to look up
04:34 - and see if you can figure out what the
04:35 - letter is all right you ready on the
04:37 - count of three
04:38 - one two three
04:40 - okay good
04:43 - okay so this was a k
04:45 - so now
04:46 - we all have our
04:49 - binary bracelets
04:50 - we're going to fill them in
04:53 - to look like the first letter of our
04:55 - first name
05:04 - and then you're going to color your
05:06 - bracelet
05:07 - to look like this
05:09 - so you'll color don't color color color
05:12 - color don't color color color
05:14 - and then you'll color don't color don't
05:16 - color color so
05:18 - color don't color don't color color and
05:20 - then you're gonna store your initial on
05:22 - a bracelet
05:31 - some kids will find it really hard to
05:33 - understand at first what we're doing
05:34 - with the decoding and you'll hear a lot
05:36 - of i don't get it or i don't understand
05:38 - it's okay if even about half the class
05:40 - is like that until you're done with all
05:42 - the examples just do some examples on
05:45 - your own have them figure some out that
05:47 - you write up and then finish off with
05:49 - the classroom coming up with one for you
05:51 - by that time they're usually all on
05:52 - board
05:54 - there's a big temptation in this lesson
05:56 - to over teach and go into binary and
06:00 - what binary numbers are and how they
06:02 - equate but you really don't have to talk
06:04 - about that decimal equivalent or any of
06:07 - that this is purely to give your
06:09 - students an idea how computers store and
06:12 - transmit information so they have a
06:14 - better idea why we do all this stuff so
06:16 - efficiently in the first place
06:22 - all right
06:23 - so
06:25 - what did we learn
06:27 - yes
06:33 - so we learned binary and we learned how
06:35 - to
06:36 - encode letters
06:38 - using binary right so now we know how to
06:40 - store entire letters
06:43 - using only
06:45 - offs and ons
06:47 - so what you guys have done
06:48 - is you have made a storage device
06:52 - and you are storing
06:54 - letters
06:55 - to your wrist right now
06:56 - yep so you're a computer

Cleaned transcript:

okay how many of you have heard of binary a couple of you when you're dealing with computers you're dealing with electricity and most specifically it's usually on and off and actually everything you do in a computer can be represented as on or off so you can show information using combinations of on or off or up and down or left and right pretty much any combination of two opposites and when you have these two opposites we call that language binary binary perfect so for every space you can have two options in that space we already talked about having either a zero or a one one right why don't we use on as just a clear box and off would be a dark box in our activity today we're going to say that a dark box means everything is off like all the lights are off in the house dark box means and a empty box or a white box means fun so what we're gonna do next is i'm gonna hand out these worksheets and do you know what they actually are these are yep they're binary codes which means this is how you would represent or show a letter if you were on the inside of a computer all right so i'm going to hand these out real quick so that you can all see the code the decoder key but i'm not going to have you do anything with them yet so right now i'm gonna put a letter on the board how many of these spaces they're called digits they're actually called binary digits which we squish down to the word bit how many of these bits do we need to make up one letter eight yes five how many are on the board eight eight very good so we need eight bits to make a letter and we call that we call that grouping of eight bits a bite how many of you have heard that term a bite yep it's what makes up a gigabyte or a kilobyte or a terabyte or whatever you happen to be using right there's a secret kind of funny name for half of a bite what do you think half of a bite is called i saw your hand first do you have a guess how about you a millibyte no there there is such thing as millibate but half a bite is called a nibble a nibble isn't that what you call it when you take half a bite some people spell it like this so that it's the same as bite but that's what it's called i'm not even kidding you all right so i want you to use your super secret decoder key and i want you to look up and see if you can figure out what the letter is all right you ready on the count of three one two three okay good okay so this was a k so now we all have our binary bracelets we're going to fill them in to look like the first letter of our first name and then you're going to color your bracelet to look like this so you'll color don't color color color color don't color color color and then you'll color don't color don't color color so color don't color don't color color and then you're gonna store your initial on a bracelet some kids will find it really hard to understand at first what we're doing with the decoding and you'll hear a lot of i don't get it or i don't understand it's okay if even about half the class is like that until you're done with all the examples just do some examples on your own have them figure some out that you write up and then finish off with the classroom coming up with one for you by that time they're usually all on board there's a big temptation in this lesson to over teach and go into binary and what binary numbers are and how they equate but you really don't have to talk about that decimal equivalent or any of that this is purely to give your students an idea how computers store and transmit information so they have a better idea why we do all this stuff so efficiently in the first place all right so what did we learn yes so we learned binary and we learned how to encode letters using binary right so now we know how to store entire letters using only offs and ons so what you guys have done is you have made a storage device and you are storing letters to your wrist right now yep so you're a computer
