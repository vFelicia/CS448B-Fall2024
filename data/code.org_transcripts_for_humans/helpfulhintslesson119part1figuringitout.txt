00:05 - in this puzzle the instructions say that
00:08 - what is underneath the cloud might be a
00:10 - flower or a honeycomb
00:12 - so we need to figure out how to get the
00:14 - b to the end of the path
00:17 - and once he's there we need to figure
00:19 - out how to tell if there's flower
00:21 - or honeycomb underneath the cloud if
00:24 - there's a flower you'll get nectar
00:26 - otherwise you're going to want to make
00:28 - honey
00:29 - how will the computer make that decision
