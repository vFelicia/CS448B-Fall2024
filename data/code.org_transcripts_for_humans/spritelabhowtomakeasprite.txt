00:10 - The first thing to do is set up a sprite.
00:12 - To add a sprite you can use the "make a new sprite" block.
00:18 - This block lets you give your sprite a name,
00:21 - a costume and a location.
00:24 - This sprite is named Dusty and the costume is a fish.
00:28 - If you want to change Dusty's location

00:44 - Let's change Dusty's size to 50...
00:46 - that's much more better.
00:48 - Action blocks like "set size" run only
once.
00:52 - Now let's get Dusty moving by using a behavior.
00:55 - You can start by giving Dusty the "spinning right" behavior.
00:59 - Once the behavior begins it will run over and over again forever,
01:04 - or until you tell it to stop.
01:06 - And that's all there is to it.
