00:05 - hi I'm Arie Duncan US Secretary of
00:07 - Education and I'm happy to officially
00:09 - kick off the 2013 Computer Science
00:12 - Education week we observe CS Ed week
00:15 - each year in recognition of the birthday
00:18 - of computing Pioneer Admiral Grace
00:20 - Murray Hopper and this year I would
00:22 - especially like to encourage all parents
00:25 - teachers and students to participate in
00:27 - the hour of code the hour of code is
00:30 - meant to encourage kids to try coding to
00:32 - let them see that it can be fun and
00:34 - creative and empowering most parents uh
00:37 - like me unfortunately didn't have the
00:39 - opportunity to learn computer skills
00:41 - growing up in school but today most kids
00:43 - will need those skills along with other
00:46 - skills in science technology and math
00:48 - when they enter a Workforce where they
00:50 - will compete with the best educated
00:52 - young people from everywhere in the
00:54 - world our hope is that the hour of cold
00:56 - activities will pique your interest but
00:59 - we will need to follow follow up on that
01:00 - interest with opportunities to take
01:02 - computer science courses in our nation's
01:05 - schools our children will need computer
01:07 - science so that they can learn how to
01:09 - use that knowledge in problem solving
01:11 - they will need to be able to code and
01:13 - they will need some understanding of
01:15 - algorithms software engineering Big Data
01:18 - cyber security and the limits of what
01:20 - computers can do the study of computer
01:23 - science is not just for those wishing to
01:25 - become it professionals it's actually
01:27 - for everyone it builds critical thinking
01:29 - and problem solving skills and it opens
01:32 - the door to so many forms of creative
01:34 - expression it sets kids up for Success
01:37 - across a wide range of fields including
01:39 - science engineering mathematics medicine
01:42 - education and the media arts and it
01:45 - empowers them to take an active part in
01:47 - the technological Transformations that
01:50 - are literally changing their world so as
01:53 - all of you join in the hour of cod look
01:55 - for other opportunities to learn more
01:57 - about computer science robotics
01:59 - engineering and so much more thank
02:06 - you
