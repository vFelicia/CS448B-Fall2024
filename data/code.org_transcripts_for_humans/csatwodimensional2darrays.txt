00:12 - question multiple choice quiz to their
00:15 - students just think about all of the
00:18 - data that the teacher would have
00:20 - for example
00:21 - let's say Amanda's answers are a c d c d
00:28 - Brian responds like this
00:31 - here is Cindy's quiz
00:34 - and finally Daniels
00:36 - each of these quizzes represents a 1D
00:39 - array of individual answer choices
00:42 - [Music]
00:43 - if we create an array of these arrays
00:46 - we get a two dimensional array
00:49 - a two-dimensional array is a data
00:52 - structure made up of an array of arrays
00:54 - we call this 2D for short it is often
00:57 - represented as a table with rows and
01:00 - columns
01:03 - CRA consists of an outer array and
01:06 - multiple inner Arrow arrays
01:07 - the other array is a one-dimensional
01:10 - array
01:11 - each position in this array contains a
01:14 - pointer to its respective inner array
01:16 - the inner arrays are also
01:18 - one-dimensional arrays
01:21 - these inner arrays contain the actual
01:23 - values we want to store
01:25 - good at 2D array is a table we can refer
01:28 - to each inner array as a row
01:31 - a row is a series of data that runs
01:34 - horizontally from left to right
01:37 - each row contains the quiz scores for a
01:39 - specific student
01:40 - the indexes for these one-dimensional
01:42 - arrays start at zero
01:46 - column is a series of data that runs
01:49 - vertically from top to bottom
01:51 - The Columns represent the answer choices
01:54 - for each question
01:55 - column indexes also started as zero
01:58 - [Music]
02:00 - here's our table written as a 2d array
02:03 - in this case the array was initialized
02:06 - with the starting values because these
02:09 - values are text we use the string data
02:12 - type notice the two-dimensional arrays
02:14 - use double square brackets after the
02:16 - data type
02:17 - we can access and modify elements in a
02:20 - 2d array in the same way that you can
02:22 - with 1D arrays
02:24 - three-dimensional arrays allows us to
02:26 - group together several similar arrays
02:29 - we can use just one data structure with
02:31 - its one identifier to store and access
02:34 - many values

foreign question multiple choice quiz to their students just think about all of the data that the teacher would have for example let's say Amanda's answers are a c d c d Brian responds like this here is Cindy's quiz and finally Daniels each of these quizzes represents a 1D array of individual answer choices if we create an array of these arrays we get a two dimensional array a twodimensional array is a data structure made up of an array of arrays we call this 2D for short it is often represented as a table with rows and columns CRA consists of an outer array and multiple inner Arrow arrays the other array is a onedimensional array each position in this array contains a pointer to its respective inner array the inner arrays are also onedimensional arrays these inner arrays contain the actual values we want to store good at 2D array is a table we can refer to each inner array as a row a row is a series of data that runs horizontally from left to right each row contains the quiz scores for a specific student the indexes for these onedimensional arrays start at zero column is a series of data that runs vertically from top to bottom The Columns represent the answer choices for each question column indexes also started as zero here's our table written as a 2d array in this case the array was initialized with the starting values because these values are text we use the string data type notice the twodimensional arrays use double square brackets after the data type we can access and modify elements in a 2d array in the same way that you can with 1D arrays threedimensional arrays allows us to group together several similar arrays we can use just one data structure with its one identifier to store and access many values
