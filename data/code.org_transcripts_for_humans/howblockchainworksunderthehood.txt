00:27 - services companies vertical Labs is an r
00:29 - d organization that builds protocols
00:31 - tools and services to improve the
00:33 - internet
00:35 - the best way to explain blockchain
00:37 - technology is by looking at the first
00:38 - example Bitcoin
00:41 - Bitcoin is a form of digital money it
00:43 - was released in 2009 and is still the
00:45 - most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin
00:47 - doesn't need essential authority to
00:48 - validate transactions over the network
00:50 - like a bank instead it's a peer-to-peer
00:54 - decentralized Network users on the
00:56 - network verify transactions by
00:58 - completing complex math problems
00:59 - essentially ordering the transactions
01:02 - from the past 10 minutes or so and they
01:04 - receive Bitcoin in return ensuring the
01:06 - transactions are correct and keep the
01:08 - network secure
01:09 - to build trust everything user addresses
01:12 - transactions and more on the network is
01:15 - publicly traceable unlike the algorithms
01:18 - or databases in a traditional bank but
01:20 - how can a currency work without a
01:22 - government or a bank
01:24 - let's think through an example together
01:26 - say you and five other people are all
01:29 - trying to buy and sell stuff from each
01:31 - other and you want to do it without
01:32 - traditional money and without anyone in
01:35 - charge
01:36 - you need a way to track all transactions
01:39 - you could have a book that you all share
01:41 - and each time you buy or sell something
01:43 - you write that down
01:44 - this is called a ledger it tracks all
01:47 - the purchases and transactions in a
01:49 - group but it doesn't make sense to have
01:51 - just one Ledger if you have just one
01:53 - Ledger you're back to a centralized
01:55 - system if one person destroys The Ledger
01:57 - or makes a fake Ledger the system breaks
01:59 - down instead each of you has your own
02:02 - copy of The Ledger to keep track of the
02:04 - transactions this is like being your own
02:06 - bank because everyone has a copy of a
02:08 - ledger anytime a transaction happens it
02:11 - needs to be sent to the entire network
02:13 - so everyone can update their own copy
02:15 - but wait what's to stop someone from
02:18 - sending a fake transaction showing
02:20 - someone paying the money the solution is
02:22 - to use something called a digital
02:24 - signature anyone sending a transaction
02:26 - must include a cryptographic signature
02:29 - that nobody else can create only them
02:32 - this proves the transaction came from
02:35 - them you can also include a timestamp
02:36 - and this way you know which transactions
02:39 - are authentic and in what order they
02:41 - happen but what if different people have
02:43 - disagreements about The Ledger without
02:44 - anybody in charge how would we know
02:46 - whose copy is correct the answer
02:48 - involves a mechanism called consensus
02:51 - which requires enough people to agree on
02:53 - which transactions are valid how does
02:55 - this work the group verifies the
02:57 - transactions in batches called blocks
02:59 - when everybody agrees on a block they
03:01 - add it to their own copy of The Ledger
03:03 - each block includes a digital summary or
03:06 - hash of all the transactions in that
03:07 - block plus all previous transactions
03:09 - this digital summary connects the blocks
03:12 - together in a chain which is why this
03:14 - way of storing information is called a
03:16 - Block Chain
03:20 - now how do these folks agree on a block
03:23 - it's an attacker publishing fake
03:25 - fake how do we tell the good ones from
03:27 - the bad ones to add a block to the chain
03:29 - we need to find a special value called a
03:32 - proof of work that requires a lot of
03:34 - computing power to find think of it like
03:37 - searching for and finding a missing
03:39 - puzzle piece that completes the Block in
03:42 - a way everyone can verify it takes a lot
03:44 - of computing power to produce each proof
03:47 - of work so it would take an astronomical
03:49 - amount of work for one person to try and
03:51 - find the proof of work for many blocks
03:53 - let alone all of them as an attacker if
03:56 - you wanted to try to add a fake block to
03:58 - the chain you could get lucky and get
04:00 - that special piece of information for
04:01 - one block but if you did you couldn't do
04:04 - it reliably for the next block and the
04:06 - next block eventually you get caught
04:08 - because of this over time only authentic
04:12 - transactions remain in the blockchain
04:14 - the system we described with six people
04:16 - could also work for six thousand or six
04:18 - million
04:19 - but does everyone need to do all of
04:21 - these very expensive proofs of work
04:24 - well if enough people are doing this
04:25 - Computing work the rest of us can
04:27 - participate more easily because we trust
04:29 - the network as a whole
04:31 - but wait why are all these people even
04:33 - doing all this work this is the really
04:35 - cool part blockchain technology
04:37 - typically has a built-in reward when you
04:39 - find the special piece of information to
04:41 - complete a block of transactions you get
04:43 - to include one more transaction to give
04:46 - some money to yourself as payment for
04:48 - the work you did to help protect the
04:50 - blockchain
04:51 - that's why the people doing this work
04:52 - are called miners it's very much like
04:54 - mining for gold you do work and you get
04:57 - paid when there are only a few miners it
04:59 - is easier to collect this money and that
05:02 - creates an incentive for more and more
05:03 - miners to join in enough to make the
05:06 - system secure for the rest of us
05:08 - so that's it the system we described
05:10 - enables a decentralized currency
05:13 - to summarize
05:14 - one the currency works on a shared
05:17 - letter of transactions two to keep a
05:20 - shared Ledger the information is stored
05:21 - in blocks three the blocks are verified
05:24 - using proof of work four each time a
05:27 - block is verified it's added to the
05:29 - blockchain five The Miner who verified
05:32 - it gets a reward and six those rewards
05:35 - keep enough miners involved to make the
05:37 - system safe
05:39 - this method of storing information on a
05:41 - blockchain creates a system of trust
05:43 - without a central Authority this is full
05:46 - Beyond just making a cryptocurrency like
05:47 - Bitcoin it has potential applications in
05:50 - many other domains as we'll learn in the
05:52 - next video
