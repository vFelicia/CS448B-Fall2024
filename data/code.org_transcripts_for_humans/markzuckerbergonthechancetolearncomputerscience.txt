00:02 - sixth grade it just unlocks all these
00:04 - different possibilities we live in this
00:06 - time now where by solving relatively
00:08 - basic problems you can improve millions
00:10 - of people's lives and it's really
00:11 - inspiring so I like going for walks
00:13 - around I it's it's California right so
00:15 - it's that's beautiful and there were
00:16 - these few kids who they they'd ride
00:19 - their bikes and and every day when i'
00:20 - when I'd walk by this one um this one
00:23 - guy he'd ask me just like yell questions
00:25 - like hey um Mr Zuckerberg like Mr
00:28 - Zuckerberg what um
00:31 - I want I want to learn how to program
00:32 - what should what should I do a few days
00:34 - later I'd come back and like all right I
00:36 - got the developer kit and my mom says I
00:38 - I I I can get it um so now what's the
00:40 - what's the first thing that I should get
00:41 - started doing so I'm like all right well
00:43 - first try to learn this and then like
00:45 - this would just go on for weeks and I I
00:46 - can't say I didn't teach him how to
00:48 - program but um but it was really
00:49 - gratifying to know that um in some small
00:52 - way maybe I could help out um teaching
00:55 - the next generation of folks who are
00:57 - going to become engineers when I think
00:59 - about what we're going be teaching in
01:00 - schools 5 10 15 years from now I I
01:03 - definitely think that computer science
01:05 - or at least basic programming is going
01:07 - to be as important of a skill as um
01:10 - being able to do basic reading and
01:12 - writing um and I think we're going to
01:15 - look back and and wonder why it took us
01:17 - so long to get to that point
