00:00 - as you can see i've already added the
00:02 - blocks in the workspace to get the b to
00:04 - move forward move forward turn right and
00:07 - move forward to the first cloud
00:09 - now we need to figure out how to see if
00:11 - there's a flower underneath the cloud
00:13 - and if there is get nectar that's what
00:16 - we're going to use this if block for
00:19 - you can see that this says if at flower
00:22 - do
00:23 - whatever is inside
00:25 - so what do we need to put inside
00:27 - that's right get nectar if you're at a
00:30 - flower you'll get nectar
00:33 - if you're not at a flower you won't run
00:36 - what's inside of this block
00:38 - next we need to move forward and do it
00:41 - again
00:42 - if there's a flower underneath that
00:44 - cloud
00:45 - get nectar
00:47 - as you can see my code is a little bit
00:49 - too long
00:51 - so i'll leave it up to you to figure out
00:53 - how to make it shorter
00:54 - happy coding
