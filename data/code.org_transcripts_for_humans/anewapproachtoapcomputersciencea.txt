00:06 - code.org does best
00:08 - equity
00:10 - inclusion
00:11 - and given students and teachers awesome
00:13 - resources to learn computer science
00:15 - having a curriculum that says you belong
00:19 - from day one
00:20 - it's really impactful you don't have to
00:24 - have ever written a single line of java
00:26 - code ever in your life to be able to
00:27 - pick this up and teach it instead of
00:29 - building up all these extra resources
00:31 - code.org has those for you and you can
00:33 - focus on preparing for the class and
00:35 - what your unique students need in your
00:37 - class there's a lot of student choice
00:39 - they can really hone in on who they are
00:42 - and represent it in their projects the
00:44 - most exciting project was definitely the
00:46 - asphalt art project at the very
00:48 - beginning just sparks creativity it
00:51 - really starts to allow students to think
00:54 - of coding in a different light it's very
00:57 - obvious looking at this curriculum that
00:58 - it was designed with culturally
01:00 - responsive teaching in mind it's not
01:02 - just about teaching students java it's
01:04 - also about helping students to see
01:06 - themselves as a computer scientist or as
01:09 - a software engineer and students start
01:11 - to realize that this type of skill that
01:13 - they're doing in their lessons and in
01:16 - their work and then their projects could
01:18 - be transferable to any subject or
01:20 - discipline that they are interested in
01:22 - when we did code reviews i set them up
01:24 - like a board room i had never taught it
01:26 - in csa before to look at other people's
01:28 - code now not only do they look at each
01:30 - other's code they have to comment on
01:32 - each other's code the students after
01:33 - going through the program can see
01:35 - similarities with industry
01:37 - after taking the exam my kids felt very
01:40 - confident my students are engaged they
01:42 - are learning they're making meaning i
01:44 - think it's going to change the face of
01:47 - apcsa
01:49 - [Music]
01:49 - [Applause]
