00:00 - Now we're going to learn about something all
game programmers use everyday. They're called
00:06 - events. An event tells your program to listen
for when something happens and then when it
00:12 - does, the game performs an action. Some examples
of events are listening for a mouse click
00:17 - or an up or down arrow key or even a tap on
the screen. Here, we're going to make the
00:23 - actor say something when the player clicks
on it. We will use the when clicked block
00:28 - and attach the say block to it. When the player
clicks, all the blocks attached to this block
00:34 - will be performed. There are also when arrow
blocks. If you link move blocks to those,
00:40 - you can start to move your actors up, down,
left, right, with the arrow keys. Little by
00:45 - little your game is getting more interactive.
