00:04 - hello welcome to the second of our my
00:07 - journey class chats for this spring my
00:09 - name is darren webb i am a software
00:11 - engineer at code.org i'm joining you
00:13 - from my home in des moines iowa and i
00:15 - want to say thank you to all the
00:16 - classrooms joining us today
00:18 - uh teachers i'm happy to share that this
00:20 - session as well as all of our future
00:21 - sessions are going to be live closed
00:23 - captions so i want to give a huge shout
00:25 - out to patty who's providing our
00:26 - captions for today's
00:28 - chat
00:29 - i am excited to welcome one of my own
00:32 - colleagues uh here from code.org tess
00:34 - o'brien tess is a product manager and
00:37 - she helps to create some of the cool
00:39 - tools that many of you use on code.org
00:41 - we'll talk to her about how she creates
00:43 - those tools her journey to code.org and
00:46 - any advice that she might have for those
00:48 - of you out there who enjoy using
00:49 - code.org and are already starting to
00:51 - think about what you might want to do
00:53 - when you're older uh teachers please put
00:55 - any questions you've got in the chat uh
00:58 - and we will do our best to get to some
00:59 - of those by the end of the talk
01:02 - first question though i've got for tess
01:04 - uh
01:05 - tess if you could tell us just a quick
01:07 - little bit of intro about yourself and
01:09 - your position and then answer to this
01:10 - incredibly important question
01:12 - as i found out that today is national
01:14 - pizza day
01:15 - uh which is really exciting for me uh
01:17 - there are so many kinds of pizza out
01:19 - there you've got thin crust you've got
01:20 - new york style you've got deep dish
01:22 - chicago style you've got the school
01:24 - cafeteria sheet pan pizzas so uh my
01:26 - question for you uh is what is your
01:29 - favorite type of pizza
01:32 - okay
01:33 - one thank you for letting me know that
01:35 - it is national pizza day it has very
01:37 - much changed what i will be eating for
01:39 - dinner tonight
01:40 - uh i'm tess i'm a product manager
01:42 - working on teacher tools
01:44 - at code.org so the tools that help our
01:46 - teachers learn how to teach computer
01:48 - science
01:50 - and
01:50 - getting to the important
01:52 - stuff i
01:55 - spent
01:56 - a few years living in brooklyn so i
01:58 - think brooklyn style pizza is my
02:02 - absolute favorite i have
02:04 - traveled far and wide in seattle trying
02:06 - to find the best brooklyn style pizza
02:09 - it's like between thin and thick crust
02:12 - has some very salty cheeses on it it can
02:14 - stand up to like a sweeter topping
02:17 - controversial pineapple plug here
02:20 - um
02:21 - so
02:22 - big fan of the brooklyn style pizza what
02:24 - is yours
02:25 - oh i was just gonna say thank you for
02:27 - sharing that i'm worried that this is a
02:28 - very controversial topic
02:30 - and then you threw pineapple in there so
02:31 - i don't want to start any fights
02:33 - out there uh i love all pizzas all
02:35 - pizzas are delicious but there's
02:37 - something about uh
02:38 - a nice uh hand toss lots of cheese uh
02:43 - here in here in des moines the best
02:44 - pizza comes from a gas station that's a
02:46 - whole separate topic so
02:48 - we'll go into that later i want to talk
02:50 - about what uh what you do at code.org so
02:52 - what exactly is a product manager could
02:55 - you tell us a little bit about what that
02:57 - means yeah definitely i have some slides
02:59 - to share because it is a bit of a new
03:01 - field
03:09 - yes
03:10 - great uh so a product manager
03:13 - uh
03:14 - across the field can mean a whole lot of
03:16 - different things company to company
03:17 - person to person teamed a team
03:19 - but here at code.org a product manager's
03:22 - job is to understand our users
03:25 - so lots of folks in this room right now
03:27 - help decide what we should build
03:30 - help implement the build itself um so
03:32 - tracking and making sure
03:34 - things are on time making smart
03:36 - trade-offs uh and then tracking the
03:38 - success whatever it is we build and
03:40 - figuring out how to refine it and make
03:41 - it a little bit better
03:43 - uh to dive in i feel like that just
03:46 - sounds like a lot of words to say what a
03:49 - product manager does
03:51 - so you're telling me that we just don't
03:52 - build whatever we think is like the
03:53 - coolest most fun thing
03:55 - sometimes we do but mostly
03:59 - um
04:00 - so
04:01 - i wanted to walk through an example of
04:04 - a
04:05 - problem that a product manager might
04:06 - face at code.org if that works for you
04:09 - yeah
04:10 - cool all right so
04:12 - say we at code.org are thinking about
04:14 - building dark mode
04:16 - uh dark mode is when the back of your
04:19 - computer screen has a dark color and
04:21 - then all of the things on top of it are
04:23 - brighter so as opposed to like writing
04:25 - in a word document where it's a white
04:27 - background
04:28 - traditionally and then black text over
04:31 - it you'd see a black background and more
04:33 - colorful text over it
04:36 - uh so say we
04:38 - have heard from teachers and students
04:40 - that they like dark mode they're
04:41 - interested in it
04:44 - a product manager would be tasked with
04:45 - figuring out is this something that
04:47 - really makes sense for code.org to build
04:50 - and the way they do that is through
04:52 - talking to users and talking and
04:55 - thinking about the market itself
04:58 - so firstly we go out and
05:00 - try to understand
05:02 - do our users want this do the students
05:04 - using our labs want dark mode
05:08 - that could look like coming into some of
05:09 - the classrooms that are here today and
05:12 - having a chat with students about
05:15 - do you use dark mode on other features
05:17 - or on other products that you use or it
05:19 - could look like things
05:21 - like questions along the lines of
05:23 - what time of day do you do your coding
05:25 - homework is it at nighttime when your
05:27 - eyes are tired
05:28 - uh or is it in the classroom
05:30 - um and so some
05:33 - uh when we've had these conversations
05:34 - before some of the things we hear
05:36 - are things like i work on my coding
05:38 - projects after i finish my other
05:40 - homework i like to be creative and
05:42 - keep working on it into the evening
05:44 - sometimes my eyes get tired before bed
05:47 - uh or something like when i use dark
05:50 - mode i feel like i'm really coding i
05:51 - feel like i'm a professional coder
05:53 - um it's like what it looks like on tv
05:55 - when someone's hacking something it's
05:56 - always this black background
05:59 - so
06:00 - we get a sense from our users it's
06:02 - something they're interested in it's
06:03 - something that
06:05 - sort of help would help them
06:07 - take a feeling away from using our
06:08 - product
06:09 - that is different than what they have
06:11 - right now
06:12 - um
06:12 - then we would dig in a little bit to
06:14 - market research and so that
06:16 - is looking around the industry looking
06:19 - around at how people use computers not
06:22 - necessarily not necessarily our product
06:25 - um but look around and see do other
06:28 - people use
06:29 - do people use dark mode elsewhere
06:32 - so just from a quick google search in
06:34 - this example i found that 91.8
06:38 - of android users use dark mode at some
06:40 - point on their phone
06:42 - so that sounds like a pretty good piece
06:43 - of signal that people are interested in
06:45 - dark mode right now
06:47 - um
06:48 - another way of saying all of that that
06:50 - when i became a product manager really
06:52 - resonated with me
06:55 - is this graphic here so you have your
06:57 - customer
06:58 - you have our service which is the
07:00 - code.org labs and then you have
07:03 - what the customer can do with your
07:04 - service
07:06 - and so what would dark mode
07:08 - what superpower would dark mode unlock
07:10 - for our users and
07:12 - will dark mode really help them feel and
07:15 - be able to
07:17 - build things in a different way
07:20 - and so i think from talking to our users
07:22 - in this example we have learned that
07:24 - there is this
07:26 - deeper meaning to why someone might want
07:29 - dark mode
07:31 - so at this point if we have confirmed we
07:34 - do want to be building
07:35 - dark mode
07:37 - a product manager would go start working
07:39 - with the experts in the field so they
07:41 - would work with design to design exactly
07:43 - what
07:44 - our dark mode looks like for code.org
07:47 - and they go and work with their
07:48 - engineering team
07:50 - to learn about how long it's going to
07:51 - take what are some of the technical
07:53 - complications we expect
07:56 - and plan out the project itself they
07:58 - would sit with the team throughout the
08:00 - project and help make smart trade-offs
08:02 - when things come in
08:04 - things come up or problems arise
08:07 - and then finally they would track the
08:10 - dark mode so they would be able to see
08:11 - how many folks are using it
08:13 - how they're using it and
08:16 - engage with how well this feature did
08:18 - once it's out there in the world
08:23 - awesome
08:24 - so you've had uh a long career in
08:26 - computer science i'm curious what what
08:28 - computer science skills or what what
08:30 - skills have you had uh that you've
08:32 - developed throughout your your career
08:34 - that got you to this place uh where you
08:36 - could be a successful product manager
08:38 - yeah definitely uh so i guess if i'm
08:40 - going to talk about how i got to
08:43 - computer science
08:45 - share my screen again
08:50 - for me
08:53 - that really starts uh with my
08:55 - grandmother maria barela
08:57 - in cuba she was she studied math and was
09:00 - an early mathematician
09:02 - she came over to the united states and
09:04 - was in
09:06 - one of the early women working for ibm
09:08 - uh so she herself worked in the computer
09:11 - science field
09:12 - for me that did not translate to
09:15 - enjoying computer science
09:17 - right off of that um when i was in the
09:20 - middle in high school
09:22 - math really intimidated me and i thought
09:25 - because i wasn't necessarily
09:27 - great at it from the jump
09:29 - uh
09:30 - that maybe it wasn't for me uh maybe i
09:33 - wasn't interested in it
09:35 - so i leaned on things i was interested
09:37 - in i studied
09:40 - i went to college studied political
09:41 - science
09:42 - came out of college and started working
09:45 - with non-profits with that degree
09:47 - around that time
09:50 - in that industry there was a lot of
09:52 - unpaid internships a lot of part-time
09:54 - jobs
09:55 - uh so i worked
09:57 - part-time in nonprofits and part-time in
10:00 - the service industry
10:02 - i got to work on a grilled cheese food
10:04 - truck for many years
10:07 - which was a great gig
10:09 - um learned a lot during that time around
10:11 - communication
10:13 - uh being
10:14 - scrappy and savvy with
10:16 - what resources you have and how to
10:19 - make those work for you both
10:20 - professionally
10:22 - and personally um
10:24 - and then at some point while working
10:27 - with nonprofits i have the chance to
10:28 - help build
10:29 - an app for our users
10:31 - and
10:33 - i was so intimidated by that project
10:36 - i thought that i
10:37 - by not having done
10:39 - a lot of science or math when i was in
10:42 - school i had sort of avoided these types
10:44 - of projects
10:46 - but i was tasked with doing the project
10:49 - work
10:50 - to make sure that this was delivered on
10:52 - time and so i
10:54 - dove right in and something that i was
10:56 - so struck by was
10:58 - the amount of impact the engineers i was
11:01 - working with were able to make for
11:04 - the folks we were working with at this
11:06 - nonprofit
11:07 - and how the app was able to make
11:09 - tangible changes in folks lives and
11:12 - really amplify our mission
11:15 - uh during this time i
11:17 - also started giving some thought to why
11:19 - did i think i wasn't good at computer
11:21 - science um
11:22 - or why did i think computer science
11:24 - wasn't for me why did i
11:26 - frankly just leave math classes and
11:29 - computer classes as soon as i had the
11:31 - chance to
11:32 - uh and i learned about a program called
11:34 - general assembly
11:36 - which is essentially three months of 12
11:38 - hours a day just coding
11:41 - and so i
11:43 - i didn't like that there was something i
11:45 - felt like i couldn't do
11:47 - and so i
11:49 - quit my job took out a loan
11:52 - i went to learn software engineering
11:54 - when i was about 24. i will say that it
11:58 - immediately came quickly to me by any
12:00 - means um
12:02 - but because i had taken a gamble on
12:03 - myself at that point i
12:07 - promised myself to be the most
12:08 - interested person in the class and to
12:10 - try everything i could ask every
12:12 - question i could and
12:14 - focus on having a growth mindset of
12:16 - believing that i could
12:18 - learn
12:19 - these new skills that at one point in my
12:20 - life i thought weren't for me
12:22 - um i left that program started work as
12:25 - an engineer and then learned about
12:27 - product management as a field which sort
12:29 - of combined
12:31 - some of these
12:32 - problem-solving
12:34 - communication skills that i in my early
12:36 - career i had done a lot of work with
12:38 - with this cool meaty software
12:40 - engineering
12:41 - and design work that i had gotten the
12:42 - chance to learn about
12:44 - in my early 20s i so i worked for a
12:46 - product manager for a few years with a
12:48 - bunch of nonprofits and then came in
12:50 - house to put that org
12:52 - and have been here for two years
12:56 - that's an awesome story the
12:58 - the the way that you kind of started
13:01 - you were exposed to some computer
13:03 - science you were exposed to that
13:04 - mathematics early on but
13:06 - it didn't really didn't really click and
13:08 - computer science is so big and there's
13:10 - so many things involved that sometimes
13:12 - coming at it from a different angle and
13:14 - and being willing to do those
13:16 - challenging things if we all just do
13:17 - what's easy we're never gonna get
13:19 - anything good done you gotta you gotta
13:21 - dive into those things that are
13:22 - definitely uh
13:24 - those challenges that you face and so
13:26 - that's an awesome story
13:27 - um if anybody out there has any any
13:30 - questions for your tests or about
13:31 - code.org or about her story uh feel free
13:34 - to throw those into chat uh i want to
13:36 - ask a little bit about
13:38 - what you do outside of work so when
13:39 - you're not working uh with code.org um
13:43 - what kind of stuff do you find yourself
13:44 - doing out there
13:46 - yeah
13:47 - so i live
13:48 - in the pacific northwest i grew up on
13:50 - the east coast and moved up here about
13:53 - seven years ago
13:54 - uh because i wanted to hike and get to
13:57 - explore the outdoors
14:00 - i
14:00 - i'm gonna use this as a moment to show
14:03 - y'all a picture of my dog
14:06 - please do
14:09 - think
14:11 - all right
14:13 - this is my dog love below
14:15 - she and i spend a lot of time exploring
14:18 - the pacific northwest uh so getting to
14:21 - hike
14:22 - adventure we work
14:24 - at coach.org right now pretty much fully
14:26 - remotely and so we've had a chance to
14:29 - get to see lots of beaches lots of
14:30 - mountains this year
14:32 - really good to explore
14:36 - it's always good to have a nice
14:37 - adventuring buddy
14:41 - do you have one
14:42 - i do we've got a border collie his name
14:44 - is zion and we're getting him we're
14:46 - working on him to carry his own little
14:48 - pack so he can carry his own like water
14:49 - and food and we can carry ours and he
14:51 - can carry his
14:54 - we bought low a pack but she isn't
14:56 - really big enough to convincingly carry
14:58 - much of her own stuff but i think she
15:01 - like likes the
15:02 - sassy walk of i have a backpack on
15:06 - they like having a job to do and a task
15:08 - to
15:11 - and then run it off into the water
15:12 - that's great
15:16 - um are there any uh
15:18 - you're talking about uh dark mode um are
15:21 - there any exciting projects at code.org
15:23 - that you've had a chance to work on as a
15:25 - product manager
15:27 - yes
15:28 - uh so my
15:31 - this this might be a horror story more
15:33 - than just a strictly exciting
15:36 - project um but i
15:39 - when i got started with
15:42 - code.org about
15:43 - a month and a half into working with the
15:46 - company i
15:48 - was
15:50 - asked to do the like project management
15:53 - part of our hour of code that year
15:57 - and we weren't releasing a new tutorial
15:59 - so there wasn't dance party coming out
16:01 - or poem block coming out that year so i
16:04 - was like i got this this this will be
16:06 - simple enough
16:08 - it was not
16:11 - is
16:12 - a really cool project where the whole
16:14 - organization works towards this one goal
16:18 - and
16:19 - we get a ton of traffic to the site a
16:22 - ton of kids using the product a bunch of
16:24 - teachers using it and especially during
16:26 - a pandemic there was just a huge amount
16:28 - of
16:30 - traffic to the site
16:32 - what i really learned in that time
16:35 - was to
16:36 - sometimes one of the best things you can
16:37 - do as a product manager is to remove
16:40 - obstacles to allow your co-workers who
16:42 - are experts in the field
16:44 - to
16:44 - really shine and do their thing so i got
16:47 - to work with marketing design
16:49 - engineering and video to make sure that
16:52 - everything
16:53 - on our site was
16:54 - up and running
16:56 - and was just sort of shoving things out
16:58 - of the way to help
16:59 - my colleagues be able to really shine
17:04 - that's something that i've enjoyed about
17:06 - um working with product managers um as
17:08 - an engineer is uh not everybody there's
17:10 - no one person who knows how everything
17:12 - works and sometimes you run into an
17:14 - issue where there's there's a problem in
17:16 - some area you might not have that
17:18 - expertise and it's usually a product
17:20 - manager who knows
17:21 - who has the answer to that how can i put
17:23 - all the right people in a room and then
17:25 - take a step back and and see that
17:27 - problem get solved
17:28 - yeah when things
17:30 - when there are problems and problems
17:31 - need to get solved sometimes it's just
17:32 - getting getting the right people in the
17:35 - right place and
17:37 - being able you being able to see that
17:38 - big picture uh really helps everybody
17:40 - else be productive so that's a an
17:42 - awesome position that you've got there
17:44 - if you were to
17:47 - go back in time
17:48 - to
17:49 - middle school tests
17:51 - or high school tests and
17:53 - give her a piece of advice uh
17:56 - knowing what you know now um
17:58 - what what advice would you give
18:01 - that's a great question
18:02 - um
18:06 - i think
18:07 - it comes down to
18:09 - believing
18:11 - that i could learn things and believing
18:14 - that it's worth learning things
18:16 - especially the harder things
18:18 - and so to approach
18:22 - in this example math but sort of
18:24 - everything as
18:26 - a chance to learn a chance to ask
18:28 - questions not necessarily feeling like i
18:30 - need to
18:31 - be the best in the room and if i'm not
18:34 - the best in a room find the room where i
18:35 - am the best
18:36 - but more so
18:38 - learn about a lot of learn a lot about
18:42 - learn a medium about about a lot of
18:44 - things
18:45 - um
18:46 - and
18:47 - take that approach of just being a
18:49 - learner being interested
18:53 - into every
18:54 - situation you're in
18:58 - so there's folks out there who are
18:59 - interested in maybe pursuing a career as
19:02 - a product manager uh or in computer
19:05 - science um
19:06 - how would they go about that will be
19:08 - some some good things to take a look at
19:10 - or the next steps
19:11 - yeah uh
19:13 - sort of in the same vein of learning
19:16 - learning a bit about a lot of things
19:18 - uh staying computer science classes i
19:20 - had to
19:22 - uh go back when i was 24
19:25 - to start learning some of those
19:26 - foundational skills um
19:28 - but a really great way to get into this
19:31 - field is
19:32 - to
19:33 - understand the fundamentals of computer
19:35 - science
19:36 - if you have that you will be ahead of a
19:38 - lot of folks
19:39 - then also understand the fundamentals of
19:41 - a lot of other things so focus on
19:44 - clear communication uh
19:47 - general design principles
19:49 - and pay attention to the products that
19:51 - you're using i think that's
19:54 - something i love about being a product
19:55 - manager is interviewing for the work is
19:57 - fun
19:58 - uh you get to sort of think about things
20:00 - like dark mode and go into these deep
20:03 - examples sort of hypothetically
20:05 - and so when you are
20:06 - out like out there on your phone or out
20:08 - there on your device
20:10 - think about the products that you
20:12 - interact with day to day uh like
20:15 - think about a cool lamp you like and why
20:17 - you like it what it makes you like what
20:19 - about it makes you feel good what about
20:21 - it makes it fun
20:22 - and just sort of start to investigate
20:25 - why you love different products that you
20:27 - love
20:30 - that's very yeah
20:32 - i'm over on the more
20:34 - uh software engineering side but i think
20:36 - we both have kind of a web development
20:38 - background and that app development web
20:40 - development and
20:42 - i think the
20:43 - exploring a broad variety of topics uh
20:46 - focusing on building those computer
20:48 - science skills is valuable if somebody
20:50 - wants to be a software engineer
20:53 - uh but but always looking at the the big
20:56 - picture and the whole world because the
20:58 - code that we write it's it's for humans
20:59 - and it's for solving problems and so if
21:02 - you can really look out there at what
21:04 - what do you love about life what is
21:06 - frustrating about life uh and how can
21:09 - how can some technology help
21:11 - uh maybe solve that problem um
21:14 - what uh are there any um specific skills
21:17 - that you would recommend people try to
21:19 - look at as as developing a computer
21:22 - science career
21:23 - maybe from be broader than a product
21:25 - manager
21:27 - uh i feel like a great place to get
21:30 - started for someone like me
21:33 - uh who wasn't
21:34 - necessarily
21:38 - uh
21:39 - just interested in learning the
21:41 - languages to learn the languages um
21:45 - was the creativity aspect of it so as
21:47 - you were saying they're daring around
21:49 - like
21:51 - the idea that you can go from a blank
21:53 - page to having something
21:55 - on that blank page to making that thing
21:56 - move across the blank page
21:58 - um or to solve a problem or to
22:01 - create a quiz that helps your friend
22:03 - that
22:03 - you have fun with your friends with or
22:05 - your parents with
22:06 - uh
22:07 - really dive into the creative side of
22:10 - engineering um i found javascript to be
22:13 - really helpful for that and sort of all
22:15 - of the things that you can do with
22:17 - javascript
22:18 - uh beyond that i think
22:22 - the thing computer science taught me
22:24 - the most in my life is that
22:27 - every problem has a solution
22:29 - and i don't know why
22:32 - it
22:32 - may be that i was in my early 20s when i
22:34 - started coding that this really clicked
22:36 - for me
22:36 - maybe that's just something you learn at
22:38 - that age
22:39 - but for me the ability
22:41 - to have a problem on a sheet and to feel
22:43 - like it was unsolvable but know that
22:46 - there was a solution
22:47 - has really helped me in my life of
22:50 - approaching every situation as if there
22:52 - is a solution to it i just have to find
22:54 - it and rely on
22:57 - the folks around me to help me find it
23:00 - so i think that isn't a super technical
23:02 - answer that is maybe a product answer to
23:05 - a technical question but
23:07 - i think i think learning how to code
23:10 - learning how to code
23:12 - uh and realizing that yeah those
23:13 - problems have solutions and and you
23:15 - don't have to wait for those solutions
23:16 - you can go out and try to build those
23:18 - solutions yourself uh
23:20 - if there's a small tool that will help
23:22 - your club
23:23 - organize its event and you can write
23:25 - some code to make that happen then
23:26 - that's a
23:27 - you just created some value and and
23:29 - solved a problem out there
23:32 - early on in our conversation you
23:33 - mentioned
23:35 - that you uh
23:36 - had some mathematics and computer
23:38 - science
23:39 - folks in your family and had some
23:41 - encouragement from them that might not
23:42 - have stuck at the time
23:44 - but i'm curious are there any is there
23:45 - anyone else who helped you along the way
23:47 - um
23:49 - and guided you into your career
23:51 - definitely uh
23:53 - teachers
23:55 - were a huge help uh
23:57 - i feel like teachers helped me learn to
23:59 - ask the right questions going into
24:01 - college and coming out of college focus
24:03 - on the right things spend my time wisely
24:07 - and then once i've been in the field
24:10 - i've had some really great
24:12 - specifically women mentors who have
24:14 - helped me
24:15 - feel like
24:17 - continue
24:20 - uh it wasn't really like a light switch
24:22 - of i belong in the computer science
24:24 - field now there is certainly times that
24:26 - i feel
24:27 - like a bit of an imposter because i came
24:29 - from maybe a different background than
24:31 - some of my coworkers
24:33 - and i
24:34 - echo daughter specifically i've had
24:36 - great mentors and my current
24:39 - manager amanda and my previous manager
24:42 - marina
24:43 - both really helped me to see that
24:47 - my voice was important
24:49 - because it was a different voice and
24:50 - because it was a different perspective
24:53 - and that the skills that i brought to
24:54 - the field
24:56 - were important because they weren't
24:57 - necessarily the skills of somebody who
25:01 - day one knew they wanted to be a
25:02 - computer scientist
25:06 - i think it's great how the
25:08 - the college opportunities for studying
25:10 - computer science have broadened the lot
25:12 - in the in the recent years um but and
25:15 - having those more having the diverse
25:17 - voices in there to influence
25:19 - organizations and influence projects is
25:21 - great my dirty little secret is that i
25:23 - am actually a cinema major uh with a
25:25 - theater minor uh i do have a computer
25:28 - science minor because i pushed myself to
25:30 - finish up that section of it
25:32 - um but most of my work in in college was
25:35 - kind of using technology in these other
25:37 - areas so i think um
25:39 - there's a lot of different ways to get
25:40 - there and a lot of ways to
25:42 - to find what you love
25:45 - and to have that that broad
25:47 - diverse set of voices in the room is
25:48 - absolutely valuable
25:50 - if anybody else has any final questions
25:53 - we've got just a couple more minutes
25:54 - here um thank you uh
25:57 - terence stone for that question that i
26:00 - tried to kind of weave in there you
26:01 - asked about specific skills that high
26:03 - school students
26:04 - should develop but they want to be a
26:05 - computer science
26:08 - a student of computer science
26:18 - um
26:20 - before we
26:22 - close out here wanted to make sure i
26:23 - didn't miss any other questions i'm just
26:25 - hungry for pizza now honestly
26:27 - that's the that's the big thing i'm
26:29 - thinking about
26:30 - um
26:32 - uh eric sent me a message and he's
26:33 - curious about
26:34 - what kinds of companies
26:36 - do product managers work for um
26:40 - we've heard of like project managers and
26:42 - product managers a little bit different
26:43 - um
26:44 - what do you think about that what types
26:45 - of companies um
26:48 - where do you find a product manager in
26:50 - it's really cool because i think we're
26:52 - in this moment where
26:55 - uh
26:56 - project product program all of those
26:59 - words
27:00 - maybe are not agreed upon across the
27:02 - industry
27:03 - uh so i think
27:05 - and as i said before product management
27:07 - is a relatively new field uh like 15 20
27:10 - years of it being like a
27:12 - a real named job and it is growing
27:15 - quickly
27:16 - so i think traditionally my
27:18 - understanding is came from
27:21 - bigger tech companies so
27:23 - google microsoft all of those big
27:26 - companies will have
27:27 - product managers they're also a pretty
27:29 - early hire at startups that have a
27:31 - technology
27:33 - focus
27:34 - but something that i really loved in
27:36 - coming from nonprofits is
27:39 - code.org's
27:41 - commitment to being a non-profit
27:44 - and a technology company and so the idea
27:46 - that you can be within a non-profit and
27:48 - working in
27:50 - with product management is something
27:52 - really new and cool
27:53 - and i think the field is going to see a
27:55 - lot more
27:56 - of that
27:59 - yeah i think a ship from a project which
28:02 - usually has a start and end to a product
28:04 - which is
28:05 - this is this is the thing we've got this
28:07 - is the whether it be the code.org uh
28:10 - online applications and website
28:12 - or it's an app that somebody has
28:14 - thinking about that in the
28:15 - broad
28:16 - sense is a
28:18 - shift that seems to be happening in the
28:19 - industry and people who can think that
28:21 - way
28:22 - are super valuable um
28:24 - what's the hardest part about being a
28:25 - product manager
28:28 - it's ambiguous
28:30 - you don't always know your role in any
28:33 - room it is not totally clear
28:36 - but you can be a helper like as you said
28:38 - you get to
28:40 - remove roadblocks bring the right people
28:41 - in a room
28:43 - then sort of the best part about being a
28:44 - product manager is getting to watch
28:47 - those around you shine and to help
28:50 - that happen from
28:51 - start until forever
28:56 - awesome well thank you so much for
28:57 - chatting with me today uh i think it's a
28:59 - super important role um
29:02 - in an organization and with uh in
29:04 - computer science and in software um so
29:07 - thank you for chatting with us today
29:08 - thank you for uh joining us out there
29:11 - teachers and students
29:13 - uh reminder to tune in for our future
29:15 - class chats and then to also check the
29:17 - recordings of past class chats we had a
29:19 - bunch of them this fall uh we had one a
29:22 - little while ago this spring and this
29:23 - one will be recorded and posted online
29:25 - as well to if you want to watch it again
29:28 - uh
29:28 - and then um teachers please check your
29:30 - email for a survey that's going to be
29:32 - going out we really appreciate your
29:33 - feedback as we continue to have these
29:35 - class chats in the future and keep
29:37 - making them even better but that's all
29:40 - we've got for today thank you for
29:41 - joining us tess
29:42 - thank you so much this is the blast
29:46 - thanks
29:47 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to the second of our my journey class chats for this spring my name is darren webb i am a software engineer at code.org i'm joining you from my home in des moines iowa and i want to say thank you to all the classrooms joining us today uh teachers i'm happy to share that this session as well as all of our future sessions are going to be live closed captions so i want to give a huge shout out to patty who's providing our captions for today's chat i am excited to welcome one of my own colleagues uh here from code.org tess o'brien tess is a product manager and she helps to create some of the cool tools that many of you use on code.org we'll talk to her about how she creates those tools her journey to code.org and any advice that she might have for those of you out there who enjoy using code.org and are already starting to think about what you might want to do when you're older uh teachers please put any questions you've got in the chat uh and we will do our best to get to some of those by the end of the talk first question though i've got for tess uh tess if you could tell us just a quick little bit of intro about yourself and your position and then answer to this incredibly important question as i found out that today is national pizza day uh which is really exciting for me uh there are so many kinds of pizza out there you've got thin crust you've got new york style you've got deep dish chicago style you've got the school cafeteria sheet pan pizzas so uh my question for you uh is what is your favorite type of pizza okay one thank you for letting me know that it is national pizza day it has very much changed what i will be eating for dinner tonight uh i'm tess i'm a product manager working on teacher tools at code.org so the tools that help our teachers learn how to teach computer science and getting to the important stuff i spent a few years living in brooklyn so i think brooklyn style pizza is my absolute favorite i have traveled far and wide in seattle trying to find the best brooklyn style pizza it's like between thin and thick crust has some very salty cheeses on it it can stand up to like a sweeter topping controversial pineapple plug here um so big fan of the brooklyn style pizza what is yours oh i was just gonna say thank you for sharing that i'm worried that this is a very controversial topic and then you threw pineapple in there so i don't want to start any fights out there uh i love all pizzas all pizzas are delicious but there's something about uh a nice uh hand toss lots of cheese uh here in here in des moines the best pizza comes from a gas station that's a whole separate topic so we'll go into that later i want to talk about what uh what you do at code.org so what exactly is a product manager could you tell us a little bit about what that means yeah definitely i have some slides to share because it is a bit of a new field yes great uh so a product manager uh across the field can mean a whole lot of different things company to company person to person teamed a team but here at code.org a product manager's job is to understand our users so lots of folks in this room right now help decide what we should build help implement the build itself um so tracking and making sure things are on time making smart tradeoffs uh and then tracking the success whatever it is we build and figuring out how to refine it and make it a little bit better uh to dive in i feel like that just sounds like a lot of words to say what a product manager does so you're telling me that we just don't build whatever we think is like the coolest most fun thing sometimes we do but mostly um so i wanted to walk through an example of a problem that a product manager might face at code.org if that works for you yeah cool all right so say we at code.org are thinking about building dark mode uh dark mode is when the back of your computer screen has a dark color and then all of the things on top of it are brighter so as opposed to like writing in a word document where it's a white background traditionally and then black text over it you'd see a black background and more colorful text over it uh so say we have heard from teachers and students that they like dark mode they're interested in it a product manager would be tasked with figuring out is this something that really makes sense for code.org to build and the way they do that is through talking to users and talking and thinking about the market itself so firstly we go out and try to understand do our users want this do the students using our labs want dark mode that could look like coming into some of the classrooms that are here today and having a chat with students about do you use dark mode on other features or on other products that you use or it could look like things like questions along the lines of what time of day do you do your coding homework is it at nighttime when your eyes are tired uh or is it in the classroom um and so some uh when we've had these conversations before some of the things we hear are things like i work on my coding projects after i finish my other homework i like to be creative and keep working on it into the evening sometimes my eyes get tired before bed uh or something like when i use dark mode i feel like i'm really coding i feel like i'm a professional coder um it's like what it looks like on tv when someone's hacking something it's always this black background so we get a sense from our users it's something they're interested in it's something that sort of help would help them take a feeling away from using our product that is different than what they have right now um then we would dig in a little bit to market research and so that is looking around the industry looking around at how people use computers not necessarily not necessarily our product um but look around and see do other people use do people use dark mode elsewhere so just from a quick google search in this example i found that 91.8 of android users use dark mode at some point on their phone so that sounds like a pretty good piece of signal that people are interested in dark mode right now um another way of saying all of that that when i became a product manager really resonated with me is this graphic here so you have your customer you have our service which is the code.org labs and then you have what the customer can do with your service and so what would dark mode what superpower would dark mode unlock for our users and will dark mode really help them feel and be able to build things in a different way and so i think from talking to our users in this example we have learned that there is this deeper meaning to why someone might want dark mode so at this point if we have confirmed we do want to be building dark mode a product manager would go start working with the experts in the field so they would work with design to design exactly what our dark mode looks like for code.org and they go and work with their engineering team to learn about how long it's going to take what are some of the technical complications we expect and plan out the project itself they would sit with the team throughout the project and help make smart tradeoffs when things come in things come up or problems arise and then finally they would track the dark mode so they would be able to see how many folks are using it how they're using it and engage with how well this feature did once it's out there in the world awesome so you've had uh a long career in computer science i'm curious what what computer science skills or what what skills have you had uh that you've developed throughout your your career that got you to this place uh where you could be a successful product manager yeah definitely uh so i guess if i'm going to talk about how i got to computer science share my screen again for me that really starts uh with my grandmother maria barela in cuba she was she studied math and was an early mathematician she came over to the united states and was in one of the early women working for ibm uh so she herself worked in the computer science field for me that did not translate to enjoying computer science right off of that um when i was in the middle in high school math really intimidated me and i thought because i wasn't necessarily great at it from the jump uh that maybe it wasn't for me uh maybe i wasn't interested in it so i leaned on things i was interested in i studied i went to college studied political science came out of college and started working with nonprofits with that degree around that time in that industry there was a lot of unpaid internships a lot of parttime jobs uh so i worked parttime in nonprofits and parttime in the service industry i got to work on a grilled cheese food truck for many years which was a great gig um learned a lot during that time around communication uh being scrappy and savvy with what resources you have and how to make those work for you both professionally and personally um and then at some point while working with nonprofits i have the chance to help build an app for our users and i was so intimidated by that project i thought that i by not having done a lot of science or math when i was in school i had sort of avoided these types of projects but i was tasked with doing the project work to make sure that this was delivered on time and so i dove right in and something that i was so struck by was the amount of impact the engineers i was working with were able to make for the folks we were working with at this nonprofit and how the app was able to make tangible changes in folks lives and really amplify our mission uh during this time i also started giving some thought to why did i think i wasn't good at computer science um or why did i think computer science wasn't for me why did i frankly just leave math classes and computer classes as soon as i had the chance to uh and i learned about a program called general assembly which is essentially three months of 12 hours a day just coding and so i i didn't like that there was something i felt like i couldn't do and so i quit my job took out a loan i went to learn software engineering when i was about 24. i will say that it immediately came quickly to me by any means um but because i had taken a gamble on myself at that point i promised myself to be the most interested person in the class and to try everything i could ask every question i could and focus on having a growth mindset of believing that i could learn these new skills that at one point in my life i thought weren't for me um i left that program started work as an engineer and then learned about product management as a field which sort of combined some of these problemsolving communication skills that i in my early career i had done a lot of work with with this cool meaty software engineering and design work that i had gotten the chance to learn about in my early 20s i so i worked for a product manager for a few years with a bunch of nonprofits and then came in house to put that org and have been here for two years that's an awesome story the the the way that you kind of started you were exposed to some computer science you were exposed to that mathematics early on but it didn't really didn't really click and computer science is so big and there's so many things involved that sometimes coming at it from a different angle and and being willing to do those challenging things if we all just do what's easy we're never gonna get anything good done you gotta you gotta dive into those things that are definitely uh those challenges that you face and so that's an awesome story um if anybody out there has any any questions for your tests or about code.org or about her story uh feel free to throw those into chat uh i want to ask a little bit about what you do outside of work so when you're not working uh with code.org um what kind of stuff do you find yourself doing out there yeah so i live in the pacific northwest i grew up on the east coast and moved up here about seven years ago uh because i wanted to hike and get to explore the outdoors i i'm gonna use this as a moment to show y'all a picture of my dog please do think all right this is my dog love below she and i spend a lot of time exploring the pacific northwest uh so getting to hike adventure we work at coach.org right now pretty much fully remotely and so we've had a chance to get to see lots of beaches lots of mountains this year really good to explore it's always good to have a nice adventuring buddy do you have one i do we've got a border collie his name is zion and we're getting him we're working on him to carry his own little pack so he can carry his own like water and food and we can carry ours and he can carry his we bought low a pack but she isn't really big enough to convincingly carry much of her own stuff but i think she like likes the sassy walk of i have a backpack on they like having a job to do and a task to and then run it off into the water that's great um are there any uh you're talking about uh dark mode um are there any exciting projects at code.org that you've had a chance to work on as a product manager yes uh so my this this might be a horror story more than just a strictly exciting project um but i when i got started with code.org about a month and a half into working with the company i was asked to do the like project management part of our hour of code that year and we weren't releasing a new tutorial so there wasn't dance party coming out or poem block coming out that year so i was like i got this this this will be simple enough it was not is a really cool project where the whole organization works towards this one goal and we get a ton of traffic to the site a ton of kids using the product a bunch of teachers using it and especially during a pandemic there was just a huge amount of traffic to the site what i really learned in that time was to sometimes one of the best things you can do as a product manager is to remove obstacles to allow your coworkers who are experts in the field to really shine and do their thing so i got to work with marketing design engineering and video to make sure that everything on our site was up and running and was just sort of shoving things out of the way to help my colleagues be able to really shine that's something that i've enjoyed about um working with product managers um as an engineer is uh not everybody there's no one person who knows how everything works and sometimes you run into an issue where there's there's a problem in some area you might not have that expertise and it's usually a product manager who knows who has the answer to that how can i put all the right people in a room and then take a step back and and see that problem get solved yeah when things when there are problems and problems need to get solved sometimes it's just getting getting the right people in the right place and being able you being able to see that big picture uh really helps everybody else be productive so that's a an awesome position that you've got there if you were to go back in time to middle school tests or high school tests and give her a piece of advice uh knowing what you know now um what what advice would you give that's a great question um i think it comes down to believing that i could learn things and believing that it's worth learning things especially the harder things and so to approach in this example math but sort of everything as a chance to learn a chance to ask questions not necessarily feeling like i need to be the best in the room and if i'm not the best in a room find the room where i am the best but more so learn about a lot of learn a lot about learn a medium about about a lot of things um and take that approach of just being a learner being interested into every situation you're in so there's folks out there who are interested in maybe pursuing a career as a product manager uh or in computer science um how would they go about that will be some some good things to take a look at or the next steps yeah uh sort of in the same vein of learning learning a bit about a lot of things uh staying computer science classes i had to uh go back when i was 24 to start learning some of those foundational skills um but a really great way to get into this field is to understand the fundamentals of computer science if you have that you will be ahead of a lot of folks then also understand the fundamentals of a lot of other things so focus on clear communication uh general design principles and pay attention to the products that you're using i think that's something i love about being a product manager is interviewing for the work is fun uh you get to sort of think about things like dark mode and go into these deep examples sort of hypothetically and so when you are out like out there on your phone or out there on your device think about the products that you interact with day to day uh like think about a cool lamp you like and why you like it what it makes you like what about it makes you feel good what about it makes it fun and just sort of start to investigate why you love different products that you love that's very yeah i'm over on the more uh software engineering side but i think we both have kind of a web development background and that app development web development and i think the exploring a broad variety of topics uh focusing on building those computer science skills is valuable if somebody wants to be a software engineer uh but but always looking at the the big picture and the whole world because the code that we write it's it's for humans and it's for solving problems and so if you can really look out there at what what do you love about life what is frustrating about life uh and how can how can some technology help uh maybe solve that problem um what uh are there any um specific skills that you would recommend people try to look at as as developing a computer science career maybe from be broader than a product manager uh i feel like a great place to get started for someone like me uh who wasn't necessarily uh just interested in learning the languages to learn the languages um was the creativity aspect of it so as you were saying they're daring around like the idea that you can go from a blank page to having something on that blank page to making that thing move across the blank page um or to solve a problem or to create a quiz that helps your friend that you have fun with your friends with or your parents with uh really dive into the creative side of engineering um i found javascript to be really helpful for that and sort of all of the things that you can do with javascript uh beyond that i think the thing computer science taught me the most in my life is that every problem has a solution and i don't know why it may be that i was in my early 20s when i started coding that this really clicked for me maybe that's just something you learn at that age but for me the ability to have a problem on a sheet and to feel like it was unsolvable but know that there was a solution has really helped me in my life of approaching every situation as if there is a solution to it i just have to find it and rely on the folks around me to help me find it so i think that isn't a super technical answer that is maybe a product answer to a technical question but i think i think learning how to code learning how to code uh and realizing that yeah those problems have solutions and and you don't have to wait for those solutions you can go out and try to build those solutions yourself uh if there's a small tool that will help your club organize its event and you can write some code to make that happen then that's a you just created some value and and solved a problem out there early on in our conversation you mentioned that you uh had some mathematics and computer science folks in your family and had some encouragement from them that might not have stuck at the time but i'm curious are there any is there anyone else who helped you along the way um and guided you into your career definitely uh teachers were a huge help uh i feel like teachers helped me learn to ask the right questions going into college and coming out of college focus on the right things spend my time wisely and then once i've been in the field i've had some really great specifically women mentors who have helped me feel like continue uh it wasn't really like a light switch of i belong in the computer science field now there is certainly times that i feel like a bit of an imposter because i came from maybe a different background than some of my coworkers and i echo daughter specifically i've had great mentors and my current manager amanda and my previous manager marina both really helped me to see that my voice was important because it was a different voice and because it was a different perspective and that the skills that i brought to the field were important because they weren't necessarily the skills of somebody who day one knew they wanted to be a computer scientist i think it's great how the the college opportunities for studying computer science have broadened the lot in the in the recent years um but and having those more having the diverse voices in there to influence organizations and influence projects is great my dirty little secret is that i am actually a cinema major uh with a theater minor uh i do have a computer science minor because i pushed myself to finish up that section of it um but most of my work in in college was kind of using technology in these other areas so i think um there's a lot of different ways to get there and a lot of ways to to find what you love and to have that that broad diverse set of voices in the room is absolutely valuable if anybody else has any final questions we've got just a couple more minutes here um thank you uh terence stone for that question that i tried to kind of weave in there you asked about specific skills that high school students should develop but they want to be a computer science a student of computer science um before we close out here wanted to make sure i didn't miss any other questions i'm just hungry for pizza now honestly that's the that's the big thing i'm thinking about um uh eric sent me a message and he's curious about what kinds of companies do product managers work for um we've heard of like project managers and product managers a little bit different um what do you think about that what types of companies um where do you find a product manager in it's really cool because i think we're in this moment where uh project product program all of those words maybe are not agreed upon across the industry uh so i think and as i said before product management is a relatively new field uh like 15 20 years of it being like a a real named job and it is growing quickly so i think traditionally my understanding is came from bigger tech companies so google microsoft all of those big companies will have product managers they're also a pretty early hire at startups that have a technology focus but something that i really loved in coming from nonprofits is code.org's commitment to being a nonprofit and a technology company and so the idea that you can be within a nonprofit and working in with product management is something really new and cool and i think the field is going to see a lot more of that yeah i think a ship from a project which usually has a start and end to a product which is this is this is the thing we've got this is the whether it be the code.org uh online applications and website or it's an app that somebody has thinking about that in the broad sense is a shift that seems to be happening in the industry and people who can think that way are super valuable um what's the hardest part about being a product manager it's ambiguous you don't always know your role in any room it is not totally clear but you can be a helper like as you said you get to remove roadblocks bring the right people in a room then sort of the best part about being a product manager is getting to watch those around you shine and to help that happen from start until forever awesome well thank you so much for chatting with me today uh i think it's a super important role um in an organization and with uh in computer science and in software um so thank you for chatting with us today thank you for uh joining us out there teachers and students uh reminder to tune in for our future class chats and then to also check the recordings of past class chats we had a bunch of them this fall uh we had one a little while ago this spring and this one will be recorded and posted online as well to if you want to watch it again uh and then um teachers please check your email for a survey that's going to be going out we really appreciate your feedback as we continue to have these class chats in the future and keep making them even better but that's all we've got for today thank you for joining us tess thank you so much this is the blast thanks bye
