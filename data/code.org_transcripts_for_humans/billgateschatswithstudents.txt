00:00 - Bill does not need any introduction for
00:02 - me uh anything to say would be worth by
00:05 - his own presence so there he is let me
00:07 - uh let me turn on him on the video here
00:09 - and uh there you go so there he is
00:12 - waiting for us and we're gonna start
00:14 - awesome we're gonna start with Parma so
00:16 - let me switch to your camera Parma and
00:18 - you can ask the first
00:20 - question go
00:22 - ahead um thank you proba for education
00:26 - and my question is what personality tra
00:28 - do you think is most beneficial to
00:32 - success you catch that bill yeah no
00:35 - that's a great question um I think
00:38 - probably
00:40 - persistence is the thing that makes the
00:42 - biggest difference I mean it's great to
00:44 - be interested in Reading uh it's great
00:48 - to be curious you but everybody has has
00:51 - some of those things if you can pick
00:52 - something and you know really push
00:55 - yourself to understand it very very well
00:58 - uh and persist
01:00 - I remember in in a lot of things I do I
01:02 - get to a point where I think I'm fairly
01:04 - good and then I find out that you know
01:07 - maybe I could be a lot better as several
01:10 - times people would look at my code tell
01:12 - me it wasn't very good uh and yet you
01:15 - know to take that feedback and have it
01:17 - engage you to just push harder try
01:19 - harder I I think you know confidence
01:22 - persistence are pretty i' put at the the
01:24 - top of the list all right thank you Bill
01:27 - okay the next question is coming from o
01:29 - hope I'm pronouncing right aagi middle
01:30 - school and let me bring you guys up aagi
01:33 - Middle School go
01:37 - ahead what emerging technology today do
01:40 - you think will cause a major change in
01:41 - how we live in the
01:45 - world you cat that bill yeah uh yeah I
01:50 - think the biggest thing is that you know
01:53 - we thought of computers with these
01:54 - things that sit on a desk and you have a
01:56 - mouse and keyboard uh or you know a
01:59 - phone in your pocket as the computer is
02:02 - able to see that is its Vision through
02:05 - very cheep cameras and its ability to
02:08 - listen to understand uh speech for
02:11 - example gets better then Computing
02:14 - becomes kind of pervasive and you even
02:16 - put those vision and listing
02:18 - capabilities on robot type
02:21 - devices and as the software gets smarter
02:24 - and smarter uh to use that vision and
02:27 - anticipate you know to see what's going
02:29 - on then it's it's kind of amazing what
02:32 - computers can do I uh you know there's
02:35 - really no limit uh to their ability to
02:38 - both help us and do things on their own
02:40 - and some people even worry that they'll
02:42 - get they'll get too capable but we the
02:44 - progress right now on things like speech
02:46 - and vision and and learning type
02:49 - technology that companies like Microsoft
02:51 - and Google and others are driving is
02:54 - quite amazing so computers won't be just
02:57 - this desktop thing uh in the future
03:01 - sure okay thank you okay the next
03:03 - question is coming from Galactic uh
03:06 - Galactic uh this a fifth grade class go
03:09 - ahead who is your role model and
03:14 - why yeah I I wouldn't say I just had
03:17 - anyone role model I mean certainly uh
03:19 - you know my parents you know were
03:21 - hardworking and and set an example for
03:23 - me uh eventually I got to meet some
03:26 - scientists who would just dig into their
03:29 - topic and in their life learning it
03:31 - realizing what they didn't know and
03:33 - always pushing themselves to understand
03:34 - more people like Richard fman was a
03:37 - physicist I got to meet Warren Buffett
03:39 - who always thought about stocks and
03:42 - businesses and how how they got
03:44 - profitability and just lived his life to
03:47 - really understand that very very well
03:50 - and I read a lot of biographies and
03:51 - autobiographies so you know uh Lincoln
03:56 - uh is an inspiring story uh Franklin Del
03:59 - Rose develops an inspiring story uh and
04:02 - a lot of people have dealt with very
04:04 - tough situations and and done well so I
04:08 - think reading LW of biographies and
04:10 - taking nuggets of how people manage to
04:13 - make a a huge difference and then you
04:15 - know as much as possible spend more time
04:18 - with people you admire and try to
04:20 - understand what is it about them uh that
04:22 - makes them you know so great and you
04:26 - know it won't just be their intelligence
04:28 - it'll be their uh their their
04:31 - personality okay thank you Bill okay we
04:33 - have Santa Fe Santa Fe Trails here Santa
04:37 - Fe Trail uh Middle
04:41 - School um what why did you start um G
04:47 - Foundation but I was very lucky that the
04:51 - Microsoft success created a lot of
04:54 - wealth uh and so the question is you
04:57 - know what what should I do so that most
05:00 - beneficial and you know at first of
05:03 - course you can buy you know uh some some
05:06 - more books or go on nice trips and
05:08 - things but the scale is Way Beyond any
05:11 - reasonable personal consumption and so
05:14 - if you decide that having your kids have
05:17 - that huge wealth would not be beneficial
05:19 - to them then you think okay where should
05:22 - it Go and that's where I started
05:24 - studying about poor countries and uh why
05:27 - so many kids in poor countries are still
05:29 - buying
05:30 - uh diseases that we pretty much
05:33 - eliminated diarrhea and pneumonia
05:36 - malaria and I decided hey I love science
05:39 - I love Innovation let's make sure that
05:41 - Innovation is working as much as
05:44 - possible to help the forest in the world
05:46 - and so that's about 70% of what we do in
05:49 - the foundation and you know I've gotten
05:51 - to learn new things it's a lot of fun
05:52 - and 30% is helping with us education
05:55 - trying to figure out how we can help
05:57 - teachers uh do an even better job of
06:01 - educating kids in in this country okay
06:04 - thank you okay next we have the Jewish
06:06 - Community High
06:10 - School how do you think online learning
06:13 - will affect education in the next 5 to
06:17 - 10 I'm very excited about online
06:20 - learning uh the idea that you can have
06:22 - the world's best lecture just there uh
06:25 - at your fingertips it's a quite a
06:27 - phenomenal thing because the best
06:29 - lecture in terms of making the subject
06:31 - interesting understandable are so much
06:33 - better than the average lecture and then
06:36 - of course you can create communities we
06:37 - can interact we can do try problem sets
06:40 - work together get advice from people you
06:43 - I think every student should know their
06:45 - math skills how good they are right now
06:48 - you know you kind of take a task and get
06:50 - the single score but understanding what
06:52 - areas to kind of weak in what materials
06:54 - are out there to help you improve uh you
06:57 - know you personally should have that
06:59 - online learning profile and be advised
07:02 - how you can how you can get better and
07:04 - so I don't think it'll replace teachers
07:06 - in classrooms in uh the high school area
07:10 - but once you get up to College
07:12 - self-directed learning will be a a much
07:14 - much uh bigger thing and so our
07:16 - foundation's the Big Thunder of all
07:18 - these online courses and seeing what
07:20 - kind of students they work for and
07:21 - blending so it's not just online versus
07:24 - traditional classroom but we using
07:25 - online and the traditional classroom
07:27 - trying to get the best of both worlds
07:30 - there so it's pretty exciting already
07:32 - things like P that I hope a lot of you
07:34 - have played around with for math type
07:36 - things uh a few dozen sites like that
07:38 - really are starting to make the
07:40 - difference well I just want to add I
07:42 - have to add right now quickly that the
07:44 - whole hour of code is an online learning
07:46 - that wouldn't even is impossible about
07:47 - the internet so getting you know
07:48 - hopefully 10 million kids this uh week
07:51 - learning the code for the first time is
07:52 - going to be a fantastic application of
07:53 - online learning so that's my my own
07:55 - little plug there let's go to the Jewish
07:58 - next we have uh it's a central Jersey
08:01 - College Prep
08:02 - y um hello Gates it is just an honor to
08:07 - be speaking to you today um my question
08:10 - is that can you give us an example of a
08:13 - time when a kid has given you useful
08:15 - advice that has made a difference in
08:17 - your
08:19 - life well certainly uh it keeps me you
08:24 - know press and uh thinking about things
08:26 - in a in a good way to have children I
08:29 - children 17 uh 14 11 and you know they
08:34 - like some Microsoft products they you
08:36 - know give me feedback of how we could
08:38 - improve some of those products and just
08:40 - the whole way that they see the internet
08:43 - and you know take it for granted which
08:45 - of course at their age when I was their
08:47 - age there was no internet and you know I
08:50 - also get to go out to schools and talk
08:52 - to students about things like online
08:54 - what you know did they think it's
08:55 - relevant to them or is it just you know
08:57 - not yet in a form that makes a
09:00 - difference for that so going out talking
09:02 - with students uh is fantastic I always
09:05 - meet with the summer interns that that
09:07 - work I did it at Microsoft every year I
09:09 - do it now at the foundation uh as they
09:11 - come in with a fresh view of you know
09:13 - how what's do they think is new and
09:15 - exciting how do they think the
09:17 - organization could be better and so the
09:20 - fresh Innovative eyes of young people
09:23 - are really where a lot of the the
09:25 - Improvement can take place and you never
09:27 - want to uh lose touch with that so uh
09:30 - you know kids think in a in a un
09:33 - unconstrained open
09:36 - way thank you very much sir and
09:39 - hopefully this is not the only
09:40 - time great all right we have Freedom
09:46 - Elementary
09:48 - hey who's G ask your
09:50 - question your traffic count program was
09:54 - your first program ever you ever sold in
09:58 - the era of four computers were how did
10:02 - you know your product would be
10:08 - successful yeah so the the very first
10:11 - thing I got paid for was kind of an
10:14 - obscure thing which is that they measure
10:17 - how much traffic R roads to understand
10:20 - when to do maintenance and how to change
10:23 - the traffic lights whether to put in a
10:24 - traffic light um they they would put a
10:27 - rubber hose across the road and and it
10:29 - would see the cars going by and then
10:30 - there'd be a counter in a metal box and
10:33 - it would punch out a paper tape with the
10:36 - every 15 minutes the traffic counts of
10:39 - of how many axles how many cars went
10:42 - over that uh the hose and then they
10:45 - would need somebody to take that and
10:48 - print it out and figure out what the
10:50 - tends and the Peaks and various things
10:52 - like that were and they were using these
10:54 - really expensive computers and we
10:56 - charged several hundred dollar for it
10:58 - and so my friends and I took the first
11:00 - computer on a chip and wire wrapped it
11:03 - together there were no personal
11:04 - computers and created a machine that was
11:06 - designed to print out these charts and
11:09 - so it's a very very limited machine like
11:12 - a million times as powerful as the the
11:15 - phone that all of you probably uh uh
11:18 - either have or will will have but it was
11:21 - enough to do that so we got paid we
11:23 - charged them like $30 for they paid like
11:25 - $100 so even though we were kids and
11:27 - they weren't quite sure about us we sent
11:31 - the stuff back it looked accurate our
11:33 - price was a lot lower uh never got to be
11:36 - a huge business but we made about three
11:39 - or 4,000 a year for about three years
11:41 - there and that was the money that I took
11:43 - that let me uh start Microsoft without
11:47 - having any income while we were doing
11:49 - the very first program
11:51 - development great thank you okay and I
11:53 - believe I don't have a question for
11:54 - Academy of Aerospace so I'm going to go
11:56 - on to Burbank and uh B High scho bring
12:00 - you up here hold on hey Bing go
12:04 - ahead um my question is if you can
12:06 - travel back in time and talk to your own
12:08 - yourself and give yourself an advice
12:10 - what would it be and
12:14 - why well there's a lot of fascinating
12:17 - periods in history
12:20 - um you know there's people like gang
12:22 - shaing and who reformed what was going
12:25 - on in very difficult uh there's you know
12:29 - some amazing us leaders that understand
12:33 - understanding uh like how Lincoln
12:35 - thought about things in the very
12:37 - difficult things he had to go go through
12:39 - and how he was able to you know build
12:41 - teams of people and keep a focus on the
12:44 - the good
12:45 - principles um you know if you could go
12:48 - back enough in time understanding the uh
12:51 - you know what happened 65 million years
12:52 - ago when the dinosaurs died out you know
12:55 - seeing all that cataclysm and uh how the
12:57 - Earth was different that would be pretty
12:59 - cool in terms of understanding Natural
13:01 - History uh so it it'd be nice to have a
13:04 - time machine uh I'm amazed how much we
13:06 - can learn about the path without
13:08 - actually being able to go back there
13:09 - just by looking at the the the way
13:11 - scientists now gather information it's
13:14 - it's amazing but it's not as good as as
13:17 - if if we could actually go back great
13:19 - and then Bill since we have five minutes
13:21 - left you have any just comments for the
13:23 - kids who are about many of them are
13:24 - going to be learning programming for the
13:26 - very first time this week in their first
13:27 - hour of code
13:29 - I think the
13:31 - um I go back to the point about
13:33 - persistence which is that you know the
13:36 - idea of a program and variables and you
13:40 - know if statements and data structure at
13:43 - first it's kind of confusing but then
13:45 - after you see a few of them you know
13:47 - then you kind of get the sense of how it
13:49 - works and and it's fun when you write a
13:51 - program you know at first it doesn't
13:53 - work and then you get it to work uh
13:55 - there's a real sense of satisfaction
13:57 - that comes out of that
13:59 - and you know it really is you just have
14:02 - to you know persist in find different
14:05 - things out and make a lot of mistakes in
14:07 - it uh but it it can be very gratifying
14:10 - even if you don't end up going into
14:12 - something related to programming
14:14 - understanding programming will give you
14:16 - a sense of how computers work what they
14:18 - can do what they can't do and if people
14:20 - have a mysterious sense of well maybe
14:22 - they can do everything but of course
14:24 - that's that's not true there're just
14:26 - certainly in today's Incarnation a very
14:28 - very very limited tools so you know I
14:30 - think programming can be fun it'll help
14:33 - with do logical thinking uh you know
14:36 - it's for everyone you know not just uh
14:40 - boys or not just math Geeks you know
14:43 - everybody uh can enjoy it and uh there's
14:47 - some you know great programs that you'll
14:49 - have a chance to do and for people who
14:51 - who choose to make a career of it it
14:53 - it's a phenomenal thing uh that you get
14:56 - to build these these products and and
14:59 - work on very tough problems uh so you
15:02 - know you you are the future workers of
15:05 - the country and the more you know about
15:07 - software and coding then the better off
15:09 - we'll be great you mentioned persistence
15:12 - I just wanted to recognize before we
15:13 - close today one of the groups here were
15:15 - snowed out that a snow day and they
15:17 - actually gaed a teacher house in order
15:19 - to chat with you so I just want to
15:21 - recognize this class which is at home at
15:23 - a teacher home uh to make sure they
15:25 - could uh make their chat with you today
15:27 - so thank you very much Bill we all have
15:29 - a round of applause un microphones
15:31 - everyone all have a round of applause
15:32 - for for Bill Gates and thank him
15:51 - [Music]
15:56 - for Microsoft long
15:59 - dinner with you at your house back in
16:01 - 1993 so thank you very much for also
16:03 - helping me on the path to great so thank
16:06 - you very much thanks everyone bye
16:13 - [Applause]
16:23 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

Bill does not need any introduction for me uh anything to say would be worth by his own presence so there he is let me uh let me turn on him on the video here and uh there you go so there he is waiting for us and we're gonna start awesome we're gonna start with Parma so let me switch to your camera Parma and you can ask the first question go ahead um thank you proba for education and my question is what personality tra do you think is most beneficial to success you catch that bill yeah no that's a great question um I think probably persistence is the thing that makes the biggest difference I mean it's great to be interested in Reading uh it's great to be curious you but everybody has has some of those things if you can pick something and you know really push yourself to understand it very very well uh and persist I remember in in a lot of things I do I get to a point where I think I'm fairly good and then I find out that you know maybe I could be a lot better as several times people would look at my code tell me it wasn't very good uh and yet you know to take that feedback and have it engage you to just push harder try harder I I think you know confidence persistence are pretty i' put at the the top of the list all right thank you Bill okay the next question is coming from o hope I'm pronouncing right aagi middle school and let me bring you guys up aagi Middle School go ahead what emerging technology today do you think will cause a major change in how we live in the world you cat that bill yeah uh yeah I think the biggest thing is that you know we thought of computers with these things that sit on a desk and you have a mouse and keyboard uh or you know a phone in your pocket as the computer is able to see that is its Vision through very cheep cameras and its ability to listen to understand uh speech for example gets better then Computing becomes kind of pervasive and you even put those vision and listing capabilities on robot type devices and as the software gets smarter and smarter uh to use that vision and anticipate you know to see what's going on then it's it's kind of amazing what computers can do I uh you know there's really no limit uh to their ability to both help us and do things on their own and some people even worry that they'll get they'll get too capable but we the progress right now on things like speech and vision and and learning type technology that companies like Microsoft and Google and others are driving is quite amazing so computers won't be just this desktop thing uh in the future sure okay thank you okay the next question is coming from Galactic uh Galactic uh this a fifth grade class go ahead who is your role model and why yeah I I wouldn't say I just had anyone role model I mean certainly uh you know my parents you know were hardworking and and set an example for me uh eventually I got to meet some scientists who would just dig into their topic and in their life learning it realizing what they didn't know and always pushing themselves to understand more people like Richard fman was a physicist I got to meet Warren Buffett who always thought about stocks and businesses and how how they got profitability and just lived his life to really understand that very very well and I read a lot of biographies and autobiographies so you know uh Lincoln uh is an inspiring story uh Franklin Del Rose develops an inspiring story uh and a lot of people have dealt with very tough situations and and done well so I think reading LW of biographies and taking nuggets of how people manage to make a a huge difference and then you know as much as possible spend more time with people you admire and try to understand what is it about them uh that makes them you know so great and you know it won't just be their intelligence it'll be their uh their their personality okay thank you Bill okay we have Santa Fe Santa Fe Trails here Santa Fe Trail uh Middle School um what why did you start um G Foundation but I was very lucky that the Microsoft success created a lot of wealth uh and so the question is you know what what should I do so that most beneficial and you know at first of course you can buy you know uh some some more books or go on nice trips and things but the scale is Way Beyond any reasonable personal consumption and so if you decide that having your kids have that huge wealth would not be beneficial to them then you think okay where should it Go and that's where I started studying about poor countries and uh why so many kids in poor countries are still buying uh diseases that we pretty much eliminated diarrhea and pneumonia malaria and I decided hey I love science I love Innovation let's make sure that Innovation is working as much as possible to help the forest in the world and so that's about 70% of what we do in the foundation and you know I've gotten to learn new things it's a lot of fun and 30% is helping with us education trying to figure out how we can help teachers uh do an even better job of educating kids in in this country okay thank you okay next we have the Jewish Community High School how do you think online learning will affect education in the next 5 to 10 I'm very excited about online learning uh the idea that you can have the world's best lecture just there uh at your fingertips it's a quite a phenomenal thing because the best lecture in terms of making the subject interesting understandable are so much better than the average lecture and then of course you can create communities we can interact we can do try problem sets work together get advice from people you I think every student should know their math skills how good they are right now you know you kind of take a task and get the single score but understanding what areas to kind of weak in what materials are out there to help you improve uh you know you personally should have that online learning profile and be advised how you can how you can get better and so I don't think it'll replace teachers in classrooms in uh the high school area but once you get up to College selfdirected learning will be a a much much uh bigger thing and so our foundation's the Big Thunder of all these online courses and seeing what kind of students they work for and blending so it's not just online versus traditional classroom but we using online and the traditional classroom trying to get the best of both worlds there so it's pretty exciting already things like P that I hope a lot of you have played around with for math type things uh a few dozen sites like that really are starting to make the difference well I just want to add I have to add right now quickly that the whole hour of code is an online learning that wouldn't even is impossible about the internet so getting you know hopefully 10 million kids this uh week learning the code for the first time is going to be a fantastic application of online learning so that's my my own little plug there let's go to the Jewish next we have uh it's a central Jersey College Prep y um hello Gates it is just an honor to be speaking to you today um my question is that can you give us an example of a time when a kid has given you useful advice that has made a difference in your life well certainly uh it keeps me you know press and uh thinking about things in a in a good way to have children I children 17 uh 14 11 and you know they like some Microsoft products they you know give me feedback of how we could improve some of those products and just the whole way that they see the internet and

interns that that work I did it at Microsoft every year I do it now at the foundation uh as they come in with a fresh view of you know how what's do they think is new and exciting how do they think the organization could be better and so the fresh Innovative eyes of young people are really where a lot of the the Improvement can take place and you never want to uh lose touch with that so uh you know kids think in a in a un unconstrained open way thank you very much sir and hopefully this is not the only time great all right we have Freedom Elementary hey who's G ask your question your traffic count program was your first program ever you ever sold in the era of four computers were how did you know your product would be successful yeah so the the very first thing I got paid for was kind of an obscure thing which is that they measure how much traffic R roads to understand when to do maintenance and how to change the traffic lights whether to put in a traffic light um they they would put a rubber hose across the road and and it would see the cars going by and then there'd be a counter in a metal box and it would punch out a paper tape with the every 15 minutes the traffic counts of of how many axles how many cars went over that uh the hose and then they would need somebody to take that and print it out and figure out what the tends and the Peaks and various things like that were and they were using these really expensive computers and we charged several hundred dollar for it and so my friends and I took the first computer on a chip and wire wrapped it together there were no personal computers and created a machine that was designed to print out these charts and so it's a very very limited machine like a million times as powerful as the the phone that all of you probably uh uh either have or will will have but it was enough to do that so we got paid we charged them like $30 for they paid like $100 so even though we were kids and they weren't quite sure about us we sent the stuff back it looked accurate our price was a lot lower uh never got to be a huge business but we made about three or 4,000 a year for about three years there and that was the money that I took that let me uh start Microsoft without having any income while we were doing the very first program development great thank you okay and I believe I don't have a question for Academy of Aerospace so I'm going to go on to Burbank and uh B High scho bring you up here hold on hey Bing go ahead um my question is if you can travel back in time and talk to your own yourself and give yourself an advice what would it be and why well there's a lot of fascinating periods in history um you know there's people like gang shaing and who reformed what was going on in very difficult uh there's you know some amazing us leaders that understand understanding uh like how Lincoln thought about things in the very difficult things he had to go go through and how he was able to you know build teams of people and keep a focus on the the good principles um you know if you could go back enough in time understanding the uh you know what happened 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs died out you know seeing all that cataclysm and uh how the Earth was different that would be pretty cool in terms of understanding Natural History uh so it it'd be nice to have a time machine uh I'm amazed how much we can learn about the path without actually being able to go back there just by looking at the the the way scientists now gather information it's it's amazing but it's not as good as as if if we could actually go back great and then Bill since we have five minutes left you have any just comments for the kids who are about many of them are going to be learning programming for the very first time this week in their first hour of code I think the um I go back to the point about persistence which is that you know the idea of a program and variables and you know if statements and data structure at first it's kind of confusing but then after you see a few of them you know then you kind of get the sense of how it works and and it's fun when you write a program you know at first it doesn't work and then you get it to work uh there's a real sense of satisfaction that comes out of that and you know it really is you just have to you know persist in find different things out and make a lot of mistakes in it uh but it it can be very gratifying even if you don't end up going into something related to programming understanding programming will give you a sense of how computers work what they can do what they can't do and if people have a mysterious sense of well maybe they can do everything but of course that's that's not true there're just certainly in today's Incarnation a very very very limited tools so you know I think programming can be fun it'll help with do logical thinking uh you know it's for everyone you know not just uh boys or not just math Geeks you know everybody uh can enjoy it and uh there's some you know great programs that you'll have a chance to do and for people who who choose to make a career of it it it's a phenomenal thing uh that you get to build these these products and and work on very tough problems uh so you know you you are the future workers of the country and the more you know about software and coding then the better off we'll be great you mentioned persistence I just wanted to recognize before we close today one of the groups here were snowed out that a snow day and they actually gaed a teacher house in order to chat with you so I just want to recognize this class which is at home at a teacher home uh to make sure they could uh make their chat with you today so thank you very much Bill we all have a round of applause un microphones everyone all have a round of applause for for Bill Gates and thank him for Microsoft long dinner with you at your house back in 1993 so thank you very much for also helping me on the path to great so thank you very much thanks everyone bye bye
