00:12 - you gotta learn how to code folks so by
00:15 - learning to code today you guys are
00:17 - already getting a head start on taking
00:18 - over the world
00:31 - at least 50 million students doing the
00:34 - hour of code just in one week which is
00:36 - an amazingly large number that's roughly
00:39 - the size of the entire us student
00:40 - population
00:42 - the hour of code is organized by a
00:44 - non-profit coalition of tech companies
00:46 - which aims to make computer science more
00:48 - available in schools
00:55 - you're basically writing the program
00:57 - rather than just operating again
01:01 - so that's the coding you did
01:06 - it's incredible to see
01:07 - so many kids across the world united by
01:09 - coding
01:12 - i'm gonna go home and do it again
01:29 - you
