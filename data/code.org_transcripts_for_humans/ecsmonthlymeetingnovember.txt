With timestamps:

00:00 - great uh to have you both
00:03 - it's great to have you join us tonight
00:05 - um we are going to
00:08 - uh have our november meeting this
00:10 - evening where we're going to
00:12 - have uh myself brooke osborne danny
00:14 - mcavoy and melissa jones take you
00:17 - through some updates um and things you
00:19 - should be aware of and also
00:21 - spend some time uh looking at tools for
00:23 - unit three so to reiterate our goals for
00:26 - tonight are to connect as a community to
00:28 - discuss how the school year is going to
00:29 - talk about tools for unit 3 and then at
00:31 - the end to just talk about any questions
00:32 - or concerns you might have right now
00:35 - um as a reminder i don't know if anyone
00:38 - on the call right now needs this
00:38 - reminder because you're getting the hang
00:40 - of it but uh you can use the chat pod on
00:43 - the right hand side at any time
00:45 - to just communicate with all of us we'll
00:47 - be monitoring it as we go
00:49 - and you can feel free to turn your mic
00:51 - turn your mic on and ask any questions
00:53 - with that if you feel comfortable
00:56 - so i'm going to turn things over to
00:57 - danny who is going to talk to us a
01:00 - little bit about some reminders and
01:01 - things to let you know about for this
01:03 - month
01:05 - all right thanks brooke
01:08 - so we have a bunch of reminders for this
01:10 - month uh
01:11 - as you guys know the unit one
01:14 - sri assessment came out last month and
01:17 - the unit two one is out this month it
01:20 - was released two days ago
01:22 - and will be up on the cs 10k site so you
01:25 - should take a look for that
01:27 - the site has been down for maintenance
01:29 - today but should be up shortly so
01:32 - keep your eye open for that especially
01:34 - if you're headed into unit two
01:38 - the unit three one is scheduled to
01:39 - release in december
01:41 - so keep your eyes open for that as well
01:44 - if you're moving to unit three
01:46 - um we released our phase three online
01:49 - for unit three and unit four today uh
01:52 - they look very similar to you what you
01:55 - saw in unit two we have tried to
01:57 - condense them a little bit um
02:00 - still give you all that great
02:01 - information but
02:03 - make it so you don't have to click
02:04 - through quite as many levels to get it
02:06 - all uh and hopefully that will be a
02:09 - positive change for you guys um
02:12 - hopefully the challenges have been going
02:14 - well i've been seeing a lot of posts on
02:15 - the forum
02:16 - uh
02:17 - with people submitting their challenge
02:20 - work and it's been really great it's
02:22 - also been great to see people pairing up
02:24 - and working together and
02:27 - giving each other feedback that's been
02:28 - really awesome so keep that up hopefully
02:30 - we can do that for unit 3 and unit 4 as
02:33 - well
02:34 - and then as always um
02:37 - make sure
02:38 - that you're sharing your resources
02:41 - in the resource folder and keep posting
02:44 - to the forum those
02:45 - um posts really help other teachers and
02:48 - it helps keep us at code.org in the loop
02:51 - in terms of what types of things you
02:53 - guys need
02:55 - so
02:56 - brook on to the next slide
02:59 - so we're just going to take a minute to
03:00 - check in and how's it going um
03:03 - i know that we get a lot of this
03:04 - feedback in the form but i wanted to
03:06 - give space here for it as well so if we
03:08 - can go to the next slide
03:13 - um
03:14 - we had a couple people tell us
03:16 - where they were in the unit so far
03:19 - right at the beginning of
03:21 - our chat tonight um
03:25 - luanne said she was in unit one which is
03:27 - great um
03:29 - there's no wrong place to be at this
03:31 - point
03:33 - you're really looking to go at the pace
03:35 - that your students need to make sure
03:36 - that they feel comfortable
03:38 - especially in units one and two you want
03:40 - to spend the time necessary to make sure
03:42 - your students
03:44 - get comfortable with the
03:45 - ways that the classroom runs in ecs and
03:48 - then the problem solving strategies
03:49 - because those will pay off big time when
03:51 - you get to units three and four so take
03:53 - that time now if you need it and keep
03:56 - working through the units you're at
03:58 - um let's go to the next slide
04:03 - so i just wanted to open up the floor
04:05 - these are a couple of the resources that
04:07 - we have um created at code.org or linked
04:11 - to so uh i would love to hear how
04:15 - things are going using these different
04:17 - resources if you have any feedback uh we
04:19 - especially i'd love to hear if anybody's
04:22 - used the sri assessment in their
04:24 - classroom because we heard from eric
04:26 - snow last month and
04:29 - um he came and introduced that
04:31 - assessment so if anybody's
04:34 - worked with that um either if you're
04:36 - watching
04:38 - after the fact you could post um
04:40 - that feedback to the forum as well i
04:43 - would love to hear it but does anybody
04:45 - in the call tonight have any feedback
04:48 - they want to share on any of these
04:50 - pieces online pd sri assessments
04:53 - the resource folder or the forum
05:01 - you can type in the chat pod
05:05 - or you can um just turn your mic on and
05:08 - talk up to you
05:12 - this is nicole and i would have to say i
05:14 - really like the resource folder it gives
05:17 - me a lot of great ideas on what other
05:19 - people are doing to modify the lessons
05:22 - to fit their students needs so thanks
05:24 - for everyone sharing in the resource
05:26 - folder
05:28 - awesome nicole thanks for sharing
05:35 - anybody else have any feedback they want
05:37 - to share on the forum the resource
05:40 - folder sri assessments or online pd
05:51 - okay well so if you're watching this
05:54 - recording after the fact make sure to
05:55 - share your thoughts as well to keep a
05:57 - part of the conversation we understand
05:59 - that people can't always make the calls
06:01 - at the time that we set them up but you
06:04 - can always um share your thoughts with
06:06 - us after the fact when you watch the
06:08 - recording so brooke if we could head on
06:10 - to the next piece
06:14 - all right so we're going to move on to a
06:17 - live demo of jsfiddle and this is an
06:20 - html and css editor and i can also do
06:23 - javascript but we're not going to worry
06:25 - about that
06:26 - um
06:27 - as you move towards unit 3 you'll notice
06:30 - that html and css are the programming
06:33 - languages we'll be using
06:36 - to start students off they help us do
06:39 - web design and
06:41 - in the curriculum there isn't a
06:42 - recommended
06:44 - way to go about
06:47 - teaching this right they they tell you
06:49 - how what concepts to teach but there
06:51 - isn't a editor that's suggested so we at
06:55 - code.org
06:56 - picked our favorite and we're just going
06:58 - to share a little bit about why it's our
07:00 - favorite and you can choose to use it
07:02 - but if you have a favorite go for it and
07:04 - use that one um we're not trying to make
07:06 - you use this it's just a matter of a
07:09 - suggestion
07:13 - all right so next slide brooke
07:17 - um so
07:19 - just
07:20 - for your information jsfiddle as i said
07:22 - is an
07:23 - html css editor and one of the coolest
07:25 - things about it is it allows you to
07:27 - collaborate so brooke and i are going to
07:29 - demo tonight how that happens
07:32 - and you'll be able to watch that as i
07:34 - share my screen
07:36 - but
07:37 - if you wanted to take a look and poke
07:38 - around in jsfiddle you can
07:42 - go to that site as well while we're
07:44 - doing this if you just google jsfiddle
07:45 - you will find it
07:47 - all right i'm pulling up my
07:50 - demo
07:51 - i'm going to share my screen
07:56 - um all right
07:58 - can everyone see my screen
08:06 - yep it's there
08:08 - alrighty
08:09 - so
08:11 - um i just made a simple
08:13 - little
08:14 - web page here and we're gonna
08:16 - we're gonna
08:17 - walk through kind of how to make this
08:19 - um
08:20 - and a couple of different features so
08:23 - instead of me trying to type this and
08:24 - get it perfect while we're on the call
08:26 - i'm going to copy over some stuff so
08:28 - first of all
08:30 - um
08:31 - you'll notice here
08:33 - i have a window that's blocking my view
08:36 - there we go
08:38 - there's an html spot
08:40 - this
08:41 - box that i'm going to paste something in
08:43 - that's the html spot you can see it pops
08:46 - up there in the corner there's also a
08:47 - css
08:49 - block here and then the results window
08:51 - is down in the right hand corner as i
08:54 - said this does also do javascript if you
08:56 - went that far with your kids
08:58 - this could be where you would have them
09:00 - type that as well so we're just going to
09:02 - test this out and see what it looks like
09:04 - i if you don't understand what this code
09:06 - says yet because you're still new to
09:09 - html and you're still learning it
09:12 - i would suggest going through the online
09:14 - pd
09:15 - nicole was one of the people that helped
09:17 - us write that and it's really awesome
09:18 - online pd
09:20 - um to help you get a grasp of html and
09:24 - css and then the unit 401 introduces you
09:27 - to scratch so if you're new to either of
09:29 - those take a look at them but we're
09:30 - going to run this
09:33 - and we're going to see
09:35 - it looks a little different than what i
09:36 - had before
09:38 - so i'm going to just make the window
09:39 - bigger for a sec so i can drag these
09:42 - and look at my results
09:44 - bigger
09:45 - looks like my image is really big right
09:47 - now and i don't have the pretty coloring
09:50 - that i had on the other page
09:52 - all right so we've just added the
09:53 - content and you'll notice that as you
09:56 - learn html
09:58 - that that is the content piece and then
10:00 - css is the style piece so let's add that
10:03 - styling that i had so i'm going to copy
10:04 - over my styling here
10:09 - um
10:12 - paste it in and now i have to hit run
10:15 - again to see the results so i'm going to
10:17 - hit run
10:19 - and there we go now i've added styling
10:21 - and don't worry about how all of that
10:23 - happened
10:24 - go through the online pd and get a sense
10:27 - of how to use these different pieces
10:29 - it'll be really helpful another thing we
10:31 - suggest um there are different websites
10:33 - that teach this so
10:35 - uh
10:36 - one of my favorites is khan academy if
10:38 - you're new to html and css
10:41 - take a step through khan academy and
10:42 - you'll feel much
10:44 - more secure and how to teach this stuff
10:47 - uh for yourself
10:49 - so i've created a simple little web page
10:52 - here
10:53 - it's just showing the results here
10:56 - and what if i want to make sure i have a
10:59 - name for it so if i'm trying to submit
11:01 - it
11:01 - and i want to name it i come into the
11:04 - jsfiddle options and i say danny's
11:07 - webpage
11:09 - and i can add a description
11:11 - i made this for an ecs demo
11:17 - so as your students are getting ready to
11:19 - submit things they can name them they
11:21 - can put a description there so they
11:22 - could put a note to you in that
11:24 - description probably um so that's nice
11:27 - that'll save and
11:30 - we'll just
11:31 - head back here um
11:34 - up the top here if i want to save this
11:36 - you'll notice that i'm logged in your
11:38 - students can make accounts really
11:40 - quickly and they'll have an account to
11:42 - save it so i'm going to hit save
11:47 - when i hit save i get a couple more
11:49 - options update update just does save on
11:53 - something that's already saved i can
11:55 - fork
11:56 - something so i can make a copy of it
11:59 - that i can then edit but i'll still have
12:01 - the old copy
12:03 - i also have tidy up so as your students
12:06 - are learning html and css they may not
12:09 - have the best practices in terms of
12:11 - keeping their code neat and tidy but one
12:12 - of the things that jsfiddle does for you
12:14 - is it'll clean it up and make it look a
12:16 - little bit nicer so if you saw as i hit
12:18 - that
12:19 - some of the stuff moved around and just
12:21 - spaced out a little bit nicer and makes
12:24 - it easier to read this j s hint button
12:27 - up the top will help you out if
12:29 - something in your program is not running
12:32 - well
12:33 - um take a look at that
12:35 - we're going to look at collaboration
12:36 - mode in a sec but i just want to show
12:38 - you share so up the top here under share
12:41 - i can
12:42 - grab a share link i can share a full
12:44 - screen result so let's take a look what
12:46 - that looks like so i'm going to copy
12:47 - this and open it in a new window
12:52 - and now i can actually test out and see
12:54 - my
12:54 - um web page in a full window that's what
12:57 - it would look like
12:58 - and show up like in a full window so
13:01 - students can test that out
13:03 - and not just in this little tiny window
13:05 - you can also embed these so if you
13:08 - want to show off what your students are
13:10 - doing in your own web page you can embed
13:12 - their web pages
13:14 - inside
13:15 - um so that's pretty cool
13:18 - and so now i just want to show you the
13:21 - collaboration mode this is one of the
13:23 - reasons that i absolutely love jsfiddle
13:28 - um so brooke's going to help me out with
13:29 - this i'm going to click collaboration
13:32 - hopefully it will pop up
13:34 - yep so you'll see that over here on the
13:37 - right hand side of my screen it popped
13:39 - up and said i can invite a friend so i'm
13:41 - gonna share this
13:43 - link with brooke
13:45 - we have over our chat that we have
13:48 - and so i just i just sent her the link
13:52 - and so she's gonna join me
13:54 - and you'll see friendly fox has now
13:56 - joined the session so
13:58 - um brooke join me and she can now
14:00 - actually type and add things to
14:04 - my project so if you watch my screen
14:07 - you'll see that brooke is typing and she
14:09 - just added a paragraph and she can then
14:11 - run it
14:13 - and we can see that she's added
14:14 - something so i didn't do anything i
14:16 - didn't add or touch the code but
14:19 - she can add things and we can work
14:21 - together
14:22 - um we can actually chat so we i could
14:24 - type messages to her so brooke do you
14:26 - want to type a message to me so we can
14:28 - see how that works
14:38 - so you see that brook can type messages
14:40 - to me there's also an audio feature
14:42 - which is newer um and it's still i think
14:46 - in beta mode but it's worth having your
14:48 - students try if they want to talk to
14:49 - each other as well
14:51 - i'm not going to do that right now
14:52 - because i don't think it will work very
14:54 - well while we're on a video call
14:56 - up and there brooke changed her name so
14:58 - now she is actually brooke
15:01 - so
15:02 - that's a pretty cool feature um as
15:04 - anyone's ever
15:07 - wanted to have their students work
15:08 - together on a project but they had to go
15:10 - home at the end of the night one of them
15:11 - had the project on their computer and
15:13 - they couldn't work together and they're
15:14 - trying to talk over the phone and they
15:16 - can't see each other's screen
15:18 - this is a really helpful tool
15:20 - to make that happen so it's one of my
15:22 - favorite features
15:24 - and i'm
15:25 - glad we got to share it with you
15:28 - so
15:29 - let's head back oh one last thing if i
15:31 - click on my name up here i can go up to
15:33 - my dashboard
15:36 - and you'll see that like everything that
15:38 - i've created is listed here so if you're
15:41 - wondering how do students save their
15:43 - stuff
15:44 - they can um they go to their dashboard
15:46 - and that's where it gets saved
15:48 - so
15:49 - if you're looking for that that's where
15:50 - it is
15:51 - all right so let me head back to
15:55 - uh
15:59 - chat and stop sharing
16:01 - and i
16:03 - that's the jsfiddle intro i would be
16:05 - happy to answer any questions that may
16:07 - have come up while i was sharing that
16:09 - does anybody have any
16:11 - thing they want to talk about
16:15 - or ask about jsfiddle
16:18 - brook there
16:28 - melissa do you have something
16:42 - um all right
16:45 - so there's also an intro to jsfiddle in
16:48 - the online pd so if you are looking for
16:51 - that take um a look through that and
16:53 - that will step you through a couple
16:55 - pieces of how jsfiddle works there as
16:58 - well
16:59 - yeah
17:00 - um i got booted out of the room quickly
17:02 - but there was a question in the chat pod
17:04 - about well a statement more
17:06 - about how new teachers might want to
17:08 - take some time to play with jsfiddle
17:10 - before introducing it to students do you
17:11 - have any tips for people who are
17:13 - completely new to programming
17:15 - or to web design i mean sure so
17:19 - my suggestion is to just
17:22 - find um
17:24 - you can so the ecs curriculum links to
17:27 - ww3 schools and we have some links to
17:30 - that in our pd um
17:33 - that's one way to learn about different
17:35 - pieces and probably the best thing to do
17:37 - is just to copy some code from
17:40 - w3schools into jsfiddle
17:43 - and run it and see what happens and
17:45 - maybe delete some lines and see what
17:47 - happens um
17:49 - i really love
17:51 - uh khan academy um
17:53 - there's other
17:54 - things that work just like khan academy
17:56 - but khan academy will
17:58 - has video demos
18:00 - that walk you through
18:02 - different
18:03 - topics in html and css so those are
18:06 - really great if you're new as well
18:09 - and you can try programming the
18:12 - different little tasks they have you do
18:14 - in jsfiddle if you want um
18:17 - so that you get comfortable with that
18:19 - platform along the way so
18:21 - those are always good ways to do it but
18:24 - the biggest thing with computer science
18:25 - is to just
18:26 - be okay with the fact that you may not
18:29 - always know
18:30 - every little detail right even when i
18:33 - teach a programming language i've known
18:35 - for a couple years or multiple years
18:38 - right
18:39 - i don't always know everything about
18:40 - that language and my students often find
18:42 - something i didn't know
18:44 - and teach me something along the way so
18:47 - be prepared to
18:49 - learn something and not always know
18:51 - everything
18:52 - computer science is such a fast changing
18:55 - subject you can't know it all because
18:57 - tomorrow it changes and is completely
19:00 - different so um that's a big piece of it
19:03 - so just accept where you're at and learn
19:06 - along with your students if that's going
19:07 - to be the best thing for you this year
19:11 - it won't be a big deal
19:13 - your students will still learn the html
19:15 - and css i have faith
19:21 - any other questions
19:27 - julie tells us in the chat pod that
19:29 - she's actually introducing html to
19:31 - younger students in fifth grade i'm
19:32 - wondering if you have any tips for
19:35 - introducing this outside of the high
19:36 - school classroom
19:40 - yeah sure um
19:41 - fifth grade
19:43 - that's awesome that we got fourth and
19:45 - fifth graders that might be learning it
19:47 - um
19:49 - i worked with middle schoolers and had
19:51 - them do html and css and i really think
19:54 - that it's something that's approachable
19:56 - at a lot of different ages and that's
19:58 - why it's one of the intros for
20:00 - uh
20:01 - ecs it's the starting place because it
20:04 - has such a low bar entry point and it's
20:07 - so creative
20:08 - so students at a lot of different ages
20:10 - can learn it um i know that pencil code
20:13 - has created something that has a little
20:15 - bit of more of a block base
20:18 - for html and css so if you're teaching
20:21 - at any younger age that might be
20:22 - something worth considering
20:25 - um
20:26 - but
20:27 - that lots of students especially if they
20:29 - have some
20:31 - intro
20:32 - to
20:33 - programming at some level we'll
20:36 - pick it up and enjoy html i think it's a
20:39 - great intro at
20:40 - multiple ages
20:45 - that's great i think that my students
20:47 - that i taught in high school had a bit a
20:49 - lot of reading challenges and learning
20:51 - differences so i think having that
20:52 - option of doing black black based even
20:54 - for older students is a great idea
20:58 - yeah
21:00 - all right
21:02 - there any other questions
21:05 - tonight
21:11 - ah so it looks like luanne has a
21:13 - question about where the online pd is
21:16 - so
21:17 - um the link should have been sent out to
21:20 - you for
21:22 - online pd from our ops team our
21:24 - operations team
21:26 - um
21:28 - and we'll actually
21:29 - at the end of these slides uh there's a
21:32 - link to a
21:34 - forum post
21:35 - where i post links to different things
21:38 - um
21:39 - updates and information so i'll put the
21:41 - links to
21:43 - uh online pd there
21:45 - for you if you need them luain
21:53 - and we had someone put them in the chat
21:54 - pod too so
21:56 - if anyone needs them later they'll be up
21:59 - there
22:02 - sorry danny i just i wanted to add to
22:03 - that once the as a as a teacher in our
22:07 - program once the the pde has been
22:10 - assigned to you it will show up on your
22:13 - teacher dashboard every time you log in
22:15 - so uh when you log into codestudio just
22:18 - at studio.co.org along with whatever
22:20 - classes you're teaching right now you'll
22:22 - also see whatever pd has been assigned
22:25 - to you so you shouldn't have to remember
22:27 - the url it should just be there for you
22:29 - when you log in
22:31 - awesome
22:32 - thank you
22:35 - all right
22:37 - so let's
22:39 - close out so can you go to the next
22:40 - slide
22:43 - one after that
22:45 - all right so we've been doing these
22:47 - monthly webinars for you the past couple
22:50 - months but um we found out recently that
22:53 - ecs is holding
22:55 - uh ecs specific webinars on the cs 10k
22:58 - community there's actually one next
23:00 - tuesday
23:01 - um
23:02 - and that schedule can be found on the
23:04 - cs10 community.org
23:07 - and what we're going to do is actually
23:08 - try and merge with them
23:12 - so that you can get
23:14 - content and
23:15 - ask questions from the curriculum
23:17 - writers themselves
23:19 - so you'll get to
23:20 - interact with them and other ecs
23:22 - teachers outside of the code.org
23:24 - community
23:25 - we're going to work towards
23:27 - that as our main
23:30 - point of webinars
23:32 - but we'll still be sharing different
23:34 - resources with you and we'll post videos
23:36 - to the forum if there's something we
23:39 - need to update you about uh
23:41 - as always we'll send emails
23:44 - and give you um updates that way as well
23:46 - so
23:47 - hopefully those uh the cs10k ecs
23:52 - webinars will be
23:54 - helpful to you and you can ask those
23:55 - questions that
23:57 - you see coming up in your classroom
24:03 - anything else
24:05 - so as i mentioned before um you can see
24:08 - here and i'm sorry that it's a long link
24:10 - we should bitly make it easier but on
24:13 - the forum
24:14 - you can find this under the general
24:16 - resources for the ecs
24:19 - um
24:20 - it's the ecs monthly meeting for
24:22 - november forum post and we'll put any
24:24 - resources or links that you might need
24:28 - from this call there
24:30 - it um
24:32 - i think we need to update it with the js
24:35 - fiddle link and
24:37 - um the
24:39 - ecs online pd
24:42 - links
24:43 - based on what people were asking about
24:46 - we have anything else

25:03 - thanks everyone

Cleaned transcript:

great uh to have you both it's great to have you join us tonight um we are going to uh have our november meeting this evening where we're going to have uh myself brooke osborne danny mcavoy and melissa jones take you through some updates um and things you should be aware of and also spend some time uh looking at tools for unit three so to reiterate our goals for tonight are to connect as a community to discuss how the school year is going to talk about tools for unit 3 and then at the end to just talk about any questions or concerns you might have right now um as a reminder i don't know if anyone on the call right now needs this reminder because you're getting the hang of it but uh you can use the chat pod on the right hand side at any time to just communicate with all of us we'll be monitoring it as we go and you can feel free to turn your mic turn your mic on and ask any questions with that if you feel comfortable so i'm going to turn things over to danny who is going to talk to us a little bit about some reminders and things to let you know about for this month all right thanks brooke so we have a bunch of reminders for this month uh as you guys know the unit one sri assessment came out last month and the unit two one is out this month it was released two days ago and will be up on the cs 10k site so you should take a look for that the site has been down for maintenance today but should be up shortly so keep your eye open for that especially if you're headed into unit two the unit three one is scheduled to release in december so keep your eyes open for that as well if you're moving to unit three um we released our phase three online for unit three and unit four today uh they look very similar to you what you saw in unit two we have tried to condense them a little bit um still give you all that great information but make it so you don't have to click through quite as many levels to get it all uh and hopefully that will be a positive change for you guys um hopefully the challenges have been going well i've been seeing a lot of posts on the forum uh with people submitting their challenge work and it's been really great it's also been great to see people pairing up and working together and giving each other feedback that's been really awesome so keep that up hopefully we can do that for unit 3 and unit 4 as well and then as always um make sure that you're sharing your resources in the resource folder and keep posting to the forum those um posts really help other teachers and it helps keep us at code.org in the loop in terms of what types of things you guys need so brook on to the next slide so we're just going to take a minute to check in and how's it going um i know that we get a lot of this feedback in the form but i wanted to give space here for it as well so if we can go to the next slide um we had a couple people tell us where they were in the unit so far right at the beginning of our chat tonight um luanne said she was in unit one which is great um there's no wrong place to be at this point you're really looking to go at the pace that your students need to make sure that they feel comfortable especially in units one and two you want to spend the time necessary to make sure your students get comfortable with the ways that the classroom runs in ecs and then the problem solving strategies because those will pay off big time when you get to units three and four so take that time now if you need it and keep working through the units you're at um let's go to the next slide so i just wanted to open up the floor these are a couple of the resources that we have um created at code.org or linked to so uh i would love to hear how things are going using these different resources if you have any feedback uh we especially i'd love to hear if anybody's used the sri assessment in their classroom because we heard from eric snow last month and um he came and introduced that assessment so if anybody's worked with that um either if you're watching after the fact you could post um that feedback to the forum as well i would love to hear it but does anybody in the call tonight have any feedback they want to share on any of these pieces online pd sri assessments the resource folder or the forum you can type in the chat pod or you can um just turn your mic on and talk up to you this is nicole and i would have to say i really like the resource folder it gives me a lot of great ideas on what other people are doing to modify the lessons to fit their students needs so thanks for everyone sharing in the resource folder awesome nicole thanks for sharing anybody else have any feedback they want to share on the forum the resource folder sri assessments or online pd okay well so if you're watching this recording after the fact make sure to share your thoughts as well to keep a part of the conversation we understand that people can't always make the calls at the time that we set them up but you can always um share your thoughts with us after the fact when you watch the recording so brooke if we could head on to the next piece all right so we're going to move on to a live demo of jsfiddle and this is an html and css editor and i can also do javascript but we're not going to worry about that um as you move towards unit 3 you'll notice that html and css are the programming languages we'll be using to start students off they help us do web design and in the curriculum there isn't a recommended way to go about teaching this right they they tell you how what concepts to teach but there isn't a editor that's suggested so we at code.org picked our favorite and we're just going to share a little bit about why it's our favorite and you can choose to use it but if you have a favorite go for it and use that one um we're not trying to make you use this it's just a matter of a suggestion all right so next slide brooke um so just for your information jsfiddle as i said is an html css editor and one of the coolest things about it is it allows you to collaborate so brooke and i are going to demo tonight how that happens and you'll be able to watch that as i share my screen but if you wanted to take a look and poke around in jsfiddle you can go to that site as well while we're doing this if you just google jsfiddle you will find it all right i'm pulling up my demo i'm going to share my screen um all right can everyone see my screen yep it's there alrighty so um i just made a simple little web page here and we're gonna we're gonna walk through kind of how to make this um and a couple of different features so instead of me trying to type this and get it perfect while we're on the call i'm going to copy over some stuff so first of all um you'll notice here i have a window that's blocking my view there we go there's an html spot this box that i'm going to paste something in that's the html spot you can see it pops up there in the corner there's also a css block here and then the results window is down in the right hand corner as i said this does also do javascript if you went that far with your kids this could be where you would have them type that as well so we're just going to test this out and see what it looks like i if you don't understand what this code says yet because you're still new to html and you're still learning it i would suggest going through the online pd nicole was one of the people that helped us write that and it's really awesome online pd um to help you get a grasp of html and css and then the unit 401 introduces you to scratch so if you're new to either of those take a look at them but we're going to run this and we're going to see it looks a little different than what i had before so i'm going to just make the window bigger for a sec so i can drag these and look at my results bigger looks like my image is really big right now and i don't have the pretty coloring that i had on the other page all right so we've just added the content and you'll notice that as you learn html that that is the content piece and then css is the style piece so let's add that styling that i had so i'm going to copy over my styling here um paste it in and now i have to hit run again to see the results so i'm going to hit run and there we go now i've added styling and don't worry about how all of that happened go through the online pd and get a sense of how to use these different pieces it'll be really helpful another thing we suggest um there are different websites that teach this so uh one of my favorites is khan academy if you're new to html and css take a step through khan academy and you'll feel much more secure and how to teach this stuff uh for yourself so i've created a simple little web page here it's just showing the results here and what if i want to make sure i have a name for it so if i'm trying to submit it and i want to name it i come into the jsfiddle options and i say danny's webpage and i can add a description i made this for an ecs demo so as your students are getting ready to submit things they can name them they can put a description there so they could put a note to you in that description probably um so that's nice that'll save and we'll just head back here um up the top here if i want to save this you'll notice that i'm logged in your students can make accounts really quickly and they'll have an account to save it so i'm going to hit save when i hit save i get a couple more options update update just does save on something that's already saved i can fork something so i can make a copy of it that i can then edit but i'll still have the old copy i also have tidy up so as your students are learning html and css they may not have the best practices in terms of keeping their code neat and tidy but one of the things that jsfiddle does for you is it'll clean it up and make it look a little bit nicer so if you saw as i hit that some of the stuff moved around and just spaced out a little bit nicer and makes it easier to read this j s hint button up the top will help you out if something in your program is not running well um take a look at that we're going to look at collaboration mode in a sec but i just want to show you share so up the top here under share i can grab a share link i can share a full screen result so let's take a look what that looks like so i'm going to copy this and open it in a new window and now i can actually test out and see my um web page in a full window that's what it would look like and show up like in a full window so students can test that out and not just in this little tiny window you can also embed these so if you want to show off what your students are doing in your own web page you can embed their web pages inside um so that's pretty cool and so now i just want to show you the collaboration mode this is one of the reasons that i absolutely love jsfiddle um so brooke's going to help me out with this i'm going to click collaboration hopefully it will pop up yep so you'll see that over here on the right hand side of my screen it popped up and said i can invite a friend so i'm gonna share this link with brooke we have over our chat that we have and so i just i just sent her the link and so she's gonna join me and you'll see friendly fox has now joined the session so um brooke join me and she can now actually type and add things to my project so if you watch my screen you'll see that brooke is typing and she just added a paragraph and she can then run it and we can see that she's added something so i didn't do anything i didn't add or touch the code but she can add things and we can work together um we can actually chat so we i could type messages to her so brooke do you want to type a message to me so we can see how that works so you see that brook can type messages to me there's also an audio feature which is newer um and it's still i think in beta mode but it's worth having your students try if they want to talk to each other as well i'm not going to do that right now because i don't think it will work very well while we're on a video call up and there brooke changed her name so now she is actually brooke so that's a pretty cool feature um as anyone's ever wanted to have their students work together on a project but they had to go home at the end of the night one of them had the project on their computer and they couldn't work together and they're trying to talk over the phone and they can't see each other's screen this is a really helpful tool to make that happen so it's one of my favorite features and i'm glad we got to share it with you so let's head back oh one last thing if i click on my name up here i can go up to my dashboard and you'll see that like everything that i've created is listed here so if you're wondering how do students save their stuff they can um they go to their dashboard and that's where it gets saved so if you're looking for that that's where it is all right so let me head back to uh chat and stop sharing and i that's the jsfiddle intro i would be happy to answer any questions that may have come up while i was sharing that does anybody have any thing they want to talk about or ask about jsfiddle brook there melissa do you have something um all right so there's also an intro to jsfiddle in the online pd so if you are looking for that take um a look through that and that will step you through a couple pieces of how jsfiddle works there as well yeah um i got booted out of the room quickly but there was a question in the chat pod about well a statement more about how new teachers might want to take some time to play with jsfiddle before introducing it to students do you have any tips for people who are completely new to programming or to web design i mean sure so my suggestion is to just find um you can so the ecs curriculum links to ww3 schools and we have some links to that in our pd um that's one way to learn about different pieces and probably the best thing to do is just to copy some code from w3schools into jsfiddle and run it and see what happens and maybe delete some lines and see what happens um i really love uh khan academy um there's other things that work just like khan academy but khan academy will has video demos that walk you through different topics in html and css so those are really great if you're new as well and you can try programming the different little tasks they have you do in jsfiddle if you want um so that you get comfortable with that platform along the way so those are always good ways to do it but the biggest thing with computer science is to just be okay with the fact that you may not always know every little detail right even when i teach a programming language i've known for a couple years or multiple years right i don't always know everything about that language and my students often find something i didn't know and teach me something along the way so be prepared to learn something and not always know everything computer science is such a fast changing subject you can't know it all because tomorrow it changes and is completely different so um that's a big piece of it so just accept where you're at and learn along with your students if that's going to be the best thing for you this year it won't be a big deal your students will still learn the html and css i have faith any other questions julie tells us in the chat pod that she's actually introducing html to younger students in fifth grade i'm wondering if you have any tips for introducing this outside of the high school classroom yeah sure um fifth grade that's awesome that we got fourth and fifth graders that might be learning it um i worked with middle schoolers and had them do html and css and i really think that it's something that's approachable at a lot of different ages and that's why it's one of the intros for uh ecs it's the starting place because it has such a low bar entry point and it's so creative so students at a lot of different ages can learn it um i know that pencil code has created something that has a little bit of more of a block base for html and css so if you're teaching at any younger age that might be something worth considering um but that lots of students especially if they have some intro to programming at some level we'll pick it up and enjoy html i think it's a great intro at multiple ages that's great i think that my students that i taught in high school had a bit a lot of reading challenges and learning differences so i think having that option of doing black black based even for older students is a great idea yeah all right there any other questions tonight ah so it looks like luanne has a question about where the online pd is so um the link should have been sent out to you for online pd from our ops team our operations team um and we'll actually at the end of these slides uh there's a link to a forum post where i post links to different things um updates and information so i'll put the links to uh online pd there for you if you need them luain and we had someone put them in the chat pod too so if anyone needs them later they'll be up there sorry danny i just i wanted to add to that once the as a as a teacher in our program once the the pde has been assigned to you it will show up on your teacher dashboard every time you log in so uh when you log into codestudio just at studio.co.org along with whatever classes you're teaching right now you'll also see whatever pd has been assigned to you so you shouldn't have to remember the url it should just be there for you when you log in awesome thank you all right so let's close out so can you go to the next slide one after that all right so we've been doing these monthly webinars for you the past couple months but um we found out recently that ecs is holding uh ecs specific webinars on the cs 10k community there's actually one next tuesday um and that schedule can be found on the cs10 community.org and what we're going to do is actually try and merge with them so that you can get content and ask questions from the curriculum writers themselves so you'll get to interact with them and other ecs teachers outside of the code.org community we're going to work towards that as our main point of webinars but we'll still be sharing different resources with you and we'll post videos to the forum if there's something we need to update you about uh as always we'll send emails and give you um updates that way as well so hopefully those uh the cs10k ecs webinars will be helpful to you and you can ask those questions that you see coming up in your classroom anything else so as i mentioned before um you can see here and i'm sorry that it's a long link we should bitly make it easier but on the forum you can find this under the general resources for the ecs um it's the ecs monthly meeting for november forum post and we'll put any resources or links that you might need from this call there it um i think we need to update it with the js fiddle link and um the ecs online pd links based on what people were asking about we have anything else melissa that you've noticed in the chatbot nope i don't think so i think we're in good shape um so thanks everyone for joining us and we'll see you next month all right bye guys thank you thanks everyone
