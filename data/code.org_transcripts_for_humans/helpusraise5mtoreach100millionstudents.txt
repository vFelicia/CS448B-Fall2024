00:03 - I started learning computer programming
00:04 - when I was 10 years old because my dad
00:07 - brought a computer home uh it was a
00:09 - Commodore 64 and he gave it to me and my
00:11 - twin brother and he told us you know
00:13 - this doesn't have any games on it so you
00:14 - need to learn to write your own games
00:16 - figure out how to program the computer
00:18 - yourselves I would not have tried
00:20 - learning computer programming or
00:21 - computer science if it hadn't been for
00:23 - the computer that my dad gave me because
00:25 - my school didn't teach it and thanks to
00:27 - what I learned on my own it opened up a
00:29 - world of opportunity for me and this is
00:31 - an opportunity that isn't something that
00:33 - just a few people should be able to have
00:36 - but today 30 years later 90% of our
00:39 - schools still don't teach basic computer
00:41 - science which means 90% of kids don't
00:43 - have the access to participate in a
00:45 - world that is being turned upside down
00:47 - by technology our schools teach kids how
00:49 - to dissect a frog and how the weather
00:51 - works but today it's equally fundamental
00:53 - to learn how to dissect an app or how
00:55 - the internet
00:56 - works last year code.org organized a
00:59 - Grassroots campaign cign to teach kids
01:01 - just 1 hour of code and since then we've
01:03 - taught 40 million students in 200
01:05 - countries but learning goes Way Beyond
01:07 - the first hour we've now put full
01:09 - courses into 30,000 classrooms and we've
01:12 - trained almost a th000 new computer
01:14 - science teachers our goal this year is
01:16 - to train 10,000 computer science
01:18 - teachers and to get 100 million students
01:20 - to try one hour of code across all
01:23 - grades worldwide with your help it's
01:26 - going to cost $5 million to do this now
01:29 - we've built Fant fantastic courses that
01:31 - students and teachers love but we need
01:33 - support to bring these courses to
01:34 - classrooms and to train teachers to
01:37 - integrate them into the curriculum to
01:38 - provide imperson training for teachers
01:40 - and to get computer science added to the
01:42 - course schedule oh my
01:44 - gosh who it has to move three steps has
01:48 - to turn right and then it has to go
01:50 - straight again oh my gosh it's working I
01:52 - did it they don't even have to be a
01:55 - computer science engineer maybe they
01:57 - want to do something else but in our
01:59 - world this is going to be the basis for
02:02 - everything that we do there is nothing
02:04 - more important than our young people's
02:07 - futures hour of code and code.org are
02:10 - giving our youth the ability to prosper
02:13 - in the Modern Age generous donors such
02:16 - as Microsoft Google salesforce.com Bill
02:19 - Gates and Reed Hoffman have committed to
02:20 - match your donations so for each dollar
02:23 - you give two students will learn one boy
02:26 - and one girl everybody knows the
02:28 - technology is moving fast it shouldn't
02:30 - be passing Us by and the idea that 90%
02:33 - of our schools aren't even preparing our
02:35 - kids for the future just isn't right we
02:37 - can fix this and we are fixing it but a
02:40 - sea change in education takes a critical
02:42 - mass of people who care please join this
02:45 - movement contribute today and share this
02:47 - video with a friend please help give
02:49 - every student the opportunity to pursue
02:51 - some of the best jobs in the world and
02:53 - to succeed in any future career thank
02:55 - you so much for your help
