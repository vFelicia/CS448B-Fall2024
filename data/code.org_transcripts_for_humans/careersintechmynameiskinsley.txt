00:07 - my name is kinsley i work at facebook as
00:09 - a software engineer the goal of facebook
00:11 - is to make the world a more open and
00:12 - connected place
00:14 - i work on the safe relator team which
00:16 - lets you save uh cool things you find on
00:18 - the internet like videos posts things
00:20 - like that so you can come back to them
00:21 - later i like working at facebook because
00:23 - i have to work with like a lot of smart
00:24 - people i get to work on something that
00:26 - like over a billion people use on the
00:28 - planet i just enjoy work my co-workers
00:31 - having device team members is also
00:32 - important because especially like
00:34 - facebook where you're trying to make a
00:36 - product for um the whole world you can't
00:38 - have like just a single set of people
00:40 - you want you want to represent the
00:42 - people you're trying to serve
00:44 - you may use facebook one way but someone
00:46 - could be using it completely differently
00:47 - or people are in different situations so
00:48 - like not everyone has like the newest
00:51 - smartphone you might have to remember
00:52 - that there's people in like other
00:54 - countries and lower end devices you have
00:55 - to make sure it works for them i like
00:56 - that it sort of scratches that like
00:58 - problem-solving part of my brain so i
01:00 - get to come in and just sort of think
01:02 - about how to do something then get to
01:04 - see if my idea works or not
01:06 - um computer's really good at telling you
01:08 - really quickly if uh something's gonna
01:10 - work or not
01:13 - probably my first job i remember wanting
01:15 - to have was i want to be an astronaut
01:17 - i went to this summer program when i was
01:19 - like in third or fourth grade
01:21 - and someone there taught me how to use
01:23 - this um old programming language called
01:25 - hypercard and with that i made like a
01:28 - really basic game where you built like a
01:30 - little ship and like flew across the
01:32 - solar system after that i like sort of
01:34 - just played around with computers a
01:35 - little bit
01:36 - i was lucky my high school had a
01:38 - programming class so i'd like to learn
01:39 - more about
01:41 - programming there
01:42 - a career in tech is attainable by anyone
01:45 - all you really need to get started is
01:46 - just a computer
01:47 - you don't have to start large you can
01:49 - make something super small i made like a
01:51 - game that only iu ever played or when i
01:54 - was in high school i made a like a
01:56 - program only i use that would like help
01:58 - me solve my math problems
02:00 - computer science is definitely a
02:01 - creative medium
02:03 - there's not like one way to solve a
02:04 - problem
02:05 - so it's up to you to sort of come up
02:06 - with the given your constraints that
02:09 - come up with the creative solution but
02:10 - probably the best way to get started is
02:11 - just uh you can try like emulating
02:13 - something you like like an app you like
02:15 - or a game or something make something
02:17 - just for yourself there's nothing really
02:18 - stopping you
02:26 - you
