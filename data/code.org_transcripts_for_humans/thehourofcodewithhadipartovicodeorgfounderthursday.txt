00:00 - everybody stay together hour of code
00:07 - that's awesome uh we're broadcasting
00:10 - this Live on YouTube as well so we're
00:12 - going to have a whole bunch of people
00:13 - sort of other classrooms around the
00:15 - world are going to be joining in and
00:16 - listening uh but there's about four
00:19 - classrooms there that can get to to see
00:21 - and talk with me uh live inside this
00:24 - sort of
00:25 - there's already a 15 other classrooms
00:27 - from around the world watching in on
00:29 - this as well uh actually now there's
00:31 - already 20 classrooms I expect we'll get
00:33 - up to about 50 or 100 other classrooms
00:35 - besides you all watching
00:38 - uh my name is Hadi I'm the the guy who
00:40 - created the hour of code uh this is
00:42 - something that started as an idea just
00:44 - three and a half years ago uh you know I
00:46 - started code.org because of the idea
00:48 - that every student in every school
00:50 - should have the opportunity to learn
00:52 - computer science uh this is a field that
00:55 - is changing everything around us uh you
00:57 - know whether you you play with apps or
01:00 - games on a phone uh or whether you play
01:03 - games on a tablet or a computer you
01:04 - start using technology but technology
01:07 - and computers have become much more than
01:08 - apps or phones they're changing things
01:11 - like transportation and cars
01:13 - communication entertainment banking
01:15 - shopping everything in the world around
01:18 - us is being changed by computers and
01:20 - Technology but our schools our schools
01:23 - don't teach how computers work they
01:26 - don't teach computer science or coding
01:28 - so the reason we started code.org in the
01:30 - hour of code is to help students in
01:33 - schools get access to this field all of
01:36 - you watching right now and there's
01:37 - there's now about 40 classrooms now here
01:39 - watching all of you are learning to code
01:41 - in your school but your parents never
01:43 - got a chance to do that your teachers
01:45 - never had a chance to do that this is
01:47 - the first generation of not only
01:49 - Americans but across the world it's the
01:51 - first generation of students that are
01:53 - getting to learn coding and computer
01:54 - science in school and the way this
01:57 - started was just with this very simple
01:58 - idea
01:59 - three and a half years ago I had this
02:02 - idea of what if you know since schools
02:04 - don't teach us what if every student in
02:07 - every classroom in every country in the
02:08 - world could just do one hour of computer
02:11 - science and coding
02:12 - if we started with one hour I bet the
02:14 - students will love it I bet the teachers
02:16 - will love it and then it can spread at
02:18 - three and a half years later that idea
02:21 - has exploded the hour of code has now
02:23 - reached 300 million hours have been done
02:26 - one out of every 10 students in the
02:29 - entire world has done the hour of code
02:31 - just right now we have about 40
02:34 - classrooms watching this but right at
02:37 - this moment over ten thousand classrooms
02:40 - right now are doing the hour of code in
02:42 - every single country from Florida to
02:45 - Alaska in this country but also
02:47 - worldwide from the southern tip of Chile
02:49 - Chile to the northernmost tip of Siberia
02:52 - in Africa they're doing it in Australia
02:55 - they're doing it in refugee camps in the
02:57 - Middle East
02:58 - students globally are doing the hour of
03:00 - code it's such an amazing thing to have
03:02 - started something that has grown big
03:04 - enough that it's being done globally and
03:07 - it's not just about one hour
03:10 - computer science starts with one hour
03:12 - everything starts with the first hour
03:13 - but the real point of it is after one
03:15 - hour you kind of get hooked you realize
03:17 - this is really fun and then you want to
03:19 - do a lot more than one hour and the real
03:21 - goal of the hour of code is to teach
03:22 - computer science in America's schools
03:25 - this campaign is just three years old
03:27 - and it's amazing how big it is the fact
03:29 - that it's gotten so big is really more
03:31 - than anything else thanks to the
03:33 - teachers worldwide but especially in the
03:35 - United States that have decided to take
03:38 - and embrace this idea of the hour of
03:39 - code so I just really wanted to give a
03:41 - thank you to all of the teachers out
03:43 - there if you're watching can you first
03:45 - say thank you and give a round of
03:47 - applause to your teachers so say thank
03:49 - you
03:55 - and the reason we're thanking the
03:57 - teachers is because your teachers never
03:59 - learned coding when they were in school
04:01 - themselves usually when your teachers
04:03 - are teaching you math or English it's
04:04 - teaching you something they've learned
04:06 - and they're having to take their own
04:08 - sort of jump to teach something that
04:09 - they're not necessarily good at and it's
04:12 - not easy to try to teach something you
04:13 - never learned and we're all learning in
04:15 - This Together uh
04:17 - you know since since I just started this
04:19 - is that I didn't want to just give a
04:20 - speech I wanted to let you guys ask some
04:23 - questions so uh why don't we have
04:25 - Angela's classroom ask a question
04:31 - okay
04:35 - and say your name and where you're from
04:38 - hi my name is Hunter and I'm
04:42 - I'm in fifth grade here at Discovery in
04:46 - Minnesota
04:48 - hi Hunter
04:49 - and my question is
04:53 - did you think that you would do stuff
04:55 - with computers when you got when you got
04:57 - older when you were in fifth grade
04:58 - actually that's a great question uh I
05:01 - started coding right around when I was
05:03 - your age uh I first started coding when
05:05 - I was 10 years old uh and you know I
05:07 - grew up in the Middle East in a country
05:09 - called Iran and I was living there
05:12 - actually during the war so literally my
05:14 - neighborhood was getting bombed every
05:15 - other night much like if you see on the
05:17 - news the stories of people getting
05:19 - bombed in Syria and my dad when they
05:22 - brought home a computer and he said you
05:24 - know here's your new toy but it doesn't
05:26 - have any apps it doesn't have any games
05:28 - but here's a book and you can teach
05:30 - yourself to code and if you get good at
05:32 - it then you can make your own apps and
05:33 - make your own games uh and I got you
05:36 - know I fell in love with it I was pretty
05:38 - much exactly your age and I got really
05:40 - good and then when I came to the United
05:42 - States you know my family was an
05:45 - immigrant family and we didn't have a
05:46 - lot of money but when I was about 13
05:49 - years old when my friends in school
05:50 - started you know getting jobs at
05:52 - restaurants gas stations I started
05:55 - getting internships of tech companies to
05:57 - help pay my way through school and
05:59 - University that I've always loved coding
06:01 - because it's fun because you get to
06:03 - create things you get to make whatever
06:04 - you want and you're just the right age
06:07 - to get started learning it
06:10 - we have one more question okay
06:13 - hi my name is City I'm here at Discovery
06:16 - in fifth grade I live in Minnesota my
06:19 - question is how did you feel when you
06:22 - created org
06:25 - uh
06:26 - creating code.org has been the best
06:28 - feeling in the entire world you know
06:30 - it's everybody likes to create things
06:33 - everybody likes to do things that have
06:34 - impact that that change the world a
06:36 - little bit you know even if you make
06:38 - something with silly putty out of clay
06:40 - or if you draw a picture and it's
06:42 - beautiful you feel proud of yourself you
06:45 - feel great that you made something that
06:47 - didn't exist until you made it uh
06:49 - I've I have this amazing fortune that
06:52 - I've made something that has touched a
06:54 - hundred million people in every single
06:56 - planet on Earth it's it's unbelievable
06:59 - there's there's nothing that that can
07:01 - possibly beat that it's I feel like the
07:03 - luckiest person in the world I have the
07:05 - coolest job in the world uh and really
07:07 - it's thank you it's thanks to the
07:08 - teachers and the schools that have
07:10 - decided that this idea is good enough
07:12 - that they welcome me into your
07:14 - classrooms and the the services and
07:16 - products and ideas we bring to get to
07:18 - change the schools of the entire world
07:20 - it's the coolest feeling ever
07:22 - yeah and I also want to say that if any
07:24 - of you decide you have an idea that you
07:26 - want to change the world by far the best
07:28 - way you can change the world is with
07:30 - coding and computer science obviously
07:32 - you can do lots of things in your life
07:34 - but if you want to do something that has
07:36 - the most impact that reaches the most
07:38 - people the best way you can do that is
07:40 - with coding and computer science because
07:42 - if you write a great app or a great
07:44 - website or a great service you can reach
07:46 - 100 million people with that and there's
07:48 - almost nothing else that can do
07:50 - do that right let's switch to leticia's
07:52 - classroom
08:02 - hello my name is
08:07 - hello my name is Danielle and I live in
08:10 - California
08:11 - when you are saying that you got your
08:13 - computer from
08:15 - your dad
08:17 - when you got your computer from your gas
08:19 - and your dad was saying so make your own
08:21 - apps and games what was your first app
08:23 - or game that you made
08:26 - that's a great question uh and hi there
08:28 - and hi to the classroom from California
08:30 - I'm in California today as well uh the
08:33 - first code I wrote was just really
08:35 - simple you know just like if you do the
08:37 - hour of code if you think what's the
08:39 - very first two lines of code you write
08:40 - with with code.org stuff it's usually
08:43 - move forward move forward turn left and
08:46 - that's it it's not it's not really
08:47 - special so the very first app that I
08:50 - made was in the programming language
08:52 - called basic and all it did is it said
08:55 - hello I just asked the computer to say
08:57 - hello and the computer said hello and I
08:59 - was like great
09:00 - but then you could say repeat 10 times
09:03 - say hello and then the computer said
09:04 - hello 10 times and then like any kid I
09:07 - was you know 10 years old I said repeat
09:08 - ten thousand times say hello and then
09:11 - the computer said hello 10 000 times in
09:13 - a row uh and that's really the power of
09:15 - seeing how computers work that you can
09:17 - tell it to do something 10 000 times or
09:19 - a hundred thousand times and it doesn't
09:20 - get tired uh the first real app I made
09:24 - that I can remember is I made an app
09:26 - that could play music because I love to
09:28 - play the piano uh and you know I was
09:32 - reasonably good at playing piano but I
09:33 - wrote an app where I could take the
09:35 - music of the piano pieces that I wanted
09:37 - to play and I would type the notes into
09:39 - the computer and then the computer would
09:41 - play the piano that I wanted to play
09:43 - back for me
09:45 - cool thank you thank you for your
09:47 - question
09:49 - Leticia does your classroom have any
09:50 - other questions
09:55 - hi this is Michelle mom from Chicago how
09:58 - are you
09:59 - hi there so we're at kindergarten class
10:02 - so I wanted everybody to just kind of
10:04 - say hello we had a couple who were
10:06 - actually a little bit of frightened to
10:07 - ask a question the two fighters
10:16 - so we're kindergarten class but I got
10:18 - the same traffic Academy in Chicago we
10:21 - had an earlier class I didn't have a few
10:23 - questions
10:42 - if I can
10:45 - all right I muted you guys because
10:46 - nobody else will be able to hear my
10:48 - answer so your question is why did I
10:50 - make this so much fun why did I put the
10:52 - fun pieces into code.org I would say the
10:54 - people standing right behind you those
10:56 - little kids are the reason I made it so
10:58 - much fun uh because you know learning
11:02 - itself is fun but just getting started
11:04 - you need a little bit of a push you know
11:06 - you don't start reading English by
11:08 - learning Shakespeare if you wanted to
11:10 - start learning English by reading
11:11 - Shakespeare it's really not that fun you
11:14 - start by reading fun stories and little
11:16 - easy stories and then you get into
11:18 - harder stories and then you know the
11:20 - biggest books you read at the end of
11:21 - high school are long and hard and you
11:23 - actually enjoy them but it takes some
11:25 - time to learn enough that you can enjoy
11:27 - those books similarly with coding if you
11:30 - wanted to jump into writing C plus plus
11:31 - or JavaScript the very first thing you'd
11:33 - say is oh my God this is too hard I
11:35 - can't do it if it's not fun but if you
11:37 - start by coding with Minecraft or Anna
11:40 - and Elsa or Moana or Star Wars the first
11:44 - experience you have is this is awesome
11:46 - and I want to do more of it and then
11:48 - over time you can do the harder stuff
11:50 - quick show of hands how many people
11:52 - there have done either the Frozen Star
11:54 - Wars Minecraft or Moana tutorials for
11:56 - the hour of code
11:59 - a lot of you have done those right let's
12:01 - go back to leticia's classroom because I
12:04 - there's a student there waiting to ask a
12:06 - question
12:11 - um hi my name is Zach and I'm from
12:13 - California and
12:16 - were you introduced to any technology
12:18 - before the computer like you like were
12:20 - interested before but
12:22 - sure before I started doing computer
12:24 - programming uh I started actually doing
12:26 - what using what's called a programmable
12:28 - calculator uh which is like the lamest
12:31 - computer you could possibly program on
12:32 - uh you know because it was a calculator
12:34 - had like 20 buttons and it could just
12:36 - show numbers that's it but I started
12:39 - making really simple programs that could
12:41 - count from one to ten so just the
12:43 - calculator would say one two three four
12:45 - five six seven eight nine ten and that
12:47 - was like my program
12:49 - um but you know this was in the 1980s so
12:51 - the technology that you could have
12:52 - growing up in Iran was pretty limited
12:54 - you guys are also lucky guys and girls
12:57 - are so lucky to have so much technology
12:59 - at your disposal the fact that there's
13:01 - smartphones and tablets and computers
13:04 - and every one of you growing up is going
13:06 - to have one or more of those things you
13:08 - are so lucky but that also means you'll
13:10 - have the experience every one of you to
13:12 - learn how to create not just use the
13:14 - technology and that's really what this
13:16 - is about
13:17 - all right let's switch to Michael's
13:18 - classroom
13:21 - hi there
13:24 - I'm Eva I'm in third grade and my
13:28 - question is what was your favorite thing
13:30 - about
13:32 - my favorite thing about what
13:36 - um you know my favorite thing about
13:37 - coding is the creativity uh and you know
13:41 - the fact that you can think of your own
13:43 - ideas and then bring them to life and
13:45 - make it the way you want it to be and in
13:47 - fact you know if you if you do the hour
13:49 - of code some of those activities are
13:51 - creative some of them are less creative
13:52 - so for example you know the Moana
13:55 - tutorial if you use that you're solving
13:58 - puzzles trying to get Moana to the fish
13:59 - or together past the uh you know the
14:02 - little bad guys but at every single time
14:05 - you're solving the puzzle you're doing
14:06 - what the what you know what Moana is
14:09 - supposed to do but if you use the Frozen
14:11 - uh tutorial or the Minecraft tutorial or
14:14 - the Star Wars tutorial or the Flappy
14:16 - Bird tutorial you can make your own
14:18 - rules you can completely change it you
14:21 - know if you if you use the Minecraft
14:22 - tutorial you can make the the Sheep lay
14:25 - gold instead of eggs you can make this
14:27 - I'm sorry you can make the chickens lay
14:29 - gold you can make the sheep chase
14:31 - zombies your ability to make the world
14:33 - what you want it to be is what I like
14:36 - the most because most of the time when
14:38 - you're living in the world you have to
14:39 - follow the rules whereas when you're
14:41 - coding you can make your own rules and
14:43 - there's almost nothing else where you
14:44 - get to make your own rules I think it's
14:46 - kind of fun to make your own rules
14:49 - and thank you so much uh let's switch to
14:53 - I'm not sure who this next classroom is
14:56 - Mrs
14:57 - somebody
14:58 - Mrs E moan I think
15:04 - Mrs Monroe oh
15:08 - hi hi
15:12 - um we had our questions written out and
15:14 - you've kind of answered some of them but
15:16 - we'll see if you have a different answer
15:17 - go ahead Julia hi my name is Joanna and
15:20 - I'm here from New Jersey why do you
15:22 - think it is important for kids to learn
15:24 - how to code
15:25 - that's a really great question uh and
15:27 - it's so cool to see students from
15:29 - Minnesota to New Jersey to California
15:32 - all during the hour of code and I also
15:34 - wanted to say
15:35 - kids are doing this in every single
15:37 - country so it's not just in this country
15:39 - and that's what's so incredible about
15:41 - this uh so you know these these video
15:43 - chats are worth with students living in
15:45 - America partly because we all speak
15:47 - English and we're all in the same time
15:49 - zone but just earlier today in in Great
15:52 - Britain in France in Germany in Italy
15:55 - students were doing the hour of code and
15:56 - then earlier than that in Russia and in
15:58 - Japan it's kind of amazing
16:01 - um and so the question you asked is why
16:03 - is this important why are we learning to
16:04 - code
16:06 - um you know the fundamental reason is
16:08 - school is supposed to teach you how the
16:09 - world works and it's supposed to teach
16:11 - you how to learn uh and you know in
16:14 - school you learn things like how plants
16:17 - make fruits uh you know how plants make
16:19 - sugar using the leaves from water you
16:22 - learn how electricity works you learn
16:24 - all these things about the different
16:25 - parts of the world but School
16:27 - traditionally doesn't teach how
16:28 - technology works it doesn't teach how
16:30 - computers work and if you look at the
16:32 - world around us everybody is using
16:34 - computers and it's changing our world in
16:37 - so many different ways it's not just
16:39 - changing the world like the games you
16:41 - play You Know the Way technology is
16:43 - changing the world the future of
16:44 - medicine is going to be about technology
16:46 - today when you look at when you go to a
16:48 - doctor the doctor when he wants to find
16:50 - out what's wrong with you he or she will
16:53 - will look inside your eye and look
16:55 - inside your ear and bang on your knee
16:57 - and they're trying to find out what's
16:59 - going on inside your body you can't find
17:01 - out what's going on inside the body by
17:03 - banging on the knee in the future a
17:05 - doctor is going to get a pinprick of you
17:06 - put in a computer the computer will
17:09 - analyze the blood look at all the genes
17:12 - inside the blood compare them with a
17:13 - database and then just say here's the
17:15 - disease and here's the Cure and that's
17:17 - just one example of how all of medicine
17:19 - is going to be changed because of
17:21 - computers medicine is changing Commerce
17:24 - is changing transportation is changing
17:26 - agriculture is changing already today
17:29 - almost all the farms in this country are
17:32 - going to and worldwide will change
17:33 - because the tractors are going to start
17:36 - driving themselves and somebody who
17:38 - wants to be a farmer today they need to
17:40 - drive the tractor tomorrow they'll need
17:42 - to code the tractor and just like you
17:45 - say you go to to an Anna and Elsa or
17:47 - Angry Bird to move forward turn left the
17:50 - farmers of Tomorrow are going to be
17:51 - tying the tractor move forward move left
17:53 - you know go all the way to the fence and
17:55 - then take a ride and then take a left
17:56 - and the job of farming is going to be
17:59 - more like coding so the reason to learn
18:01 - it is to understand how our world works
18:04 - today and to be prepared for all the
18:06 - changes that will happen in the jobs of
18:08 - the future
18:10 - you guys have another question there
18:15 - yes
18:17 - um
18:20 - which of the puzzles are you most proud
18:23 - of
18:25 - but my most proud of
18:27 - um you know it's so amazing by the way
18:29 - to have been in charge of building these
18:31 - these you know puzzles and tutorials you
18:34 - know it started with our Angry Birds and
18:35 - Plants versus Zombies stuffed and Flappy
18:37 - Bird Minecraft Moana Star Wars uh Frozen
18:41 - all these different tutorials we've made
18:43 - uh and it's amazing that they've been
18:45 - used literally by a hundred million
18:46 - people I mean just to put that in
18:48 - perspective a hundred million people
18:51 - have used our puzzles that's more than
18:52 - all of the students in the United States
18:55 - plus all of the students in Italy France
18:58 - Germany Paris most of Europe add up all
19:00 - of those students that's about 70
19:02 - million people we've had 100 million
19:04 - people use these puzzles my personal
19:06 - favorite is the Star Wars puzzles
19:09 - um but that's just because it's mine and
19:10 - there's there's the reason I like that
19:12 - is because I grew up as a Star Wars fan
19:14 - when I was little when I was uh you know
19:16 - 10 or so and I had never even seen the
19:19 - movies because I lived in Iran and we
19:21 - didn't actually have access to movies uh
19:23 - but I had gotten the books so I read
19:25 - book about the movies and I was like oh
19:27 - these these movies must be so great and
19:29 - one day I'll get to live in America and
19:30 - see them uh and so the fact that I could
19:33 - not only come to America and see the
19:35 - movies but then make the coding game
19:37 - based on the movies and then launch that
19:40 - as part of the new Star Wars movie
19:42 - launched last year was the biggest movie
19:43 - launch of all time and code.org was part
19:46 - of that movie launch for the new hour of
19:48 - code tutorial that was one of the most
19:49 - special things I could do
19:52 - let's switch to Nicole's classroom
19:54 - because we may be running out of time
20:02 - from uh West High School in Utah
20:06 - hi Richard
20:07 - uh my question is how many hours did it
20:10 - take to make hour of code
20:13 - that's a great question
20:14 - um well you know
20:16 - the strongest thing about hi uh the
20:19 - strongest thing about the hour of code
20:20 - isn't what we've made it's just the idea
20:23 - uh you know you can make lots of things
20:25 - you can make a car you can make a
20:27 - painting you can make an app but one of
20:30 - the most incredible things you can make
20:31 - is an idea and I remember very well it
20:35 - was June 27th of 2013 three and a half
20:38 - years ago when the idea for the hour of
20:40 - code kind of came together and I
20:42 - immediately knew this is the best idea I
20:44 - will ever have in my life I literally
20:46 - started calling people saying I just had
20:48 - the best idea ever that we're just going
20:50 - to get every student in the world to do
20:52 - just one hour of code and that the
20:54 - reason that idea is is important is
20:57 - because even if we hadn't made the
20:59 - tutorials even if we hadn't done all the
21:01 - pieces we've done
21:03 - teachers Educators politicians
21:05 - celebrities parents everybody has agreed
21:09 - that this is a good idea and the success
21:10 - of the hour of code isn't because of
21:12 - what we've done the success of the hour
21:14 - of code is because of all the people
21:16 - who've decided this is such a great idea
21:18 - we want to make it happen the fact that
21:20 - in Russia the minister of education has
21:23 - said it's a rule that every school in
21:25 - Russia must do the hour of code
21:27 - in an island in the Indian Ocean they've
21:30 - decided that every single mom dad child
21:34 - teacher every single member of the
21:36 - entire island has done the hour of code
21:37 - that's not because of anything
21:39 - I've done in terms of how many hours
21:41 - I've put into it it's just because it's
21:42 - such a great idea now in terms of the
21:45 - tutorials we make you know we have a
21:47 - team at code.org that works very hard on
21:49 - making the hour of code tutorials on the
21:51 - marketing on the event kits uh so and
21:54 - it's one of the you know I've I've
21:55 - worked the hardest I've ever worked over
21:57 - the last three years to make this
21:58 - campaign a success but the true success
22:01 - of the campaign is because it's an idea
22:02 - that it's captured the imagination
22:04 - worldwide of Educators parents leaders
22:07 - and and even students
22:10 - and even in Utah uh Nicole does your
22:12 - classroom have another question yes we
22:15 - do thank you hello my name is Harley
22:17 - from West High School I'm in ninth grade
22:19 - and my question is what jobs do you see
22:22 - like coming up for computer science when
22:25 - I graduate
22:26 - I'm sure that's a great question
22:28 - um you know we and this is probably more
22:30 - relevant to the older students I'm
22:31 - guessing The Kindergartners there are
22:33 - not really thinking about the jobs when
22:35 - they graduate uh but you know we're
22:37 - living at a time when not just in
22:40 - America but around the world people are
22:41 - a little bit worried about jobs uh you
22:44 - know we just went through an election
22:45 - that was a big deal for this country and
22:48 - a huge theme of this election was jobs
22:50 - and people worrying about will they get
22:52 - to keep their jobs or have they lost
22:54 - their jobs or so on and the reason for
22:56 - that is the jobs in this country and the
22:58 - rest of the world are changing uh the
23:00 - one good thing to know is almost every
23:03 - other field is is a little worried about
23:04 - the jobs the computer science field has
23:07 - the most jobs and the highest paying
23:09 - jobs in the country and it's not just
23:11 - jobs as coders right by there uh it's
23:15 - jobs in every field from medicine to
23:17 - transportation to to agriculture to
23:19 - entertainment all the jobs in the future
23:22 - are going to involve some amount of
23:23 - coding in computer science so please
23:25 - stick with it uh while that classroom
23:28 - prepares to leave I'll just give some
23:29 - closing remarks I just wanted to say
23:30 - thank you all for joining me thank you
23:33 - for participating in the hour of code
23:34 - getting to created something that has
23:36 - reached every span of the earth and so
23:39 - many students has been the most
23:40 - delightful personal experience and it's
23:42 - thanks more than anything else to all
23:44 - the teachers the Educators who've
23:46 - basically taken this campaign and made
23:48 - it what it is uh there's about 40
23:50 - classrooms watching this but over 10 000
23:53 - other classrooms that are coding right
23:54 - now just in the in the 20 minutes we've
23:57 - spoken almost a hundred thousand
23:59 - students have done the hour of code uh
24:01 - so thank you all for doing this and give
24:03 - another round of applause for your
24:05 - teachers and goodbye
24:09 - [Music]
24:15 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

everybody stay together hour of code that's awesome uh we're broadcasting this Live on YouTube as well so we're going to have a whole bunch of people sort of other classrooms around the world are going to be joining in and listening uh but there's about four classrooms there that can get to to see and talk with me uh live inside this sort of there's already a 15 other classrooms from around the world watching in on this as well uh actually now there's already 20 classrooms I expect we'll get up to about 50 or 100 other classrooms besides you all watching uh my name is Hadi I'm the the guy who created the hour of code uh this is something that started as an idea just three and a half years ago uh you know I started code.org because of the idea that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science uh this is a field that is changing everything around us uh you know whether you you play with apps or games on a phone uh or whether you play games on a tablet or a computer you start using technology but technology and computers have become much more than apps or phones they're changing things like transportation and cars communication entertainment banking shopping everything in the world around us is being changed by computers and Technology but our schools our schools don't teach how computers work they don't teach computer science or coding so the reason we started code.org in the hour of code is to help students in schools get access to this field all of you watching right now and there's there's now about 40 classrooms now here watching all of you are learning to code in your school but your parents never got a chance to do that your teachers never had a chance to do that this is the first generation of not only Americans but across the world it's the first generation of students that are getting to learn coding and computer science in school and the way this started was just with this very simple idea three and a half years ago I had this idea of what if you know since schools don't teach us what if every student in every classroom in every country in the world could just do one hour of computer science and coding if we started with one hour I bet the students will love it I bet the teachers will love it and then it can spread at three and a half years later that idea has exploded the hour of code has now reached 300 million hours have been done one out of every 10 students in the entire world has done the hour of code just right now we have about 40 classrooms watching this but right at this moment over ten thousand classrooms right now are doing the hour of code in every single country from Florida to Alaska in this country but also worldwide from the southern tip of Chile Chile to the northernmost tip of Siberia in Africa they're doing it in Australia they're doing it in refugee camps in the Middle East students globally are doing the hour of code it's such an amazing thing to have started something that has grown big enough that it's being done globally and it's not just about one hour computer science starts with one hour everything starts with the first hour but the real point of it is after one hour you kind of get hooked you realize this is really fun and then you want to do a lot more than one hour and the real goal of the hour of code is to teach computer science in America's schools this campaign is just three years old and it's amazing how big it is the fact that it's gotten so big is really more than anything else thanks to the teachers worldwide but especially in the United States that have decided to take and embrace this idea of the hour of code so I just really wanted to give a thank you to all of the teachers out there if you're watching can you first say thank you and give a round of applause to your teachers so say thank you and the reason we're thanking the teachers is because your teachers never learned coding when they were in school themselves usually when your teachers are teaching you math or English it's teaching you something they've learned and they're having to take their own sort of jump to teach something that they're not necessarily good at and it's not easy to try to teach something you never learned and we're all learning in This Together uh you know since since I just started this is that I didn't want to just give a speech I wanted to let you guys ask some questions so uh why don't we have Angela's classroom ask a question okay and say your name and where you're from hi my name is Hunter and I'm I'm in fifth grade here at Discovery in Minnesota hi Hunter and my question is did you think that you would do stuff with computers when you got when you got older when you were in fifth grade actually that's a great question uh I started coding right around when I was your age uh I first started coding when I was 10 years old uh and you know I grew up in the Middle East in a country called Iran and I was living there actually during the war so literally my neighborhood was getting bombed every other night much like if you see on the news the stories of people getting bombed in Syria and my dad when they brought home a computer and he said you know here's your new toy but it doesn't have any apps it doesn't have any games but here's a book and you can teach yourself to code and if you get good at it then you can make your own apps and make your own games uh and I got you know I fell in love with it I was pretty much exactly your age and I got really good and then when I came to the United States you know my family was an immigrant family and we didn't have a lot of money but when I was about 13 years old when my friends in school started you know getting jobs at restaurants gas stations I started getting internships of tech companies to help pay my way through school and University that I've always loved coding because it's fun because you get to create things you get to make whatever you want and you're just the right age to get started learning it we have one more question okay hi my name is City I'm here at Discovery in fifth grade I live in Minnesota my question is how did you feel when you created org uh creating code.org has been the best feeling in the entire world you know it's everybody likes to create things everybody likes to do things that have impact that that change the world a little bit you know even if you make something with silly putty out of clay or if you draw a picture and it's beautiful you feel proud of yourself you feel great that you made something that didn't exist until you made it uh I've I have this amazing fortune that I've made something that has touched a hundred million people in every single planet on Earth it's it's unbelievable there's there's nothing that that can possibly beat that it's I feel like the luckiest person in the world I have the coolest job in the world uh and really it's thank you it's thanks to the teachers and the schools that have decided that this idea is good enough that they welcome me into your classrooms and the the services and products and ideas we bring to get to change the schools of the entire world it's the coolest feeling ever yeah and I also want to say that if any of you decide you have an idea that you want to change the world by far the best way you can change the world is with coding and computer science obviously you can do lots of things in your life but if you want to do something that has the most impact that reaches the most people the best way you can do that is with coding and computer science because if you write a great app or a great website or a great service you can reach 100 million people with that and there's almost nothing else that can do do that right let's switch to leticia's classroom hello my name is hello my name is Danielle and I live in California when you are saying that you got your computer from your dad when you got your computer from your gas and your dad was saying so make your own apps and games what was your first app or game that you made that's a great question uh and hi there and hi to the classroom from California I'm in California today as well uh the first code I wrote was just really simple you know just like if you do the hour of code if you think what's the very first two lines of code you write with with code.org stuff it's usually move forward move forward turn left and that's it it's not it's not really special so the very first app that I made was in the programming language called basic and all it did is it said hello I just asked the computer to say hello and the computer said hello and I was like great but then you could say repeat 10 times say hello and then the computer said hello 10 times and then like any kid I was you know 10 years old I said repeat ten thousand times say hello and then the computer said hello 10 000 times in a row uh and that's really the power of seeing how computers work that you can tell it to do something 10 000 times or a hundred thousand times and it doesn't get tired uh the first real app I made that I can remember is I made an app that could play music because I love to play the piano uh and you know I was reasonably good at playing piano but I wrote an app where I could take the music of the piano pieces that I wanted to play and I would type the notes into the computer and then the computer would play the piano that I wanted to play back for me cool thank you thank you for your question Leticia does your classroom have any other questions hi this is Michelle mom from Chicago how are you hi there so we're at kindergarten class so I wanted everybody to just kind of say hello we had a couple who were actually a little bit of frightened to ask a question the two fighters so we're kindergarten class but I got the same traffic Academy in Chicago we had an earlier class I didn't have a few questions if I can all right I muted you guys because nobody else will be able to hear my answer so your question is why did I make this so much fun why did I put the fun pieces into code.org I would say the people standing right behind you those little kids are the reason I made it so much fun uh because you know learning itself is fun but just getting started you need a little bit of a push you know you don't start reading English by learning Shakespeare if you wanted to start learning English by reading Shakespeare it's really not that fun you start by reading fun stories and little easy stories and then you get into harder stories and then you know the biggest books you read at the end of high school are long and hard and you actually enjoy them but it takes some time to learn enough that you can enjoy those books similarly with coding if you wanted to jump into writing C plus plus or JavaScript the very first thing you'd say is oh my God this is too hard I can't do it if it's not fun but if you start by coding with Minecraft or Anna and Elsa or Moana or Star Wars the first experience you have is this is awesome and I want to do more of it and then over time you can do the harder stuff quick show of hands how many people there have done either the Frozen Star Wars Minecraft or Moana tutorials for the hour of code a lot of you have done those right let's go back to leticia's classroom because I there's a student there waiting to ask a question um hi my name is Zach and I'm from California and were you introduced to any technology before the computer like you like were interested before but sure before I started doing computer programming uh I started actually doing what using what's called a programmable calculator uh which is like the lamest computer you could possibly program on uh you know because it was a calculator had like 20 buttons and it could just show numbers that's it but I started making really simple programs that could count from one to ten so just the calculator would say one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and that was like my program um but you know this was in the 1980s so the technology that you could have growing up in Iran was pretty limited you guys are also lucky guys and girls are so lucky to have so much technology at your disposal the fact that there's smartphones and tablets and computers and every one of you growing up is going to have one or more of those things you are so lucky but that also means you'll have the experience every one of you to learn how to create not just use the technology and that's really what this is about all right let's switch to Michael's classroom hi there I'm Eva I'm in third grade and my question is what was your favorite thing about my favorite thing about what um you know my favorite thing about coding is the creativity uh and you know the fact that you can think of your own ideas and then bring them to life and make it the way you want it to be and in fact you know if you if you do the hour of code some of those activities are creative some of them are less creative so for example you know the Moana tutorial if you use that you're solving puzzles trying to get Moana to the fish or together past the uh you know the little bad guys but at every single time you're solving the puzzle you're doing what the what you know what Moana is supposed to do but if you use the Frozen uh tutorial or the Minecraft tutorial or the Star Wars tutorial or the Flappy Bird tutorial you can make your own rules you can completely change it you know if you if you use the Minecraft tutorial you can make the the Sheep lay gold instead of eggs you can make this I'm sorry you can make the chickens lay gold you can make the sheep chase zombies your ability to make the world what you want it to be is what I like the most because most of the time when you're living in the world you have to follow the rules whereas when you're coding you can make your own rules and there's almost nothing else where you get to make your own rules I think it's kind of fun to make your own rules and thank you so much uh let's switch to I'm not sure who this next classroom is Mrs somebody Mrs E moan I think Mrs Monroe oh hi hi um we had our questions written out and you've kind of answered some of them but we'll see if you have a different answer go ahead Julia hi my name is Joanna and I'm here from New Jersey why do you think it is important for kids to learn how to code that's a really great question uh and it's so cool to see students from Minnesota to New Jersey to California all during the hour of code and I also wanted to say kids are doing this in every single country so it's not just in this country and that's what's so incredible about this uh so you know these these video chats are worth with students living in America partly because we all speak English and we're all in the same time zone but just earlier today in in Great Britain in France in Germany in Italy students were doing the hour of code and then earlier than that in Russia and in Japan it's kind of amazing um and so the question you asked is why is this important why are we learning to code um you know the fundamental reason is school is supposed to teach you how the world works and it's supposed to teach you how to learn uh and you know in school you learn things like how plants make fruits uh you know how plants make sugar using the leaves from water you learn how electricity works you learn all these things about the different parts of the world but School traditionally doesn't teach how technology works it doesn't teach how computers work and if you look at the world around us everybody is using computers and it's changing our world in so many different ways it's not just changing the world like the games you play You Know the Way technology is changing the world the future of medicine is going to be about technology today when you look at when you go to a doctor the doctor when he wants to find out what's wrong with you he or she will will look inside your eye and look inside your ear and bang on your knee and they're trying to find out what's going on inside your body you can't find out what's going on inside the body by banging on the knee in the future a doctor is going to get a pinprick of you put in a computer the computer will analyze the blood look at all the genes inside the blood compare them with a database and then just say here's the disease and here's the Cure and that's just one example of how all of medicine is going to be changed because of computers medicine is changing Commerce is changing transportation is changing agriculture is changing already today almost all the farms in this country are going to and worldwide will change because the tractors are going to start driving themselves and somebody who wants to be a farmer today they need to drive the tractor tomorrow they'll need to code the tractor and just like you say you go to to an Anna and Elsa or Angry Bird to move forward turn left the farmers of Tomorrow are going to be tying the tractor move forward move left you know go all the way to the fence and then take a ride and then take a left and the job of farming is going to be more like coding so the reason to learn it is to understand how our world works today and to be prepared for all the changes that will happen in the jobs of the future you guys have another question there yes um which of the puzzles are you most proud of but my most proud of um you know it's so amazing by the way to have been in charge of building these these you know puzzles and tutorials you know it started with our Angry Birds and Plants versus Zombies stuffed and Flappy Bird Minecraft Moana Star Wars uh Frozen all these different tutorials we've made uh and it's amazing that they've been used literally by a hundred million people I mean just to put that in perspective a hundred million people have used our puzzles that's more than all of the students in the United States plus all of the students in Italy France Germany Paris most of Europe add up all of those students that's about 70 million people we've had 100 million people use these puzzles my personal favorite is the Star Wars puzzles um but that's just because it's mine and there's there's the reason I like that is because I grew up as a Star Wars fan when I was little when I was uh you know 10 or so and I had never even seen the movies because I lived in Iran and we didn't actually have access to movies uh but I had gotten the books so I read book about the movies and I was like oh these these movies must be so great and one day I'll get to live in America and see them uh and so the fact that I could not only come to America and see the movies but then make the coding game based on the movies and then launch that as part of the new Star Wars movie launched last year was the biggest movie launch of all time and code.org was part of that movie launch for the new hour of code tutorial that was one of the most special things I could do let's switch to Nicole's classroom because we may be running out of time from uh West High School in Utah hi Richard uh my question is how many hours did it take to make hour of code that's a great question um well you know the strongest thing about hi uh the strongest thing about the hour of code isn't what we've made it's just the idea uh you know you can make lots of things you can make a car you can make a painting you can make an app but one of the most incredible things you can make is an idea and I remember very well it was June 27th of 2013 three and a half years ago when the idea for the hour of code kind of came together and I immediately knew this is the best idea I will ever have in my life I literally started calling people saying I just had the best idea ever that we're just going to get every student in the world to do just one hour of code and that the reason that idea is is important is because even if we hadn't made the tutorials even if we hadn't done all the pieces we've done teachers Educators politicians celebrities parents everybody has agreed that this is a good idea and the success of the hour of code isn't because of what we've done the success of the hour of code is because of all the people who've decided this is such a great idea we want to make it happen the fact that in Russia the minister of education has said it's a rule that every school in Russia must do the hour of code in an island in the Indian Ocean they've decided that every single mom dad child teacher every single member of the entire island has done the hour of code that's not because of anything I've done in terms of how many hours I've put into it it's just because it's such a great idea now in terms of the tutorials we make you know we have a team at code.org that works very hard on making the hour of code tutorials on the marketing on the event kits uh so and it's one of the you know I've I've worked the hardest I've ever worked over the last three years to make this campaign a success but the true success of the campaign is because it's an idea that it's captured the imagination worldwide of Educators parents leaders and and even students and even in Utah uh Nicole does your classroom have another question yes we do thank you hello my name is Harley from West High School I'm in ninth grade and my question is what jobs do you see like coming up for computer science when I graduate I'm sure that's a great question um you know we and this is probably more relevant to the older students I'm guessing The Kindergartners there are not really thinking about the jobs when they graduate uh but you know we're living at a time when not just in America but around the world people are a little bit worried about jobs uh you know we just went through an election that was a big deal for this country and a huge theme of this election was jobs and people worrying about will they get to keep their jobs or have they lost their jobs or so on and the reason for that is the jobs in this country and the rest of the world are changing uh the one good thing to know is almost every other field is is a little worried about the jobs the computer science field has the most jobs and the highest paying jobs in the country and it's not just jobs as coders right by there uh it's jobs in every field from medicine to transportation to to agriculture to entertainment all the jobs in the future are going to involve some amount of coding in computer science so please stick with it uh while that classroom prepares to leave I'll just give some closing remarks I just wanted to say thank you all for joining me thank you for participating in the hour of code getting to created something that has reached every span of the earth and so many students has been the most delightful personal experience and it's thanks more than anything else to all the teachers the Educators who've basically taken this campaign and made it what it is uh there's about 40 classrooms watching this but over 10 000 other classrooms that are coding right now just in the in the 20 minutes we've spoken almost a hundred thousand students have done the hour of code uh so thank you all for doing this and give another round of applause for your teachers and goodbye thank you
