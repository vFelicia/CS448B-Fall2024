00:24 - what computer science is is what's going
00:26 - to change the whole field of computer
00:28 - science
00:29 - computer science discoveries is a
00:31 - year-long computer science course that
00:33 - covers hardware and how computers work
00:35 - it covers some web development how do
00:37 - websites get made how do they get
00:39 - published you get to do some programming
00:41 - with video games we talk about socially
00:44 - impactful areas of computer science
00:48 - well it's fun because a lot of time you
00:49 - get to collaborate with other people
00:51 - and you also get to get some insight on
00:53 - other people's ideas
