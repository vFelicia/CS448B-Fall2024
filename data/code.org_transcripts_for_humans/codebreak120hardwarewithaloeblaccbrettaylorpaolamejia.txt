02:05 - hello and welcome to code break my name
02:07 - is hadi i'm the founder of code.org in
02:09 - the hour of code
02:11 - and we're joined by lots of students on
02:13 - zoom on facebook live and on youtube
02:16 - live
02:17 - together we're hoping to build the
02:18 - world's largest live interactive
02:19 - classroom
02:20 - this is for many of us the last week of
02:22 - school for some people school is already
02:24 - over that's sophie this is your last day
02:26 - of school right yeah um so this will
02:29 - also be our last day of code break and
02:31 - i'm here with my daughter and sidekick
02:33 - sophia who's a budding computer
02:35 - scientist
02:36 - uh i also want to start before we
02:38 - mention the episode to mention that
02:40 - today uh is
02:41 - being a day that's called by uh
02:44 - universities and researchers around the
02:45 - world as shut down stem day which is a
02:48 - movement organized by black organizers
02:50 - and researchers to call on workers and
02:52 - representatives in science technology
02:54 - and math fields to work towards
02:56 - anti-racism
02:58 - uh we're very fortunate at code.org to
03:00 - have the platform to speak with you all
03:01 - about it until as we hold our last code
03:04 - break episode as a way to reach our
03:05 - younger students and recognize the
03:07 - anti-black racism that exists in the
03:09 - world and in stem fields and we need to
03:11 - do the work as a larger stem community
03:13 - to fight for black lives and for more
03:15 - diversity in the field of computer
03:17 - science
03:19 - to start today's episode i want to
03:21 - introduce two of our special guests
03:23 - one is paula
03:26 - paola are you there with us
03:28 - i'm here hi honey thank you so much for
03:29 - having me
03:31 - hi it's great to see you paulo as a
03:33 - senior software engineer at microsoft
03:35 - she's going to be joining us for the
03:36 - later part of the episode but you'll see
03:38 - her on screen uh and our first special
03:40 - guest is singer and songwriter aloe
03:43 - blacc
03:46 - i'm doing great how are you
03:47 - it's great to see you alon uh where are
03:50 - you calling us from i am in from los
03:53 - angeles today
03:55 - all right
03:57 - are you still stuck at home or is la
03:59 - able yeah we are still in quarantine
04:03 - we only go out for essentials
04:05 - here in seattle we have some restaurants
04:08 - opening at limited capacity you know
04:10 - it's uh hopefully people
04:13 - more and more around the world will get
04:14 - a chance to to get out a little bit at
04:16 - least over the summer but the pandemic
04:18 - really has not stopped and this is a
04:20 - disease that's going to be coming back i
04:21 - believe in the fall and winter so uh
04:23 - it's been a rough time for all of us
04:25 - do you have any message to share with
04:27 - students who are at home uh whether the
04:29 - ones who've been studying and still in
04:30 - school or thinking about their plans for
04:32 - the summer
04:33 - yeah i think this is a great summer to
04:35 - find
04:36 - what you might
04:38 - be passionate about so explore a lot of
04:40 - different things and since we're here
04:42 - and and you're here at code break maybe
04:45 - this is your passion
04:46 - try to build something amazing come up
04:48 - with some great ideas
04:51 - that's wonderful
04:53 - so we're going to start today's episode
04:55 - with the computer science joke of the
04:56 - day with sophia so sophia you want to
04:58 - share your your joke okay what is an
05:00 - astronaut's favorite key on the computer
05:03 - board on the computer keyboard
05:08 - so
05:11 - astronaut's favorite
05:13 - key on the computer keyboard
05:17 - i would say
05:20 - return because he can't wait to get back
05:22 - home
05:23 - that's a good
05:25 - the answer is the space bar oh my
05:28 - goodness of course of course the space
05:30 - bar yeah
05:32 - i should have thought of that
05:33 - at code.org we write our own jokes and
05:35 - sophia actually wrote a new joke uh when
05:37 - we were practicing today's episode so
05:39 - she has a second joke that today we're
05:42 - learning about hardware so you want to
05:44 - say your hardware-related joke it's a
05:45 - little
05:47 - tricky but what does the cpu call its
05:50 - mother the is a part of the computer
05:57 - so what does the central processing unit
05:59 - call its mother
06:02 - oh my goodness
06:04 - i'm gonna go for
06:07 - board
06:09 - i feel pretty close it's the motherboard
06:12 - [Laughter]
06:14 - motherboard
06:16 - the motherboard is actually the
06:18 - board of silicon that the cpu is
06:20 - installed on so it's actually a physical
06:22 - part of the computer
06:23 - all right well uh we now met our special
06:26 - guests let's start by saying hello to
06:28 - our uh the rest of our audience so can
06:30 - we show all the audience on screen and
06:32 - allo if you don't see them all you can
06:33 - hit the gallery button and zoom which
06:35 - will be in your upper right hand corner
06:39 - so you can see everybody if we could
06:40 - unmute everybody to say hello
06:50 - [Music]
06:56 - and there's a lot more students as well
06:58 - if you want to see the audience on
07:00 - screen and i'm actually going to share
07:01 - my screen so you can see where people
07:03 - are calling us from
07:06 - so if you see my screen share
07:10 - we have can you all see the map i have
07:12 - here
07:16 - all right so we have audience members as
07:18 - they were joining in basically scanning
07:20 - a qr code and telling us where they're
07:21 - calling from uh aloe i don't know if you
07:24 - expected to see people calling from
07:26 - hawaii some of these are i think fake
07:28 - locations whoever put in greenland i'm
07:30 - guessing is not actually calling from
07:32 - the middle of greenland but we have
07:33 - students from south america from africa
07:36 - from australia india uh and these are
07:38 - live so for many of them they're calling
07:40 - from the their late night or very early
07:42 - morning
07:43 - that's pretty amazing it's a lot of
07:45 - people
07:46 - yeah it's a lot of students from all
07:47 - over trying to learn to code with us
07:49 - together so we're so excited to have you
07:51 - on for our very last code break
07:53 - as we go through this episode if you
07:55 - have questions uh
07:58 - please submit them at code.org questions
08:00 - we're not sure with three special guests
08:02 - this time we're not sure how many uh
08:04 - questions we'll be able to field but
08:06 - also since this is our last code break
08:08 - we're also going to spend some time
08:09 - thanking all the parents and so if you
08:11 - want to give a shout out to your mom or
08:12 - dad you can also go to code.org
08:14 - questions and and put a shout out over
08:16 - there for your mom and dad
08:19 - for today's episode we're going to be
08:20 - talking about hardware and we have three
08:23 - different parts to talk about first
08:25 - we're going to talk about input and
08:26 - output next we're going to talk about
08:28 - the parts inside of a computer and
08:30 - lastly we're going to do some
08:31 - programming using circuits
08:36 - so
08:37 - before we go on to go into some today's
08:39 - lessons i want to welcome some of the
08:40 - students to demo their creations from
08:43 - last week last week we challenged
08:45 - students to make your own sprite live
08:48 - game or app lab drawing using functions
08:50 - and also in the previous week we asked
08:52 - you to use
08:54 - ai and machine learning to train a
08:55 - computer to recognize information so
08:58 - allo we're going to welcome some
08:59 - students who are going to demo what they
09:01 - built for us and if you could uh check
09:03 - them out and and hear from them can we
09:05 - unmute nick
09:13 - hi can you hear me
09:14 - yep we can hear you
09:16 - where are you calling from
09:18 - uh calgary canada
09:21 - calgary
09:22 - and what grade are you in
09:24 - i'm in grade 8.
09:25 - so i'm going to show what you created
09:28 - and so we can
09:29 - present it to aloe as well
09:32 - so nick basically worked on ai to
09:35 - basically do use computer vision and
09:36 - what you see here on the left hand side
09:39 - oops
09:40 - let me share it differently give me a
09:42 - second add
09:51 - [Music]
09:53 - what you see on the uh
09:55 - on the left hand side here is a computer
09:57 - vision recognizer he made that
09:59 - recognizes rock paper and scissors so as
10:02 - his hand shows paper the computer
10:04 - recognizes paper when his hand shows
10:06 - scissors
10:08 - and rock on the bottom it shows what the
10:10 - computer is seeing
10:11 - or this middle one shows him showing
10:13 - different facial expressions happy
10:16 - sad and angry and in the bottom you see
10:19 - what the computer is recognizing so he's
10:22 - trained the computer vision algorithm to
10:23 - to basically recognize his emotions
10:26 - and nick can you tell us what this is
10:27 - here on the right hand side the video
10:29 - you sent us
10:31 - uh so this one is um i made it recognize
10:35 - audio clips so the two i chose
10:38 - were for to recognize clapping and
10:40 - snapping
10:42 - all right cool so i'm gonna play the
10:43 - video and you're gonna
10:45 - clap and snap and the computer will tell
10:46 - those apart yep
10:49 - clap
10:52 - snap
10:56 - let me try that again that one really
10:58 - quickly clap
11:02 - snap
11:04 - right so the computer down below is
11:05 - listening to the sounds you make and
11:06 - recognizing and that's pretty cool
11:08 - thanks for learning how to use ai nick
11:12 - and the next student we wanted to uh
11:14 - welcome is
11:15 - sarvika
11:17 - sarvika are you there
11:22 - can we unmute sarvika for a second
11:29 - uh i think she dropped so i'm gonna demo
11:30 - starvika's project briefly and if she
11:33 - gets back i will say hello to her
11:35 - starvika is joining us from india so she
11:37 - might be dropping because it's super
11:39 - late at night for her uh but here we
11:42 - have the game that she created that was
11:44 - built in game lab
11:45 - and it was modeled after the game we
11:47 - created with a rabbit that is feeding
11:48 - carrots to make carrots do but you can
11:51 - control this
11:52 - little
11:53 - scientist
11:54 - and have them drop tools to fix
11:56 - computers
11:58 - and then there's like a bad robot and if
12:00 - the tool gets eaten by the robot you
12:01 - lose
12:02 - so it's kind of a hard game oh no uh am
12:06 - i audible i'm cervical oh hi cervica
12:09 - we're playing
12:10 - i dropped out
12:12 - no worries where are you calling us from
12:14 - i'm from india noida
12:16 - all right and what grade are you in
12:19 - i'm in grade eight
12:20 - great eights well i just played your
12:22 - game and i i wasn't very good at it so i
12:25 - got a game over but thank you so much
12:27 - by the way the code that sarvika wrote
12:29 - there's a lot of lines of code here you
12:31 - can see on the right hand side to make
12:33 - this game in game lab we had made it
12:35 - last week in sprite lab which is much
12:37 - much easier so our whole team at
12:39 - code.org was pretty impressed for for
12:42 - building all of this inside game lab so
12:44 - congratulations for building something
12:46 - uh
12:48 - advanced
12:50 - uh aloe are you there with us too still
12:59 - there you go how you doing
13:01 - right there you are all right so uh
13:04 - thank you again sophia if you could play
13:05 - an applause sound for both starvika and
13:07 - for nick and for all of our students who
13:09 - made
13:10 - special creations last week
13:12 - let's get into today's lesson
13:14 - our word of the day today is hardware
13:19 - and today what we're going to talk about
13:21 - is basically what is hardware and how
13:23 - does it work
13:24 - hardware is basically the physical stuff
13:26 - that is inside of a computer not just
13:28 - inside it but even outside it it's
13:30 - basically the physical parts that work
13:32 - together to make a computer so you may
13:34 - have heard of some of these parts like
13:35 - the cpu which means the central
13:37 - processing unit or the memory which is
13:39 - also called as ram and so on
13:42 - but before we go into hardware i want to
13:45 - talk about what are examples of what a
13:47 - computer even is uh and i want to chat
13:51 - with some of the students to to learn
13:52 - more about it so uh can we unmute uh
13:56 - josiah in north carolina actually i'm
13:58 - gonna mute you myself
14:02 - hottie
14:03 - hi there
14:04 - is nc does that mean you're calling from
14:05 - north carolina uh yes
14:09 - right so can i ask you what are examples
14:11 - of computers besides a laptop what other
14:14 - things do you ever work with that are
14:15 - computers
14:17 - uh you mean like huh
14:21 - i work with apple tv
14:24 - apple tv is a computer
14:26 - aloe can you think of examples of things
14:27 - that are computers besides just laptops
14:30 - yes sometimes i walk around with a
14:32 - computer in my pocket that's my phone
14:35 - that's right your cell phone
14:37 - how about you sofia
14:39 - um
14:41 - an ipad an ipad is a computer if you
14:43 - have a smart watch that's a computer
14:46 - but also if you have a navigation system
14:48 - in your mom or dad's car
14:50 - that's a computer the satellites that go
14:52 - around the world in space like on anuj's
14:55 - background screen
14:57 - those are computers
14:58 - if you have smart screens on your
15:00 - microwave or on your uh
15:02 - or you know on your fridge that's a
15:05 - computer
15:06 - and if you've ever seen if you've ever
15:07 - seen a calculator
15:09 - that's actually a computer every
15:11 - calculator is a computer uh in our very
15:14 - first episode of code break hill harper
15:16 - walked us into his shower that had a
15:18 - touch screen and that was a computer
15:20 - most modern medical equipment uses
15:22 - computers
15:24 - today the smallest computers could be so
15:26 - small that they're microscopic you
15:28 - literally can't even see it with your
15:30 - eyes and their computers
15:31 - so the question i want to ask is what
15:34 - makes a computer a computer what defines
15:37 - that something is a computer versus
15:38 - something else every computer has four
15:42 - things and what these four things have
15:43 - to do generally with are processing
15:46 - information
15:47 - it first takes an input
15:49 - then it stores that information
15:52 - it processes the information and then
15:54 - converts it into output of some sort
15:57 - inputs means sort of the physical
15:58 - world's telling something to the
16:00 - computer then it processes and works
16:02 - that input into some other form of
16:04 - information and then outputs that
16:06 - now that could mean like doing math or
16:09 - changing something by words but there's
16:11 - lots of different ways to give
16:13 - input to a computer you might click a
16:15 - key on the keyboard so can we think of
16:18 - different ways you can give input to a
16:19 - computer at kayleen i'm going to call on
16:22 - you kayleen can you hear me
16:25 - yeah i can hear you all right so can you
16:27 - think of other ways you can give input
16:29 - to a computer
16:30 - besides touching on a keyboard
16:34 - well there are touch screen computers
16:36 - like you can touch on the screen but um
16:40 - those touch screen computers are more
16:42 - expensive than the keyboard ones and
16:45 - they're more easier to use some other
16:48 - computers you can flip them to tablets
16:50 - and things like that exactly so the
16:52 - touch screen that feels your touch
16:54 - that's an input device can anybody share
16:57 - another type of input into a computer
17:01 - all right uh alexander
17:06 - oops
17:09 - yes
17:10 - yep where are you calling from
17:12 - oshkosh wisconsin all right so what's
17:14 - another example of a computer input
17:19 - pretty much with like um like coding
17:23 - with like websites because when you like
17:25 - let's say like you want to like
17:28 - pick like an item from like a computer
17:30 - you have to
17:32 - like um
17:34 - you have to like search up the item
17:37 - and
17:38 - they'll show you
17:40 - to show you on some like items that are
17:43 - so when you're using the website it
17:45 - wants you to give information and you
17:46 - could use your keyboard to type that
17:48 - information but is there some other
17:50 - thing you can use like when if you want
17:52 - to give it if you want to choose
17:53 - something from a drop down menu what do
17:55 - you use to choose to make that selection
17:59 - what are you moving around
18:01 - you the mouse
18:02 - the mouse exactly the mouse so uh thank
18:06 - you so much alexander so
18:07 - input devices for computer all the
18:10 - things that take something from the
18:11 - physical world the world of touch the
18:13 - world of sound the world of light so the
18:16 - camera on a phone that's taking input
18:19 - the microphone on a phone or computer
18:22 - that's taking input you speak to it or
18:23 - it hears noise and that receives that
18:26 - information whether it's touch
18:28 - sound
18:29 - site
18:30 - even things like the gps locator on your
18:33 - phone it's locating where you are in the
18:35 - world these are all inputs and then the
18:37 - computer uses that information to output
18:39 - something
18:41 - aloe can you give us an example of what
18:43 - are some ways a computer can output
18:44 - information
18:46 - yeah um well i make music so i love the
18:49 - speakers on a computer that's my
18:51 - favorite part of output on a computer
18:53 - sometimes but i also make music videos
18:56 - so
18:57 - um the screen is an output and it's
19:01 - offering the information
19:03 - uh through that output
19:05 - yep so the sights and sounds you get
19:06 - from a computer or from your phone are
19:08 - output but there's again many types of
19:10 - output like on sophia's phone here
19:12 - there's a flashlight that makes light or
19:15 - if you have a computer that's
19:16 - controlling physical
19:17 - equipment the output can control that
19:20 - like if your car has a smart braking
19:22 - system
19:23 - the output of the computers the brakes
19:25 - on the car or if you have a robot uh the
19:28 - movement of that robot is controlled by
19:30 - the output of a computer or if a
19:32 - computer is inside maybe a microwave uh
19:34 - it turns on or off the microwave that's
19:36 - the output every computer does these
19:39 - four things of taking in input
19:42 - storing and processing it and then
19:44 - outputting and that input can be light
19:46 - or sight or touch and the output can be
19:49 - sound or sights and so on now i want to
19:52 - do something unique we're going to act
19:53 - out the different parts of the computer
19:55 - today with all the students on camera
19:58 - so in the background we're going to have
19:59 - this screen share that shows all of you
20:01 - on screen
20:02 - and what we're going to do is we're
20:03 - going to have
20:04 - five different computers on screen at so
20:08 - basically
20:09 - each of you in one of these vertical
20:10 - columns that you see is going to be a
20:12 - computer consisting of four people so
20:18 - we see five computers each one is a
20:20 - vertical row uh and so that's computer
20:23 - number one is started with me and sophia
20:27 - computer number two is with naomi
20:29 - and so on and so forth
20:33 - and the top row is going to be input
20:36 - the second row is going to be storage
20:40 - the third row
20:41 - is going to be processing and the fourth
20:44 - row is going to be output so
20:48 - look look at where you will look at
20:49 - where you are in the computer on the
20:51 - screen and you'll see which computer
20:54 - number uh column you fall under and
20:56 - you'll see what part of the pr um
20:59 - the computing stage
21:01 - you are in the on the roads
21:03 - right
21:04 - so alexander who's raising his hand he's
21:06 - part of the processing for computer
21:08 - number three yep
21:10 - or aloe is
21:11 - part of computer number three storage
21:14 - so all right so now all of our computers
21:16 - are going to do something so if you're
21:18 - in the input row
21:20 - i want you to grab a piece of paper
21:22 - and also if you're in the in a pen and
21:24 - if you're in the output row also grab a
21:27 - piece of paper and a pen so if you grab
21:29 - a piece of paper because we're part of
21:30 - input for computer number one
21:33 - so
21:34 - we're using paper because the original
21:37 - computers and this the first computers
21:38 - used paper as their only way of input
21:41 - and output before there were microphones
21:43 - and cameras and even keyboards on a
21:46 - computer the earliest computers you fed
21:48 - them information on a card with little
21:50 - holes in it and then they printed out
21:52 - information after they very true and
21:54 - that's those were the machine the
21:55 - machine computers that the word computer
21:59 - is basically referring to a human being
22:01 - who would compute information so if you
22:04 - were the person to do the work you were
22:06 - called the computer
22:09 - yep
22:09 - exactly so what i want everybody in the
22:12 - input row i want you to use your pen to
22:15 - pick a number between one through five
22:17 - and draw that many dots on your paper
22:20 - make them big dots so that we can see
22:22 - them when you hold them up to the camera
22:24 - sophia can you draw one of these
22:26 - so any number
22:28 - a number between one to five don't make
22:30 - it too big of a number because
22:33 - because that's too many dots and make
22:35 - them thick dots so that when you hold
22:37 - them up to the camera we can see them
22:40 - [Music]
22:43 - all right
22:44 - sophia can you show your number good job
22:46 - zion
22:48 - thank you nikki
22:51 - great job naomi
22:54 - all right
22:56 - so all right come on thank you right
22:58 - we've got all these numbers on screen so
23:00 - everybody who's in storage
23:02 - i want you to use your fingers to show
23:04 - how many dots you see from the input
23:05 - above you
23:07 - so look at the number above you and hold
23:09 - up that number of dots and hold them up
23:11 - using your fingers and make sure we see
23:13 - them
23:13 - now if you're holding up your hand to
23:15 - show the dots
23:16 - make sure you keep your hand up don't
23:18 - bring it down
23:19 - your job is to remember what was there
23:22 - so even when the dots disappear keep
23:24 - your hand up all right
23:26 - all right so now can the dots go away
23:30 - all the pieces of paper i want you to
23:32 - write down a new number of dots
23:35 - pick a different number you can maybe
23:37 - add a
23:38 - and again pick a number between one to
23:40 - five the hands-on screen don't don't
23:42 - bring your hands down because you're
23:43 - still remembering the previous number
23:47 - so let's see a new number on screen
23:51 - okay sophia has one dot
24:02 - all right
24:03 - nikki can you hold yours down just a bit
24:05 - so we can see
24:07 - there you go
24:08 - all right so can whoever is doing the
24:11 - drawings on the screen stop doing that
24:12 - right so now uh for everybody who's in
24:15 - processing the third row of the computer
24:18 - take a look at the number you see in
24:20 - storage
24:21 - which is the one the row the second row
24:24 - and then look at the new inputs and add
24:26 - them together so you see one number
24:28 - that's being stored in memory which is
24:30 - the first time we hold up the dots then
24:33 - a new number which is the new input and
24:35 - add these two together and show that
24:37 - with your fingers on the screen
24:40 - so you see for example sophia is holding
24:43 - one dot and right above her kayleen is
24:46 - showing
24:46 - three fingers
24:48 - so one plus three is four
24:52 - and naomi is showing two dots
24:55 - and
24:56 - power lies
24:58 - that's your one dot right so now
25:00 - everybody who's basically doing
25:02 - processing is showing a new number
25:04 - alexander can you hold your number up
25:06 - higher so we can see it
25:09 - okay you're gonna alexander i'm holding
25:12 - up three because that's the memory that
25:13 - was in storage
25:15 - and nicki's holding up two because
25:17 - that's the new number
25:19 - so you have to add those together two
25:21 - plus three there you go
25:24 - thanks alex
25:26 - all right so we all have numbers showing
25:28 - so now the dots can stop showing their
25:30 - inputs and what i want but for the
25:32 - processing folks don't change your
25:33 - numbers now if you're an output
25:36 - now write down the number you see in
25:37 - processing right above you
25:39 - so
25:40 - and people in processing make sure your
25:41 - numbers are very obvious if folks can
25:43 - write down
25:44 - and write it down as a number not as
25:46 - dots so if you see the number four you
25:48 - write down the number four
25:55 - and
25:57 - all right so anjali is writing down six
26:03 - great job kate
26:05 - all right and kate wrote down the number
26:08 - five
26:16 - all right
26:17 - well thank you so much guys so uh i
26:19 - think somebody just dropped off the
26:21 - camera which kind of changes this a
26:23 - little bit for us
26:24 - so what we just did is we showed the
26:26 - different parts of a computer basically
26:27 - involve inputting information which in
26:29 - our case the input was a piece of paper
26:32 - remembering that information which said
26:33 - even if the paper changed you remember
26:35 - what's going on
26:36 - processing that information
26:38 - in our case we just did very simple
26:40 - addition
26:41 - and then getting the results and
26:42 - outputting them and the output we did
26:44 - was with paper now we did this with pen
26:46 - and paper but the inputs and outputs of
26:48 - a computer can be completely different
26:50 - the input could be a sound you get from
26:52 - the microphone and then you record that
26:54 - sound inside the computer in the memory
26:56 - and the processing of that sound could
26:58 - be like a you know changing the volume
27:00 - or remixing it and then outputting the
27:03 - sound comes out for the speakers
27:05 - everything a computer does and what
27:07 - defines what a computer is is those four
27:09 - things of input
27:11 - storing information
27:13 - processing that information and
27:14 - outputting it and every computer whether
27:17 - it's a tablet a gaming desktop a phone
27:20 - the car gps system all of those do those
27:23 - same four things we have an entire video
27:26 - series about how computers work that
27:28 - goes into a lot more detail and we're
27:29 - going to share that at the end of this
27:31 - episode for folks to watch it's about 50
27:33 - minutes of videos and it features bill
27:35 - gates himself who created one of the
27:37 - most popular computer operating systems
27:39 - ever to explain to you that
27:41 - these parts of a computer and how they
27:43 - work
27:45 - so uh before we say goodbye to aloe i
27:48 - want to uh do a lightning round with you
27:49 - aloe so aloe you're our sixth and final
27:52 - special guest to play our lightning
27:54 - round game uh sophia is going to put 60
27:57 - seconds on the clock and she's going to
27:59 - keep score you're going to be getting a
28:01 - bunch of quick questions and your goal
28:03 - is to see how many questions you can
28:04 - answer in 60 seconds okay our high score
28:07 - was set by macklemore who got 14 answers
28:10 - uh in in 60 seconds oh my goodness yeah
28:14 - it's kind of hard it's pretty high
28:15 - stress but i'm sure you'll do okay
28:17 - sophie you ready yes aloe you ready yes
28:20 - all right go
28:22 - what are your feelings about pineapple
28:24 - on pizza
28:26 - i love it
28:27 - something you can't every no matter how
28:29 - many people love it
28:31 - jalapenos
28:32 - your favorite smell
28:35 - jasmine
28:36 - your favorite article of clothing
28:38 - hat
28:40 - strangest thing in your refrigerator
28:46 - hummus
28:48 - something you wish you could have
28:49 - learned as a kid
28:52 - coding
28:53 - what's your best advice you've ever
28:55 - gotten
28:58 - study the greats
29:00 - as a kid what did you want to be when
29:01 - you grew up
29:03 - a neuroscientist
29:06 - what is the superhero power you wish you
29:08 - had
29:10 - automatically create food
29:13 - first thing you do in the morning
29:16 - check my email
29:18 - what were your hobbies when you were a
29:20 - kid
29:22 - riding bikes
29:23 - um
29:24 - okay you got 10 which is really good all
29:27 - right great
29:29 - that's great and by the way aloe meant
29:31 - you mentioned that you wanted to learn
29:32 - coding but aloe's actually one of the
29:34 - reasons we've highlighted aloe not only
29:36 - in this episode but on on many code
29:38 - videos as well is because
29:40 - when the internet first came out allah
29:42 - was one of the first musicians to create
29:44 - his own website and to use that to
29:46 - promote his music and it's an important
29:47 - lesson that even if you want to become a
29:49 - rock star or an athlete whatever field
29:52 - you want to go into understanding how
29:53 - technology works is super important as
29:56 - well
29:58 - thank you
30:00 - um so alan i know we're out of time and
30:03 - we're running late for your schedules
30:04 - can we switch to gallery view and have
30:06 - everybody say goodbye to aloe as we add
30:08 - yvonne with our episode
30:09 - [Applause]
30:13 - bye everybody thank you
30:15 - all right it's been a pleasure
30:16 - thank you so happy learning
30:18 - bye bye
30:20 - before we welcome our next special guest
30:22 - i want to take a quick break for a
30:24 - short trivia question so it's trip video
30:26 - time
30:28 - so the question is what does the acronym
30:30 - bios
30:32 - stand for bios and if you're not on the
30:36 - zoom call the options are
30:38 - booting info on startup
30:40 - the next option is
30:41 - basic input output system
30:44 - the third option is bytes in operating
30:46 - system
30:48 - and the fourth option is begin input
30:50 - output scan
30:53 - right so almost half of our audience has
30:55 - already voted on these so what does the
30:57 - acronym bios stand for all right it
31:00 - sounds like most people got this right
31:01 - if we could share the results on screen
31:04 - almost all of you got it correct
31:06 - so the basic input output system uh what
31:09 - that is or the bios of a computer it's
31:12 - like the operating system but it's at a
31:14 - much more detailed sort of lower level
31:17 - thing basically the bios is the little
31:20 - bit of code that runs
31:22 - the immediate moment when you turn on a
31:24 - computer when you immediately turn on
31:25 - the phone it's the thing that tests to
31:28 - make sure that all the inputs and
31:30 - outputs work that there is a keyboard
31:31 - that the memory actually exists that the
31:34 - wires are actually working and so on and
31:36 - once this step is complete it then
31:39 - actually loads the real operating system
31:41 - which could be windows or android or ios
31:44 - and then passes control of the computer
31:46 - to the operating system which then takes
31:48 - over and manages everything that happens
31:51 - so i want to welcome our second special
31:53 - guest at today brett are you here with
31:55 - us i'm here
31:57 - hi brett it's great to see you where are
31:59 - you calling us from uh calling from
32:01 - lafayette california which is uh right
32:03 - next to oakland california if any of you
32:05 - know where that is
32:07 - uh well i know where that is but uh i
32:09 - wanted to ask sort is is where you at
32:11 - are people out and about yet are you
32:13 - still in quarantine mode are you staying
32:15 - at home or can you get together we're
32:16 - still sheltering in place um though some
32:19 - businesses are opening up so um it's a
32:21 - little bit more normal than it was
32:23 - though uh still you know the kids are i
32:26 - have three kids uh 10 uh eight and five
32:29 - and um a lot of their summer activities
32:32 - are still at home
32:34 - yeah it's rough to be spending summer at
32:36 - home
32:37 - uh brett by the way for those of you who
32:39 - didn't read our introductions is
32:40 - currently the president of salesforce he
32:42 - used to be the chief technology officer
32:44 - of facebook and he's also the co-creator
32:47 - and inventor of google maps
32:49 - which i know i use pretty much every day
32:51 - at least when i'm not sheltering in
32:53 - place or quarantining
32:55 - brett can you share us a little bit
32:56 - about your involvement with google maps
32:58 - how old were you when you were working
32:59 - on google maps uh and can you tell us a
33:02 - little bit about the the project that
33:03 - got that going yeah sure i was i was 25
33:06 - years old when we launched google maps
33:08 - and
33:09 - actually 24 years old
33:11 - turned 25 a couple months after
33:13 - so
33:14 - really it was at my first job right out
33:17 - of university i'm at google and
33:20 - for me when i think about it i think
33:22 - that most of the really cool
33:24 - products that you use um that are
33:27 - created by code are done by teams
33:29 - and it was interesting when i i feel
33:32 - really proud that i helped make google
33:33 - maps because so many people around the
33:35 - world use it now hundreds of millions of
33:37 - people use it but it was really a whole
33:39 - team that did it we had one engineer on
33:41 - the team named jens who was really good
33:43 - at drawing um so he was responsible for
33:46 - all the way the maps looked um which you
33:48 - know at the time was uh i think was one
33:50 - of the most beautiful maps and it really
33:52 - helped people want to use google maps
33:54 - over some of the other mapping
33:56 - technologies at the time my friend jim
33:59 - he was best at algorithms
34:01 - and so he designed the algorithm that
34:03 - helped make driving directions work so
34:06 - when you say you know i want to go from
34:08 - san francisco to new york you can
34:10 - imagine how many different ways you
34:12 - could do that how many different roads
34:13 - you could drive on he came up with a way
34:15 - to find the best route to take into
34:17 - account how fast the highways were the
34:20 - different speed limits really really
34:22 - complicated math and he was the best at
34:24 - that
34:25 - and i spent a lot of time on the user
34:26 - interface which is really
34:28 - i think a fun topic you're talking about
34:30 - inputs and outputs
34:32 - i um wrote all the code that um so when
34:35 - you took your mouse and you dragged the
34:37 - map i made it move in the right way um
34:39 - and that was really my specialty
34:41 - and on the other side of that the team
34:42 - of about five of us made google maps and
34:46 - now there's a much bigger team working
34:47 - on it but it was one of those fun coding
34:49 - projects of my life
34:52 - it's pretty awesome if only five people
34:53 - made the first version and pretty much
34:55 - everything we use in technology that we
34:58 - sort of society upholds sort of
35:00 - individuals as the inventors but they're
35:02 - always made by teams of people behind
35:03 - them doing different parts
35:05 - and since today we're learning about the
35:07 - different parts of a computer such as
35:08 - input and output one thing that made
35:10 - google maps special before all the other
35:12 - compared to all the maps that came
35:14 - before it is
35:15 - in the past anytime you wanted to move
35:17 - the map the entire map would need to
35:19 - load start to bottom and you couldn't
35:22 - even move your mouse left and right to
35:23 - drag the mouse drag the map
35:26 - we are now accustomed the idea on a
35:27 - touch screen you touch and you move it
35:29 - and you give it the input and then the
35:31 - output which is the monitor shows
35:33 - basically the map scrolling and google
35:35 - maps was really the first version that
35:37 - did that uh and when it happened and
35:39 - people saw that for the first time was a
35:41 - pretty magical experience that now you
35:42 - take for granted yeah i mean what's so
35:45 - fun about talking about input and output
35:47 - is it sounds so simple but honestly it's
35:49 - the most important part of the way we
35:51 - work with computers
35:53 - you know back when hottie and i started
35:56 - coding the way you
35:58 - talk to a computer was just through a
36:00 - text interface so you typed on a
36:02 - keyboard and you saw text come back on
36:04 - the screen
36:06 - and then
36:07 - it became a graphical user interface so
36:09 - you could see pictures on the screen and
36:11 - you could use a mouse along with a
36:13 - keyboard to both input things into
36:15 - computer and see the output
36:17 - and that was really as you said hottie
36:19 - with google maps we realized you know
36:21 - the modern mapping systems weren't
36:23 - taking advantage of all these new ways
36:25 - that you could input and output data
36:27 - from the computer and when we thought of
36:29 - a creative new way of doing it it really
36:31 - changed mapping forever but actually the
36:34 - most interesting part of google maps
36:35 - wasn't even created by us i think was
36:37 - created by steve jobs who is the um
36:39 - obviously the founder of apple um who
36:42 - makes iphones like this one right here
36:45 - you know when they introduced this they
36:46 - introduced a new way to input into a
36:48 - computer which was your finger and i
36:50 - think i can say that the moment i took
36:52 - my finger and dragged a google map i
36:54 - thought wow this is the coolest thing
36:56 - i've ever seen in my life and so you
36:58 - know i think when you think about all
37:00 - the cool things you're going to make
37:01 - with code a lot of the new experiences
37:04 - we make are because of new ways of input
37:06 - and new ways of output and i'm really
37:09 - excited about virtual reality i'm really
37:11 - excited about
37:13 - you know new forms of user interfaces
37:16 - being created all around the world right
37:17 - now and i think the way you all will
37:19 - code for computers 10 years from now is
37:21 - going to be really different than the
37:22 - computers of today and that's pretty
37:24 - exciting
37:25 - so we're going to learn a little bit
37:28 - about the graphical user interface
37:29 - inside coding which has also changed a
37:31 - lot and i know that your kids use
37:33 - code.org we're going to switch to uh
37:35 - codingoncode.org to
37:37 - complete a game that sophie and i are
37:38 - gonna be coding uh to basically learn
37:41 - about the parts inside of a computer so
37:43 - i'm gonna share my screen and what you
37:45 - see here is code.org sprite lab
37:47 - and we've started this game with these
37:49 - really cool graphics that we're very
37:52 - very proud of and this kind of fancy
37:54 - looking computer that we're gonna put
37:56 - together and if i run the game
37:58 - i can put the different parts inside the
38:00 - computer so this here is the cpu on its
38:03 - motherboard
38:05 - and this here is a memory
38:07 - and brett can you
38:08 - find any input devices that i can attach
38:11 - to this computer yeah why don't we start
38:13 - with maybe the keyboard
38:15 - the keyboard is one of the inputs
38:18 - all right
38:19 - any other input devices i think a mouse
38:21 - is a good input device that's another
38:23 - input device
38:25 - and
38:26 - as output we have this little black
38:28 - thing which is our monitor
38:30 - doesn't really look like a monitor but
38:31 - the screen on your laptop is black until
38:33 - you turn it on uh and that's basically
38:36 - the output that shows what's on your
38:37 - screen
38:38 - uh
38:39 - and then this last part is the power
38:40 - cord but we can't drag it because this
38:42 - part doesn't work yet and i want to turn
38:45 - the computer on by clicking on it but
38:46 - that doesn't work because it doesn't
38:47 - have any power
38:49 - so that's the part that sophia and i are
38:50 - going to be coding right now
38:52 - so i'm going to stop this for a second
38:54 - and before we get into the coding i
38:56 - wanted to point out that this little
38:58 - thing here was not even draggable
39:01 - all the other sprites on the screen were
39:03 - draggable and the way that happened is
39:05 - something that happened in the starter
39:06 - code here when you see reset game
39:09 - this is basically a function we wrote
39:11 - last week we learned about abstraction
39:12 - and how functions can have lots of code
39:15 - inside them so if i click the edit
39:17 - button here you can see all of the code
39:20 - that goes into starting the game
39:22 - uh you don't need to know what all this
39:24 - code does it basically sets things up
39:26 - but sophia if you go to the very very
39:28 - bottom it makes all the sprites on the
39:30 - screen draggable so the keyboard is
39:32 - draggable and the mouse is draggable and
39:34 - so on but the power unit is not
39:36 - draggable so go into behaviors
39:40 - and then say sprite begins
39:43 - and
39:44 - add that in there and now you can make
39:46 - rabbit draggable but not the reaction
39:49 - but not the rabbit yeah let's make the
39:50 - power unit draggable
39:52 - and then go into behaviors
39:54 - and say
39:55 - being draggable
39:56 - so now your power unit is draggable
40:00 - oops
40:03 - it's glitchy is it glitching for you
40:06 - right now hit close
40:10 - all right and now hit start so we can
40:14 - yes hit run so we can see if the power
40:16 - unit is draggable
40:19 - right draggable but it's not clicking
40:21 - into place like those other things did
40:23 - so let's write the code to make it click
40:26 - right so if you look on the screen it
40:27 - shows what happens right now when the
40:29 - memory chip touches the computer
40:33 - i'm going to refresh the screen share
40:34 - because
40:35 - it's glitching a little bit for people
40:37 - so i'm going to start this over give me
40:39 - just one second
40:40 - i'm going to stop the show can i share a
40:42 - story about building a computer
40:44 - sure go ahead yeah so when i was a kid
40:47 - um i couldn't afford a computer
40:51 - from a computer store
40:53 - but it was cheaper if i bought all the
40:54 - parts of a computer and i built it
40:56 - myself so if i bought the memory and i
40:58 - bought the cpu and i bought the case
41:02 - and the first time i did it i had this
41:03 - exact same top problem hottie which is i
41:06 - finished doing it and i screwed it in
41:08 - with a screwdriver and i turned it on
41:10 - and it didn't work and i had to take the
41:11 - entire thing apart and i had forgotten
41:13 - to connect the power supply to the cpu
41:17 - and the computer wouldn't turn on and so
41:19 - one it's one engineering principle that
41:21 - i think is really important is always
41:23 - test the entire way
41:26 - you know when you're writing code don't
41:27 - wait to the end to
41:29 - see if your code's working always run it
41:31 - and see what happens
41:32 - i learned that the hard way when i was
41:34 - building my first computer a true story
41:36 - that's wonderful yeah and that's why we
41:38 - tested at the mouse that the power unit
41:40 - was draggable
41:42 - before we jumped into doing anything
41:43 - else
41:44 - and i hope this works right now so i'm
41:46 - going to run this code again and we can
41:48 - drag the power unit but it doesn't click
41:50 - into place but at least the code that we
41:52 - wrote does something so now if you look
41:55 - at this code here this shows what
41:56 - happens how we make it lock into place
41:58 - we want to do something like this which
42:00 - is how the memory locks into place so
42:02 - we're going to recreate something like
42:03 - that so start with creating an event
42:05 - block
42:06 - and so you see when the rabbit touches
42:08 - the carrot
42:10 - but we don't have a rabbit or a cat but
42:11 - we can say when the power unit
42:14 - touches the computer we want to make it
42:16 - click into place
42:20 - yeah someone's drawing so what happens
42:23 - when the power unit touches the computer
42:25 - first thing we want to do is make it
42:26 - stop being draggable
42:36 - and then
42:37 - being draggable
42:39 - yep
42:40 - but right now you said make the rabbit
42:41 - stop being grabbable
42:46 - [Music]
42:49 - and then the other thing we want to do
42:50 - is we want to have it jump and lock into
42:53 - place see how it says jump this memory
42:55 - unit jumps to a location so go into
42:58 - actions
43:00 - and have
43:02 - the sprite
43:04 - jump
43:05 - and instead of a random location we want
43:07 - to pick our own location
43:08 - so go into locations
43:10 - and see that little thing with a pin in
43:12 - it
43:13 - it's right in the middle
43:16 - click that and choose a location kind of
43:18 - halfway between the power
43:21 - yeah a little bit yeah that's that's a
43:23 - good location
43:25 - over there yep that's good
43:27 - so now let's hit run and see if that
43:29 - works
43:34 - it's glitching
43:36 - oh did it lock in a bad place
43:38 - i'm gonna
43:44 - oh it's because you have the rabbit
43:45 - jumping
43:47 - we need to make this be the power unit
43:48 - so this is exactly as brad said we need
43:51 - to test every step of the way
43:53 - i'm glad we tested to see what the
43:54 - problem was there so if we hit run now
43:58 - click run again
44:00 - and you can move it and it jumps into
44:02 - place perfect but we want to make a
44:04 - sound when it jumps into place as well
44:07 - so
44:08 - can you go into the world and choose
44:10 - play sound
44:15 - all right
44:16 - and now we can choose a sound
44:19 - all right let's gonna choose a digital
44:21 - sound so we have let's pick some of
44:23 - these choices play the ring one
44:27 - and then start up
44:30 - play the whistle
44:32 - and the win
44:34 - all right
44:34 - we're going to choose one of these
44:35 - sounds brett do you have a favorite and
44:38 - let's also pull the entire i like the
44:40 - win that made me laugh
44:42 - all right let's house the whole audience
44:44 - and we'll play the sounds and so we can
44:46 - choose uh so
44:48 - ring startup
44:52 - whistle
44:55 - and win
44:58 - all right
45:00 - and let's share the audience poll
45:01 - results
45:04 - i think everybody else agreed with you
45:05 - brett uh so we're gonna go with the win
45:10 - right uh
45:11 - and then the last thing we want to do is
45:13 - we can actually uh if you look what is
45:15 - happening here when we're adding these
45:17 - commands if you look above there's a
45:19 - command here that says change parts by
45:21 - one what that's doing is incrementing a
45:24 - variable which is something we learned a
45:26 - few weeks ago and if the reason is doing
45:28 - that it's counting how many parts we put
45:30 - inside the computer because at the end
45:33 - we're going to test and see if parts
45:35 - reaches 6 we'll let the computer turn on
45:38 - so basically we need to increase this
45:40 - variable as well so we're going to need
45:42 - to choose one of the variable codes to
45:44 - change
45:47 - change parts by one um
45:49 - and i think that's good you hit the run
45:51 - button
45:53 - now this should all work
45:55 - put the other parts in
46:00 - the inputs
46:02 - the outputs we got the storage of
46:04 - processing and then put the power
46:07 - and now you can turn on the computer yay
46:10 - yay it all
46:12 - works
46:14 - yeah we can i wanted to leave that for
46:15 - the audience to do later so there's lots
46:17 - of things you can add to this
46:19 - first of all you can change the look and
46:21 - feel of the power unit once it's
46:22 - connected we have a little costume you
46:24 - can change
46:26 - light up and show power uh but we're
46:28 - going to share this app with you
46:30 - so you can
46:31 - actually sophie you can do that right
46:32 - now while i'm talking about it so you
46:34 - can add the costume if you want um so
46:37 - this app that we just made is very
46:39 - simple but we're going to let you extend
46:40 - it so you can add other computer parts
46:42 - you can have other sort of parts like
46:45 - more memory and so on you can add other
46:47 - inputs and outputs
46:49 - and if you want to do something advanced
46:50 - you can actually go go further and make
46:52 - an actual smartphone version of this so
46:54 - you put the parts inside of a smartphone
46:56 - together and we'll send that to you as
46:58 - part of your challenges
47:01 - the other cool thing and brad i don't
47:02 - know if you've seen this is we can share
47:04 - this out to everybody so this app that
47:06 - we made
47:07 - we're going to share and if you see that
47:09 - little qr code if you have a phone with
47:11 - you which bret i saw that you had you
47:13 - can scan that qr code on that on your
47:15 - phone right now
47:17 - and you'll get a little notification so
47:18 - you need to turn on your phone's camera
47:20 - and then if you just hold it up to that
47:23 - qr code it'll show a little notification
47:25 - and then you can
47:26 - get the app that we just put together
47:29 - that's awesome
47:31 - yeah and then you can play it on your
47:32 - own computer you can play it on your own
47:34 - and it works just like we just did so
47:36 - you can
47:37 - have fun making a computer and this time
47:39 - don't forget to connect the power supply
47:41 - and it'll start working
47:49 - so
47:50 - before we say goodbye to brett just one
47:52 - thing i want to say today we're joined
47:53 - by some teachers along uh who are
47:56 - basically computer science principals
47:58 - teachers who are graduating this year uh
48:00 - cs principles is the most popular
48:02 - computer science course in america's
48:05 - high schools right now and these
48:06 - teachers have students who are
48:07 - graduating and as you know they've all
48:08 - been basically studying at home for the
48:10 - latter part of the year many of them had
48:12 - to take an ap exam uh as part of that
48:15 - and we wanted to give a special shout
48:16 - out to the students who worked so hard
48:18 - to accomplish their goals in the midst
48:20 - of a global pandemic
48:22 - before we say hi to these folks i want
48:24 - to do an audience poll to ask how many
48:26 - of the students joining us right now are
48:28 - graduating this year
48:30 - and this means whether you're a senior
48:32 - in high school or whether you're you
48:34 - know in elementary school in fifth grade
48:37 - and leaving your school and going to a
48:38 - new school
48:39 - how many of you are graduates or from
48:42 - eighth grade to yeah or ending middle
48:45 - school to go into high school
48:48 - so wow i did not expect to see so many
48:50 - graduating students this year it's
48:52 - pretty awesome to see how many of our
48:53 - students are it's amazing
48:54 - congratulations everyone
48:56 - so we haven't shared the poll results if
48:59 - we could share those yeah about a
49:00 - quarter of all the students on code
49:02 - break are graduating so what a special
49:04 - moment today we congratulate all of you
49:07 - for your graduation and i wanted to
49:08 - invite a teacher uh to join us
49:11 - so is shanti there
49:15 - i'm here
49:17 - hi shanti where are you calling us from
49:19 - i'm calling from ohio cleveland ohio
49:23 - cleveland ohio it's so great to meet you
49:25 - and thank you for all of your hard work
49:26 - helping your students make it through
49:28 - this year uh i know you were hoping to
49:30 - have some of your graduating students
49:32 - join us as
49:33 - panelists but i think it was hard to put
49:34 - together can you read out the names of
49:36 - your students
49:37 - you have some students are actually here
49:39 - though as well um they're they're on as
49:42 - well
49:43 - um
49:44 - so uh mary hudson she's here
49:48 - she just waved uh ashanti hamilton she's
49:51 - under shayla sharp
49:54 - and
49:54 - um so those two are here with us along
49:56 - with some other uh cs students
49:59 - but our other cs graduates are jefferson
50:01 - agitate
50:03 - janaya wheeler rihanna blanchett anaya
50:06 - clark
50:07 - jonathan clay the saint chesney marquita
50:09 - edwards mylena edwards camario malone
50:12 - jalen debose nyla house davion mosley
50:16 - dalita powell samaj stewart tamaya
50:19 - williams and davon
50:22 - thank you so much uh we're gonna unmute
50:25 - everybody uh and to clap for all these
50:27 - students and brett if you don't see all
50:28 - those students you can click this button
50:30 - to to see
50:31 - all the faces
50:33 - [Applause]
50:34 - and shantae you're calling from
50:36 - cleveland ohio is that right
50:38 - yes but um we i teach at shaw high
50:40 - school in east cleveland ohio
50:43 - awesome
50:44 - all right so let's unmute everybody in
50:46 - the audience
50:51 - [Applause]
50:59 - thank you and brett uh you know we give
51:01 - a round of applause for shanti students
51:03 - but if you want to share some words to
51:05 - congratulate not just shanti students
51:07 - but the many hundreds of students who
51:10 - are joining us on code breaker
51:11 - graduating and who aren't getting their
51:13 - own graduation ceremony if you want to
51:14 - share some final words with them well i
51:16 - also say congratulations uh it's such an
51:18 - achievement
51:20 - to graduate and in particular right now
51:22 - in this completely unprecedented time
51:24 - it's so hard to be uh sheltered in place
51:27 - in our homes and and to not get the
51:30 - celebration of some of these graduations
51:32 - but i just want to say
51:33 - so many of the great
51:35 - technologies we've used are created by
51:37 - young people and by students so take all
51:39 - the skills you've learned and take all
51:41 - the creativity you have and the
51:43 - beginners mind you have about um what
51:45 - you want to create and create the future
51:47 - i'm looking forward to seeing all the
51:49 - the cool things you all build with the
51:51 - skills you learned this year
51:53 - thank you so much well thank you so much
51:56 - brett and we're going to say goodbye to
51:57 - brett if you could play an applause
51:59 - sound sofia
52:01 - avaya and it was great to see you and
52:02 - thank you for joining us thank you for
52:04 - having me and uh it was really nice to
52:06 - meet you all
52:08 - right bye-bye
52:09 - and i'd like to now welcome back our
52:12 - third and final guest senior software
52:13 - engineering manager at microsoft powell
52:16 - mejia
52:17 - welcome paola hi heidi thank you so much
52:20 - for having me hi there uh and sofia you
52:23 - can uh head out sophie's gonna say
52:25 - goodbye to us
52:27 - and we're gonna be joined by my
52:29 - son darius hi hey there is how are you
52:34 - darius is 13. paolo where are you
52:36 - calling us from i am calling from
52:38 - seattle washington just like you
52:40 - and you've worked on many tools that
52:42 - many students are familiar with like
52:44 - microsoft office 365
52:46 - or bing and microsoft teams
52:49 - can you share with us a little bit about
52:50 - your back story and what it took to
52:52 - become a software engineer at microsoft
52:54 - yeah yeah absolutely so my journey with
52:56 - microsoft actually started back when i
52:58 - was in college in my senior year i did
53:01 - an internship in the summer of 2006 and
53:04 - then i joined full-time at microsoft in
53:07 - 2007 and over the span of all these
53:09 - years i have worked in office you know
53:12 - which is the family of products like
53:14 - ward and excel and
53:16 - powerpoint
53:17 - um and then i was there for some time i
53:20 - transitioned to bing.com and i was there
53:22 - for about seven years
53:24 - and my last role has been in microsoft
53:27 - teams so i have been there for about
53:28 - three years and that one has been by far
53:31 - you know one of the most exciting
53:32 - products i've worked on
53:34 - i'm not sure you know maybe some of you
53:36 - guys have had the chance to join some
53:38 - online classes or do some video calling
53:41 - using microsoft teams um we're building
53:44 - a collaborative platform you know to
53:46 - facilitate education and collaboration
53:48 - in the workspace
53:50 - but overall it has been a fantastic ride
53:52 - at microsoft i have been there for about
53:54 - 13 years and it's been full of great
53:56 - opportunities to learn
53:58 - new technologies and also to work with a
54:00 - lot of really talented people
54:04 - and you did a lot of internships when
54:06 - you were trying to get get effective
54:09 - into your career can you talk a little
54:10 - bit about that yeah so when i was
54:12 - actually in college i i was trying to
54:15 - apply for an internship at microsoft um
54:18 - i think it took about three attempts to
54:20 - get to the final internship offer
54:24 - during my years
54:26 - in school i was primarily focused on
54:29 - extracurricular projects you know while
54:31 - i was building a strong resume
54:33 - and i was getting more expertise in the
54:36 - technical field one of the things that i
54:39 - did when i was back in school was
54:42 - the imagine cup competition i actually
54:44 - made it to the finals on national stage
54:46 - in mexico and that's where i was born
54:49 - and raised and and where i went to
54:51 - school so um gaining all of that
54:53 - experience since i was uh in school
54:55 - really helped me
54:57 - towards my journey being a software
54:58 - engineer in the tech field and was your
55:01 - internship at microsoft yes yeah i did
55:03 - that internship at microsoft so just two
55:05 - weeks ago we actually met with scott
55:08 - forstall who uh he did his first
55:10 - internship at microsoft as well and he
55:11 - moved on to work at apple and was one of
55:13 - the
55:14 - inventors of the iphone said you can
55:17 - start with an internship at a tech
55:19 - company and move on to create great
55:20 - things so i can't wait to see what you
55:22 - do
55:23 - further on in your career
55:25 - thank you so we want to move on to the
55:26 - last part of our episode which is to
55:28 - learn about circuits because today we're
55:30 - learning about hardware we started
55:32 - learning about input and output in the
55:33 - different
55:34 - aspects of what a computer does and then
55:36 - the parts inside the computer now we
55:38 - want to actually write code to control a
55:40 - circuit this is really different than
55:42 - anything we've done
55:44 - and i'm going to actually share my
55:45 - screen soon to show you but what we're
55:47 - going to do is we're going to write code
55:49 - to code this circuit which is an
55:52 - adafruit circuit playground
55:55 - it uses a architecture called arduino
55:57 - which is a very popular way of basically
56:00 - controlling really small circuits you
56:02 - can purchase one of these it costs about
56:04 - twenty dollars and we're going to send a
56:05 - link to you at the end if you want to
56:07 - and if you look at this thing it has
56:09 - lots of inputs and outputs on it
56:12 - so for example right here there's little
56:14 - buttons you can click
56:16 - uh and around it there are lights
56:19 - but there's lots of other inputs and
56:20 - outputs for example it has an
56:22 - accelerometer that detects if i'm
56:24 - turning it or moving it
56:26 - it even has a temperature sensor inside
56:28 - it and a microphone to hear sound uh do
56:31 - you have uh thoughts on any of those in
56:32 - terms of what those can be useful for
56:35 - yeah so um i mean you can think of
56:37 - circuit boards being present pretty much
56:39 - everywhere in our lives right like if
56:40 - you think about the temperature um like
56:43 - a thermostat for example the ones that
56:44 - we have at home you know it's it's
56:46 - another way of taking information from
56:49 - um an external source and process that
56:52 - and then have an output to tell you
56:54 - something
56:56 - exactly so now we're gonna i'm gonna
56:59 - screen share and this is a slightly
57:00 - different type of screen share for me uh
57:04 - and i'm gonna
57:05 - show us how we do the code to control
57:08 - this circuit
57:09 - so i'm gonna screen share portion of my
57:12 - screen can you all see
57:13 - uh
57:14 - yeah i can see it it's okay and there's
57:17 - two versions of my video now so i'm
57:18 - gonna stop one of them to simplify this
57:20 - so what we see here on the left hand
57:23 - side is
57:24 - app lab which you're comfortable with
57:26 - and here's an app that we're making and
57:27 - all the code for it
57:29 - but i did something here i clicked this
57:31 - gear
57:32 - and i chose to enable the maker toolkit
57:34 - which added a whole new category of
57:37 - commands here see here where it says
57:38 - circuit these are all the blocks that
57:41 - manage
57:42 - things that can happen with this circuit
57:44 - board
57:46 - now over here is the code that controls
57:48 - what our app does and it uses some of
57:50 - these blocks and what we're going to do
57:52 - is we're going to create an app that
57:53 - lets you doodle and draw but using the
57:55 - board as the controller not the mouse
57:57 - a few weeks ago we had the founder of
57:59 - instagram show us how to make an image
58:01 - doodler where you move the mouse around
58:03 - and you draw on the screen and you could
58:05 - choose different colors or you could
58:06 - change the thickness of your drawing but
58:08 - the input device for the drawing was a
58:10 - mouse
58:12 - i want to use this little thing as our
58:14 - input device and the input is going to
58:16 - be by moving it around we're going to
58:19 - draw on the screen
58:20 - and we've already started this code up
58:22 - here it basically has a function here
58:24 - saying onboard event when the
58:26 - accelerometer makes an event
58:29 - and the accelerometer is going to give
58:30 - us a pitch and a roll the pitch is when
58:33 - we move it forward and backwards and the
58:36 - role is when we turn right or left
58:39 - and those those are basically the inputs
58:41 - and outputs of this device and uh you
58:44 - can see here the code that basically
58:45 - text gets the pitch from the
58:47 - accelerometer and it gets the roll from
58:50 - the accelerometer so darius here is
58:52 - going to add some very simple code that
58:54 - allows the pitch and roll of this thing
58:56 - to control the drawing on the screen
58:58 - so we want to use the turtle drawing
59:00 - commands so go into
59:02 - turtle and then say move forward
59:08 - but instead of moving forward 25 pixels
59:10 - move forward pitch pixels so if my pitch
59:13 - is positive and i'm leaning forward
59:15 - it'll move forward that many and if it's
59:17 - negative and moving backwards it'll go
59:19 - backwards
59:20 - and then also now turn right
59:25 - and turn right
59:26 - how what should you turn by how many
59:28 - degrees
59:29 - the roll which is how much we're going
59:30 - left and right so enter the roll there
59:33 - oops you misspelled it
59:36 - all right and just like the examples you
59:38 - were saying about the computers right
59:40 - like when you take an input from
59:41 - something else like the mouse and in
59:43 - this case it's gonna be the movements
59:45 - that you do
59:47 - back and forth and left and right right
59:49 - exactly the inputs are what we get from
59:51 - the accelerometer and the outputs are
59:53 - the move forward and turn right which
59:55 - controls what shows up on the screen so
59:57 - there is can you hit run and i'm going
59:58 - to see if this works
60:01 - all right so i'm leaning forward and it
60:03 - moves forward
60:04 - and then i
60:05 - lean back and it moves backwards
60:08 - and then if i turn right
60:10 - it goes in this crazy circle
60:12 - if and you can change the colors as i'm
60:14 - drawing too if you want oh cool
60:17 - wow
60:18 - and this
60:20 - all right this is going
60:21 - a little bit out of control
60:23 - it's kind of hard to draw with this
60:24 - because it's moving kind of too fast so
60:27 - can you reset it
60:29 - yeah
60:30 - all right so that was going too fast so
60:32 - what could we do to actually make it not
60:34 - move so fast so i can control this more
60:35 - more carefully oh we could do like move
60:38 - forward my pitch divided by
60:40 - like eight all right so you're gonna do
60:42 - some so we'll still go in the direction
60:45 - of the pitch and roll but you're
60:46 - dividing it by
60:47 - some numbers that so it doesn't go quite
60:49 - as aggressively we'll see maybe it's
60:51 - still too fast all right i'm gonna try
60:52 - it again and you can change the colors
60:54 - all right i'm going to lean forward and
60:56 - it's moving forward
60:59 - then i'm going to turn right
61:03 - and i'm going to oh you made it thicker
61:04 - i'm going to turn left
61:07 - that doesn't do anything right now oh
61:10 - so as i'm moving
61:12 - forward i can even move backwards by
61:14 - leaning backwards
61:16 - all right this is kind of fun but one
61:18 - problem with this is basically it's
61:20 - continuously drawing and if i want to
61:21 - stop the drawing i can't lift up the pen
61:24 - and white ink
61:25 - yeah white well white ink you can lift
61:27 - up my face
61:29 - it's an eraser so can you hit reset for
61:31 - a second
61:33 - so there's these buttons on this this
61:35 - left and right button i want to make
61:37 - those macy lift up the pen and put down
61:39 - the pen so we can draw something more
61:40 - complicated and so we can do that using
61:43 - events which we learned about
61:45 - last week so you can even put us into
61:47 - show blocks
61:50 - now if you go into the circuit block
61:52 - area
61:53 - there's an onboard event
61:56 - if you drag that out it enables events
61:59 - so it says onboard if in the event of a
62:01 - button left
62:03 - being down so that's basically
62:06 - that's the left button so when that's
62:08 - down what should we do
62:10 - pen up pen up so i'm going to turtle and
62:14 - say pen up
62:16 - pen up
62:19 - and let's do the opposite for the button
62:21 - right so what can we do there paulo you
62:22 - want to help us as well we can
62:25 - we can say on event
62:26 - [Music]
62:28 - band
62:30 - button r
62:32 - yeah
62:33 - yeah
62:34 - and then from the turtle
62:37 - we could do pen down
62:39 - and you know this circuit also can make
62:41 - sounds so i want to make it so when we
62:43 - press these buttons we actually hear
62:44 - some sounds coming out of this board
62:47 - yeah on the defense
62:49 - so can you go back to the circuit blocks
62:52 - and can you paula help us see if you can
62:54 - see anything that
62:55 - sounds buzzer note i think here let's do
62:58 - buzzer notes yeah
63:00 - um
63:01 - e4 i think a4 means like the abcde notes
63:05 - on a keyboard yeah okay and that 100 is
63:07 - the duration so we can change that to
63:09 - make it longer
63:11 - or like something else if it's 100
63:13 - duration that's gotta be milliseconds
63:19 - can we pick a different sound for the
63:21 - other one
63:22 - here let's do c4
63:24 - yeah
63:25 - four
63:27 - one thousand no we're not ten
63:31 - all right now let's run that and see
63:33 - what happens
63:34 - okay
63:35 - so now
63:37 - if i lean forward it should draw and if
63:39 - i hit the right button the pin is down
63:42 - the left button lifts the pen so now i'm
63:44 - moving around
63:46 - i can turn right and turn left
63:49 - and then right button puts the pen down
63:52 - and
63:53 - makes that little sound and the left
63:55 - button lifts it can you all hear the
63:56 - sound it's making yeah i can hear it
64:01 - right this is not easy to control it's
64:04 - like flying an airplane
64:06 - yeah you can try um i actually want to
64:09 - ask the audience to suggest something
64:11 - for us to draw here oh go ahead you can
64:13 - try um let's do an audience poll for
64:15 - what we can try to draw now with this
64:18 - cool little tool we've got uh
64:20 - there's oops this is on the screen
64:23 - so there's
64:24 - i want to make this easy for me so
64:26 - choose a plus sign please the plus sign
64:29 - is the easiest thing to draw plus sign
64:32 - can can everybody vote for a plus sign
64:34 - because
64:35 - the cat is very popular
64:38 - i think the plus sign is what i want
64:40 - people to vote for
64:42 - yeah i could draw the character
64:45 - it'll it might look like a government
64:47 - all right let's share let's share the
64:48 - poll results
64:50 - okay so
64:52 - it sounds like nobody wants to have me
64:54 - draw a plus sign we'll have to try
64:55 - drawing a cat
64:57 - uh
64:59 - all right so
65:01 - this is not going to be easy at all but
65:03 - i
65:04 - i'm going to try drawing a cat
65:07 - i'm gonna lift up the pen
65:10 - or i'll turn it down and very so you can
65:12 - control the colors if you want so this
65:14 - will be the cat
65:16 - face
65:18 - i'm gonna do the outline of the cat face
65:23 - oh my gosh this is so hard ah
65:27 - this is like an ear
65:30 - it looks like an ear
65:33 - oh no great
65:38 - this is actually better than i thought
65:39 - it would be because i'd practice it a
65:40 - little earlier
65:43 - all right i'm going backwards now it's
65:46 - going in reversal it connects oh
65:51 - not as good as we're going to get on the
65:52 - cat face it's a really nice cat can you
65:54 - help me with the eyes make the eyes a
65:56 - different color
66:00 - all right where should i make the eyes
66:01 - that's one eye no
66:05 - this cat has giant eyes
66:09 - [Music]
66:12 - all right
66:13 - i think this is as good as we're gonna
66:14 - get with the cat you can try making the
66:16 - whiskers if you want
66:17 - so what we oops you hit reset well what
66:20 - we learned there is how to write code
66:23 - that controls inputs and outputs
66:25 - you know when you use commands like move
66:28 - forward or turn right that's putting
66:30 - drawings on the screen and that's
66:32 - controlling the circuits inside your
66:34 - computer that actually put stuff on the
66:36 - screen but whether you're handling a
66:38 - computer or a chip like this the inputs
66:41 - and outputs start as being really simple
66:43 - like little buttons and an event that
66:46 - detects a mouse move is just like an
66:47 - attempt an event that detects a button
66:50 - being down
66:51 - or a command that says move forward or
66:53 - turn right is just like a command that
66:55 - says play the buzzer note in every one
66:58 - of these cases the code you're writing
67:00 - is controlling the inputs and outputs on
67:02 - the screen and when a computer works it
67:04 - receives information through the inputs
67:07 - it runs code to basically manage
67:11 - processing that information and it runs
67:13 - code to basically store that information
67:16 - process it and then uses output whether
67:18 - to show something on the screen to play
67:20 - a sound etc
67:23 - thank you so much for
67:25 - being patient with my terrible airplane
67:27 - drawing skills uh so we shared that app
67:30 - with you but there's a lot more you can
67:31 - do with it
67:32 - and if you want to give us your email
67:34 - address just can you hear me some of
67:36 - those things
67:37 - we want we'll send you instructions for
67:40 - how you can actually make your own using
67:42 - the same board uh so if we don't already
67:45 - have your email address you can go to
67:47 - code.org
67:48 - break code.org break and if you sign up
67:52 - here
67:53 - we'll be able to send you today's
67:56 - challenges for you to try out
67:57 - and there's a bunch of things you can
67:59 - get in these challenges first of all
68:01 - we'll send you the short video series i
68:03 - mentioned about how computers work and
68:05 - that's going to basically be this 40
68:07 - minute long video series that talks
68:09 - about the different parts of a computer
68:11 - and how they actually work at detail and
68:13 - it features bill gates the founder of
68:14 - microsoft explaining the insides of a
68:16 - computer then we'll send you that sprite
68:19 - lab game that sophia and i worked on
68:20 - together and you can add to that project
68:22 - by adding speakers or a camera or more
68:25 - memory and make a more complicated uh
68:28 - computer inside that game and then
68:30 - lastly if you're able to purchase a
68:32 - circuit playground they cost 20 bucks
68:34 - we'll send you a link for one of those
68:36 - then you can use app lab to do much more
68:38 - complicated stuff than the little
68:40 - drawing thing that darius and i just did
68:42 - uh you know you can we'll obviously send
68:44 - you the app that we just made so you can
68:46 - improve on it and play with it the way i
68:47 - just did but we'll also send you ideas
68:49 - for other projects you could do
68:52 - so since this is our very last episode
68:54 - of quote break
68:55 - i wanted to spend some time to give a
68:57 - special thanks to all the parents and
68:59 - teachers who've been joining us and
69:00 - who've made it possible for their
69:01 - children to tune in to code break and
69:04 - participate in their activities
69:06 - first of all if you want to give your
69:08 - own shout out to a parent
69:10 - to your mom and dad please use our
69:12 - question form as i sent earlier about
69:14 - code.org questions and i want to do a
69:16 - quick audience poll how many of the
69:18 - students for joining us today are
69:19 - watching with their parents
69:22 - many of you i know are just watching
69:23 - code break alone
69:26 - but a whole bunch of you are doing here
69:28 - with you with your parents next to you
69:30 - [Music]
69:32 - and we want to do something special to
69:34 - recognize all the parents
69:39 - all right if you could share the poll
69:40 - results
69:41 - so it looks like one third of our
69:43 - audience is actually joining us with the
69:45 - parents
69:46 - paola uh before we go thanking our
69:49 - parents can you share a little bit about
69:50 - your own parents and how they helped you
69:52 - as you were getting into computer
69:53 - science yeah absolutely um so i was born
69:57 - and raised in mexico and i grew up in a
70:00 - city called veracruz which you know
70:01 - where the opportunities to learn
70:03 - computer science were very limited so
70:05 - both of my parents are chemical
70:06 - engineers my mom was actually the first
70:08 - female engineer in the family and they
70:11 - really wanted to support me in a journey
70:14 - where i had all the tools to face a
70:17 - world that's constantly changing so
70:19 - without their support i wouldn't have
70:21 - been able to make it to where i am today
70:24 - um you know but between my parents and
70:26 - also my teachers um they taught me that
70:29 - you know there may be a lot of no's
70:31 - along the way but it only takes one yes
70:33 - to get the the next opportunity and to
70:36 - get on the right track so to the moms
70:38 - and dads joining us today thank you
70:40 - thank you for being there thank you for
70:42 - making a difference i want to thank my
70:44 - parents specifically they have been so
70:46 - inspiring to me and honestly without
70:49 - them i don't think i would have been
70:51 - able to accomplish everything i have
70:53 - that's wonderful one thing that studies
70:55 - have shown is that
70:56 - encouragement from a parent is one of
70:58 - the most important things
71:00 - to keep to basically ensure persistence
71:03 - of young kids in computer science
71:05 - especially among girls or students of
71:06 - color who are typically underrepresented
71:08 - in the field encouragement from their
71:10 - parent is one of the most important ways
71:11 - to get them to stick with it
71:13 - i'd like to invite our producer akira
71:15 - who missed last week's episode to also
71:17 - join me and to read out some of the
71:18 - shout outs to parents from all the
71:19 - students
71:20 - tuning in at home so akira can you join
71:23 - us on screen for a second
71:25 - yes thanks hattie so we have a couple of
71:28 - shout outs to parents um we have one
71:30 - from aniola from the past manitoba in
71:32 - canada and they say i want to thank my
71:34 - mom and dad as they are both essential
71:36 - workers my mom works at a hospital and
71:38 - my dad is a teacher so i think there's
71:40 - accommodation all around on that one
71:43 - dominic says i'd like to give a shout
71:45 - out to my grandma for letting me do code
71:47 - break so i'm really glad that we have
71:49 - grandma's encouragement and finally we
71:51 - have adees and caleb from maddie reading
71:53 - massachusetts and i believe both of them
71:54 - have joined us as former panelists on
71:57 - code break and they said our parents
71:59 - mocta and sent yahoo we want to thank
72:02 - them for working so hard to support us
72:03 - and take care of us not only during this
72:05 - quarantine but for our whole lives
72:07 - they're our main inspiration to learn
72:10 - thank you so much uh and if you could uh
72:12 - just briefly if darris could play an
72:14 - applause sound
72:15 - uh hold on this is coming in right here
72:21 - and i want to basically make a special
72:23 - thanks if we could basically go to
72:24 - gallery mode and basically give a round
72:26 - of applause uh if we could unmute all
72:29 - the students
72:41 - a round of applause to thank all of our
72:44 - students and all of our panelists our
72:47 - parents
72:48 - to to to congratulate the graduating
72:50 - seniors as well as their teachers and
72:52 - lastly a special thanks to our special
72:54 - guests this week alo
72:56 - uh brett and paula
72:58 - i lastly want to say you know this is
73:00 - our very last code break so we're done
73:01 - and we're going to say goodbye to you
73:03 - but if you want to continue learning you
73:05 - can go to code.org
73:08 - at home
73:09 - all the tools and games and things we've
73:10 - learned about are there and there's a
73:12 - whole bunch of other activities we'll be
73:14 - emailing this to you as well
73:16 - and lastly if you want to help support
73:17 - code.org if you want to buy a hat like
73:19 - my cool hat
73:21 - or a t-shirt like the one sophia was
73:22 - wearing you can go to code.org shop or
73:25 - you can just google for code.org on
73:27 - amazon
73:29 - and then lastly all of our work is only
73:31 - made possible thanks to generous
73:32 - charitable donations so if any of the
73:34 - parents want to support code.org if you
73:36 - go to code.org help that's the best way
73:39 - for you to basically help the work that
73:40 - we're doing there's many millions of
73:42 - students who learn computer science and
73:44 - coding on code.org we've had we just
73:46 - passed 50 million students on code.org
73:48 - we want to reach 50 million more
73:50 - students and we only need your help to
73:52 - do that
73:53 - thank you so much everybody who's been
73:55 - with us throughout the last three months
73:57 - of the quarantine uh this is our very
73:59 - last code break so we're just gonna say
74:00 - one big wave goodbye
74:02 - please enjoy your summer breaks and when
74:04 - you're bored and you want some some
74:06 - creativity make sure to take a code
74:08 - break
74:09 - goodbye everybody
74:11 - guys goodbye
74:46 - so
74:50 - [Music]
75:13 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so so so hello and welcome to code break my name is hadi i'm the founder of code.org in the hour of code and we're joined by lots of students on zoom on facebook live and on youtube live together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom this is for many of us the last week of school for some people school is already over that's sophie this is your last day of school right yeah um so this will also be our last day of code break and i'm here with my daughter and sidekick sophia who's a budding computer scientist uh i also want to start before we mention the episode to mention that today uh is being a day that's called by uh universities and researchers around the world as shut down stem day which is a movement organized by black organizers and researchers to call on workers and representatives in science technology and math fields to work towards antiracism uh we're very fortunate at code.org to have the platform to speak with you all about it until as we hold our last code break episode as a way to reach our younger students and recognize the antiblack racism that exists in the world and in stem fields and we need to do the work as a larger stem community to fight for black lives and for more diversity in the field of computer science to start today's episode i want to introduce two of our special guests one is paula paola are you there with us i'm here hi honey thank you so much for having me hi it's great to see you paulo as a senior software engineer at microsoft she's going to be joining us for the later part of the episode but you'll see her on screen uh and our first special guest is singer and songwriter aloe blacc i'm doing great how are you it's great to see you alon uh where are you calling us from i am in from los angeles today all right are you still stuck at home or is la able yeah we are still in quarantine we only go out for essentials here in seattle we have some restaurants opening at limited capacity you know it's uh hopefully people more and more around the world will get a chance to to get out a little bit at least over the summer but the pandemic really has not stopped and this is a disease that's going to be coming back i believe in the fall and winter so uh it's been a rough time for all of us do you have any message to share with students who are at home uh whether the ones who've been studying and still in school or thinking about their plans for the summer yeah i think this is a great summer to find what you might be passionate about so explore a lot of different things and since we're here and and you're here at code break maybe this is your passion try to build something amazing come up with some great ideas that's wonderful so we're going to start today's episode with the computer science joke of the day with sophia so sophia you want to share your your joke okay what is an astronaut's favorite key on the computer board on the computer keyboard so astronaut's favorite key on the computer keyboard i would say return because he can't wait to get back home that's a good the answer is the space bar oh my goodness of course of course the space bar yeah i should have thought of that at code.org we write our own jokes and sophia actually wrote a new joke uh when we were practicing today's episode so she has a second joke that today we're learning about hardware so you want to say your hardwarerelated joke it's a little tricky but what does the cpu call its mother the is a part of the computer so what does the central processing unit call its mother oh my goodness i'm gonna go for board i feel pretty close it's the motherboard [Laughter] motherboard the motherboard is actually the board of silicon that the cpu is installed on so it's actually a physical part of the computer all right well uh we now met our special guests let's start by saying hello to our uh the rest of our audience so can we show all the audience on screen and allo if you don't see them all you can hit the gallery button and zoom which will be in your upper right hand corner so you can see everybody if we could unmute everybody to say hello and there's a lot more students as well if you want to see the audience on screen and i'm actually going to share my screen so you can see where people are calling us from so if you see my screen share we have can you all see the map i have here all right so we have audience members as they were joining in basically scanning a qr code and telling us where they're calling from uh aloe i don't know if you expected to see people calling from hawaii some of these are i think fake locations whoever put in greenland i'm guessing is not actually calling from the middle of greenland but we have students from south america from africa from australia india uh and these are live so for many of them they're calling from the their late night or very early morning that's pretty amazing it's a lot of people yeah it's a lot of students from all over trying to learn to code with us together so we're so excited to have you on for our very last code break as we go through this episode if you have questions uh please submit them at code.org questions we're not sure with three special guests this time we're not sure how many uh questions we'll be able to field but also since this is our last code break we're also going to spend some time thanking all the parents and so if you want to give a shout out to your mom or dad you can also go to code.org questions and and put a shout out over there for your mom and dad for today's episode we're going to be talking about hardware and we have three different parts to talk about first we're going to talk about input and output next we're going to talk about the parts inside of a computer and lastly we're going to do some programming using circuits so before we go on to go into some today's lessons i want to welcome some of the students to demo their creations from last week last week we challenged students to make your own sprite live game or app lab drawing using functions and also in the previous week we asked you to use ai and machine learning to train a computer to recognize information so allo we're going to welcome some students who are going to demo what they built for us and if you could uh check them out and and hear from them can we unmute nick hi can you hear me yep we can hear you where are you calling from uh calgary canada calgary and what grade are you in i'm in grade 8. so i'm going to show what you created and so we can present it to aloe as well so nick basically worked on ai to basically do use computer vision and what you see here on the left hand side oops let me share it differently give me a second add what you see on the uh on the left hand side here is a computer vision recognizer he made that recognizes rock paper and scissors so as his hand shows paper the computer recognizes paper when his hand shows scissors and rock on the bottom it shows what the computer is seeing or this middle one shows him showing different facial expressions happy sad and angry and in the bottom you see what the computer is recognizing so he's trained the computer vision algorithm to to basically recognize his emotions and nick can you tell us what this is here on the right hand side the video you sent us uh so this one is um i made it recognize audio clips so the two i chose were for to recognize clapping and snapping all right cool so i'm gonna play the video and you're gonna clap and snap and the computer will tell those apart yep clap snap let me try that again that one really quickly clap snap right so the computer down below is listening to the sounds you make and recognizing and that's pretty cool thanks for learning how to use ai nick and the next student we wanted to uh welcome is sarvika sarvika are you there can we unmute sarvika for a second uh i think she dropped so i'm gonna demo starvika's project briefly and if she gets back i will say hello to her starvika is joining us from india so she might be dropping because it's super late at night for her uh but here we have the game that she created that was built in game lab and it was modeled after the game we created with a rabbit that is feeding carrots to make carrots do but you can control this little scientist and have them drop tools to fix computers and then there's like a bad robot and if the tool gets eaten by the robot you lose so it's kind of a hard game oh no uh am i audible i'm cervical oh hi cervica we're playing i dropped out no worries where are you calling us from i'm from india noida all right and what grade are you in i'm in grade eight great eights well i just played your game and i i wasn't very good at it so i got a game over but thank you so much by the way the code that sarvika wrote there's a lot of lines of code here you can see on the right hand side to make this game in game lab we had made it last week in sprite lab which is much much easier so our whole team at code.org was pretty impressed for for building all of this inside game lab so congratulations for building something uh advanced uh aloe are you there with us too still there you go how you doing right there you are all right so uh thank you again sophia if you could play an applause sound for both starvika and for nick and for all of our students who made special creations last week let's get into today's lesson our word of the day today is hardware and today what we're going to talk about is basically what is hardware and how does it work hardware is basically the physical stuff that is inside of a computer not just inside it but even outside it it's basically the physical parts that work together to make a computer so you may have heard of some of these parts like the cpu which means the central processing unit or the memory which is also called as ram and so on but before we go into hardware i want to talk about what are examples of what a computer even is uh and i want to chat with some of the students to to learn more about it so uh can we unmute uh josiah in north carolina actually i'm gonna mute you myself hottie hi there is nc does that mean you're calling from north carolina uh yes right so can i ask you what are examples of computers besides a laptop what other things do you ever work with that are computers uh you mean like huh i work with apple tv apple tv is a computer aloe can you think of examples of things that are computers besides just laptops yes sometimes i walk around with a computer in my pocket that's my phone that's right your cell phone how about you sofia um an ipad an ipad is a computer if you have a smart watch that's a computer but also if you have a navigation system in your mom or dad's car that's a computer the satellites that go around the world in space like on anuj's background screen those are computers if you have smart screens on your microwave or on your uh or you know on your fridge that's a computer and if you've ever seen if you've ever seen a calculator that's actually a computer every calculator is a computer uh in our very first episode of code break hill harper walked us into his shower that had a touch screen and that was a computer most modern medical equipment uses computers today the smallest computers could be so small that they're microscopic you literally can't even see it with your eyes and their computers so the question i want to ask is what makes a computer a computer what defines that something is a computer versus something else every computer has four things and what these four things have to do generally with are processing information it first takes an input then it stores that information it processes the information and then converts it into output of some sort inputs means sort of the physical world's telling something to the computer then it processes and works that input into some other form of information and then outputs that now that could mean like doing math or changing something by words but there's lots of different ways to give input to a computer you might click a key on the keyboard so can we think of different ways you can give input to a computer at kayleen i'm going to call on you kayleen can you hear me yeah i can hear you all right so can you think of other ways you can give input to a computer besides touching on a keyboard well there are touch screen computers like you can touch on the screen but um those touch screen computers are more expensive than the keyboard ones and they're more easier to use some other computers you can flip them to tablets and things like that exactly so the touch screen that feels your touch that's an input device can anybody share another type of input into a computer all right uh alexander oops yes yep where are you calling from oshkosh wisconsin all right so what's another example of a computer input pretty much with like um like coding with like websites because when you like let's say like you want to like pick like an item from like a computer you have to like um you have to like search up the item and they'll show you to show you on some like items that are so when you're using the website it wants you to give information and you could use your keyboard to type that information but is there some other thing you can use like when if you want to give it if you want to choose something from a drop down menu what do you use to choose to make that selection what are you moving around you the mouse the mouse exactly the mouse so uh thank you so much alexander so input devices for computer all the things that take something from the physical world the world of touch the world of sound the world of light so the camera on a phone that's taking input the microphone on a phone or computer that's taking input you speak to it or it hears noise and that receives that information whether it's touch sound site even things like the gps locator on your phone it's locating where you are in the world these are all inputs and then the computer uses that information to output something aloe can you give us an example of what are some ways a computer can output information yeah um well i make music so i love the speakers on a computer that's my favorite part of output on a computer sometimes but i also make music videos so um the screen is an output and it's offering the information uh through that output yep so the sights and sounds you get from a computer or from your phone are output but there's again many types of output like on sophia's phone here there's a flashlight that makes light or if you have a computer that's controlling physical equipment the output can control that like if your car has a smart braking system the output of the computers the brakes on the car or if you have a robot uh the movement of that robot is controlled by the output of a computer or if a computer is inside maybe a microwave uh it turns on or off the microwave that's the output every computer does these four things of taking in input storing and processing it and then outputting and that input can be light or sight or touch and the output can be sound or sights and so on now i want to do something unique we're going to act out the different parts of the computer today with all the students on camera so in the background we're going to have this screen share that shows all of you on screen and what we're going to do is we're going to have five different computers on screen at so basically each of you in one of these vertical columns that you see is going to be a computer consisting of four people so we see five computers each one is a vertical row uh and so that's computer number one is started with me and sophia computer number two is with naomi and so on and so forth and the top row is going to be input the second row is going to be storage the third row is going to be processing and the fourth row is going to be output so look look at where you will look at where you are in the computer on the screen and you'll see which computer number uh column you fall under and you'll see what part of the pr um the computing stage you are in the on the roads right so alexander who's raising his hand he's part of the processing for computer number three yep or aloe is part of computer number three storage so all right so now all of our computers are going to do something so if you're in the input row i want you to grab a piece of paper and also if you're in the in a pen and if you're in the output row also grab a piece of paper and a pen so if you grab a piece of paper because we're part of input for computer number one so we're using paper because the original computers and this the first computers used paper as their only way of input and output before there were microphones and cameras and even keyboards on a computer the earliest computers you fed them information on a card with little holes in it and then they printed out information after they very true and that's those were the machine the machine computers that the word computer is basically referring to a human being who would compute information so if you were the person to do the work you were called the computer yep exactly so what i want everybody in the input row i want you to use your pen to pick a number between one through five and draw that many dots on your paper make them big dots so that we can see them when you hold them up to the camera sophia can you draw one of these so any number a number between one to five don't make it too big of a number because because that's too many dots and make them thick dots so that when you hold them up to the camera we can see them all right sophia can you show your number good job zion thank you nikki great job naomi all right so all right come on thank you right we've got all these numbers on screen so everybody who's in storage i want you to use your fingers to show how many dots you see from the input above you so look at the number above you and hold up that number of dots and hold them up using your fingers and make sure we see them now if you're holding up your hand to show the dots make sure you keep your hand up don't bring it down your job is to remember what was there so even when the dots disappear keep your hand up all right all right so now can the dots go away all the pieces of paper i want you to write down a new number of dots pick a different number you can maybe add a and again pick a number between one to five the handson screen don't don't bring your hands down because you're still remembering the previous number so let's see a new number on screen okay sophia has one dot all right nikki can you hold yours down just a bit so we can see there you go all right so can whoever is doing the drawings on the screen stop doing that right so now uh for everybody who's in processing the third row of the computer take a look at the number you see in storage which is the one the row the second row and then look at the new inputs and add them together so you see one number that's being stored in memory which is the first time we hold up the dots then a new number which is the new input and add these two together and show that with your fingers on the screen so you see for example sophia is holding one dot and right above her kayleen is showing three fingers so one plus three is four and naomi is showing two dots and power lies that's your one dot right so now everybody who's basically doing processing is showing a new number alexander can you hold your number up higher so we can see it okay you're gonna alexander i'm holding up three because that's the memory that was in storage and nicki's holding up two because that's the new number so you have to add those together two plus three there you go thanks alex all right so we all have numbers showing so now the dots can stop showing their inputs and what i want but for the processing folks don't change your numbers now if you're an output now write down the number you see in processing right above you so and people in processing make sure your numbers are very obvious if folks can write down and write it down as a number not as dots so if you see the number four you write down the number four and all right so anjali is writing down six great job kate all right and kate wrote down the number five all right well thank you so much guys so uh i think somebody just dropped off the camera which kind of changes this a little bit for us so what we just did is we showed the different parts of a computer basically involve inputting information which in our case the input was a piece of paper remembering that information which said even if the paper changed you remember what's going on processing that information in our case we just did very simple addition and then getting the results and outputting them and the output we did was with paper now we did this with pen and paper but the inputs and outputs of a computer can be completely different the input could be a sound you get from the microphone and then you record that sound inside the computer in the memory and the processing of that sound could be like a you know changing the volume or remixing it and then outputting the sound comes out for the speakers everything a computer does and what defines what a computer is is those four things of input storing information processing that information and outputting it and every computer whether it's a tablet a gaming desktop a phone the car gps system all of those do those same four things we have an entire video series about how computers work that goes into a lot more detail and we're going to share that at the end of this episode for folks to watch it's about 50 minutes of videos and it features bill gates himself who created one of the most popular computer operating systems ever to explain to you that these parts of a computer and how they work so uh before we say goodbye to aloe i want to uh do a lightning round with you aloe so aloe you're our sixth and final special guest to play our lightning round game uh sophia is going to put 60 seconds on the clock and she's going to keep score you're going to be getting a bunch of quick questions and your goal is to see how many questions you can answer in 60 seconds okay our high score was set by macklemore who got 14 answers uh in in 60 seconds oh my goodness yeah it's kind of hard it's pretty high stress but i'm sure you'll do okay sophie you ready yes aloe you ready yes all right go what are your feelings about pineapple on pizza i love it something you can't every no matter how many people love it jalapenos your favorite smell jasmine your favorite article of clothing hat strangest thing in your refrigerator hummus something you wish you could have learned as a kid coding what's your best advice you've ever gotten study the greats as a kid what did you want to be when you grew up a neuroscientist what is the superhero power you wish you had automatically create food first thing you do in the morning check my email what were your hobbies when you were a kid riding bikes um okay you got 10 which is really good all right great that's great and by the way aloe meant you mentioned that you wanted to learn coding but aloe's actually one of the reasons we've highlighted aloe not only in this episode but on on many code videos as well is because when the internet first came out allah was one of the first musicians to create his own website and to use that to promote his music and it's an important lesson that even if you want to become a rock star or an athlete whatever field you want to go into understanding how technology works is super important as well thank you um so alan i know we're out of time and we're running late for your schedules can we switch to gallery view and have everybody say goodbye to aloe as we add yvonne with our episode bye everybody thank you all right it's been a pleasure thank you so happy learning bye bye before we welcome our next special guest i want to take a quick break for a short trivia question so it's trip video time so the question is what does the acronym bios stand for bios and if you're not on the zoom call the options are booting info on startup the next option is basic input output system the third option is bytes in operating system and the fourth option is begin input output scan right so almost half of our audience has already voted on these so what does the acronym bios stand for all right it sounds like most people got this right if we could share the results on screen almost all of you got it correct so the basic input output system uh what that is or the bios of a computer it's like the operating system but it's at a much more detailed sort of lower level thing basically the bios is the little bit of code that runs the immediate moment when you turn on a computer when you immediately turn on the phone it's the thing that tests to make sure that all the inputs and outputs work that there is a keyboard that the memory actually exists that the wires are actually working and so on and once this step is complete it then actually loads the real operating system which could be windows or android or ios and then passes control of the computer to the operating system which then takes over and manages everything that happens so i want to welcome our second special guest at today brett are you here with us i'm here hi brett it's great to see you where are you calling us from uh calling from lafayette california which is uh right next to oakland california if any of you know where that is uh well i know where that is but uh i wanted to ask sort is is where you at are people out and about yet are you still in quarantine mode are you staying at home or can you get together we're still sheltering in place um though some businesses are opening up so um it's a little bit more normal than it was though uh still you know the kids are i have three kids uh 10 uh eight and five and um a lot of their summer activities are still at home yeah it's rough to be spending summer at home uh brett by the way for those of you who didn't read our introductions is currently the president of salesforce he used to be the chief technology officer of facebook and he's also the cocreator and inventor of google maps which i know i use pretty much every day at least when i'm not sheltering in place or quarantining brett can you share us a little bit about your involvement with google maps how old were you when you were working on google maps uh and can you tell us a little bit about the the project that got that going yeah sure i was i was 25 years old when we launched google maps and actually 24 years old turned 25 a couple months after so really it was at my first job right out of university i'm at google and for me when i think about it i think that most of the really cool products that you use um that are created by code are done by teams and it was interesting when i i feel really proud that i helped make google maps because so many people around the world use it now hundreds of millions of people use it but it was really a whole team that did it we had one engineer on the team named jens who was really good at drawing um so he was responsible for all the way the maps looked um which you know at the time was uh i think was one of the most beautiful maps and it really helped people want to use google maps over some of the other mapping technologies at the time my friend jim he was best at algorithms and so he designed the algorithm that helped make driving directions work so when you say you know i want to go from san francisco to new york you can imagine how many different ways you could do that how many different roads you could drive on he came up with a way to find the best route to take into account how fast the highways were the different speed limits really really complicated math and he was the best at that and i spent a lot of time on the user interface which is really i think a fun topic you're talking about inputs and outputs i um wrote all the code that um so when you took your mouse and you dragged the map i made it move in the right way um and that was really my specialty and on the other side of that the team of about five of us made google maps and now there's a much bigger team working on it but it was one of those fun coding projects of my life it's pretty awesome if only five people made the first version and pretty much everything we use in technology that we sort of society upholds sort of individuals as the inventors but they're always made by teams of people behind them doing different parts and since today we're learning about the different parts of a computer such as input and output one thing that made google maps special before all the other compared to all the maps that came before it is in the past anytime you wanted to move the map the entire map would need to load start to bottom and you couldn't even move your mouse left and right to drag the mouse drag the map we are now accustomed the idea on a touch screen you touch and you move it and you give it the input and then the output which is the monitor shows basically the map scrolling and google maps was really the first version that did that uh and when it happened and people saw that for the first time was a pretty magical experience that now you take for granted yeah i mean what's so fun about talking about input and output is it sounds so simple but honestly it's the most important part of the way we work with computers you know back when hottie and i started coding the way you talk to a computer was just through a text interface so you typed on a keyboard and you saw text come back on the screen and then it became a graphical user interface so you could see pictures on the screen and you could use a mouse along with a keyboard to both input things into computer and see the output and that was really as you said hottie with google maps we realized you know the modern mapping systems weren't taking advantage of all these new ways that you could input and output data from the computer and when we thought of a creative new way of doing it it really changed mapping forever but actually the most interesting part of google maps wasn't even created by us i think was created by steve jobs who is the um obviously the founder of apple um who makes iphones like this one right here you know when they introduced this they introduced a new way to input into a computer which was your finger and i think i can say that the moment i took my finger and dragged a google map i thought wow this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life and so you know i think when you think about all the cool things you're going to make with code a lot of the new experiences we make are because of new ways of input and new ways of output and i'm really excited about virtual reality i'm really excited about you know new forms of user interfaces being created all around the world right now and i think the way you all will code for computers 10 years from now is going to be really different than the computers of today and that's pretty exciting so we're going to learn a little bit about the graphical user interface inside coding which has also changed a lot and i know that your kids use code.org we're going to switch to uh codingoncode.org to complete a game that sophie and i are gonna be coding uh to basically learn about the parts inside of a computer so i'm gonna share my screen and what you see here is code.org sprite lab and we've started this game with these really cool graphics that we're very very proud of and this kind of fancy looking computer that we're gonna put together and if i run the game i can put the different parts inside the computer so this here is the cpu on its motherboard and this here is a memory and brett can you find any input devices that i can attach to this computer yeah why don't we start with maybe the keyboard the keyboard is one of the inputs all right any other input devices i think a mouse is a good input device that's another input device and as output we have this little black thing which is our monitor doesn't really look like a monitor but the screen on your laptop is black until you turn it on uh and that's basically the output that shows what's on your screen uh and then this last part is the power cord but we can't drag it because this part doesn't work yet and i want to turn the computer on by clicking on it but that doesn't work because it doesn't have any power so that's the part that sophia and i are going to be coding right now so i'm going to stop this for a second and before we get into the coding i wanted to point out that this little thing here was not even draggable all the other sprites on the screen were draggable and the way that happened is something that happened in the starter code here when you see reset game this is basically a function we wrote last week we learned about abstraction and how functions can have lots of code inside them so if i click the edit button here you can see all of the code that goes into starting the game uh you don't need to know what all this code does it basically sets things up but sophia if you go to the very very bottom it makes all the sprites on the screen draggable so the keyboard is draggable and the mouse is draggable and so on but the power unit is not draggable so go into behaviors and then say sprite begins and add that in there and now you can make rabbit draggable but not the reaction but not the rabbit yeah let's make the power unit draggable and then go into behaviors and say being draggable so now your power unit is draggable oops it's glitchy is it glitching for you right now hit close all right and now hit start so we can yes hit run so we can see if the power unit is draggable right draggable but it's not clicking into place like those other things did so let's write the code to make it click right so if you look on the screen it shows what happens right now when the memory chip touches the computer i'm going to refresh the screen share because it's glitching a little bit for people so i'm going to start this over give me just one second i'm going to stop the show can i share a story about building a computer sure go ahead yeah so when i was a kid um i couldn't afford a computer from a computer store but it was cheaper if i bought all the parts of a computer and i built it myself so if i bought the memory and i bought the cpu and i bought the case and the first time i did it i had this exact same top problem hottie which is i finished doing it and i screwed it in with a screwdriver and i turned it on and it didn't work and i had to take the entire thing apart and i had forgotten to connect the power supply to the cpu and the computer wouldn't turn on and so one it's one engineering principle that i think is really important is always test the entire way you know when you're writing code don't wait to the end to see if your code's working always run it and see what happens i learned that the hard way when i was building my first computer a true story that's wonderful yeah and that's why we tested at the mouse that the power unit was draggable before we jumped into doing anything else and i hope this works right now so i'm going to run this code again and we can drag the power unit but it doesn't click into place but at least the code that we wrote does something so now if you look at this code here this shows what happens how we make it lock into place we want to do something like this which is how the memory locks into place so we're going to recreate something like that so start with creating an event block and so you see when the rabbit touches the carrot but we don't have a rabbit or a cat but we can say when the power unit touches the computer we want to make it click into place yeah someone's drawing so what happens when the power unit touches the computer first thing we want to do is make it stop being draggable and then being draggable yep but right now you said make the rabbit stop being grabbable and then the other thing we want to do is we want to have it jump and lock into place see how it says jump this memory unit jumps to a location so go into actions and have the sprite jump and instead of a random location we want to pick our own location so go into locations and see that little thing with a pin in it it's right in the middle click that and choose a location kind of halfway between the power yeah a little bit yeah that's that's a good location over there yep that's good so now let's hit run and see if that works it's glitching oh did it lock in a bad place i'm gonna oh it's because you have the rabbit jumping we need to make this be the power unit so this is exactly as brad said we need to test every step of the way i'm glad we tested to see what the problem was there so if we hit run now click run again and you can move it and it jumps into place perfect but we want to make a sound when it jumps into place as well so can you go into the world and choose play sound all right and now we can choose a sound all right let's gonna choose a digital sound so we have let's pick some of these choices play the ring one and then start up play the whistle and the win all right we're going to choose one of these sounds brett do you have a favorite and let's also pull the entire i like the win that made me laugh all right let's house the whole audience and we'll play the sounds and so we can choose uh so ring startup whistle and win all right and let's share the audience poll results i think everybody else agreed with you brett uh so we're gonna go with the win right uh and then the last thing we want to do is we can actually uh if you look what is happening here when we're adding these commands if you look above there's a command here that says change parts by one what that's doing is incrementing a variable which is something we learned a few weeks ago and if the reason is doing that it's counting how many parts we put inside the computer because at the end we're going to test and see if parts reaches 6 we'll let the computer turn on so basically we need to increase this variable as well so we're going to need to choose one of the variable codes to change change parts by one um and i think that's good you hit the run button now this should all work put the other parts in the inputs the outputs we got the storage of processing and then put the power and now you can turn on the computer yay yay it all works yeah we can i wanted to leave that for the audience to do later so there's lots of things you can add to this first of all you can change the look and feel of the power unit once it's connected we have a little costume you can change light up and show power uh but we're going to share this app with you so you can actually sophie you can do that right now while i'm talking about it so you can add the costume if you want um so this app that we just made is very simple but we're going to let you extend it so you can add other computer parts you can have other sort of parts like more memory and so on you can add other inputs and outputs and if you want to do something advanced you can actually go go further and make an actual smartphone version of this so you put the parts inside of a smartphone together and we'll send that to you as part of your challenges the other cool thing and brad i don't know if you've seen this is we can share this out to everybody so this app that we made we're going to share and if you see that little qr code if you have a phone with you which bret i saw that you had you can scan that qr code on that on your phone right now and you'll get a little notification so you need to turn on your phone's camera and then if you just hold it up to that qr code it'll show a little notification and then you can get the app that we just put together that's awesome yeah and then you can play it on your own computer you can play it on your own and it works just like we just did so you can have fun making a computer and this time don't forget to connect the power supply and it'll start working so before we say goodbye to brett just one thing i want to say today we're joined by some teachers along uh who are basically computer science principals teachers who are graduating this year uh cs principles is the most popular computer science course in america's high schools right now and these teachers have students who are graduating and as you know they've all been basically studying at home for the latter part of the year many of them had to take an ap exam uh as part of that and we wanted to give a special shout out to the students who worked so hard to accomplish their goals in the midst of a global pandemic before we say hi to these folks i want to do an audience poll to ask how many of the students joining us right now are graduating this year and this means whether you're a senior in high school or whether you're you know in elementary school in fifth grade and leaving your school and going to a new school how many of you are graduates or from eighth grade to yeah or ending middle school to go into high school so wow i did not expect to see so many graduating students this year it's pretty awesome to see how many of our students are it's amazing congratulations everyone so we haven't shared the poll results if we could share those yeah about a quarter of all the students on code break are graduating so what a special moment today we congratulate all of you for your graduation and i wanted to invite a teacher uh to join us so is shanti there i'm here hi shanti where are you calling us from i'm calling from ohio cleveland ohio cleveland ohio it's so great to meet you and thank you for all of your hard work helping your students make it through this year uh i know you were hoping to have some of your graduating students join us as panelists but i think it was hard to put together can you read out the names of your students you have some students are actually here though as well um they're they're on as well um so uh mary hudson she's here she just waved uh ashanti hamilton she's under shayla sharp and um so those two are here with us along with some other uh cs students but our other cs graduates are jefferson agitate janaya wheeler rihanna blanchett anaya clark jonathan clay the saint chesney marquita edwards mylena edwards camario malone jalen debose nyla house davion mosley dalita powell samaj stewart tamaya williams and davon thank you so much uh we're gonna unmute everybody uh and to clap for all these students and brett if you don't see all those students you can click this button to to see all the faces and shantae you're calling from cleveland ohio is that right yes but um we i teach at shaw high school in east cleveland ohio awesome all right so let's unmute everybody in the audience thank you and brett uh you know we give a round of applause for shanti students but if you want to share some words to congratulate not just shanti students but the many hundreds of students who are joining us on code breaker graduating and who aren't getting their own graduation ceremony if you want to share some final words with them well i also say congratulations uh it's such an achievement to graduate and in particular right now in this completely unprecedented time it's so hard to be uh sheltered in place in our homes and and to not get the celebration of some of these graduations but i just want to say so many of the great technologies we've used are created by young people and by students so take all the skills you've learned and take all the creativity you have and the beginners mind you have about um what you want to create and create the future i'm looking forward to seeing all the the cool things you all build with the skills you learned this year thank you so much well thank you so much brett and we're going to say goodbye to brett if you could play an applause sound sofia avaya and it was great to see you and thank you for joining us thank you for having me and uh it was really nice to meet you all right byebye and i'd like to now welcome back our third and final guest senior software engineering manager at microsoft powell mejia welcome paola hi heidi thank you so much for having me hi there uh and sofia you can uh head out sophie's gonna say goodbye to us and we're gonna be joined by my son darius hi hey there is how are you darius is 13. paolo where are you calling us from i am calling from seattle washington just like you and you've worked on many tools that many students are familiar with like microsoft office 365 or bing and microsoft teams can you share with us a little bit about your back story and what it took to become a software engineer at microsoft yeah yeah absolutely so my journey with microsoft actually started back when i was in college in my senior year i did an internship in the summer of 2006 and then i joined fulltime at microsoft in 2007 and over the span of all these years i have worked in office you know which is the family of products like ward and excel and powerpoint um and then i was there for some time i transitioned to bing.com and i was there for about seven years and my last role has been in microsoft teams so i have been there for about three years and that one has been by far you know one of the most exciting products i've worked on i'm not sure you know maybe some of you guys have had the chance to join some online classes or do some video calling using microsoft teams um we're building a collaborative platform you know to facilitate education and collaboration in the workspace but overall it has been a fantastic ride at microsoft i have been there for about 13 years and it's been full of great opportunities to learn new technologies and also to work with a lot of really talented people and you did a lot of internships when you were trying to get get effective into your career can you talk a little bit about that yeah so when i was actually in college i i was trying to apply for an internship at microsoft um i think it took about three attempts to get to the final internship offer during my years in school i was primarily focused on extracurricular projects you know while i was building a strong resume and i was getting more expertise in the technical field one of the things that i did when i was back in school was the imagine cup competition i actually made it to the finals on national stage in mexico and that's where i was born and raised and and where i went to school so um gaining all of that experience since i was uh in school really helped me towards my journey being a software engineer in the tech field and was your internship at microsoft yes yeah i did that internship at microsoft so just two weeks ago we actually met with scott forstall who uh he did his first internship at microsoft as well and he moved on to work at apple and was one of the inventors of the iphone said you can start with an internship at a tech company and move on to create great things so i can't wait to see what you do further on in your career thank you so we want to move on to the last part of our episode which is to learn about circuits because today we're learning about hardware we started learning about input and output in the different aspects of what a computer does and then the parts inside the computer now we want to actually write code to control a circuit this is really different than anything we've done and i'm going to actually share my screen soon to show you but what we're going to do is we're going to write code to code this circuit which is an adafruit circuit playground it uses a architecture called arduino which is a very popular way of basically controlling really small circuits you can purchase one of these it costs about twenty dollars and we're going to send a link to you at the end if you want to and if you look at this thing it has lots of inputs and outputs on it so for example right here there's little buttons you can click uh and around it there are lights but there's lots of other inputs and outputs for example it has an accelerometer that detects if i'm turning it or moving it it even has a temperature sensor inside it and a microphone to hear sound uh do you have uh thoughts on any of those in terms of what those can be useful for yeah so um i mean you can think of circuit boards being present pretty much everywhere in our lives right like if you think about the temperature um like a thermostat for example the ones that we have at home you know it's it's another way of taking information from um an external source and process that and then have an output to tell you something exactly so now we're gonna i'm gonna screen share and this is a slightly different type of screen share for me uh and i'm gonna show us how we do the code to control this circuit so i'm gonna screen share portion of my screen can you all see uh yeah i can see it it's okay and there's two versions of my video now so i'm gonna stop one of them to simplify this so what we see here on the left hand side is app lab which you're comfortable with and here's an app that we're making and all the code for it but i did something here i clicked this gear and i chose to enable the maker toolkit which added a whole new category of commands here see here where it says circuit these are all the blocks that manage things that can happen with this circuit board now over here is the code that controls what our app does and it uses some of these blocks and what we're going to do is we're going to create an app that lets you doodle and draw but using the board as the controller not the mouse a few weeks ago we had the founder of instagram show us how to make an image doodler where you move the mouse around and you draw on the screen and you could choose different colors or you could change the thickness of your drawing but the input device for the drawing was a mouse i want to use this little thing as our input device and the input is going to be by moving it around we're going to draw on the screen and we've already started this code up here it basically has a function here saying onboard event when the accelerometer makes an event and the accelerometer is going to give us a pitch and a roll the pitch is when we move it forward and backwards and the role is when we turn right or left and those those are basically the inputs and outputs of this device and uh you can see here the code that basically text gets the pitch from the accelerometer and it gets the roll from the accelerometer so darius here is going to add some very simple code that allows the pitch and roll of this thing to control the drawing on the screen so we want to use the turtle drawing commands so go into turtle and then say move forward but instead of moving forward 25 pixels move forward pitch pixels so if my pitch is positive and i'm leaning forward it'll move forward that many and if it's negative and moving backwards it'll go backwards and then also now turn right and turn right how what should you turn by how many degrees the roll which is how much we're going left and right so enter the roll there oops you misspelled it all right and just like the examples you were saying about the computers right like when you take an input from something else like the mouse and in this case it's gonna be the movements that you do back and forth and left and right right exactly the inputs are what we get from the accelerometer and the outputs are the move forward and turn right which controls what shows up on the screen so there is can you hit run and i'm going to see if this works all right so i'm leaning forward and it moves forward and then i lean back and it moves backwards and then if i turn right it goes in this crazy circle if and you can change the colors as i'm drawing too if you want oh cool wow and this all right this is going a little bit out of control it's kind of hard to draw with this because it's moving kind of too fast so can you reset it yeah all right so that was going too fast so what could we do to actually make it not move so fast so i can control this more more carefully oh we could do like move forward my pitch divided by like eight all right so you're gonna do some so we'll still go in the direction of the pitch and roll but you're dividing it by some numbers that so it doesn't go quite as aggressively we'll see maybe it's still too fast all right i'm gonna try it again and you can change the colors all right i'm going to lean forward and it's moving forward then i'm going to turn right and i'm going to oh you made it thicker i'm going to turn left that doesn't do anything right now oh so as i'm moving forward i can even move backwards by leaning backwards all right this is kind of fun but one problem with this is basically it's continuously drawing and if i want to stop the drawing i can't lift up the pen and white ink yeah white well white ink you can lift up my face it's an eraser so can you hit reset for a second so there's these buttons on this this left and right button i want to make those macy lift up the pen and put down the pen so we can draw something more complicated and so we can do that using events which we learned about last week so you can even put us into show blocks now if you go into the circuit block area there's an onboard event if you drag that out it enables events so it says onboard if in the event of a button left being down so that's basically that's the left button so when that's down what should we do pen up pen up so i'm going to turtle and say pen up pen up and let's do the opposite for the button right so what can we do there paulo you want to help us as well we can we can say on event band button r yeah yeah and then from the turtle we could do pen down and you know this circuit also can make sounds so i want to make it so when we press these buttons we actually hear some sounds coming out of this board yeah on the defense so can you go back to the circuit blocks and can you paula help us see if you can see anything that sounds buzzer note i think here let's do buzzer notes yeah um e4 i think a4 means like the abcde notes on a keyboard yeah okay and that 100 is the duration so we can change that to make it longer or like something else if it's 100 duration that's gotta be milliseconds can we pick a different sound for the other one here let's do c4 yeah four one thousand no we're not ten all right now let's run that and see what happens okay so now if i lean forward it should draw and if i hit the right button the pin is down the left button lifts the pen so now i'm moving around i can turn right and turn left and then right button puts the pen down and makes that little sound and the left button lifts it can you all hear the sound it's making yeah i can hear it right this is not easy to control it's like flying an airplane yeah you can try um i actually want to ask the audience to suggest something for us to draw here oh go ahead you can try um let's do an audience poll for what we can try to draw now with this cool little tool we've got uh there's oops this is on the screen so there's i want to make this easy for me so choose a plus sign please the plus sign is the easiest thing to draw plus sign can can everybody vote for a plus sign because the cat is very popular i think the plus sign is what i want people to vote for yeah i could draw the character it'll it might look like a government all right let's share let's share the poll results okay so it sounds like nobody wants to have me draw a plus sign we'll have to try drawing a cat uh all right so this is not going to be easy at all but i i'm going to try drawing a cat i'm gonna lift up the pen or i'll turn it down and very so you can control the colors if you want so this will be the cat face i'm gonna do the outline of the cat face oh my gosh this is so hard ah this is like an ear it looks like an ear oh no great this is actually better than i thought it would be because i'd practice it a little earlier all right i'm going backwards now it's going in reversal it connects oh not as good as we're going to get on the cat face it's a really nice cat can you help me with the eyes make the eyes a different color all right where should i make the eyes that's one eye no this cat has giant eyes all right i think this is as good as we're gonna get with the cat you can try making the whiskers if you want so what we oops you hit reset well what we learned there is how to write code that controls inputs and outputs you know when you use commands like move forward or turn right that's putting drawings on the screen and that's controlling the circuits inside your computer that actually put stuff on the screen but whether you're handling a computer or a chip like this the inputs and outputs start as being really simple like little buttons and an event that detects a mouse move is just like an attempt an event that detects a button being down or a command that says move forward or turn right is just like a command that says play the buzzer note in every one of these cases the code you're writing is controlling the inputs and outputs on the screen and when a computer works it receives information through the inputs it runs code to basically manage processing that information and it runs code to basically store that information process it and then uses output whether to show something on the screen to play a sound etc thank you so much for being patient with my terrible airplane drawing skills uh so we shared that app with you but there's a lot more you can do with it and if you want to give us your email address just can you hear me some of those things we want we'll send you instructions for how you can actually make your own using the same board uh so if we don't already have your email address you can go to code.org break code.org break and if you sign up here we'll be able to send you today's challenges for you to try out and there's a bunch of things you can get in these challenges first of all we'll send you the short video series i mentioned about how computers work and that's going to basically be this 40 minute long video series that talks about the different parts of a computer and how they actually work at detail and it features bill gates the founder of microsoft explaining the insides of a computer then we'll send you that sprite lab game that sophia and i worked on together and you can add to that project by adding speakers or a camera or more memory and make a more complicated uh computer inside that game and then lastly if you're able to purchase a circuit playground they cost 20 bucks we'll send you a link for one of those then you can use app lab to do much more complicated stuff than the little drawing thing that darius and i just did uh you know you can we'll obviously send you the app that we just made so you can improve on it and play with it the way i just did but we'll also send you ideas for other projects you could do so since this is our very last episode of quote break i wanted to spend some time to give a special thanks to all the parents and teachers who've been joining us and who've made it possible for their children to tune in to code break and participate in their activities first of all if you want to give your own shout out to a parent to your mom and dad please use our question form as i sent earlier about code.org questions and i want to do a quick audience poll how many of the students for joining us today are watching with their parents many of you i know are just watching code break alone but a whole bunch of you are doing here with you with your parents next to you and we want to do something special to recognize all the parents all right if you could share the poll results so it looks like one third of our audience is actually joining us with the parents paola uh before we go thanking our parents can you share a little bit about your own parents and how they helped you as you were getting into computer science yeah absolutely um so i was born and raised in mexico and i grew up in a city called veracruz which you know where the opportunities to learn computer science were very limited so both of my parents are chemical engineers my mom was actually the first female engineer in the family and they really wanted to support me in a journey where i had all the tools to face a world that's constantly changing so without their support i wouldn't have been able to make it to where i am today um you know but between my parents and also my teachers um they taught me that you know there may be a lot of no's along the way but it only takes one yes to get the the next opportunity and to get on the right track so to the moms and dads joining us today thank you thank you for being there thank you for making a difference i want to thank my parents specifically they have been so inspiring to me and honestly without them i don't think i would have been able to accomplish everything i have that's wonderful one thing that studies have shown is that encouragement from a parent is one of the most important things to keep to basically ensure persistence of young kids in computer science especially among girls or students of color who are typically underrepresented in the field encouragement from their parent is one of the most important ways to get them to stick with it i'd like to invite our producer akira who missed last week's episode to also join me and to read out some of the shout outs to parents from all the students tuning in at home so akira can you join us on screen for a second yes thanks hattie so we have a couple of shout outs to parents um we have one from aniola from the past manitoba in canada and they say i want to thank my mom and dad as they are both essential workers my mom works at a hospital and my dad is a teacher so i think there's accommodation all around on that one dominic says i'd like to give a shout out to my grandma for letting me do code break so i'm really glad that we have grandma's encouragement and finally we have adees and caleb from maddie reading massachusetts and i believe both of them have joined us as former panelists on code break and they said our parents mocta and sent yahoo we want to thank them for working so hard to support us and take care of us not only during this quarantine but for our whole lives they're our main inspiration to learn thank you so much uh and if you could uh just briefly if darris could play an applause sound uh hold on this is coming in right here and i want to basically make a special thanks if we could basically go to gallery mode and basically give a round of applause uh if we could unmute all the students a round of applause to thank all of our students and all of our panelists our parents to to to congratulate the graduating seniors as well as their teachers and lastly a special thanks to our special guests this week alo uh brett and paula i lastly want to say you know this is our very last code break so we're done and we're going to say goodbye to you but if you want to continue learning you can go to code.org at home all the tools and games and things we've learned about are there and there's a whole bunch of other activities we'll be emailing this to you as well and lastly if you want to help support code.org if you want to buy a hat like my cool hat or a tshirt like the one sophia was wearing you can go to code.org shop or you can just google for code.org on amazon and then lastly all of our work is only made possible thanks to generous charitable donations so if any of the parents want to support code.org if you go to code.org help that's the best way for you to basically help the work that we're doing there's many millions of students who learn computer science and coding on code.org we've had we just passed 50 million students on code.org we want to reach 50 million more students and we only need your help to do that thank you so much everybody who's been with us throughout the last three months of the quarantine uh this is our very last code break so we're just gonna say one big wave goodbye please enjoy your summer breaks and when you're bored and you want some some creativity make sure to take a code break goodbye everybody guys goodbye so you
