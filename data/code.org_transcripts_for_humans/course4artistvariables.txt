With timestamps:

00:04 - A variable is a container you can store a
value in. When you use that variable in an
00:10 - algorithm, it opens up the container and looks
at the value inside. This lets you write smarter
00:16 - algorithms that behave differently depending
on the value stored in the variable. For example,
00:21 - if you wanted to write an algorithm to say
Happy birthday, you're turning 10! to my little
00:27 - brother, that's great now but when I run it
next year I'd want it to say, Happy birthday,
00:32 - you're turning 11! I could create a variable
called age to store my brother's age and write
00:39 - my algorithm to say Happy birthday, you're
turning 'age' instead. Because variable can
00:44 - change, every year I can update the variable
'age' to equal 'age' plus 1. In this puzzle,
00:52 - we're going to be using a variable that will
set the length of the line our artist draws.
00:57 - Later on in our code, the move forward block
will look at that length variable to see what
01:02 - value you've set it to.
