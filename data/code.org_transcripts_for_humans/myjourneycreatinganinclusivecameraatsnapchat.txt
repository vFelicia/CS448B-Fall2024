00:10 - hello everyone welcome my name is
00:13 - kanikiha and i'm a curriculum
00:15 - development manager here at code.org
00:18 - as a curriculum development manager
00:20 - that means i get to make lessons make
00:23 - activities uh make lessons plans lesson
00:26 - plans and gather feedback about how all
00:28 - of those things are working in
00:30 - classrooms from teachers and students
00:31 - like yourself who are tuning in today
00:33 - i'm really excited to
00:36 - join you all today and thanks to all the
00:37 - classrooms who are tuning in
00:39 - for today's my journey class chat
00:42 - teachers we've enabled live closed
00:44 - captioning for all of our class chats
00:47 - today we are excited and lucky to
00:49 - welcome bertrand st prue as a product
00:52 - manager at snap who started and lead
00:54 - snap's inclusive camera team to ensure
00:57 - snap's camera works well for everyone
00:59 - regardless of their skin tone cultural
01:01 - background beauty standards or ability
01:04 - teachers please let us know where you're
01:06 - tuning in from
01:07 - and put your students questions for
01:09 - bertrand in the q a we'll try our best
01:11 - to get to some of those during the chat
01:12 - today
01:14 - uh
01:15 - merchant will start with a uh fun
01:17 - icebreaker uh so it's just a little
01:19 - would you rather would you rather be
01:21 - able to
01:22 - breathe underwater or be able to
01:25 - fly and i'll go first uh i think i'm
01:28 - gonna say
01:30 - flying i just i think the the idea of
01:32 - moving quickly through the air is a cool
01:34 - sensation and the the views that you
01:37 - could get from being able to fly are
01:39 - definitely uh something that i would
01:42 - treasure so how about yourself
01:44 - i'd definitely say flying as well um
01:47 - this it would make traveling so much
01:49 - easier there's so many places i'd be
01:50 - able to go
01:51 - um and i wouldn't need a car
01:55 - yeah for sure where someone where
01:57 - somewhere you would want to fly where
01:58 - you would want to travel if you had that
01:59 - ability japan easily japan
02:02 - oh very cool very cool my
02:05 - my my father's side of the family is
02:06 - from japan so i've lived there for a
02:08 - year so that's that's awesome cool very
02:10 - cool well uh well welcome bertrand again
02:13 - thanks for joining us today um we'd love
02:16 - to just start with a little uh
02:17 - introduction from yourself and if you
02:19 - could tell us a little bit about your
02:20 - work and what you do at snack
02:23 - yeah um so again my name is beatron
02:25 - sampua or bertrand st prue
02:27 - i'm a product manager at snapchat um and
02:31 - i work
02:32 - to build products to make the camera
02:34 - more inclusive no matter who you are um
02:37 - your skin tone your race culture beauty
02:40 - standards or just whoever you are
02:42 - essentially making the camera work for
02:43 - you uh and so that is a really really
02:46 - fun and impactful project that i'm
02:48 - really happy to say i work on
02:50 - um
02:51 - and
02:52 - yeah oh and i'm also from miami florida
02:55 - and if you can tell from my name or not
02:56 - um i'm very haitian which is a
02:59 - country in the caribbean um yeah
03:02 - awesome cool well um yeah you mentioned
03:06 - this inclusive camera i wonder if you
03:08 - could just tell us what what is it and
03:11 - and just maybe give us a little bit more
03:12 - background about it about it
03:14 - yeah so the inclusive camera is
03:16 - essentially um a way in which uh snap is
03:20 - working to recreate the camera um to
03:23 - work better for folk the camera has
03:25 - unfortunately not worked um inclusively
03:27 - of everyone uh
03:29 - in its history it started off um working
03:32 - for for lighter skin tones because the
03:35 - shirley card and various other uh the
03:37 - surely card which is a color correction
03:39 - card um that folks used to use to go
03:41 - into
03:42 - um photo hut this is way back in like
03:44 - the 1940s and 50s well into our parents
03:47 - and parents uh grandparents um when they
03:50 - used to go develop their photos it was
03:51 - all developed against a photo um of a
03:54 - woman who was white uh and it had the
03:57 - caption normal on it and so if you were
03:59 - never a person who
04:01 - uh
04:02 - who
04:03 - identified as a lighter-skinned person
04:06 - um and you went to get your photos
04:07 - developed then they just wouldn't be
04:09 - looking as good as they could be and so
04:11 - that history went on into the digital
04:14 - age and
04:16 - yeah that's what caused us at snap to be
04:18 - able to want to create an inclusive
04:20 - camera which recreates and rewrites the
04:22 - way that cameras are made
04:24 - from the process and software level on
04:26 - to better
04:28 - be able to take a picture of everyone no
04:30 - matter who you are
04:31 - and so there's a little bit of a
04:34 - video that i have to explain this a bit
04:36 - more
04:37 - um
04:39 - well uh well bertrand gets that video
04:40 - ready i just wanted to welcome folks
04:43 - joining from dover delaware pittsburgh
04:46 - sacramento north dakota so good to have
04:48 - people from all over the country joining
04:49 - today
05:01 - i think people of color assume that
05:03 - their skin tones are difficult to
05:04 - photograph because they've seen
05:06 - themselves in lights that are not
05:07 - complementary to how they look and
05:10 - that's absolutely not the case
05:12 - when you look at the camera technology
05:14 - when you look at the history of it
05:17 - when you look at how image making has
05:18 - evolved throughout the years
05:21 - there's some actual technological
05:24 - limitations when it comes to how we show
05:26 - up on screen
05:28 - my name is bertrand sampua
05:31 - and i am the lead for the inclusive
05:33 - camera i've experienced situations where
05:36 - like my skin has been lightened by the
05:37 - camera taking photos of myself and just
05:39 - like it doesn't work especially in low
05:41 - light settings you don't see me
05:44 - so i really want to improve that
05:46 - experience for myself and for the
05:47 - community
05:48 - my mom picking up a phone is assuming
05:50 - that this phone has the best interest
05:52 - for her skin tone and who she is and the
05:54 - photos she wants to take
05:56 - but there's that assumption there that
05:58 - it should be figured out already but it
06:00 - really isn't a lot of times camera
06:02 - companies are registering our skin
06:03 - colors as shadows instead of as skin so
06:06 - it just kind of becomes muddy
06:09 - the inclusive camera is just a camera
06:11 - that allows any person to be seen by the
06:12 - camera the way that they want to be seen
06:14 - the way that they are
06:16 - i love having a balance of like this was
06:18 - made with everybody in mind because that
06:20 - opens up a whole other path of like what
06:22 - creativity could look like when it's
06:24 - actually being made with good purpose
06:27 - you see that saturation that comes in it
06:29 - lifts it a lot it feels like there's a
06:31 - filter on it
06:34 - want every time that you open the
06:35 - snapchat camera to be a moment that you
06:36 - feel as though you can express yourself
06:38 - any way that you want to
06:40 - it's not going to be an easy journey and
06:42 - rebuilding our camera is just the first
06:44 - phase
06:44 - improving low light flash capture and
06:46 - exposure correction so that we can
06:48 - account for all people's skin tones and
06:50 - their undertones so that any person
06:52 - whatever phone they're picking up
06:53 - they're able to take a good selfie
06:55 - and this
06:56 - is just the beginning
07:07 - awesome bertrand thanks for sharing that
07:09 - video um
07:12 - you mentioned your title being a product
07:15 - manager and i feel like that that video
07:17 - showed some of some of your you at work
07:19 - a little bit and so i wonder if you
07:21 - could kind of talk about your role in
07:23 - this project i said you're the lead but
07:25 - what what is like the day-to-day what
07:27 - has that process been like of guiding
07:29 - that project
07:31 - yeah so um being a product manager uh
07:34 - pretty much means that like you define
07:36 - the vision of the product and from end
07:38 - to end from the concept of the product
07:40 - all the way to like it being released
07:42 - and even then after you're working with
07:44 - engineers designers and everyone in
07:46 - between to make sure that the product
07:47 - needs to be exactly what it needs to be
07:49 - for the community and especially in this
07:50 - case for the inclusive camera we're like
07:52 - redefining the whole like typical
07:54 - product um development process and so i
07:57 - work with a ton of photographers um
07:59 - someone which some of which you saw
08:01 - i work with like marketing and comms and
08:04 - just various folk to understand and tell
08:07 - like how do we tell the story to the
08:08 - community um and help them understand
08:10 - the product so it's a lot of hats that
08:13 - you get to wear as a product manager
08:14 - you're pretty much like the middle
08:15 - person of everything to make sure that
08:17 - the product is what it needs to be
08:21 - yeah i wonder that's
08:23 - so cool you get to interact with so many
08:24 - different people and like in super
08:27 - collaborative um i think that's
08:29 - something that uh you know students and
08:31 - teachers watching probably hopefully
08:32 - resonate with kind of that collaborative
08:34 - nature of computer science and building
08:36 - something together
08:38 - kind of can make it a fun subject
08:40 - i wonder you know you mentioned the
08:42 - photographers just because we saw them
08:43 - in the video could you talk a little bit
08:45 - about the
08:46 - the contribution
08:48 - um that they you know how did that back
08:50 - and forth go and what was their
08:52 - contribution to the the vision like you
08:54 - said
08:55 - yeah absolutely so um when i
08:58 - when i started this project and pitched
09:00 - it to the to the uh to the team um
09:04 - one thing that we realized was just that
09:06 - like
09:07 - even though we're a camera company and
09:08 - we have a camera team i was on the
09:11 - camera team even before um joining this
09:13 - project that there aren't any
09:14 - photographers on the camera team and so
09:17 - like what does it look like to actually
09:18 - bring those folk in and have them tune
09:20 - our algorithms for us so we created
09:22 - tools for them to be able to like um
09:24 - computational photography tools which is
09:26 - pretty much photography and technology
09:28 - and like how do you build photography
09:30 - into code which is what computational
09:33 - photography is and so we built a bunch
09:34 - of those algorithms and
09:37 - were a few of those algorithms and we
09:40 - we had them
09:41 - go through and tune it in similar to
09:43 - like photoshop like what does it look
09:45 - like for these algorithms to work on
09:46 - different people so we translated what
09:50 - we do is we work with them and they told
09:51 - us like what they would do with the
09:53 - normal dslr camera like the nikon
09:55 - cameras or kodak cameras um and we
09:58 - converted that into code so that our
10:00 - algorithms can work really
10:02 - well very cool um
10:06 - i also know
10:07 - that uh you know in the video i
10:09 - mentioned like some features of like
10:10 - flash correction and things like that
10:12 - like i wonder if you could talk more
10:13 - about some of the specific things that
10:15 - that have come out of this project yeah
10:17 - absolutely and i'm happy to be able to
10:19 - show some as well uh so pretty much one
10:22 - of the things that was just that was
10:23 - mentioned in that video was that we um
10:26 - work with these photographers not just
10:28 - on our algorithms but just to understand
10:29 - like flash capture and how to light
10:31 - people uh in lower light and so one of
10:34 - the features that we released is ring
10:35 - flash so in uh when folks are usually
10:38 - taking a flash if you use snapchat um
10:41 - and you're on the front facing camera
10:43 - and you go and take uh use flash and
10:45 - like it's really dark outside or dark
10:47 - inside or outside and like flashes on
10:50 - your face and you look at yourself like
10:51 - oh my goodness i did not realize that's
10:52 - what i look like um it happens to me all
10:55 - the times or it used to happen to me all
10:56 - the time um until
10:59 - we built ring flash which as i'm trying
11:02 - to share my screen give me this moment
11:05 - um
11:07 - oh we built ring flash which
11:09 - uh essentially
11:11 - illuminates the border around your
11:12 - screen um so that you can better take
11:16 - uh snaps at night and so
11:20 - while bertrand just gets that up uh just
11:23 - teachers out there and students feel
11:25 - free to keep submitting questions in the
11:26 - q a and we'll try our best to get to
11:29 - those uh later in the conversation but
11:31 - happy to submit those
11:39 - [Music]
11:51 - so
11:52 - usually when you're taking flash and
11:53 - actually i'm gonna make it darker in
11:54 - here so that y'all can truly see oh my
11:58 - goodness huh
12:11 - and so
12:12 - when it is darker in here and you
12:14 - take the flash i did not really know
12:16 - what i look like and oh this is uh i'll
12:20 - tell you what that is a little bit later
12:23 - but what ring flash does it illuminates
12:26 - the border around your screen
12:27 - so that you can better see yourself
12:30 - while you're taking the snap
12:35 - and so when it's really dark it works
12:36 - much better of course
12:38 - and then what makes it inclusive is that
12:40 - we understand that every person no
12:42 - matter what skin tone they have they
12:44 - have different undertones so no matter
12:46 - your skin tone
12:47 - most folk are
12:49 - have either cool warm or neutral
12:52 - undertones so pretty much a white a
12:55 - warmish red or a foolish blue undertone
12:58 - and so we work with our photographers to
13:01 - find which colors are the best to
13:04 - include in the app and this is a uh
13:07 - a more beta version of the app
13:09 - especially i'm on ios um and so these
13:12 - colors are definitely still being
13:14 - finalized um but the feature is
13:17 - out for the most part on android
13:22 - very cool um
13:24 - bertrand one question we have from
13:27 - uh
13:29 - jonah criner in dover delaware is how it
13:31 - sounds like the project is still ongoing
13:33 - but how long have you been working on it
13:35 - and maybe how long do you see it going
13:37 - going going for
13:39 - yeah so we've been working on this
13:41 - project for
13:42 - almost two years now
13:44 - or a year and a half about a year and a
13:46 - half to two years it's been it's been a
13:48 - long uh
13:50 - a long blurry journey since 2020
13:53 - um but yeah and i foresee it so the
13:56 - camera is not going to be inclusive
13:58 - overnight um these are just the first
14:00 - features that we're working on and there
14:01 - are many many many more to come it's
14:03 - going to be a long uh longer journey of
14:06 - like honestly i feel as though we can be
14:09 - working on this for easily five years
14:11 - and still have more runway to go um
14:14 - because
14:15 - is
14:16 - it's a process um we're learning how to
14:19 - make that process more and more
14:20 - inclusive and build tools to be
14:22 - inclusive because just the field and
14:25 - area of product inclusion making
14:27 - inclusive product as a whole is very uh
14:31 - un uncharted territory for many
14:33 - companies and many people and so with
14:35 - inclusive camera we're one of the first
14:37 - who are going in and diving deep into
14:39 - building inclusive products and making
14:41 - sure that throughout the whole process
14:43 - there is a diverse group of people that
14:45 - are giving feedback and just uh
14:47 - throughout the whole process and working
14:49 - with the people who are experts and
14:50 - understand these spaces who aren't
14:53 - necessarily always in the tech companies
14:57 - yeah
14:58 - that's
14:59 - uh it's super cool to hear about that
15:01 - work that you all are doing there and um
15:05 - i think yeah some students and teachers
15:07 - who are listening might might kind of
15:09 - resonate with some of that that feedback
15:11 - process of building a feature getting
15:12 - feedback iterating on it working on one
15:14 - feature at a time and also this idea of
15:17 - kind of the empathy for the user and
15:18 - also thinking about who are the users
15:20 - right in an inclusive way um something
15:23 - that
15:24 - you know students who might be in cs
15:26 - discoveries as principals thinking about
15:28 - as they design their work and do their
15:29 - projects in their classrooms
15:31 - um
15:32 - speaking of you know things you might
15:34 - have learned along the way bertrand i'm
15:36 - curious what are some specific cs skills
15:39 - that you've learned that have helped you
15:40 - build the foundation for what you do
15:43 - with your work today
15:46 - yeah um honestly my cis skills uh very
15:49 - much brought me to where i am today
15:52 - so i before i was a product manager i
15:54 - was a software engineer on the camera
15:56 - team at snap and studied computer
15:58 - science in college uh so i have a degree
16:01 - from uh wentworth institute of
16:03 - technology in boston um in computer
16:05 - science and throughout that whole
16:07 - process uh what helped me is just
16:10 - understanding um the fundamentals of
16:13 - technology in general understanding how
16:15 - uh the camera works so i was helping
16:17 - build the
16:18 - foundations and the infrastructure for
16:21 - the camera on our team
16:23 - and i
16:24 - through that i'm really able to speak to
16:27 - our uh our engineering team
16:30 - as an engineer which they fully fully
16:32 - love
16:33 - because not all product managers have
16:35 - that much of an engineering background
16:37 - and so right now when there's when we're
16:39 - working on our computational photography
16:42 - algorithms and going deeper into
16:45 - like how though they work and even
16:46 - speaking about like whether we should or
16:48 - shouldn't use machine learning i'm able
16:50 - to uh
16:52 - speak really deeply with them and
16:54 - understand what they're talking about
16:55 - and vice versa um and so
16:57 - like my computer science background was
17:00 - great because like even on our
17:02 - on our product we are focusing on
17:04 - launching on android first and as an
17:06 - android developer beforehand i was able
17:08 - to understand like why it's so important
17:10 - to be launching on android um because
17:12 - the disparities and how many people are
17:14 - using android around the world compared
17:16 - to ios
17:19 - cool yeah yeah um
17:22 - that's cool to hear about that part of
17:23 - your journey and um
17:26 - bertrand just going back to the what you
17:27 - showed us kind of the demo um there's a
17:29 - question about
17:30 - can you explain a little bit more about
17:32 - this idea of undertones
17:36 - yeah um so
17:37 - at everyone's base level they have their
17:39 - skin tone that's what everybody sees um
17:42 - but every person has like different
17:43 - undertones in the sense of like what
17:46 - when you're taking pictures or wearing
17:48 - clothes what
17:49 - colors do you gravitate more towards or
17:51 - which ones do you realize that look
17:53 - better on you like if there's a backdrop
17:55 - or you're wearing like a blue shirt
17:57 - which one do you which one looks better
17:59 - um and so like under your
18:01 - uh
18:02 - under your skin essentially through your
18:04 - veins you can tell like what your
18:05 - undertones are i believe if your veins
18:07 - are like more bluish you have a cooler
18:09 - undertone if they're like uh more
18:11 - greenish you might have a warmer
18:13 - undertone there's honestly a website
18:15 - that helps you understand all your
18:16 - undertones i do not want to butcher it
18:18 - there um i believe i have cool
18:21 - undertones um and so uh like i look
18:24 - better with the blues um and so it this
18:27 - ranges so like within um black folk it
18:30 - ranges it's not like um black folk or
18:31 - darker skin folk all have blue
18:33 - undertones and lighters can folk all
18:34 - have warm undertones within each skin
18:36 - tone you can be either um and so yeah
18:40 - actually east african folk are more
18:42 - likely to have warm undertones and west
18:44 - african folk are more likely to have
18:46 - blue undertones and even though they're
18:48 - still
18:49 - both african and other similar tone
18:52 - ranges
18:53 - oh cool thanks for sharing about that
18:55 - and that made me think about something i
18:56 - think
18:57 - a quote for you in the video of this
18:59 - like yeah the image of or the vision of
19:02 - you know being able to be seen the way
19:04 - you want to be the way you are the way
19:05 - you want to be seen and so that makes me
19:07 - think about that um there's a question
19:09 - from from the audience about how will
19:11 - you the project account for
19:14 - the situation where there's several
19:15 - people in an image and they have
19:17 - different skin tones and different
19:19 - undertones how how is going to account
19:21 - for all of that
19:22 - absolutely and so that's one of the
19:24 - things where i say that this is going to
19:26 - be a long journey home so right now um
19:29 - we aren't accounting for that as much or
19:32 - um in the sense of just like we are
19:34 - focusing on the selfie camera because 90
19:36 - of the time it's a single person in the
19:38 - photo and so trying to get that uh
19:40 - working really well and then expanding
19:42 - that to multiple people because i want
19:44 - to be able to take the photos with my
19:45 - friends and my family at the same time
19:47 - the same way i know um everyone uh else
19:50 - on this call would want to as well um so
19:52 - that will be uh definitely to come
19:55 - cool cool
19:56 - well um
19:58 - you know bertrand you know part of your
20:00 - who you are is your work but we'd also
20:02 - love to know a little bit more about you
20:03 - outside of work so what do you enjoy
20:05 - doing outside of work
20:08 - um a few things so uh historically i
20:11 - used to wrestle um was uh but more
20:14 - recently i've been doing a lot of
20:17 - playing music singing and roller skating
20:20 - um so joined a lot of the roller skating
20:22 - craze that's happened in the past year
20:24 - two years
20:25 - very cool uh is this like roller skating
20:28 - for with like tricks or for speed or for
20:31 - like exercise like what is it what kind
20:33 - of started this exercise because i'm
20:35 - really i when i used to get a lot of my
20:37 - exercise from wrestling stop doing that
20:39 - um and don't like running so started
20:41 - with exercise um just for distance but
20:44 - then i started uh dance skating jam
20:46 - skating um and have been doing that ever
20:48 - since which that's pretty much all i do
20:50 - which is even more of in at least for me
20:53 - more of an exercise yeah i'm just roller
20:55 - skating on the beach yeah for sure i've
20:57 - seen i've seen people in groups doing it
20:59 - it looks very intense that's awesome um
21:02 - cool
21:02 - um
21:04 - well
21:06 - bertrand i wonder if we can kind of
21:08 - um i don't know maybe it's tied to your
21:10 - interest maybe maybe not but you know
21:12 - kind of even go back to
21:14 - um
21:15 - like yeah how did you how did you decide
21:17 - to get into this line of work kind of
21:19 - where where where did this interest in
21:22 - computer science um uh come from
21:25 - yeah um so i've always been involved in
21:29 - some level of technology um from when i
21:32 - was younger uh my brothers and i got
21:34 - into it from
21:36 - trying to
21:38 - figure out how to
21:40 - pretty much uh
21:42 - get video games um in a sense through
21:46 - the internet and whatnot um and so that
21:49 - was that helped me like figure out some
21:51 - level of it and actually was my me
21:53 - watching my brothers do it uh and then
21:55 - from there i played actually i'm a huge
21:57 - legend legend of zelda fan and played a
21:59 - ton of video games um but once i got
22:02 - into middle school i
22:04 - like
22:05 - had like a small
22:07 - uh a small instance with it there was
22:10 - like a
22:11 - test for
22:12 - a bunch of subjects and randomly i chose
22:14 - computers
22:15 - just because i was like oh i like
22:17 - computers um and i did pretty well in it
22:20 - but it wasn't until my last semester of
22:22 - high school that i
22:24 - uh took a computer science class with a
22:27 - haitian professor
22:29 - where i went to school in florida and it
22:31 - was completely on a whim
22:33 - i had a class with him my freshman year
22:34 - he was the best professor at the school
22:36 - and
22:38 - i promised him before i left i would
22:39 - take another class with him i had no
22:41 - idea what class that was like literally
22:43 - had no idea and it turned out to be a
22:45 - computer science class that was never
22:47 - ever actually coded um so like before
22:50 - that i was actually planning on studying
22:51 - law um and then i took that class and i
22:53 - switched my like what my plan was
22:55 - completely um then from there um i got
22:59 - into some programs that helped black and
23:01 - hispanic folk um college students into
23:04 - tech code 2040 uh and they were the ones
23:07 - who showed me that like there is a full
23:09 - intersection between our communities the
23:11 - black uh the black and hispanic
23:13 - community into
23:15 - into tech and like you can
23:18 - build your your keep your uh
23:21 - your
23:22 - values into what you build and so since
23:25 - then my values have always been to build
23:28 - dope stuff for dope people and with that
23:30 - increasing folks quality of life through
23:32 - technology and so um inclusive camera is
23:35 - one aspect of that and i can't wait
23:37 - until the
23:38 - future things that i build that are uh
23:40 - definitely going to be in that realm as
23:42 - well
23:43 - very cool i love that saying um another
23:46 - question from the audience kind of
23:48 - related to what you were just saying is
23:50 - what
23:51 - what maybe job internship opportunities
23:54 - did you take of advantage or even kind
23:55 - of projects did you work on
23:57 - um earlier to gain experience to then
24:00 - get to your current role
24:02 - yeah
24:03 - um i say this a ton to people uh because
24:07 - programming
24:09 - is amazing it's fun but sometimes it can
24:11 - be really boring like it can be
24:13 - especially when you're sitting and
24:14 - you're trying to figure out just some
24:16 - homework or something that like was
24:19 - uh just something and like it does it's
24:21 - not working and you want to have
24:22 - something to drive you to actually be
24:24 - doing it um
24:26 - and that's kind of what like pushed me
24:28 - the projects that i built so i figured
24:30 - out that or i wanted to build a music
24:33 - app because i did not want to be in
24:35 - charge of the aux cord um with my
24:38 - friends and like i just it was a whole i
24:40 - was always in charge of the oxford and i
24:41 - was like let me let me let me go to let
24:44 - me sit back and relax and somebody else
24:45 - play the music for once um and so i
24:48 - thought of like what does it look like
24:49 - to create an app where everybody is in
24:51 - charge of the aux cord um and i was
24:53 - building this throughout college and
24:55 - that's how i really really learned how
24:57 - to program because i was building
24:58 - something that i really wanted like
25:00 - something that i was passionate about um
25:02 - and so through that even though i tried
25:05 - failed tried failed and tried again um i
25:08 - was able to learn so much from that
25:10 - project and eventually it was able to to
25:13 - work um
25:15 - spotify then came out with a similar
25:17 - feature so i no longer need this project
25:18 - so that's okay um but uh it was able to
25:22 - work and uh
25:23 - got some used it as like my senior
25:25 - project even though like i started as
25:27 - like my freshman year as a passion
25:29 - project and eventually got some time
25:31 - even at school to work on it as part of
25:33 - my course too um and it really helped me
25:37 - shape what it looks like to
25:38 - uh to code actually and like the
25:41 - practical um the practicalities of
25:43 - programming but also what it looks like
25:45 - to build a product um i think that's
25:47 - some of my first product management
25:48 - experience as well in terms of like
25:50 - defining what the mvp is the most viable
25:52 - product essentially like the base
25:54 - features you need to get this um uh to
25:57 - get this out and go from there building
25:59 - those getting feedback from people
26:01 - showing it to people and doing the whole
26:03 - process
26:05 - yeah that example is uh
26:07 - super powerful and i think hopefully you
26:10 - know students teachers who are listening
26:11 - you know thinking about maybe like well
26:13 - should i try to build that thing that i
26:14 - want to even if
26:16 - you know maybe you don't know how but it
26:17 - sounds like probably when you started
26:18 - out you didn't know how you said you
26:20 - know you failed a lot of times and kept
26:22 - at it but like kind of having that
26:24 - vision in mind and
26:26 - um that product management piece that
26:28 - you mentioned there is probably helpful
26:29 - to have your friends give you feedback
26:31 - on you know whether it was working and
26:32 - obviously yourself were you able to
26:34 - relax uh
26:36 - and and not be in charge of the aux cord
26:38 - so some good feedback streams there for
26:40 - yourself
26:41 - um
26:44 - richard i'm curious
26:46 - if you could
26:47 - talk to us about what obstacles have you
26:50 - faced along your journey and and how
26:52 - have you approached them
26:55 - yeah i would say um
26:57 - honestly one of the major obstacles that
26:59 - i faced uh especially in
27:02 - the beginning of my career was like
27:04 - going from high school to college um
27:07 - i
27:08 - went to a
27:10 - uh i went to school in florida and my
27:12 - parents are really education is
27:14 - everything to haitians parents like
27:15 - everything um and
27:18 - but unfortunately due to circumstance i
27:21 - was didn't have enough scholarships to
27:22 - go to school without uh without taking
27:25 - out any loans and
27:27 - um definitely was not trying to take out
27:29 - any loans uh my parents weren't my
27:32 - parents weren't in favor of loans which
27:34 - i understand that um so i went to
27:37 - community college for a year and that
27:38 - was something that was like uh at least
27:41 - a big step back for me in terms of like
27:43 - not something i was expecting to do i
27:45 - was expecting you to go to state school
27:46 - like my siblings did um like so many of
27:49 - my friends did um all the florida
27:51 - schools fsu if you've ever heard of them
27:53 - they're like really popular schools that
27:55 - like so many of my friends went to um
27:57 - and but unfortunately i went to uh
28:00 - unfortunately at the time honestly it's
28:02 - the biggest blessing ever um that's the
28:04 - point of this um but unfortunately at
28:06 - the time i went to a community college
28:08 - um but i didn't let that like stop my
28:11 - career and so like i was able to
28:13 - um just keep at it be persistent and
28:17 - uh finish my like associates i had some
28:20 - uh some college credits from doing dual
28:22 - enrollment um and finished my associates
28:24 - in a year and it caused me to really be
28:28 - more tenacious and
28:30 - drive what like i really want and
28:32 - understand that like
28:34 - if i really want to be successful as a
28:36 - software engineer in computer science i
28:38 - need to like push and then eventually
28:41 - actually after i
28:42 - finished my
28:43 - my associates i transferred to a school
28:46 - in boston um
28:48 - ended up taking loans but it was
28:49 - definitely half the amount that i would
28:52 - have taken if if i stayed for four years
28:55 - and it's honestly the biggest blessing
28:56 - um because that's where i'm at code 2040
28:58 - and so a ton of other folks
29:01 - that's very cool to hear and uh
29:04 - appreciate you sharing about that your
29:05 - journey it's not always the uh the
29:07 - linear path that we might have in mind
29:09 - when we're when we're younger but it's
29:11 - obviously where you're at now is doing
29:13 - some super uh impactful and work and
29:17 - work that you're passionate about so um
29:19 - super cool to hear about that and um
29:21 - yeah but that's kind of the time that we
29:24 - have for today so return i want to just
29:26 - say thanks a lot for joining us uh for
29:28 - sharing everything you did uh i really
29:30 - enjoyed getting to hear from you and i
29:32 - hope everyone else out there listening
29:34 - uh also did um thank you to all the
29:37 - teachers and the students who tuned in
29:38 - to listen um
29:41 - just a reminder to the audience remember
29:42 - you can tune into the one more
29:45 - class chat we have later this spring and
29:47 - you can also look back at the past chats
29:49 - if you go to code.org cs journeys and
29:52 - teachers please check your email for a
29:55 - survey as we really appreciate the
29:56 - feedback about these calls
29:59 - as we think about future ones so again
30:01 - thank you bertrand thanks everyone
30:03 - listening
30:04 - and have a great rest of your day
30:06 - everybody thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome my name is kanikiha and i'm a curriculum development manager here at code.org as a curriculum development manager that means i get to make lessons make activities uh make lessons plans lesson plans and gather feedback about how all of those things are working in classrooms from teachers and students like yourself who are tuning in today i'm really excited to join you all today and thanks to all the classrooms who are tuning in for today's my journey class chat teachers we've enabled live closed captioning for all of our class chats today we are excited and lucky to welcome bertrand st prue as a product manager at snap who started and lead snap's inclusive camera team to ensure snap's camera works well for everyone regardless of their skin tone cultural background beauty standards or ability teachers please let us know where you're tuning in from and put your students questions for bertrand in the q a we'll try our best to get to some of those during the chat today uh merchant will start with a uh fun icebreaker uh so it's just a little would you rather would you rather be able to breathe underwater or be able to fly and i'll go first uh i think i'm gonna say flying i just i think the the idea of moving quickly through the air is a cool sensation and the the views that you could get from being able to fly are definitely uh something that i would treasure so how about yourself i'd definitely say flying as well um this it would make traveling so much easier there's so many places i'd be able to go um and i wouldn't need a car yeah for sure where someone where somewhere you would want to fly where you would want to travel if you had that ability japan easily japan oh very cool very cool my my my father's side of the family is from japan so i've lived there for a year so that's that's awesome cool very cool well uh well welcome bertrand again thanks for joining us today um we'd love to just start with a little uh introduction from yourself and if you could tell us a little bit about your work and what you do at snack yeah um so again my name is beatron sampua or bertrand st prue i'm a product manager at snapchat um and i work to build products to make the camera more inclusive no matter who you are um your skin tone your race culture beauty standards or just whoever you are essentially making the camera work for you uh and so that is a really really fun and impactful project that i'm really happy to say i work on um and yeah oh and i'm also from miami florida and if you can tell from my name or not um i'm very haitian which is a country in the caribbean um yeah awesome cool well um yeah you mentioned this inclusive camera i wonder if you could just tell us what what is it and and just maybe give us a little bit more background about it about it yeah so the inclusive camera is essentially um a way in which uh snap is working to recreate the camera um to work better for folk the camera has unfortunately not worked um inclusively of everyone uh in its history it started off um working for for lighter skin tones because the shirley card and various other uh the surely card which is a color correction card um that folks used to use to go into um photo hut this is way back in like the 1940s and 50s well into our parents and parents uh grandparents um when they used to go develop their photos it was all developed against a photo um of a woman who was white uh and it had the caption normal on it and so if you were never a person who uh who identified as a lighterskinned person um and you went to get your photos developed then they just wouldn't be looking as good as they could be and so that history went on into the digital age and yeah that's what caused us at snap to be able to want to create an inclusive camera which recreates and rewrites the way that cameras are made from the process and software level on to better be able to take a picture of everyone no matter who you are and so there's a little bit of a video that i have to explain this a bit more um well uh well bertrand gets that video ready i just wanted to welcome folks joining from dover delaware pittsburgh sacramento north dakota so good to have people from all over the country joining today i think people of color assume that their skin tones are difficult to photograph because they've seen themselves in lights that are not complementary to how they look and that's absolutely not the case when you look at the camera technology when you look at the history of it when you look at how image making has evolved throughout the years there's some actual technological limitations when it comes to how we show up on screen my name is bertrand sampua and i am the lead for the inclusive camera i've experienced situations where like my skin has been lightened by the camera taking photos of myself and just like it doesn't work especially in low light settings you don't see me so i really want to improve that experience for myself and for the community my mom picking up a phone is assuming that this phone has the best interest for her skin tone and who she is and the photos she wants to take but there's that assumption there that it should be figured out already but it really isn't a lot of times camera companies are registering our skin colors as shadows instead of as skin so it just kind of becomes muddy the inclusive camera is just a camera that allows any person to be seen by the camera the way that they want to be seen the way that they are i love having a balance of like this was made with everybody in mind because that opens up a whole other path of like what creativity could look like when it's actually being made with good purpose you see that saturation that comes in it lifts it a lot it feels like there's a filter on it want every time that you open the snapchat camera to be a moment that you feel as though you can express yourself any way that you want to it's not going to be an easy journey and rebuilding our camera is just the first phase improving low light flash capture and exposure correction so that we can account for all people's skin tones and their undertones so that any person whatever phone they're picking up they're able to take a good selfie and this is just the beginning awesome bertrand thanks for sharing that video um you mentioned your title being a product manager and i feel like that that video showed some of some of your you at work a little bit and so i wonder if you could kind of talk about your role in this project i said you're the lead but what what is like the daytoday what has that process been like of guiding that project yeah so um being a product manager uh pretty much means that like you define the vision of the product and from end to end from the concept of the product all the way to like it being released and even then after you're working with engineers designers and everyone in between to make sure that the product needs to be exactly what it needs to be for the community and especially in this case for the inclusive camera we're like redefining the whole like typical product um development process and so i work with a ton of photographers um someone which some of which you saw i work with like marketing and comms and just various folk to understand and tell like how do we tell the story to the community um and help them understand the product so it's a lot of hats that you get to wear as a product manager you're pretty much like the middle person of everything to make sure that the product is what it needs to be yeah i wonder that's so cool you get to interact with so many different people and like in super collaborative um i think that's something that uh you know students and teachers watching probably hopefully resonate with kind of that collaborative nature of computer science and building something together kind of can make it a fun subject i wonder you know you mentioned the photographers just because we saw them in the video could you talk a little bit about the the contribution um that they you know how did that back and forth go and what was their contribution to the the vision like you said yeah absolutely so um when i when i started this project and pitched it to the to the uh to the team um one thing that we realized was just that like even though we're a camera company and we have a camera team i was on the camera team even before um joining this project that there aren't any photographers on the camera team and so like what does it look like to actually bring those folk in and have them tune our algorithms for us so we created tools for them to be able to like um computational photography tools which is pretty much photography and technology and like how do you build photography into code which is what computational photography is and so we built a bunch of those algorithms and were a few of those algorithms and we we had them go through and tune it in similar to like photoshop like what does it look like for these algorithms to work on different people so we translated what we do is we work with them and they told us like what they would do with the normal dslr camera like the nikon cameras or kodak cameras um and we converted that into code so that our algorithms can work really well very cool um i also know that uh you know in the video i mentioned like some features of like flash correction and things like that like i wonder if you could talk more about some of the specific things that that have come out of this project yeah absolutely and i'm happy to be able to show some as well uh so pretty much one of the things that was just that was mentioned in that video was that we um work with these photographers not just on our algorithms but just to understand like flash capture and how to light people uh in lower light and so one of the features that we released is ring flash so in uh when folks are usually taking a flash if you use snapchat um and you're on the front facing camera and you go and take uh use flash and like it's really dark outside or dark inside or outside and like flashes on your face and you look at yourself like oh my goodness i did not realize that's what i look like um it happens to me all the times or it used to happen to me all the time um until we built ring flash which as i'm trying to share my screen give me this moment um oh we built ring flash which uh essentially illuminates the border around your screen um so that you can better take uh snaps at night and so while bertrand just gets that up uh just teachers out there and students feel free to keep submitting questions in the q a and we'll try our best to get to those uh later in the conversation but happy to submit those so usually when you're taking flash and actually i'm gonna make it darker in here so that y'all can truly see oh my goodness huh and so when it is darker in here and you take the flash i did not really know what i look like and oh this is uh i'll tell you what that is a little bit later but what ring flash does it illuminates the border around your screen so that you can better see yourself while you're taking the snap and so when it's really dark it works much better of course and then what makes it inclusive is that we understand that every person no matter what skin tone they have they have different undertones so no matter your skin tone most folk are have either cool warm or neutral undertones so pretty much a white a warmish red or a foolish blue undertone and so we work with our photographers to find which colors are the best to include in the app and this is a uh a more beta version of the app especially i'm on ios um and so these colors are definitely still being finalized um but the feature is out for the most part on android very cool um bertrand one question we have from uh jonah criner in dover delaware is how it sounds like the project is still ongoing but how long have you been working on it and maybe how long do you see it going going going for yeah so we've been working on this project for almost two years now or a year and a half about a year and a half to two years it's been it's been a long uh a long blurry journey since 2020 um but yeah and i foresee it so the camera is not going to be inclusive overnight um these are just the first features that we're working on and there are many many many more to come it's going to be a long uh longer journey of like honestly i feel as though we can be working on this for easily five years and still have more runway to go um because is it's a process um we're learning how to make that process more and more inclusive and build tools to be inclusive because just the field and area of product inclusion making inclusive product as a whole is very uh un uncharted territory for many companies and many people and so with inclusive camera we're one of the first who are going in and diving deep into building inclusive products and making sure that throughout the whole process there is a diverse group of people that are giving feedback and just uh throughout the whole process and working with the people who are experts and understand these spaces who aren't necessarily always in the tech companies yeah that's uh it's super cool to hear about that work that you all are doing there and um i think yeah some students and teachers who are listening might might kind of resonate with some of that that feedback process of building a feature getting feedback iterating on it working on one feature at a time and also this idea of kind of the empathy for the user and also thinking about who are the users right in an inclusive way um something that you know students who might be in cs discoveries as principals thinking about as they design their work and do their projects in their classrooms um speaking of you know things you might have learned along the way bertrand i'm curious what are some specific cs skills that you've learned that have helped you build the foundation for what you do with your work today yeah um honestly my cis skills uh very much brought me to where i am today so i before i was a product manager i was a software engineer on the camera team at snap and studied computer science in college uh so i have a degree from uh wentworth institute of technology in boston um in computer science and throughout that whole process uh what helped me is just understanding um the fundamentals of technology in general understanding how uh the camera works so i was helping build the foundations and the infrastructure for the camera on our team and i through that i'm really able to speak to our uh our engineering team as an engineer which they fully fully love because not all product managers have that much of an engineering background and so right now when there's when we're working on our computational photography algorithms and going deeper into like how though they work and even speaking about like whether we should or shouldn't use machine learning i'm able to uh speak really deeply with them and understand what they're talking about and vice versa um and so like my computer science background was great because like even on our on our product we are focusing on launching on android first and as an android developer beforehand i was able to understand like why it's so important to be launching on android um because the disparities and how many people are using android around the world compared to ios cool yeah yeah um that's cool to hear about that part of your journey and um bertrand just going back to the what you showed us kind of the demo um there's a question about can you explain a little bit more about this idea of undertones yeah um so at everyone's base level they have their skin tone that's what everybody sees um but every person has like different undertones in the sense of like what when you're taking pictures or wearing clothes what colors do you gravitate more towards or which ones do you realize that look better on you like if there's a backdrop or you're wearing like a blue shirt which one do you which one looks better um and so like under your uh under your skin essentially through your veins you can tell like what your undertones are i believe if your veins are like more bluish you have a cooler undertone if they're like uh more greenish you might have a warmer undertone there's honestly a website that helps you understand all your undertones i do not want to butcher it there um i believe i have cool undertones um and so uh like i look better with the blues um and so it this ranges so like within um black folk it ranges it's not like um black folk or darker skin folk all have blue undertones and lighters can folk all have warm undertones within each skin tone you can be either um and so yeah actually east african folk are more likely to have warm undertones and west african folk are more likely to have blue undertones and even though they're still both african and other similar tone ranges oh cool thanks for sharing about that and that made me think about something i think a quote for you in the video of this like yeah the image of or the vision of you know being able to be seen the way you want to be the way you are the way you want to be seen and so that makes me think about that um there's a question from from the audience about how will you the project account for the situation where there's several people in an image and they have different skin tones and different undertones how how is going to account for all of that absolutely and so that's one of the things where i say that this is going to be a long journey home so right now um we aren't accounting for that as much or um in the sense of just like we are focusing on the selfie camera because 90 of the time it's a single person in the photo and so trying to get that uh working really well and then expanding that to multiple people because i want to be able to take the photos with my friends and my family at the same time the same way i know um everyone uh else on this call would want to as well um so that will be uh definitely to come cool cool well um you know bertrand you know part of your who you are is your work but we'd also love to know a little bit more about you outside of work so what do you enjoy doing outside of work um a few things so uh historically i used to wrestle um was uh but more recently i've been doing a lot of playing music singing and roller skating um so joined a lot of the roller skating craze that's happened in the past year two years very cool uh is this like roller skating for with like tricks or for speed or for like exercise like what is it what kind of started this exercise because i'm really i when i used to get a lot of my exercise from wrestling stop doing that um and don't like running so started with exercise um just for distance but then i started uh dance skating jam skating um and have been doing that ever since which that's pretty much all i do which is even more of in at least for me more of an exercise yeah i'm just roller skating on the beach yeah for sure i've seen i've seen people in groups doing it it looks very intense that's awesome um cool um well bertrand i wonder if we can kind of um i don't know maybe it's tied to your interest maybe maybe not but you know kind of even go back to um like yeah how did you how did you decide to get into this line of work kind of where where where did this interest in computer science um uh come from yeah um so i've always been involved in some level of technology um from when i was younger uh my brothers and i got into it from trying to figure out how to pretty much uh get video games um in a sense through the internet and whatnot um and so that was that helped me like figure out some level of it and actually was my me watching my brothers do it uh and then from there i played actually i'm a huge legend legend of zelda fan and played a ton of video games um but once i got into middle school i like had like a small uh a small instance with it there was like a test for a bunch of subjects and randomly i chose computers just because i was like oh i like computers um and i did pretty well in it but it wasn't until my last semester of high school that i uh took a computer science class with a haitian professor where i went to school in florida and it was completely on a whim i had a class with him my freshman year he was the best professor at the school and i promised him before i left i would take another class with him i had no idea what class that was like literally had no idea and it turned out to be a computer science class that was never ever actually coded um so like before that i was actually planning on studying law um and then i took that class and i switched my like what my plan was completely um then from there um i got into some programs that helped black and hispanic folk um college students into tech code 2040 uh and they were the ones who showed me that like there is a full intersection between our communities the black uh the black and hispanic community into into tech and like you can build your your keep your uh your values into what you build and so since then my values have always been to build dope stuff for dope people and with that increasing folks quality of life through technology and so um inclusive camera is one aspect of that and i can't wait until the future things that i build that are uh definitely going to be in that realm as well very cool i love that saying um another question from the audience kind of related to what you were just saying is what what maybe job internship opportunities did you take of advantage or even kind of projects did you work on um earlier to gain experience to then get to your current role yeah um i say this a ton to people uh because programming is amazing it's fun but sometimes it can be really boring like it can be especially when you're sitting and you're trying to figure out just some homework or something that like was uh just something and like it does it's not working and you want to have something to drive you to actually be doing it um and that's kind of what like pushed me the projects that i built so i figured out that or i wanted to build a music app because i did not want to be in charge of the aux cord um with my friends and like i just it was a whole i was always in charge of the oxford and i was like let me let me let me go to let me sit back and relax and somebody else play the music for once um and so i thought of like what does it look like to create an app where everybody is in charge of the aux cord um and i was building this throughout college and that's how i really really learned how to program because i was building something that i really wanted like something that i was passionate about um and so through that even though i tried failed tried failed and tried again um i was able to learn so much from that project and eventually it was able to to work um spotify then came out with a similar feature so i no longer need this project so that's okay um but uh it was able to work and uh got some used it as like my senior project even though like i started as like my freshman year as a passion project and eventually got some time even at school to work on it as part of my course too um and it really helped me shape what it looks like to uh to code actually and like the practical um the practicalities of programming but also what it looks like to build a product um i think that's some of my first product management experience as well in terms of like defining what the mvp is the most viable product essentially like the base features you need to get this um uh to get this out and go from there building those getting feedback from people showing it to people and doing the whole process yeah that example is uh super powerful and i think hopefully you know students teachers who are listening you know thinking about maybe like well should i try to build that thing that i want to even if you know maybe you don't know how but it sounds like probably when you started out you didn't know how you said you know you failed a lot of times and kept at it but like kind of having that vision in mind and um that product management piece that you mentioned there is probably helpful to have your friends give you feedback on you know whether it was working and obviously yourself were you able to relax uh and and not be in charge of the aux cord so some good feedback streams there for yourself um richard i'm curious if you could talk to us about what obstacles have you faced along your journey and and how have you approached them yeah i would say um honestly one of the major obstacles that i faced uh especially in the beginning of my career was like going from high school to college um i went to a uh i went to school in florida and my parents are really education is everything to haitians parents like everything um and but unfortunately due to circumstance i was didn't have enough scholarships to go to school without uh without taking out any loans and um definitely was not trying to take out any loans uh my parents weren't my parents weren't in favor of loans which i understand that um so i went to community college for a year and that was something that was like uh at least a big step back for me in terms of like not something i was expecting to do i was expecting you to go to state school like my siblings did um like so many of my friends did um all the florida schools fsu if you've ever heard of them they're like really popular schools that like so many of my friends went to um and but unfortunately i went to uh unfortunately at the time honestly it's the biggest blessing ever um that's the point of this um but unfortunately at the time i went to a community college um but i didn't let that like stop my career and so like i was able to um just keep at it be persistent and uh finish my like associates i had some uh some college credits from doing dual enrollment um and finished my associates in a year and it caused me to really be more tenacious and drive what like i really want and understand that like if i really want to be successful as a software engineer in computer science i need to like push and then eventually actually after i finished my my associates i transferred to a school in boston um ended up taking loans but it was definitely half the amount that i would have taken if if i stayed for four years and it's honestly the biggest blessing um because that's where i'm at code 2040 and so a ton of other folks that's very cool to hear and uh appreciate you sharing about that your journey it's not always the uh the linear path that we might have in mind when we're when we're younger but it's obviously where you're at now is doing some super uh impactful and work and work that you're passionate about so um super cool to hear about that and um yeah but that's kind of the time that we have for today so return i want to just say thanks a lot for joining us uh for sharing everything you did uh i really enjoyed getting to hear from you and i hope everyone else out there listening uh also did um thank you to all the teachers and the students who tuned in to listen um just a reminder to the audience remember you can tune into the one more class chat we have later this spring and you can also look back at the past chats if you go to code.org cs journeys and teachers please check your email for a survey as we really appreciate the feedback about these calls as we think about future ones so again thank you bertrand thanks everyone listening and have a great rest of your day everybody thank you
