00:06 - Hi, my name's John.
00:07 - I lead the search and machine
learning teams at Google.
00:12 - I think it's amazingly inspiring
00:14 - that people all over the world
00:16 - turn to search engines to
ask trivial questions
00:19 - and incredibly important questions.
00:20 - So it's a huge
responsibility to give them
00:23 - the best answers that we can.
00:26 - Hi, my name's Akshaya and 
I work on the Bing search team.
00:30 - There are many times where
we will start looking
00:33 - into artificial intelligence
and machine learning,
00:35 - but we have to address how are
the users going to use this,
00:39 - because at the end of the day,
we want to make an impact to society.
00:43 - Let's ask a simple question.
00:45 - How long does it take to travel to Mars?
00:49 - Where did these results come from
00:51 - and why was this listed
before the other one?
00:55 - Okay, let's dive in and
see how the search engine
00:58 - turned your request into a result.
01:00 - The first thing you need to
know is when you do a search,
01:03 - the search engine isn't actually
going out to the World Wide Web
01:06 - to run your search in real time.
01:08 - And that's because there's
over a billion websites
01:10 - on the internet and hundreds more are
being created every single minute.
01:14 - So if the search engine
had to look through
01:16 - every single site to
find the one you wanted,
01:18 - it would just take forever.
01:20 - So to make your search faster,
01:21 - search engines are constantly
scanning the web in advance
01:25 - to record the information that might
help with your search later.
01:28 - That way, when you search
about travel to Mars,
01:31 - the search engine
already has what it needs
01:33 - to give you an answer in real time.
01:36 - Here's how it works.
01:37 - The internet is a web of pages
connected to each other by hyperlinks.
01:42 - Search engines are
constantly running a program
01:44 - called a Spider that cross
through these web pages
01:47 - to collect information about them.
01:49 - Each time it finds a hyperlink,
01:52 - it follows it until it
has visited every page
01:55 - it can find on the entire
internet.
01:57 - For each page the spider visits,
01:59 - it records any information
it might need for a search
02:02 - by adding it to a special
database called a search index.
02:07 - Now, let's go back to
that search from earlier
02:09 - and see if we can figure
out how the search engine
02:11 - came up with the results.
02:13 - When you ask how long does
it take to travel to Mars,
02:16 - the search engine looks
in each of those words
02:18 - in the search index to
immediately get a list
02:21 - of all the pages on the
internet containing those words.
02:24 - But just looking for these search terms
02:26 - could return millions of pages,
02:28 - so the search engine needs
to be able to determine
02:31 - the best matches to show you first.
02:33 - This is where it gets tricky
because the search engine
02:36 - may need to guess what
you're looking for.
02:38 - Each search engine
uses its own algorithm
02:41 - to rank the pages based on
what it thinks you want.
02:44 - The search engine's ranking
algorithm might check
02:47 - if your search term shows
up in the page title,
02:50 - it might check if all of the
words show up next to each other,
02:54 - or any number of other calculations
02:57 - that help it better determine
02:58 - which pages you'll want
to see and which you won't.
03:02 - Google invented the most 
famous algorithm
03:04 - for choosing the most relevant results
for a search by taking into account
03:08 - how many other Web pages
linked to a given page.
03:11 - The idea is that if
lots of websites think
03:14 - that a web page is interesting,
03:15 - then it's probably the one 
you're looking for.
03:18 - This algorithm is called page rank,
03:20 - not because it ranks web pages,
03:22 - but because it was named after
its inventor, Larry Page,
03:25 - who's one of the founders of Google.
03:27 - Because a website often makes
money when you visit it,
03:30 - spammers are constantly
trying to find ways
03:32 - to game the search algorithm 
so that their pages
03:35 - are listed higher in the results.
03:38 - Search engines regularly
update their algorithms
03:40 - to prevent fake or untrustworthy
sites from reaching the top.
03:44 - Ultimately, it's up to you 
to keep an eye out
03:47 - for these pages that are untrustworthy
03:49 - by looking at the web address and
making sure it's a reliable source.
03:53 - Search programs are always evolving
03:55 - to improve the algorithms 
wo they return better results,
03:58 - faster results than their competitors.
04:01 - Today's search engines
even use information
04:03 - that you haven't explicitly provided
to help you narrow down your search.
04:07 - So, for example,
if you did a search for dog parks,
04:10 - many search engines
would give you results
04:12 - for all the dog parks nearby,
04:14 - even though you didn't
type in your location.
04:17 - Modern search engines
also understand more
04:20 - than just the words on a page,
04:22 - but what they actually mean
in order to find the best one
04:24 - that matches what you're looking for.
04:27 - For example, if you search 
for fast pitcher,
04:30 - it will know you're
looking for an athlete.
04:32 - But if you search for large pitcher,
04:34 - it will find you options
for your kitchen.
04:38 - To understand the words better, 
we use something called machine learning,
04:41 - a type of artificial intelligence.
04:43 - It enables search
algorithms to search out
04:46 - not just individual letters
or words in the page,
04:48 - but understand the underlying
meaning of the words.
04:53 - The internet is growing exponentially,
04:56 - but if the teams that design
search engines do our jobs right,
05:00 - the information you want should
always be just a few keystrokes away.
