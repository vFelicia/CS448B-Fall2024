00:01 - "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer...
00:04 - because it teachers you how to think."
00:08 - >> Bill: created Microsoft
I was 13 when I first got access to a computer.
00:14 - >> Jack: created Twitter
My parents bought me a Macintosh in 1984 
when I was eight years old.
00:18 - I was in sixth grade
00:19 - I learned to code in college.
00:21 - >> Ruchi: First female engineer at Facebook. 
Freshman year first semester, Intro to Computer Science.
00:25 - I wrote a program that played Tic-tac-toe.
00:28 - >> Drew: Created Dropbox
I think it was pretty humble beginnings. 
I think the first program I wrote asked
00:32 - things like, What's your favorite color? Or, How old are you?
00:35 - >> Elena: Created Clothia.com
I first learned how make a green circle 
and a red square appear on the screen.
00:41 - >> Gabe: Created Valve
The first time I actually had something come up
00:43 - and say "Hello World", and I made a computer do that,
00:46 - it was just astonishing.
00:47 - >> Mark: Created Facebook
Learning how to program didn't start off as wanting to learn
00:50 - all of Computer Science
00:52 - or trying to master this discipline or
00:54 - anything like that.
00:55 - it just started off because I wanted to do
00:57 - this one simple thing.
00:59 - I want to make something that was fun for myself and and my sisters.
01:01 - I wrote this little program
01:02 - then basically just add a little bit to it.
01:05 - Then when I needed to learn something new
01:06 - I looked it up either in a book or on the Internet
01:08 - and then added a little bit to it.
01:10 - It's really not unlike kind of playing an instrument or something
01:13 - or playing a sport.
01:17 - It starts out being very intimidating,
01:19 - but you kind of get the hang of it over time.
01:21 - >> Chris: NBA All-Star, Coded in College
Coding is something that can be learned and...
01:24 - I know it can be intimidating...
01:26 - a lot of things are intimidating, but...
01:28 - you know, what isn't?
01:30 - >> Makinde: Early Facebook engineer
A lot of the coding that people do is actually fairly simple.
01:33 - It's more about the process of breaking down problems
01:36 - than  coming up with
01:38 - complicated algorithms as people traditionally think about it.
01:45 - >> Vanessa: Created Girl Develop IT
You don't have to be a genius to know how to code. 
You need to be determined.
01:48 - Addition, subtraction...that's about about it.
01:52 - >> Tony: CEO @ Zappos
You should probably know your multiplication tables.
01:54 - >> Bronwen: Technical artist at Valve
You don't have to be a genius to code.
 Do you have to be a genius to read?
01:57 - Even if you want to become a race car driver or play baseball
02:01 - or... you know
02:04 - build a house... all of these things 
have been turned upside down by software.
02:08 - What is it, is you know, computers are everywhere.
02:10 - You want to work in agriculture?
02:11 - Do you want to work in entertainment? 
Do you want to work in manufacturing?
02:16 - It's just all over.
02:29 - Here we are, 2013
02:31 - >> Will.I.Am: Created The Black Eyed Peas, Now taking coding classes
We all depend on technology to communicate, to bank...
02:36 - ...information...
02:38 - and none of us know how to read and write code.
02:45 - When I was in school I was in the this 
after school group called the Whiz Kids
02:49 - and when people found out they laughed at me 
and you know, all these things and I'm like
02:53 - "Man I don't care! I think it's cool and I'm learning a lot and
02:57 - some of my friends have jobs!"
03:01 - Our policy is literally to hire as many talented engineers as we can find.
03:07 - The whole limit in the system is that 
there just aren't enough people who are
03:10 - trained and have these skills today.
03:13 - To get the very best people we try to make the office
03:15 - as awesome as possible.
03:39 - We have a fantastic chef.
03:41 - free food
03:42 - breakfast, lunch and dinner.
03:44 - free laundry
03:45 - Snacks
03:47 - even places to play
03:49 - video games and scooters
03:51 - there's always kinds of interesting things
03:53 - around the office where people can play, or relax,
03:58 - or go to think, or play music or be creative.
04:01 - >>HADI: Created Code.Org
Whether you're trying to make a lot of money 
or whether you just want to change the world,
04:05 - Computer programming is an incredibly empowering skill to learn.
04:09 - I think if someone had told me that
04:12 - software is really about humanity, that it's really about helping people
04:17 - by using computer technology
04:19 - it would have changed my outlook a lot earlier.
04:23 - To be able to actually come up with an idea and then see it in your hands and then be able to press a button
04:28 - and have it be in millions of people hands, I mean, I think we're the first
04:32 - generation in the world that's really ever had that kind of experience.
04:36 - Just to think that you can start something in your college dorm room and you can have a set of people
04:41 - who haven't built a big company before come together and build something that
04:45 - a billion people use as part of their daily lives...
04:48 - It's crazy to think about, right? It's really, it's humbling and it's amazing.
04:51 - The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future.
04:54 - You know, you're going look like you have magic powers
compared to everybody else.
04:58 - It's amazing. It's, it's the closest thing we have to a super power.
05:03 - Great coders are today's Rock Stars.  That's it!
05:09 - 1 million of the best jobs in America may go unfilled...
05:12 - ...because only 1 in 4 schools teach students how to code.
05:15 - Whether you want to be a doctor or a rockstar,
05:17 - ask about a coding class at your school
