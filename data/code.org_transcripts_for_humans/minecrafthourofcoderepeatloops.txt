00:04 - Stampy: I wonder what Stacy is up to?
00:13 - Stacy: Woah, I think I'm in the right place.
00:17 - This is amazing!
00:19 - I feel like I'm back in Minecraft!
00:22 - Hello.
00:23 - How are you?
00:24 - Hello?
00:26 - Oh, there's a creeper. You don't do anything, do you?
00:30 - Katie: Stacy?
00:31 - Stacy:Hi, Katie?
00:32 - Katie: Yes!
00:32 - Welcome to Minecraft.
00:33 - Stacy: Thank you!
00:34 - Katie: Come on in!
00:38 - Stacy: This is amazing.
00:39 - So you work here every day as a developer,
right?
00:42 - Katie: Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
00:44 - I'm a developer on the Minecraft marketplace
team.
00:46 - Stacy: How many coding languages do you know?
00:49 - Katie: In my career I've probably worked with
over a dozen.
00:51 - Stacy: A dozen?
00:52 - Katie: Yeah.
00:53 - Stacy: So now, you wouldn't happen to know
anything about this little golem guy that
00:57 - calls himself "the Agent"?
00:59 - Katie: We use the Agent to do things that
Steve or Alex can't, like go across lava.
01:05 - Stacy: Well, I want to learn how to code,
and they want to learn how to code, so what
01:10 - is one of the first things that you need to
know when you're learning?
01:13 - Katie: Well, you need to learn how to use
loops.
01:15 - Stacy: Ok.
01:16 - Katie: Loops are things that developers write
to give commands to a computer that can be
01:20 - run over and over again.
01:22 - Stacy: Got it, so I think there's actually
some of that coming up in the levels ahead,
01:25 - so go ahead and give loops a try.
01:28 - In the next level, you can use a loop to move
the Agent along the path.
01:32 - Drag the repeat block into the workspace and
place the move forward block inside the repeat
01:38 - block.
01:39 - This tells the computer to do the same thing
many times in a row without having to drag
01:43 - a whole bunch of blocks into the workspace.
01:46 - You can choose how many times to repeat by
putting a number in the repeat block.
01:50 - You can put turns and multiple commands in
the repeat block too, but for now try using
01:55 - a repeat to move the Agent forward a few steps.
01:59 - Remember, if you get stuck on a puzzle you
can always hit the blue "reset" button and
02:02 - try again.
02:03 - If you are thinking about having a cool job
like Katie's, go ahead and click the "show
02:08 - code" button when you finish every level.
02:11 - That's going to actually show you the Javascript
code that someone like Katie uses when she's
02:15 - actually programming Minecraft.
02:16 - So anyway, thank you so much!
02:18 - Katie: Yeah, good luck everyone!
