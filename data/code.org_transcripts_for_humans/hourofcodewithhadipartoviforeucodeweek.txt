00:01 - [Music]
00:04 - we can switch this way so we can see
00:06 - ourselves
00:07 - oh there i am
00:09 - hi there uh
00:11 - and we're here to
00:12 - kick off
00:13 - at one hour during eu code week of
00:16 - streaming to teach
00:18 - a little bit of uh coding and computer
00:20 - science to folks
00:21 - let me turn off our zoom background
00:23 - because it's distracting a little bit
00:28 - uh
00:31 - no background
00:35 - [Music]
00:37 - yay
00:38 - there we go
00:40 - all right um
00:42 - i wanted to ask everybody if you're uh
00:45 - joining us there's a number of ways you
00:47 - can chat with us but the most important
00:48 - one if you're not already familiar with
00:50 - it is the little chat button in the
00:51 - bottom of your screen
00:53 - if you see that there i'd love to see
00:55 - where people are calling in from so if
00:56 - you could chat and uh just type in the
00:58 - country or city that you're
01:01 - participating from so you can see where
01:02 - folks are
01:04 - we can see stuff you can you read some
01:05 - of these
01:06 - um songs from romania sounds from sweden
01:10 - greece germany abu dhabi
01:13 - denmark
01:15 - paris
01:16 - austria
01:18 - belgium
01:22 - portugal
01:23 - macedonia
01:25 - wow myanmar that's pretty far away
01:29 - croatia i've seen a lot of people from
01:31 - romania rhode island okay we have some
01:34 - folks from the united states even uh
01:36 - well folks are calling in from all over
01:37 - the place at an eu code week is one of
01:40 - the first weeks of the year where
01:42 - uh folks from all over the world in
01:44 - europe are basically participating in
01:47 - computer science uh
01:49 - sophie and i wanted to spend some time
01:50 - showing coding at to folks uh using the
01:53 - code.org platform you know the hour of
01:55 - code is one of the things that kicked
01:57 - off basically this idea of one-hour
01:59 - introductions to computer science and
02:01 - since we started it uh eight years ago
02:04 - we've now had over one billion hours of
02:06 - code done
02:07 - before we jump into this i want to get a
02:09 - sense of what grade level folks are in
02:11 - that are coming in so if you could type
02:13 - in what grade you're in and a number
02:15 - from 1 through 12 for the folk for the
02:18 - students who are in school so we could
02:20 - get a sense of what grades everybody's
02:22 - in grade six
02:24 - one to six that's lots of grades
02:30 - elementary school
02:34 - one to seven one to eight
02:37 - one to eight
02:38 - it sounds like these are classrooms
02:40 - uh dialing in elementary
02:43 - thirteen to fifteen
02:47 - and i also wanna get a sense of how many
02:49 - of high school mainly all right so we
02:51 - have basically students from all all
02:53 - ages teenagers elementary school
02:55 - students we're going to have a program
02:57 - that is basically kind of
03:00 - targeting all ages but we're going to
03:02 - start at the easier stuff and then get
03:03 - progressively harder over time so if
03:05 - you're more advanced it may take a
03:07 - little bit of uh you may need to be a
03:09 - little bit patient with us
03:11 - and if you have questions at any point
03:13 - please type it into the chat room we
03:15 - have some folks from code.org will be
03:17 - able to respond at
03:19 - and if you have questions for us to
03:21 - answer you can also use uh
03:24 - you can basically raise your hand
03:27 - you see a button that looks like this to
03:29 - raise your hand to ask a question
03:31 - although the chat is probably the best
03:32 - way to do that
03:35 - all right so sophia are you ready yeah
03:37 - so sophia is going to be doing most of
03:39 - the coding during this uh
03:41 - except for the maybe the most advanced
03:42 - stuff but what we're going to first do
03:44 - is a little bit of coding with a tool
03:47 - called artist and what we're going to
03:48 - learn about
03:50 - is
03:50 - algorithms sophia what's an algorithm
03:56 - you're not sure
03:59 - an algorithm is when you give a computer
04:01 - a set of instructions or a series of
04:03 - steps to solve a problem of some sort oh
04:05 - i was thinking of something else oh you
04:07 - were confused about what an algorithm is
04:09 - all right well it's one of those
04:11 - words that we learn in computer science
04:13 - and sophia is going to make an algorithm
04:14 - to do some drawings
04:16 - so let's
04:17 - first share my screen
04:23 - can everybody see this i hope
04:25 - so what we're looking at right now is
04:27 - the code.org artist tool
04:30 - and sophia is going to
04:32 - use this but what we see over here is
04:34 - the little artist he's going to be
04:35 - making the drawings
04:37 - over here are the commands he can use
04:39 - and over here is where the code is going
04:41 - to be that we're going to create so
04:42 - she's going to basically use these
04:43 - commands to make some code
04:45 - so sophia can you start by getting the
04:47 - artist to move
04:48 - 100 pixels to the right
04:54 - and then hit run to see what that's
04:56 - going to do
04:58 - all right so the artist moved 100 pixels
05:00 - to draw a line that's not super
05:02 - incredible but it's a first start
05:05 - so next what we want to do is have the
05:06 - artist draw a shape so sophie can you
05:08 - have the artist turn right after his
05:11 - little move command and then move again
05:18 - and now hit run
05:22 - all right so can you drive so can you uh
05:24 - basically copy that basically multiple
05:27 - more turn and move commands
05:30 - so maybe three or four more
05:32 - as as she's doing this i want people to
05:34 - uh to basically type in the chat area
05:36 - what they think this is gonna do when
05:38 - she hits the run button next
05:44 - keep going
05:54 - one more move and one more turn
06:03 - all right
06:04 - so what do you all think this is going
06:05 - to draw so eric says it's going to be a
06:07 - square
06:08 - so if you say can you hit run and reset
06:10 - again
06:13 - all right that's the square
06:15 - that's pretty simple so one thing we
06:17 - want to do is show the repeat blocks so
06:18 - if you take out most of these except
06:20 - just to move forward and turn right if
06:22 - you look it says move turn move turn
06:24 - move turn move turn so instead of doing
06:26 - it that way we can just repeat it four
06:28 - times
06:29 - so four times
06:31 - we're going to repeat this move turn
06:34 - this does the same thing so if i type
06:35 - the number four here
06:38 - and you hit the reset it draws a simple
06:40 - square now let's make every square
06:43 - make the square a random color and
06:45 - repeat and draw many many many many
06:47 - squares so
06:49 - basically drag another repeat block
06:54 - and
06:56 - put put it up there and put the first
06:58 - one inside there
07:00 - and now repeat like a hundred times
07:05 - not three thousand one hundred one
07:07 - hundred times
07:08 - and now each time the square gets drawn
07:10 - make it a different color
07:12 - so before you draw the square set color
07:15 - to random color
07:19 - so now we're going to draw 100 squares
07:22 - hit the reset button and start it over
07:23 - again
07:29 - and you can make it faster if you want
07:33 - okay stop that's getting boring but what
07:36 - you're seeing right now is a very simple
07:38 - algorithm where we're basically using
07:39 - the repeat command telling it not only
07:42 - to draw a square but to repeatedly draw
07:44 - a square but all those squares are right
07:46 - on top of each other so
07:48 - what are what are the things we could do
07:50 - that we can make so we can see every one
07:52 - of those squares individually maybe we
07:54 - can put another turn command so after
07:55 - each square there's a little bit of a
07:57 - turn
07:59 - not 90 degrees
08:02 - yeah pick a smaller number like maybe
08:04 - now you can use that angle thing to turn
08:06 - just a little bit a tiny little turn
08:08 - yeah that's good
08:10 - 11 degrees okay
08:12 - now hit run and see what happens
08:15 - so after every square it's doing a turn
08:21 - and it's going to keep going
08:25 - because we said 11 degrees
08:29 - so it's going to do 100 different little
08:31 - squares each one slightly farther apart
08:34 - from the other
08:43 - so what's cool about this do you want to
08:45 - see truck do the same thing by using
08:47 - triangles instead of squares
08:50 - so instead of doing
08:51 - the if we want to change that from a
08:53 - square to a triangle remember when we
08:55 - said repeat four times move forward and
08:56 - 90 degrees change that to move three
08:59 - times
09:00 - and then turn it two
09:02 - and
09:03 - oops
09:05 - three times
09:07 - and then turn right by we should do 120.
09:11 - yeah let's make this a little more too
09:14 - here and you want to change the turn
09:16 - okay so you just play with the numbers
09:18 - and then you can click run and make a
09:20 - different shape
09:23 - and now these are triangles
09:27 - yeah the other thing we could do is make
09:28 - stickers so why don't we make a sticker
09:32 - all throughout this square so drag the
09:33 - draw sticker shape
09:36 - and put it into the middle of that
09:38 - square
09:40 - or the triangle
09:42 - that's going to do it at the end of each
09:44 - one
09:44 - [Music]
09:46 - yeah do it like
09:47 - many times inside the triangle yeah
09:49 - something like that and let's choose a
09:51 - sticker so can folks type in the chat
09:53 - what sticker they want what shape should
09:55 - we put in there
09:56 - we have like an alien
09:58 - ghost a wizard a wizard
10:03 - somebody chose zombie
10:05 - okay which one of these is the zombie i
10:07 - don't see the zombie there's the zombie
10:09 - can you pick the zombie
10:12 - so now every single time that's drawing
10:15 - it's also going to draw zombies all over
10:16 - the place so hit the run button let's
10:18 - see what happens
10:20 - oh there's a lot of zombies everywhere
10:25 - we've created a monster
10:27 - all right so this is a very simple
10:29 - algorithm we just made
10:31 - and that was basically zombie
10:32 - apocalypse
10:34 - and one thing i want to show is anytime
10:36 - you write code on code.org and we're
10:38 - using the code.org hour of code right
10:40 - here do this when you hit the finish
10:42 - button you can see your creation
10:45 - you can share it and you can also send
10:47 - it to your phone so there's a qr code
10:50 - that you can actually scan with your
10:51 - phone and if you have your phone camera
10:53 - ready you could basically
10:56 - use that if you want
10:58 - if you want it so i'm gonna use my phone
11:00 - camera
11:01 - to scan that
11:03 - and it'll actually then
11:04 - show me how to go and then i can then
11:06 - get the same zombie apocalypse
11:12 - the same zombie apocalypse is now on my
11:14 - phone so it's really easy to build
11:17 - something that you also then send to a
11:18 - phone and play with
11:20 - i have zombies all over my phone
11:23 - so moving on let's do something
11:25 - different i want to now teach something
11:27 - else in computer science we learned
11:29 - about algorithms
11:30 - let's turn about let's learn about
11:33 - events
11:34 - so
11:35 - events sophia do you want to explain
11:37 - what are events in computer science
11:38 - event is not really like a run command
11:40 - but it's something that it can be played
11:43 - many times if you press something like
11:45 - for example a one if you have the code
11:48 - under event every time you press one
11:50 - that code will run
11:51 - yep so an event is when the computer is
11:53 - reacting to something that happened so
11:56 - instead of you just giving it the
11:57 - commands to do over and over and over
11:59 - you can say when the mouse is clicked or
12:01 - when a key is pressed or when when
12:04 - somebody taps the screen or if there's a
12:07 - very loud sound when something happens
12:10 - you make something happen that you you
12:12 - react to it so
12:14 - we're going to do something involving
12:16 - events but using dancing
12:18 - we're going to have
12:20 - sophia is going to do some dancing for
12:21 - us and we're going to program her using
12:24 - events and the events are going to say
12:26 - when you see the letter a
12:28 - and when you see the letter b
12:31 - and when you see the letter c
12:34 - and sophia are you ready to do the
12:35 - dancing
12:41 - is that gonna be better
12:43 - finally ask the audience so they can
12:45 - decide who's gonna do the dancing so why
12:48 - don't you all decide by chatting who
12:50 - should do the dancing sofia
12:52 - or hottie or dad if you don't know how
12:55 - to stop me people are saying howdy howdy
12:57 - come on let's have some folks ask for
12:59 - sophia
13:00 - oh come on
13:02 - all right i'm gonna do the dance yeah
13:05 - well wait eula says sophia it sounds
13:07 - like it's a tie most no see most there's
13:10 - a bunch of people who said sophia should
13:12 - do this two out of like
13:14 - five okay fine i'll do it
13:16 - so sofia is gonna hold up different
13:19 - letters a b and c
13:21 - and we're going to have three different
13:23 - dance moves for when she holds the
13:25 - letters but we want to have the audience
13:27 - choose what the dance moves are
13:29 - so the first is
13:32 - when
13:33 - the a is showing what should the dance
13:35 - move be the choices are let's say a kick
13:39 - or a clap
13:40 - uh kick or clap
13:43 - yeah what should we do on the letter a
13:45 - kick or clap
13:50 - okay it sounds like people are saying
13:53 - clap
13:54 - right so we're going to make the first
13:57 - command be that when the a shows we're
14:00 - going to do a clap
14:02 - all right the next dance move is going
14:04 - to be when the b shows hold up your
14:06 - letter b
14:08 - when the b shows
14:11 - we can choose between
14:13 - a
14:14 - dab or a floss
14:17 - so can folks type in what would you like
14:19 - on the letter b
14:21 - floss okay
14:23 - floss is like a really hard move so if
14:25 - you don't make me do this too often
14:29 - all right
14:30 - and then lastly when the letter c shows
14:33 - uh
14:34 - [Music]
14:35 - we've done a clap in a floss shall we
14:37 - make the third one just be a dab
14:40 - yeah
14:42 - all right
14:43 - so we're gonna have
14:45 - here's our code
14:47 - when the a shows
14:49 - clap
14:51 - when the b shows
14:53 - floss
14:55 - and when the c shows dab all right i'm
14:58 - gonna get my code ready
15:01 - so i don't forget what these commands
15:03 - are
15:05 - and sophia is gonna
15:08 - and if you're watching at home and the
15:10 - students who are younger you can follow
15:12 - along with sophia yourselves
15:14 - to get up a little bit to get moving a
15:16 - bit
15:17 - um and sophia you hit this play button
15:19 - to start the music
15:21 - right is everybody ready and sophia is
15:23 - going to show the letters and i'm going
15:24 - to quickly do
15:27 - a is clap b as floss c is dab
15:32 - right you're so tall
15:35 - ready sofia yes
15:43 - [Music]
16:00 - go
16:05 - [Music]
16:15 - [Music]
16:24 - right so that was a little bit of
16:25 - exercise for me but what we're going to
16:26 - do next is show how you can actually do
16:28 - this
16:29 - on a computer using coding and sophia is
16:31 - going to do the coding this time yes
16:33 - sure okay
16:35 - so i'm gonna go into the code.org dance
16:37 - party
16:39 - so we're gonna share our screen again
16:42 - here's the code.org dance party
16:46 - and so let's do the same code that we
16:48 - were just doing uh but using
16:51 - i mean basically the same dance so that
16:53 - everybody helped us decide so why don't
16:56 - you first
16:58 - create a world and choose a world
16:59 - background
17:06 - should we ask our audience what
17:07 - background to use
17:10 - so choose from the different backgrounds
17:12 - should we do a firework or a laser dance
17:14 - floor
17:21 - um
17:22 - let's do the laser dance floor
17:24 - oh somebody said neon disco choose neon
17:26 - disco
17:29 - disco ball
17:31 - all right now put a dancer in the middle
17:39 - and you probably wanted to be a cat
17:40 - because you love cats
17:43 - okay
17:44 - well and you want to put some dancers in
17:46 - the all around it as well so make a
17:48 - group of dancers you can make it be a
17:49 - cat because i know you love cats
17:53 - and then make like
17:55 - 20 of something else
17:59 - 20
18:00 - and let's ask the audience what we want
18:02 - this one to be so should these be dogs
18:04 - or ducks or pineapples or robots
18:08 - somebody said aliens
18:10 - let's go aliens
18:12 - okay aliens aliens is i think pretty
18:15 - popular
18:16 - all right
18:17 - um
18:18 - and then what do we want these these
18:20 - dancers are going to do different stuff
18:21 - when we hit the keys so see where it
18:23 - says events and that's what we were
18:25 - learning about is events
18:28 - so click
18:29 - choose when the up arrow key is pressed
18:31 - but instead of the up key click
18:34 - and choose the letter a
18:37 - and for letter a we're going to do a
18:38 - clap
18:39 - i don't remember what they are you'll
18:40 - need to look it up okay okay so now go
18:43 - into the dancers and make everybody do a
18:45 - clap
18:51 - and then choose you can
18:54 - say when the b letter is pressed
18:56 - what's the b again
18:59 - b is false
19:06 - yep okay
19:07 - i always mix these
19:09 - up
19:10 - okay last one and then the last one
19:13 - when a c is pressed
19:20 - and have it do dab forever
19:27 - all right so you're going to use the
19:28 - little keyboard
19:30 - to make the dance work and for the song
19:32 - we have this thing here the ode to code
19:35 - we could choose all sorts of songs here
19:37 - uh
19:38 - but because it's eu code week we have
19:40 - the ode to code song that's been written
19:42 - for eu code week
19:44 - all right are you ready for this and
19:45 - sophia you're gonna man the keyboard
19:48 - ready and so you're gonna do a b and c
19:55 - [Applause]
19:55 - [Music]
19:57 - you want to shout out as you're doing
20:04 - [Music]
20:06 - hey
20:08 - and can you do it faster like um
20:13 - [Music]
20:26 - [Music]
20:32 - okay all right
20:33 - so we could do lots and lots of
20:35 - different things
20:36 - somebody said stop for a second it's
20:38 - laggy for me but there's all sorts of
20:40 - different dances you can make this much
20:42 - much more complicated with different key
20:43 - presses and different moves
20:45 - and then this too you can also once
20:47 - you've finished your dance you can also
20:49 - send it to your phone
20:51 - as well
20:53 - but i want to now switch gears and do
20:55 - something a lot more complicated we're
20:56 - going to actually make our own little
20:58 - app and this is also going to use events
21:02 - so we're jumping into code.org's app lab
21:05 - if you're in elementary school you'll
21:06 - still be able to follow along but the
21:08 - coding we're doing even though it's drag
21:10 - and drop
21:11 - is going to be in a programming language
21:13 - called javascript so maybe a little bit
21:15 - harder to follow along but then we're
21:17 - going to jump into something easy
21:18 - afterwards again so don't lose us
21:21 - um so the app that i want to make is an
21:23 - image tutorial you know in apps like
21:25 - instagram or snapchat if you take photos
21:28 - you can basically
21:29 - draw on your photo we want to make an
21:31 - app like that so you can draw uh
21:34 - we're gonna have you pick a photo that
21:35 - you draw on as well
21:38 - so
21:38 - um
21:39 - so we're gonna have you pick a photo
21:42 - from here
21:44 - we're gonna go so here's app lab and
21:46 - here you have we're gonna be able to
21:48 - design our app in design mode and then
21:50 - write the code for it
21:52 - so the first thing we wanna do is drag
21:54 - an image
21:56 - that is the image that our app is gonna
21:57 - have that's kind of important
22:00 - yes
22:02 - and for the image
22:04 - we're gonna choose
22:05 - a cat
22:08 - this cat
22:11 - which is sophia's cat and i didn't have
22:13 - sunny so this is our previous cat
22:15 - right so here's our little cat and we
22:17 - want to write the code so that sophia
22:19 - can doodle on this cat
22:21 - and draw all over it
22:26 - all right sophia are you ready
22:28 - yes
22:29 - so what we want to do is make it so that
22:31 - any time the mouse moves you're drawing
22:34 - so can you drag an on event block from
22:37 - over there
22:43 - and say on events that on the screen you
22:46 - see a mouse move event
22:48 - so on the screen when you get a mouse
22:50 - move
22:51 - event
22:53 - and then we want to move and draw to
22:55 - that location so go into the turtle
22:57 - drawing commands
22:59 - and say move to
23:05 - but instead of moving to zero zero we're
23:07 - going to move to event dot
23:10 - x
23:12 - and event dot y
23:14 - and that's the location that the mouse
23:16 - move event brought us to so now click
23:18 - run
23:19 - and then move around oops click run
23:21 - again
23:25 - oops we have an error hold on
23:29 - i need to put a little event here
23:32 - okay try it again
23:38 - and so the as you're moving the turtle
23:40 - is moving but it's not drawing anything
23:42 - so how do we get it to draw
23:45 - now we're doing something called
23:46 - debugging
23:47 - this is basically a bug that we found in
23:50 - our code
23:52 - that i drew yes sophia drew this little
23:54 - ladybug so hit the reset button
23:57 - so the problem is that the turtle isn't
23:59 - drawing at all because his pen isn't
24:01 - down so what we need to do
24:03 - is drag this pen down command to the
24:06 - very front and the very top of your code
24:11 - and while we're there let's check the
24:12 - pen color so make the pen color
24:17 - white
24:19 - yeah you can click there and choose the
24:21 - color for it
24:23 - oh no you can't
24:24 - i'll i'll type it in
24:26 - we'll make it a white pen
24:29 - and do you want to choose the pen width
24:30 - as well sure
24:35 - and we'll make that five
24:37 - okay now hit run
24:43 - so
24:43 - is it drawing i don't think so
24:49 - that dad i have perfectly good way i can
24:52 - see it's not dry it's not drying
24:57 - hmm
24:59 - do you need to do the pen color before
25:03 - no no this is correct
25:05 - i'm only wondering if it's not drawing
25:07 - on the image because it's drawing
25:10 - on the screen ahead of it i think we
25:12 - need to
25:18 - let's go to design mode
25:21 - and hit run again
25:23 - oh it is drawing
25:26 - all right so i'm just going to get rid
25:27 - of the cat so we write the code without
25:28 - the cat behind it
25:30 - okay
25:31 - so you're doing this image doodling
25:34 - so
25:35 - let me change this green color though so
25:37 - we'll we'll debug that later but for now
25:39 - all we're going to do is is continue
25:42 - doing this code so hit the run button
25:43 - one of the problems
25:44 - right now is as you're moving around can
25:47 - you stop the drawing
25:49 - i don't think no it's drawing all the
25:51 - time the reason is right now it's always
25:54 - the pen is down remember how we said pen
25:56 - down so we need to have the pen
25:58 - sometimes be down and sometimes be up
26:01 - maybe when you're clicking okay so hit
26:02 - reset we can use other events remember
26:05 - we're learning about events all right so
26:07 - click out go into ui controls
26:10 - and choose on event it's at the top
26:16 - on events so we want to figure out that
26:17 - when the mouse is down the pen should be
26:20 - down
26:21 - so in the screen
26:24 - gets a mouse down event
26:27 - then
26:28 - say
26:30 - pen down go to turtle
26:33 - pen down
26:38 - and also let's also make a move to
26:40 - command right here as well so we'll say
26:43 - move to
26:45 - and over here event dot x
26:47 - and events dot y what about the pen down
26:50 - at the top of the screen
26:52 - oh you don't want it to this one you
26:54 - mean yeah you want it to no longer start
26:56 - with the pen being down how should it
26:58 - start
26:59 - pin up let's start with the pen up
27:03 - okay
27:04 - so now what's this going to do
27:06 - hit run and see what happens
27:10 - yay so now it's not drawing until you
27:12 - click
27:13 - now can you stop
27:15 - wait it's not stopping the drawing stop
27:17 - the drawing you want to make a smiley
27:19 - face okay so you can't do it because now
27:21 - we did what we said when the mouse goes
27:23 - down but we didn't do anything when the
27:24 - mouse goes up so now go to ui controls
27:28 - and then say on event
27:32 - screen one
27:34 - thus up
27:36 - i think
27:37 - yep that's a good guess when the screen
27:39 - has a mouse up event
27:41 - what should we do
27:43 - you don't need that okay
27:46 - maybe
27:48 - and up
27:50 - yeah
27:51 - all right so now i think you have a full
27:53 - image doodler
27:57 - so now you can draw whatever you want
27:59 - lift the mouse up
28:02 - yay so do you want to add some more
28:04 - stuff to this image doodler to make it
28:06 - slightly more powerful
28:08 - okay stop
28:09 - let's let's add some stuff because this
28:11 - is kind of simplistic but the other
28:13 - thing is see this little triangle that's
28:15 - moving around with us that's the little
28:16 - turtle
28:17 - and we can have him hide so we don't see
28:20 - him as we're writing our code
28:22 - so basically there's a hide command
28:25 - to hide the turtle
28:27 - but what i want to do is add some
28:28 - buttons to basically let you choose the
28:31 - color so click design to move to the
28:33 - design mode
28:35 - and drag a few buttons to either the
28:38 - bottom of the top of the screen maybe
28:39 - three three buttons
28:44 - you're not gonna be perfect
28:47 - they don't need to be perfect
28:51 - okay move them around a little bit okay
28:53 - okay let's name these different buttons
28:56 - after different colors and let's ask the
28:58 - audience what colors should we use for
29:00 - the first button
29:03 - we can choose red green blue wow
29:06 - everybody's choosing red
29:08 - so red
29:10 - okay so the first button is red
29:12 - and we can even choose the color of this
29:14 - button
29:15 - to be red
29:17 - is that kind of reddish it's like an
29:19 - orange artist but it does it's close
29:21 - enough right what color should we make
29:23 - the next button
29:26 - blue green yellow
29:30 - blue
29:31 - what somebody said violet
29:34 - blue and green let's let's do the next
29:36 - two buttons blue and green so this one
29:38 - is going to be blue
29:42 - and then this one
29:44 - the text of it will make green
29:48 - and so if you want to help me choose
29:50 - green
29:56 - that's good all right that's good red
29:58 - blue and green are our buttons so how do
30:01 - we make the code so that depending on
30:03 - which button we press the color changes
30:06 - will be another event we need to use
30:08 - events that's right
30:10 - so
30:11 - go into ui controls again
30:13 - and then say on event
30:16 - and now we need to choose when the
30:18 - buttons are clicked
30:20 - so
30:20 - on event where the button is clicked
30:23 - which button
30:24 - i think button four
30:26 - how do you know just pick button four
30:28 - and then hover over them to see what
30:30 - they are that one's button four that
30:32 - one's button five thousand six so when
30:33 - button four is clicked
30:35 - what should we do
30:37 - go into the turtle again let me change
30:39 - the pen color yeah scroll down and see
30:42 - where it says pen color
30:46 - and it's already set to red okay
30:48 - and then now bring another ui event on
30:51 - event
30:58 - and instead of id you want to choose
31:00 - button five
31:03 - and then oh no that's that's correct
31:05 - okay and then you want to do a turtle
31:06 - command
31:09 - and choose the pen color
31:12 - blue
31:13 - click on the red you do
31:16 - all right
31:17 - and then last last one for green
31:20 - you're way ahead of me now
31:26 - there we go turtle no don't forget to
31:29 - choose the id for your button we still
31:31 - have the turtle
31:35 - issac called turtle by the way you
31:36 - always want to know why is it called
31:38 - turtle yeah that is a great question
31:41 - like python or something
31:43 - no python is internal or differently
31:45 - named by different people a long time
31:47 - ago there's a
31:49 - basically an mit turtle drawing
31:52 - was started out early on it actually was
31:53 - a little turtle that moved around on the
31:55 - screen so you could see it moving and
31:57 - you could give it command
31:59 - oh
32:00 - right so now you hit the run button
32:05 - can you choose the different colors
32:07 - click to make different colors
32:09 - so now you make blue
32:12 - now you may choose green
32:15 - and you can choose red
32:20 - now you can draw all sorts of stuff
32:22 - so
32:23 - do you want to also let you change it to
32:25 - make it a thick brush or a thin brush
32:27 - sure this is also one of the fun things
32:29 - you could do so go back into design mode
32:32 - and like
32:33 - and pick a slider see that slider
32:37 - put a slider at the top of the screen
32:40 - and
32:41 - we need to choose what the slider goes
32:43 - from what to what right now it goes from
32:44 - zero to 100 let's make it go from like
32:47 - one
32:48 - to
32:49 - one thousand
32:51 - fifteen yeah
32:53 - okay so it goes from one to fifteen so
32:56 - now this is also really easy to do we'll
32:58 - basically make it so this slider chooses
33:00 - our pen width okay
33:03 - so drag another on events
33:07 - blocks how many
33:11 - we're using events all throughout this
33:13 - lesson
33:15 - that's good
33:16 - and then on event
33:17 - choose the slider
33:20 - it's called it's slider one
33:27 - and the event this isn't a click event
33:29 - it's a change event
33:31 - so when the slider changes
33:33 - what we're going to get
33:35 - is now we want to change the width so go
33:38 - to turtle
33:42 - and when you what what you want to do is
33:44 - pen width
33:48 - but the width we're going to need to do
33:50 - it's not like the number three we we
33:52 - need to know what's in the value of the
33:53 - slider
33:54 - so the way you're gonna need to do this
33:58 - is go into ui controls
34:01 - and get the text
34:04 - of what's inside the slider
34:07 - so instead of setting the width to three
34:09 - we'll get the number that's in the
34:10 - slider
34:11 - so now hit run
34:18 - change the slider
34:22 - it looks slightly the same
34:24 - and now it's thin
34:26 - now it's super tight okay wanna make a
34:27 - big red thick thread line
34:32 - yeah it's a thick red line
34:35 - yeah
34:37 - you can i bet you wanted the slider to
34:39 - make even thicker lines didn't you
34:42 - do you want to show how to make really
34:43 - thick lines go to go into design mode
34:45 - and change what the slider can do so
34:48 - right now
34:49 - the slider was going the minimum values
34:52 - from 1 to 15 where would you want it to
34:54 - be
34:57 - 50
34:58 - okay
35:00 - you're going to break it one of the fun
35:02 - things about coding is trying to break
35:03 - the computer
35:08 - so that's a small slider
35:11 - you would do red red and thick okay
35:14 - behold
35:16 - oh
35:17 - super thick line
35:21 - all right so let's finish off with this
35:23 - um
35:24 - can you show our audience how to share
35:26 - this so that i can get it onto our phone
35:27 - and so we can do this right here maybe
35:30 - the share button click the share button
35:32 - and then hit send to phone
35:34 - and any of you if you have a phone all
35:36 - you need to do is then
35:38 - scan the qr code that shows up on the
35:40 - screen
35:40 - and open it
35:47 - and i'm now going to stop the share and
35:49 - show you this app that we made
35:51 - basically has everything we just did
35:54 - in an app so i can hit the blue
35:56 - and make it small
36:00 - it's kind of hard to show an app while
36:01 - using it on the screen but basically the
36:04 - app that we made is now something we
36:05 - have on our screen as well it's the qr
36:07 - code
36:09 - i went too fast all right so now let's
36:11 - move to our third and last section of
36:14 - today's lesson what we're going to learn
36:16 - about is something super important
36:19 - called artificial intelligence
36:21 - and artificial intelligence is something
36:24 - that's being used everywhere around the
36:26 - world we're not going to be coding the
36:28 - ai right now we're going to be doing
36:30 - what's called training so artificial
36:32 - intelligence means like when computers
36:34 - are like magically smart
36:37 - but we're going to learn about a
36:38 - specific type of artificial intelligence
36:40 - called machine learning and what machine
36:42 - learning is is a computer basically is
36:46 - learning from what we tell it whatever
36:48 - we tell it it learns and so
36:51 - the training we provided is very similar
36:53 - to writing code but instead of
36:56 - writing in code we're just giving it
36:58 - data and when the computer sees enough
37:00 - data it learns we're going to start this
37:03 - with something really simple to using
37:06 - code.org to teach the computer the
37:08 - difference between fish and garbage and
37:11 - this is something that we could use
37:12 - later for having computers learn how to
37:14 - clean our oceans and this is actually
37:16 - important because lots of things like
37:18 - problems like cleaning the ocean and
37:20 - many other world problems are problems
37:22 - that we're going to need machine
37:23 - learning and artificial intelligence to
37:25 - solve
37:27 - so i'm going to share our screen
37:29 - and this is going to be
37:32 - using the code.org ai for ocean's
37:34 - tutorial okay is the fork are you ready
37:38 - so what we want to do right now is we're
37:40 - going to be training the computer and
37:42 - training the ai um so this says is this
37:45 - a fish sophia do you want to do that or
37:47 - do you want to call it out
37:48 - worth it but there's two ways to do this
37:51 - you can do the funny way and just make
37:53 - everything you want the opposite no
37:55 - let's train the ai properly let's say
37:57 - this is not a fish
37:58 - is this a fish yes yes is that a fish
38:02 - yes is that a fish no
38:04 - is that a fish no
38:07 - so you're helping it by training it
38:08 - that's that's a fish
38:10 - that's not a fish
38:12 - that's a fish
38:14 - not a fish right so we've given it 12
38:17 - pieces of data
38:18 - so far we're training it each time we
38:21 - show it something it can tell the
38:22 - difference between fish and not a fish
38:24 - do you think that's enough data stop
38:26 - stop stop stop stop now let's see if
38:28 - that's enough for ai to tell the
38:30 - difference between fish and garbage hit
38:32 - run
38:34 - and see it's detected
38:36 - wait a second that's not a fish that's a
38:38 - fish
38:39 - that see it's doing a good job
38:41 - it's figured it out
38:43 - yes
38:44 - wait
38:45 - it doesn't know how to recognize apple
38:47 - cores as not being fish newest fish
38:49 - species apples
38:52 - wait
38:53 - wait
38:54 - so if we finish this ai also once we've
38:57 - trained it it can move super fast and if
39:00 - we continue we can see
39:02 - all the things that it chose were fish
39:05 - and it got lots of things right but got
39:07 - some of them wrong now click into the
39:09 - little knot area to see
39:11 - these are all the things it recognizes
39:16 - so if we wanted to help ai do better you
39:18 - would click train more because it didn't
39:20 - have enough data but hold on hold on
39:23 - hold on but i want to show something
39:24 - different let's train ai to do something
39:27 - to learn something that it doesn't know
39:29 - that we don't even know what it is let's
39:31 - have it decide
39:32 - a word to teach like basically we can
39:35 - teach a new word to the ai we can teach
39:37 - it to recognize fish that are fierce or
39:40 - spooky or delicious or wild
39:44 - so why don't we ask the audience what
39:46 - word we should teach our fish
39:48 - somebody says angry
39:50 - angry fish fish
39:53 - wild fish glitchy fish
39:56 - silly fish
39:58 - all right let's choose between
40:01 - okay lots of people said angry let's
40:03 - choose angry fish
40:05 - i like angry birds also but we're going
40:07 - to choose
40:08 - so hold on let's decide are you going to
40:10 - decide or am i going to decide because
40:11 - now it really matters because it's an
40:13 - opinion
40:14 - because before one of those fish or
40:16 - trash you'll do rock paper scissors
40:18 - paper scissors shoot okay you get to the
40:21 - side
40:22 - all right is that fish angry
40:25 - i don't think it's angry okay so not
40:27 - angry how about that one no
40:31 - that one looks angry
40:33 - but it's your opinion i think it looks
40:35 - very
40:41 - it's got like angry eyes with a happy
40:43 - face so i don't know
40:45 - i don't think he's angry you're gonna
40:46 - say it's angry
40:48 - that one's definitely angry this one's
40:50 - sort of angry
40:52 - i'm sad more fish
40:57 - all right go a little faster as you're
40:58 - choosing these
41:02 - i'm just so angry
41:03 - is that guy's angry
41:07 - that one's definitely angry because no
41:09 - no the one you chose oh okay so you're
41:12 - basically not choosing whatever you want
41:14 - and what's important to note here is you
41:16 - might not think that sofia is coding but
41:18 - she's kind of doing the equivalent of
41:20 - coding with machine learning
41:22 - the data that you give ai is the code
41:26 - and the ai is learning from sofia what's
41:28 - angry and what's not angry and what's
41:30 - really important here is that every time
41:32 - sophia is making this decision between
41:34 - not angry and angry she's giving an
41:36 - opinion it's her opinion of what what
41:39 - angry looks like and that opinion is
41:41 - being used to train the computer and we
41:44 - should think when we do this when ai is
41:46 - being trained by a human opinion
41:48 - if she has the wrong opinion
41:50 - she gets to decide and the ai can learn
41:53 - something good or bad because she's the
41:54 - one doing the training
41:56 - this is really relevant because computer
41:58 - systems when they're when you train ai
42:00 - they're not necessarily getting it right
42:02 - or wrong they're just mirroring and
42:04 - repeating
42:05 - the training we give them if the data
42:07 - that we use to train them has some kind
42:10 - of bias
42:11 - for example if she thought that was
42:12 - angry then it would learn wrong
42:15 - the other thing is it's only learning
42:17 - from the fish that we see here so if
42:20 - once we train this it may not work on
42:22 - other types of fish because we're only
42:23 - given a limited set of fish all right so
42:25 - if you hit the continue button so we can
42:27 - see
42:28 - two so now we trained 60 fish and now we
42:32 - can run and have the ai
42:35 - see how well it learned
42:39 - that one's definitely angry wait
42:42 - it's
42:44 - so it's doing okay but i would say not
42:47 - perfect
42:48 - so can you speed it up
42:54 - okay i got some what does that oh i'm
42:56 - angry so let's hit continue to see all
42:59 - the fish that it determines that are
43:01 - angry and sad
43:03 - so some of these so now what's cool is
43:06 - we can actually find out why it thought
43:08 - something was angry it stopped this was
43:10 - angry because of its mouth
43:13 - and because of its tail
43:15 - click on one of the other ones and we
43:16 - can see why he thinks it's angry that
43:18 - one because of its eyes and its mouth
43:21 - let's see that one now that one also its
43:24 - eyes and its mouth
43:27 - that one its eyes and for some reason it
43:28 - thinks that dorsal fin is angry why do i
43:31 - think this one is angry
43:36 - okay the eyes
43:37 - uh you thought the sort of black eyes
43:39 - are angry they're
43:41 - kind of cute
43:43 - so you can find out for all the things
43:45 - the reason why hey i thought something
43:48 - i personally think the eyes are the top
43:50 - thing that shows when it's angry but
43:52 - basically since you fed it with those
43:53 - opinions that's what it's going to go
43:54 - for yeah don't judge a fish by its cover
43:58 - yeah don't it's generally not good to
44:00 - judge a book by its cover or a fish and
44:03 - this by the way is actually pretty
44:05 - relevant because computer scientists are
44:07 - doing some kind of weird things with
44:09 - machine learning so if you did you know
44:11 - that there's this is going to kind of
44:13 - bother you there's people that are
44:14 - already using machine learning
44:16 - to look at somebody's face
44:18 - and decide whether that person is
44:20 - trustworthy or not
44:22 - whether you can trust them or not just
44:24 - by seeing a photo of them and they're
44:26 - training
44:27 - machine learning just by giving it
44:29 - pictures and saying that that person's
44:31 - trustworthy that person is not
44:33 - trustworthy is it fair to judge whether
44:36 - somebody is trustworthy or not just by
44:38 - looking at their face
44:39 - no it's kind of not fair like imagine if
44:42 - a computer decided whether you should be
44:44 - allowed whether you should get a job or
44:46 - not based on what your face looks like
44:48 - that's not okay uh and
44:51 - the reality is the computer doesn't know
44:53 - what is okay or not it doesn't know
44:54 - what's ethical or not ethical it's the
44:56 - person who's training that ai who needs
44:58 - to decide is this actually a good thing
45:00 - to train a computer to do and so if
45:02 - you're training a computer to decide if
45:04 - somebody if you can trust somebody based
45:06 - on how they look that's kind of a bad
45:08 - thing we teach our children don't you
45:10 - know judge people by their looks so we
45:12 - should also teach your computers the
45:14 - same thing as well
45:16 - all right so i have one last thing to
45:17 - show with ai since we taught uh
45:20 - since we talked to the computer how to
45:22 - recognize angry or sad fish we're also
45:25 - gonna teach uh using basically computer
45:28 - vision
45:29 - how to recognize angry versus sad
45:31 - emotions
45:33 - so um and i'm going to be the one doing
45:35 - this because last time we did try this
45:36 - very bad ass showing my facial emotions
45:40 - literally okay so i'm going to first see
45:43 - uh sofia you're going to be the computer
45:45 - so you try to recognize my emotion
45:48 - what emotion is this
45:50 - i think that's happy
45:51 - what am i happy
45:53 - okay what emotion is this
45:56 - that's sad
45:58 - sad what emotion is this
46:03 - that's angry so now let's try something
46:05 - else i want to see if you can do it this
46:06 - way
46:09 - what emotion am i showing now
46:12 - happy
46:15 - that's a good guess you could tell just
46:16 - from looking at my eyes
46:18 - and what emotion am i showing now
46:22 - angry
46:23 - yeah
46:24 - now what emotion am i showing well i
46:26 - mean there's only one left so sad
46:30 - okay sad so the reason i showed that is
46:32 - you can tell my emotions just by looking
46:34 - at the upper part of my face
46:37 - and that's partly because you know me
46:38 - very well now let's see if we can train
46:41 - an ai to detect some of these things
46:45 - so
46:46 - i'm going to screen share again
46:50 - [Music]
46:52 - we're going to screen share in something
46:53 - called teachable machine this isn't on
46:56 - code.org
46:58 - but we're working at code.org building
47:00 - something similar as well teachable
47:01 - machine if you google it as this tool
47:04 - and what we're going to teach the ui of
47:06 - the ai is detect happy
47:09 - from
47:11 - sad sad too angry angry
47:15 - sleepy
47:17 - all right
47:18 - um and so if you come off the screen or
47:20 - i'll i'll the camera just point it let's
47:23 - do this part you're going to run away
47:24 - for a little bit so what we're going to
47:25 - do is teach the
47:27 - you can still be close so we can hear
47:29 - you
47:30 - all right so we're going to use the
47:31 - webcam
47:34 - and
47:35 - i'm going to show i'm going to train the
47:37 - ai what happy looks like so happy
47:44 - so that's my happy look
47:46 - then i'm gonna train the ai to see what
47:48 - sad looks like this is sad
47:50 - sad
47:54 - i'm giving it all these images i got 60
47:57 - examples of sad then lastly i'm going to
47:59 - show it what angry looks like
48:07 - that's angry all right so we gave it
48:09 - happy sad and angry and now we can hit
48:11 - click to train the model
48:14 - and now it's taking all these images
48:15 - that we gave it 26 happy images
48:18 - 60 sad images and 41 angry images
48:23 - and it's going to take a little bit of
48:24 - time to train sophia you can come and
48:26 - come and
48:27 - see what's going on right now so while
48:30 - this is training
48:34 - you were watching from afar um and you
48:36 - know why so what what i want to do is
48:38 - i'm gonna have it basically
48:40 - um let me screen share again i'm gonna
48:42 - have it try to recognize my emotions and
48:45 - then see if it can recognize your
48:46 - emotions
48:48 - see it's training basically it's going
48:50 - from counting from 1 to 50 using all the
48:53 - images that we gave it
48:59 - all right so if you can you step off
49:01 - screen again
49:03 - so now let's see
49:05 - what is it saying it's saying happy it
49:08 - sees down here that i'm happy now let's
49:10 - see if i change to sad will it recognize
49:14 - do you think it'll work for me
49:16 - you know
49:17 - how angry
49:20 - he recognizes angry for sure
49:23 - but sad
49:31 - can i try all right so it's basically
49:33 - looking at the webcam and detecting my
49:35 - emotions let's see if it knows any of
49:37 - your emotions
49:39 - okay ain't nothing on screen yet okay so
49:41 - now go happy
49:45 - angry
49:49 - it's just all sad basically it's the
49:52 - computer we trained it to see my
49:54 - emotions but when we have somebody else
49:55 - on screen it can't recognize at all do
49:58 - you know why it can't tell sofia no
50:01 - because we've trained it the very
50:02 - limited number of images we showed them
50:05 - only showed me in my face
50:07 - so
50:08 - as humans when you look at my face and
50:10 - your face you can tell what's going on
50:14 - and as humans when we see what you've
50:16 - learned what angry and sad looks like
50:18 - not only in my face but in all sorts of
50:20 - other people as well the computer we
50:22 - just gave it 60 images of each one thing
50:24 - and we only trained it on my my face so
50:27 - when we gave it your face it doesn't
50:28 - work this is also true in computer
50:30 - vision on all sorts of other things for
50:32 - example
50:33 - image recognition
50:35 - in general you can't just be trained on
50:37 - one set of people's faces you need to
50:40 - train it on people from different
50:42 - genders different races different
50:43 - ethnicities and this is kind of one of
50:45 - the problems with machine learning and
50:47 - computer vision is if you teach a
50:50 - computer to recognize faces that are
50:52 - white once they see faces that are
50:55 - black or brown they might not be as
50:57 - recognizable or asians
51:00 - and this isn't just a question of like
51:02 - does facebook know how to tag you in
51:04 - photos properly there's a number of
51:06 - reasons this is really important
51:08 - consider for example uh diagnosing of
51:11 - diseases the same computer vision that
51:13 - we did to show the teacher computer
51:15 - recognized happy from sad
51:17 - it's just looking we could have that
51:19 - look at teach a computer to look at
51:21 - x-rays and to detect
51:23 - sick from healthy or to look at
51:26 - mri scans and try to detect cancer cells
51:28 - from not cancer cells but if you do that
51:31 - you need to make sure that if you're
51:33 - going to use machine learning for
51:34 - diagnosing a disease it should work well
51:37 - across genders it would be bad if you
51:39 - only showed
51:40 - x-rays of male patients
51:42 - and then learned how to detect a disease
51:45 - but then the system doesn't work with
51:47 - women or if you did it only with people
51:50 - from one background like only white
51:52 - patients and then people who are uh
51:55 - indian or african the diagnosis doesn't
51:58 - work
51:59 - or maybe it does work but it's less
52:01 - accurate if it's slightly less accurate
52:03 - depending on your race is that fair no
52:05 - that's a tough question
52:07 - and there's so many ethical questions
52:10 - when you're basically coding an
52:12 - algorithm using data so you know when
52:14 - you're coding an algorithm with events
52:15 - like the dance you say when a do the dab
52:18 - it's it does exactly what you tell it
52:20 - but when you're coding it with data you
52:22 - need to figure out how much data is
52:24 - enough we didn't give it enough data to
52:26 - detect the fish from the trash and so
52:28 - the computer made mistakes and whether
52:30 - it's things like diagnosing diseases
52:33 - helping a car know how to avoid a
52:35 - pedestrian if it's going to be a
52:36 - self-driving car so it automatically
52:38 - hits the brakes all these types of
52:40 - things the data we give it to code the
52:42 - computer is very critical to make sure
52:44 - the computer is is and the algorithm
52:47 - is doing things ethically the way we
52:49 - want it to be
52:51 - all right we're at the end of our hours
52:52 - so we're going to get going now thank
52:54 - you so much to everybody from eu code
52:56 - week who joined us
52:57 - today we learned about events
53:01 - and we learned about
53:03 - algorithms algorithms
53:06 - and we learned about ai artificial
53:08 - intelligence and if you want to learn
53:10 - any of these things yourself you can go
53:13 - to code.org
53:16 - and all the exercises we did you can
53:18 - find over there as well
53:20 - so and there's lots of other fun things
53:22 - at code.org at home for example you can
53:24 - learn how to make your own star wars
53:26 - game and again share it to your phone
53:27 - and all sorts of stuff
53:29 - you also learned about my bug
53:31 - yeah
53:32 - we learned about sofia's bug so thank
53:34 - you everybody we're going to tune out
53:35 - now and enjoy the rest of your code week
53:37 - bye
53:42 - should we leave this camera on while
53:43 - everybody's saying goodbye i'm gonna
53:45 - click leave
53:46 - okay
54:54 - you

Cleaned transcript:

we can switch this way so we can see ourselves oh there i am hi there uh and we're here to kick off at one hour during eu code week of streaming to teach a little bit of uh coding and computer science to folks let me turn off our zoom background because it's distracting a little bit uh no background yay there we go all right um i wanted to ask everybody if you're uh joining us there's a number of ways you can chat with us but the most important one if you're not already familiar with it is the little chat button in the bottom of your screen if you see that there i'd love to see where people are calling in from so if you could chat and uh just type in the country or city that you're participating from so you can see where folks are we can see stuff you can you read some of these um songs from romania sounds from sweden greece germany abu dhabi denmark paris austria belgium portugal macedonia wow myanmar that's pretty far away croatia i've seen a lot of people from romania rhode island okay we have some folks from the united states even uh well folks are calling in from all over the place at an eu code week is one of the first weeks of the year where uh folks from all over the world in europe are basically participating in computer science uh sophie and i wanted to spend some time showing coding at to folks uh using the code.org platform you know the hour of code is one of the things that kicked off basically this idea of onehour introductions to computer science and since we started it uh eight years ago we've now had over one billion hours of code done before we jump into this i want to get a sense of what grade level folks are in that are coming in so if you could type in what grade you're in and a number from 1 through 12 for the folk for the students who are in school so we could get a sense of what grades everybody's in grade six one to six that's lots of grades elementary school one to seven one to eight one to eight it sounds like these are classrooms uh dialing in elementary thirteen to fifteen and i also wanna get a sense of how many of high school mainly all right so we have basically students from all all ages teenagers elementary school students we're going to have a program that is basically kind of targeting all ages but we're going to start at the easier stuff and then get progressively harder over time so if you're more advanced it may take a little bit of uh you may need to be a little bit patient with us and if you have questions at any point please type it into the chat room we have some folks from code.org will be able to respond at and if you have questions for us to answer you can also use uh you can basically raise your hand you see a button that looks like this to raise your hand to ask a question although the chat is probably the best way to do that all right so sophia are you ready yeah so sophia is going to be doing most of the coding during this uh except for the maybe the most advanced stuff but what we're going to first do is a little bit of coding with a tool called artist and what we're going to learn about is algorithms sophia what's an algorithm you're not sure an algorithm is when you give a computer a set of instructions or a series of steps to solve a problem of some sort oh i was thinking of something else oh you were confused about what an algorithm is all right well it's one of those words that we learn in computer science and sophia is going to make an algorithm to do some drawings so let's first share my screen can everybody see this i hope so what we're looking at right now is the code.org artist tool and sophia is going to use this but what we see over here is the little artist he's going to be making the drawings over here are the commands he can use and over here is where the code is going to be that we're going to create so she's going to basically use these commands to make some code so sophia can you start by getting the artist to move 100 pixels to the right and then hit run to see what that's going to do all right so the artist moved 100 pixels to draw a line that's not super incredible but it's a first start so next what we want to do is have the artist draw a shape so sophie can you have the artist turn right after his little move command and then move again and now hit run all right so can you drive so can you uh basically copy that basically multiple more turn and move commands so maybe three or four more as as she's doing this i want people to uh to basically type in the chat area what they think this is gonna do when she hits the run button next keep going one more move and one more turn all right so what do you all think this is going to draw so eric says it's going to be a square so if you say can you hit run and reset again all right that's the square that's pretty simple so one thing we want to do is show the repeat blocks so if you take out most of these except just to move forward and turn right if you look it says move turn move turn move turn move turn so instead of doing it that way we can just repeat it four times so four times we're going to repeat this move turn this does the same thing so if i type the number four here and you hit the reset it draws a simple square now let's make every square make the square a random color and repeat and draw many many many many squares so basically drag another repeat block and put put it up there and put the first one inside there and now repeat like a hundred times not three thousand one hundred one hundred times and now each time the square gets drawn make it a different color so before you draw the square set color to random color so now we're going to draw 100 squares hit the reset button and start it over again and you can make it faster if you want okay stop that's getting boring but what you're seeing right now is a very simple algorithm where we're basically using the repeat command telling it not only to draw a square but to repeatedly draw a square but all those squares are right on top of each other so what are what are the things we could do that we can make so we can see every one of those squares individually maybe we can put another turn command so after each square there's a little bit of a turn not 90 degrees yeah pick a smaller number like maybe now you can use that angle thing to turn just a little bit a tiny little turn yeah that's good 11 degrees okay now hit run and see what happens so after every square it's doing a turn and it's going to keep going because we said 11 degrees so it's going to do 100 different little squares each one slightly farther apart from the other so what's cool about this do you want to see truck do the same thing by using triangles instead of squares so instead of doing the if we want to change that from a square to a triangle remember when we said repeat four times move forward and 90 degrees change that to move three times and then turn it two and oops three times and then turn right by we should do 120. yeah let's make this a little more too here and you want to change the turn okay so you just play with the numbers and then you can click run and make a different shape and now these are triangles yeah the other thing we could do is make stickers so why don't we make a sticker all throughout this square so drag the draw sticker shape and put it into the middle of that square or the triangle that's going to do it at the end of each one yeah do it like many times inside the triangle yeah something like that and let's choose a sticker so can folks type in the chat what sticker they want what shape should we put in there we have like an alien ghost a wizard a wizard somebody chose zombie okay which one of these is the zombie i don't see the zombie there's the zombie can you pick the zombie so now every single time that's drawing it's also going to draw zombies all over the place so hit the run button let's see what happens oh there's a lot of zombies everywhere we've created a monster all right so this is a very simple algorithm we just made and that was basically zombie apocalypse and one thing i want to show is anytime you write code on code.org and we're using the code.org hour of code right here do this when you hit the finish button you can see your creation you can share it and you can also send it to your phone so there's a qr code that you can actually scan with your phone and if you have your phone camera ready you could basically use that if you want if you want it so i'm gonna use my phone camera to scan that and it'll actually then show me how to go and then i can then get the same zombie apocalypse the same zombie apocalypse is now on my phone so it's really easy to build something that you also then send to a phone and play with i have zombies all over my phone so moving on let's do something different i want to now teach something else in computer science we learned about algorithms let's turn about let's learn about events so events sophia do you want to explain what are events in computer science event is not really like a run command but it's something that it can be played many times if you press something like for example a one if you have the code under event every time you press one that code will run yep so an event is when the computer is reacting to something that happened so instead of you just giving it the commands to do over and over and over you can say when the mouse is clicked or when a key is pressed or when when somebody taps the screen or if there's a very loud sound when something happens you make something happen that you you react to it so we're going to do something involving events but using dancing we're going to have sophia is going to do some dancing for us and we're going to program her using events and the events are going to say when you see the letter a and when you see the letter b and when you see the letter c and sophia are you ready to do the dancing is that gonna be better finally ask the audience so they can decide who's gonna do the dancing so why don't you all decide by chatting who should do the dancing sofia or hottie or dad if you don't know how to stop me people are saying howdy howdy come on let's have some folks ask for sophia oh come on all right i'm gonna do the dance yeah well wait eula says sophia it sounds like it's a tie most no see most there's a bunch of people who said sophia should do this two out of like five okay fine i'll do it so sofia is gonna hold up different letters a b and c and we're going to have three different dance moves for when she holds the letters but we want to have the audience choose what the dance moves are so the first is when the a is showing what should the dance move be the choices are let's say a kick or a clap uh kick or clap yeah what should we do on the letter a kick or clap okay it sounds like people are saying clap right so we're going to make the first command be that when the a shows we're going to do a clap all right the next dance move is going to be when the b shows hold up your letter b when the b shows we can choose between a dab or a floss so can folks type in what would you like on the letter b floss okay floss is like a really hard move so if you don't make me do this too often all right and then lastly when the letter c shows uh we've done a clap in a floss shall we make the third one just be a dab yeah all right so we're gonna have here's our code when the a shows clap when the b shows floss and when the c shows dab all right i'm gonna get my code ready so i don't forget what these commands are and sophia is gonna and if you're watching at home and the students who are younger you can follow along with sophia yourselves to get up a little bit to get moving a bit um and sophia you hit this play button to start the music right is everybody ready and sophia is going to show the letters and i'm going to quickly do a is clap b as floss c is dab right you're so tall ready sofia yes go right so that was a little bit of exercise for me but what we're going to do next is show how you can actually do this on a computer using coding and sophia is going to do the coding this time yes sure okay so i'm gonna go into the code.org dance party so we're gonna share our screen again here's the code.org dance party and so let's do the same code that we were just doing uh but using i mean basically the same dance so that everybody helped us decide so why don't you first create a world and choose a world background should we ask our audience what background to use so choose from the different backgrounds should we do a firework or a laser dance floor um let's do the laser dance floor oh somebody said neon disco choose neon disco disco ball all right now put a dancer in the middle and you probably wanted to be a cat because you love cats okay well and you want to put some dancers in the all around it as well so make a group of dancers you can make it be a cat because i know you love cats and then make like 20 of something else 20 and let's ask the audience what we want this one to be so should these be dogs or ducks or pineapples or robots somebody said aliens let's go aliens okay aliens aliens is i think pretty popular all right um and then what do we want these these dancers are going to do different stuff when we hit the keys so see where it says events and that's what we were learning about is events so click choose when the up arrow key is pressed but instead of the up key click and choose the letter a and for letter a we're going to do a clap i don't remember what they are you'll need to look it up okay okay so now go into the dancers and make everybody do a clap and then choose you can say when the b letter is pressed what's the b again b is false yep okay i always mix these up okay last one and then the last one when a c is pressed and have it do dab forever all right so you're going to use the little keyboard to make the dance work and for the song we have this thing here the ode to code we could choose all sorts of songs here uh but because it's eu code week we have the ode to code song that's been written for eu code week all right are you ready for this and sophia you're gonna man the keyboard ready and so you're gonna do a b and c you want to shout out as you're doing hey and can you do it faster like um okay all right so we could do lots and lots of different things somebody said stop for a second it's laggy for me but there's all sorts of different dances you can make this much much more complicated with different key presses and different moves and then this too you can also once you've finished your dance you can also send it to your phone as well but i want to now switch gears and do something a lot more complicated we're going to actually make our own little app and this is also going to use events so we're jumping into code.org's app lab if you're in elementary school you'll still be able to follow along but the coding we're doing even though it's drag and drop is going to be in a programming language called javascript so maybe a little bit harder to follow along but then we're going to jump into something easy afterwards again so don't lose us um so the app that i want to make is an image tutorial you know in apps like instagram or snapchat if you take photos you can basically draw on your photo we want to make an app like that so you can draw uh we're gonna have you pick a photo that you draw on as well so um so we're gonna have you pick a photo from here we're gonna go so here's app lab and here you have we're gonna be able to design our app in design mode and then write the code for it so the first thing we wanna do is drag an image that is the image that our app is gonna have that's kind of important yes and for the image we're gonna choose a cat this cat which is sophia's cat and i didn't have sunny so this is our previous cat right so here's our little cat and we want to write the code so that sophia can doodle on this cat and draw all over it all right sophia are you ready yes so what we want to do is make it so that any time the mouse moves you're drawing so can you drag an on event block from over there and say on events that on the screen you see a mouse move event so on the screen when you get a mouse move event and then we want to move and draw to that location so go into the turtle drawing commands and say move to but instead of moving to zero zero we're going to move to event dot x and event dot y and that's the location that the mouse move event brought us to so now click run and then move around oops click run again oops we have an error hold on i need to put a little event here okay try it again and so the as you're moving the turtle is moving but it's not drawing anything so how do we get it to draw now we're doing something called debugging this is basically a bug that we found in our code that i drew yes sophia drew this little ladybug so hit the reset button so the problem is that the turtle isn't drawing at all because his pen isn't down so what we need to do is drag this pen down command to the very front and the very top of your code and while we're there let's check the pen color so make the pen color white yeah you can click there and choose the color for it oh no you can't i'll i'll type it in we'll make it a white pen and do you want to choose the pen width as well sure and we'll make that five okay now hit run so is it drawing i don't think so that dad i have perfectly good way i can see it's not dry it's not drying hmm do you need to do the pen color before no no this is correct i'm only wondering if it's not drawing on the image because it's drawing on the screen ahead of it i think we need to let's go to design mode and hit run again oh it is drawing all right so i'm just going to get rid of the cat so we write the code without the cat behind it okay so you're doing this image doodling so let me change this green color though so we'll we'll debug that later but for now all we're going to do is is continue doing this code so hit the run button one of the problems right now is as you're moving around can you stop the drawing i don't think no it's drawing all the time the reason is right now it's always the pen is down remember how we said pen down so we need to have the pen sometimes be down and sometimes be up maybe when you're clicking okay so hit reset we can use other events remember we're learning about events all right so click out go into ui controls and choose on event it's at the top on events so we want to figure out that when the mouse is down the pen should be down so in the screen gets a mouse down event then say pen down go to turtle pen down and also let's also make a move to command right here as well so we'll say move to and over here event dot x and events dot y what about the pen down at the top of the screen oh you don't want it to this one you mean yeah you want it to no longer start with the pen being down how should it start pin up let's start with the pen up okay so now what's this going to do hit run and see what happens yay so now it's not drawing until you click now can you stop wait it's not stopping the drawing stop the drawing you want to make a smiley face okay so you can't do it because now we did what we said when the mouse goes down but we didn't do anything when the mouse goes up so now go to ui controls and then say on event screen one thus up i think yep that's a good guess when the screen has a mouse up event what should we do you don't need that okay maybe and up yeah all right so now i think you have a full image doodler so now you can draw whatever you want lift the mouse up yay so do you want to add some more stuff to this image doodler to make it slightly more powerful okay stop let's let's add some stuff because this is kind of simplistic but the other thing is see this little triangle that's moving around with us that's the little turtle and we can have him hide so we don't see him as we're writing our code so basically there's a hide command to hide the turtle but what i want to do is add some buttons to basically let you choose the color so click design to move to the design mode and drag a few buttons to either the bottom of the top of the screen maybe three three buttons you're not gonna be perfect they don't need to be perfect okay move them around a little bit okay okay let's name these different buttons after different colors and let's ask the audience what colors should we use for the first button we can choose red green blue wow everybody's choosing red so red okay so the first button is red and we can even choose the color of this button to be red is that kind of reddish it's like an orange artist but it does it's close enough right what color should we make the next button blue green yellow blue what somebody said violet blue and green let's let's do the next two buttons blue and green so this one is going to be blue and then this one the text of it will make green and so if you want to help me choose green that's good all right that's good red blue and green are our buttons so how do we make the code so that depending on which button we press the color changes will be another event we need to use events that's right so go into ui controls again and then say on event and now we need to choose when the buttons are clicked so on event where the button is clicked which button i think button four how do you know just pick button four and then hover over them to see what they are that one's button four that one's button five thousand six so when button four is clicked what should we do go into the turtle again let me change the pen color yeah scroll down and see where it says pen color and it's already set to red okay and then now bring another ui event on event and instead of id you want to choose button five and then oh no that's that's correct okay and then you want to do a turtle command and choose the pen color blue click on the red you do all right and then last last one for green you're way ahead of me now there we go turtle no don't forget to choose the id for your button we still have the turtle issac called turtle by the way you always want to know why is it called turtle yeah that is a great question like python or something no python is internal or differently named by different people a long time ago there's a basically an mit turtle drawing was started out early on it actually was a little turtle that moved around on the screen so you could see it moving and you could give it command oh right so now you hit the run button can you choose the different colors click to make different colors so now you make blue now you may choose green and you can choose red now you can draw all sorts of stuff so do you want to also let you change it to make it a thick brush or a thin brush sure this is also one of the fun things you could do so go back into design mode and like and pick a slider see that slider put a slider at the top of the screen and we need to choose what the slider goes from what to what right now it goes from zero to 100 let's make it go from like one to one thousand fifteen yeah okay so it goes from one to fifteen so now this is also really easy to do we'll basically make it so this slider chooses our pen width okay so drag another on events blocks how many we're using events all throughout this lesson that's good and then on event choose the slider it's called it's slider one and the event this isn't a click event it's a change event so when the slider changes what we're going to get is now we want to change the width so go to turtle and when you what what you want to do is pen width but the width we're going to need to do it's not like the number three we we need to know what's in the value of the slider so the way you're gonna need to do this is go into ui controls and get the text of what's inside the slider so instead of setting the width to three we'll get the number that's in the slider so now hit run change the slider it looks slightly the same and now it's thin now it's super tight okay wanna make a big red thick thread line yeah it's a thick red line yeah you can i bet you wanted the slider to make even thicker lines didn't you do you want to show how to make really thick lines go to go into design mode and change what the slider can do so right now the slider was going the minimum values from 1 to 15 where would you want it to be 50 okay you're going to break it one of the fun things about coding is trying to break the computer so that's a small slider you would do red red and thick okay behold oh super thick line all right so let's finish off with this um can you show our audience how to share this so that i can get it onto our phone and so we can do this right here maybe the share button click the share button and then hit send to phone and any of you if you have a phone all you need to do is then scan the qr code that shows up on the screen and open it and i'm now going to stop the share and show you this app that we made basically has everything we just did in an app so i can hit the blue and make it small it's kind of hard to show an app while using it on the screen but basically the app that we made is now something we have on our screen as well it's the qr code i went too fast all right so now let's move to our third and last section of today's lesson what we're going to learn about is something super important called artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence is something that's being used everywhere around the world we're not going to be coding the ai right now we're going to be doing what's called training so artificial intelligence means like when computers are like magically smart but we're going to learn about a specific type of artificial intelligence called machine learning and what machine learning is is a computer basically is learning from what we tell it whatever we tell it it learns and so the training we provided is very similar to writing code but instead of writing in code we're just giving it data and when the computer sees enough data it learns we're going to start this with something really simple to using code.org to teach the computer the difference between fish and garbage and this is something that we could use later for having computers learn how to clean our oceans and this is actually important because lots of things like problems like cleaning the ocean and many other world problems are problems that we're going to need machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve so i'm going to share our screen and this is going to be using the code.org ai for ocean's tutorial okay is the fork are you ready so what we want to do right now is we're going to be training the computer and training the ai um so this says is this a fish sophia do you want to do that or do you want to call it out worth it but there's two ways to do this you can do the funny way and just make everything you want the opposite no let's train the ai properly let's say this is not a fish is this a fish yes yes is that a fish yes is that a fish no is that a fish no so you're helping it by training it that's that's a fish that's not a fish that's a fish not a fish right so we've given it 12 pieces of data so far we're training it each time we show it something it can tell the difference between fish and not a fish do you think that's enough data stop stop stop stop stop now let's see if that's enough for ai to tell the difference between fish and garbage hit run and see it's detected wait a second that's not a fish that's a fish that see it's doing a good job it's figured it out yes wait it doesn't know how to recognize apple cores as not being fish newest fish species apples wait wait so if we finish this ai also once we've trained it it can move super fast and if we continue we can see all the things that it chose were fish and it got lots of things right but got some of them wrong now click into the little knot area to see these are all the things it recognizes so if we wanted to help ai do better you would click train more because it didn't have enough data but hold on hold on hold on but i want to show something different let's train ai to do something to learn something that it doesn't know that we don't even know what it is let's have it decide a word to teach like basically we can teach a new word to the ai we can teach it to recognize fish that are fierce or spooky or delicious or wild so why don't we ask the audience what word we should teach our fish somebody says angry angry fish fish wild fish glitchy fish silly fish all right let's choose between okay lots of people said angry let's choose angry fish i like angry birds also but we're going to choose so hold on let's decide are you going to decide or am i going to decide because now it really matters because it's an opinion because before one of those fish or trash you'll do rock paper scissors paper scissors shoot okay you get to the side all right is that fish angry i don't think it's angry okay so not angry how about that one no that one looks angry but it's your opinion i think it looks very it's got like angry eyes with a happy face so i don't know i don't think he's angry you're gonna say it's angry that one's definitely angry this one's sort of angry i'm sad more fish all right go a little faster as you're choosing these i'm just so angry is that guy's angry that one's definitely angry because no no the one you chose oh okay so you're basically not choosing whatever you want and what's important to note here is you might not think that sofia is coding but she's kind of doing the equivalent of coding with machine learning the data that you give ai is the code and the ai is learning from sofia what's angry and what's not angry and what's really important here is that every time sophia is making this decision between not angry and angry she's giving an opinion it's her opinion of what what angry looks like and that opinion is being used to train the computer and we should think when we do this when ai is being trained by a human opinion if she has the wrong opinion she gets to decide and the ai can learn something good or bad because she's the one doing the training this is really relevant because computer systems when they're when you train ai they're not necessarily getting it right or wrong they're just mirroring and repeating the training we give them if the data that we use to train them has some kind of bias for example if she thought that was angry then it would learn wrong the other thing is it's only learning from the fish that we see here so if once we train this it may not work on other types of fish because we're only given a limited set of fish all right so if you hit the continue button so we can see two so now we trained 60 fish and now we can run and have the ai see how well it learned that one's definitely angry wait it's so it's doing okay but i would say not perfect so can you speed it up okay i got some what does that oh i'm angry so let's hit continue to see all the fish that it determines that are angry and sad so some of these so now what's cool is we can actually find out why it thought something was angry it stopped this was angry because of its mouth and because of its tail click on one of the other ones and we can see why he thinks it's angry that one because of its eyes and its mouth let's see that one now that one also its eyes and its mouth that one its eyes and for some reason it thinks that dorsal fin is angry why do i think this one is angry okay the eyes uh you thought the sort of black eyes are angry they're kind of cute so you can find out for all the things the reason why hey i thought something i personally think the eyes are the top thing that shows when it's angry but basically since you fed it with those opinions that's what it's going to go for yeah don't judge a fish by its cover yeah don't it's generally not good to judge a book by its cover or a fish and this by the way is actually pretty relevant because computer scientists are doing some kind of weird things with machine learning so if you did you know that there's this is going to kind of bother you there's people that are already using machine learning to look at somebody's face and decide whether that person is trustworthy or not whether you can trust them or not just by seeing a photo of them and they're training machine learning just by giving it pictures and saying that that person's trustworthy that person is not trustworthy is it fair to judge whether somebody is trustworthy or not just by looking at their face no it's kind of not fair like imagine if a computer decided whether you should be allowed whether you should get a job or not based on what your face looks like that's not okay uh and the reality is the computer doesn't know what is okay or not it doesn't know what's ethical or not ethical it's the person who's training that ai who needs to decide is this actually a good thing to train a computer to do and so if you're training a computer to decide if somebody if you can trust somebody based on how they look that's kind of a bad thing we teach our children don't you know judge people by their looks so we should also teach your computers the same thing as well all right so i have one last thing to show with ai since we taught uh since we talked to the computer how to recognize angry or sad fish we're also gonna teach uh using basically computer vision how to recognize angry versus sad emotions so um and i'm going to be the one doing this because last time we did try this very bad ass showing my facial emotions literally okay so i'm going to first see uh sofia you're going to be the computer so you try to recognize my emotion what emotion is this i think that's happy what am i happy okay what emotion is this that's sad sad what emotion is this that's angry so now let's try something else i want to see if you can do it this way what emotion am i showing now happy that's a good guess you could tell just from looking at my eyes and what emotion am i showing now angry yeah now what emotion am i showing well i mean there's only one left so sad okay sad so the reason i showed that is you can tell my emotions just by looking at the upper part of my face and that's partly because you know me very well now let's see if we can train an ai to detect some of these things so i'm going to screen share again we're going to screen share in something called teachable machine this isn't on code.org but we're working at code.org building something similar as well teachable machine if you google it as this tool and what we're going to teach the ui of the ai is detect happy from sad sad too angry angry sleepy all right um and so if you come off the screen or i'll i'll the camera just point it let's do this part you're going to run away for a little bit so what we're going to do is teach the you can still be close so we can hear you all right so we're going to use the webcam and i'm going to show i'm going to train the ai what happy looks like so happy so that's my happy look then i'm gonna train the ai to see what sad looks like this is sad sad i'm giving it all these images i got 60 examples of sad then lastly i'm going to show it what angry looks like that's angry all right so we gave it happy sad and angry and now we can hit click to train the model and now it's taking all these images that we gave it 26 happy images 60 sad images and 41 angry images and it's going to take a little bit of time to train sophia you can come and come and see what's going on right now so while this is training you were watching from afar um and you know why so what what i want to do is i'm gonna have it basically um let me screen share again i'm gonna have it try to recognize my emotions and then see if it can recognize your emotions see it's training basically it's going from counting from 1 to 50 using all the images that we gave it all right so if you can you step off screen again so now let's see what is it saying it's saying happy it sees down here that i'm happy now let's see if i change to sad will it recognize do you think it'll work for me you know how angry he recognizes angry for sure but sad can i try all right so it's basically looking at the webcam and detecting my emotions let's see if it knows any of your emotions okay ain't nothing on screen yet okay so now go happy angry it's just all sad basically it's the computer we trained it to see my emotions but when we have somebody else on screen it can't recognize at all do you know why it can't tell sofia no because we've trained it the very limited number of images we showed them only showed me in my face so as humans when you look at my face and your face you can tell what's going on and as humans when we see what you've learned what angry and sad looks like not only in my face but in all sorts of other people as well the computer we just gave it 60 images of each one thing and we only trained it on my my face so when we gave it your face it doesn't work this is also true in computer vision on all sorts of other things for example image recognition in general you can't just be trained on one set of people's faces you need to train it on people from different genders different races different ethnicities and this is kind of one of the problems with machine learning and computer vision is if you teach a computer to recognize faces that are white once they see faces that are black or brown they might not be as recognizable or asians and this isn't just a question of like does facebook know how to tag you in photos properly there's a number of reasons this is really important consider for example uh diagnosing of diseases the same computer vision that we did to show the teacher computer recognized happy from sad it's just looking we could have that look at teach a computer to look at xrays and to detect sick from healthy or to look at mri scans and try to detect cancer cells from not cancer cells but if you do that you need to make sure that if you're going to use machine learning for diagnosing a disease it should work well across genders it would be bad if you only showed xrays of male patients and then learned how to detect a disease but then the system doesn't work with women or if you did it only with people from one background like only white patients and then people who are uh indian or african the diagnosis doesn't work or maybe it does work but it's less accurate if it's slightly less accurate depending on your race is that fair no that's a tough question and there's so many ethical questions when you're basically coding an algorithm using data so you know when you're coding an algorithm with events like the dance you say when a do the dab it's it does exactly what you tell it but when you're coding it with data you need to figure out how much data is enough we didn't give it enough data to detect the fish from the trash and so the computer made mistakes and whether it's things like diagnosing diseases helping a car know how to avoid a pedestrian if it's going to be a selfdriving car so it automatically hits the brakes all these types of things the data we give it to code the computer is very critical to make sure the computer is is and the algorithm is doing things ethically the way we want it to be all right we're at the end of our hours so we're going to get going now thank you so much to everybody from eu code week who joined us today we learned about events and we learned about algorithms algorithms and we learned about ai artificial intelligence and if you want to learn any of these things yourself you can go to code.org and all the exercises we did you can find over there as well so and there's lots of other fun things at code.org at home for example you can learn how to make your own star wars game and again share it to your phone and all sorts of stuff you also learned about my bug yeah we learned about sofia's bug so thank you everybody we're going to tune out now and enjoy the rest of your code week bye should we leave this camera on while everybody's saying goodbye i'm gonna click leave okay you
