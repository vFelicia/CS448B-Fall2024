00:06 - what computer science is it's a way to
00:09 - impact the world I was exposed to
00:12 - computer science courses as early as
00:14 - sixth grade like when I was nine when I
00:16 - was 13. fourth grade I was 11. it was
00:21 - cool from the beginning for them they
00:22 - were showing other classes they were
00:24 - doing this they were showing their
00:25 - friends they were showing their families
00:28 - we Integrated Science with this
00:30 - programming and I saw my scores go up 30
00:33 - percent it's foundational for any type
00:37 - of work when I grow up I want to be a
00:39 - music writer on the computer why do you
00:41 - want to be when you grow up Olivia and I
00:44 - do programming in astronaut for a newer
00:48 - teacher that hasn't had the experience
00:49 - with it once you see it being used and
00:51 - see the successes that the kids have you
00:55 - wouldn't want to not have it in your
00:57 - class
00:59 - the skills the way of thinking the
01:01 - problem solving pieces that they learn
01:03 - in those classes they'll be able to use
01:05 - in mathematics and science and even the
01:07 - English language arts you guys have a
01:10 - lot everyone else hasn't learned yet we
01:12 - designed the code.org courses to feel
01:14 - like a game you're writing simple code
01:16 - to solve puzzles to get to the next
01:18 - level and these puzzles even use real
01:20 - game characters like Angry Birds and the
01:23 - programming uses visual blocks instead
01:25 - of typing which is how introductory
01:27 - programming is taught at leading
01:28 - universities these days because it's
01:30 - easier for the kids to get started and
01:33 - as a teacher you get a dashboard showing
01:36 - your students progress throughout the
01:37 - course this program got 100 of my
01:41 - students engaged and involved in
01:43 - participating nice work you guys this is
01:45 - so fun at first I was like kids fourth
01:49 - grade coding really are we sure we want
01:52 - to go there the learning is still there
01:54 - the information is not changing our
01:56 - students have changed and we as teachers
01:58 - need to change along with that which
02:00 - challenge are you taking on but if we
02:02 - take on the challenge and do it I can
02:04 - only imagine where our kids are going to
02:05 - be tomorrow
02:06 - have you done it before yes it's cool is
02:09 - it really fun yes we love it and my
02:11 - school's doing it yes I love it
02:14 - I love code.org as an organization and
02:18 - as a curriculum
02:20 - oh my God
02:24 - whoa it has to move three steps let's
02:27 - turn right and then ask to go straight
02:29 - again they're not just doing programming
02:31 - but they're actually using it to express
02:33 - what they've learned in math and reading
02:35 - and our normal curriculum for this side
02:38 - adjacent to this one you need to change
02:40 - that that's the main thing oh yeah
02:44 - just the other piece about learning how
02:47 - to think I mean how do we go wrong here
02:50 - you know I don't know that we do
02:56 - programming is fun and pretty easy you
02:59 - can do anything your mind wants to do I
03:03 - guess I'd like to encourage
03:04 - administrators and teachers to just be
03:06 - open to the idea because I know that
03:08 - initially I was skeptical if it's
03:10 - something engaging and it's something
03:12 - fun for them and it builds these
03:14 - critical thinking problems solving
03:15 - skills then we're only setting them up
03:18 - for success in it we should be using it
03:20 - I feel pretty passionate about making
03:22 - sure that we're equipping our kids with
03:24 - a real tool set when they leave K-12
03:28 - education and that's part of our test is
03:31 - to educate students that you know what
03:32 - computer science is not for them over
03:34 - there or somewhere else that's for you
03:36 - here now

what computer science is it's a way to impact the world I was exposed to computer science courses as early as sixth grade like when I was nine when I was 13. fourth grade I was 11. it was cool from the beginning for them they were showing other classes they were doing this they were showing their friends they were showing their families we Integrated Science with this programming and I saw my scores go up 30 percent it's foundational for any type of work when I grow up I want to be a music writer on the computer why do you want to be when you grow up Olivia and I do programming in astronaut for a newer teacher that hasn't had the experience with it once you see it being used and see the successes that the kids have you wouldn't want to not have it in your class the skills the way of thinking the problem solving pieces that they learn in those classes they'll be able to use in mathematics and science and even the English language arts you guys have a lot everyone else hasn't learned yet we designed the code.org courses to feel like a game you're writing simple code to solve puzzles to get to the next level and these puzzles even use real game characters like Angry Birds and the programming uses visual blocks instead of typing which is how introductory programming is taught at leading universities these days because it's easier for the kids to get started and as a teacher you get a dashboard showing your students progress throughout the course this program got 100 of my students engaged and involved in participating nice work you guys this is so fun at first I was like kids fourth grade coding really are we sure we want to go there the learning is still there the information is not changing our students have changed and we as teachers need to change along with that which challenge are you taking on but if we take on the challenge and do it I can only imagine where our kids are going to be tomorrow have you done it before yes it's cool is it really fun yes we love it and my school's doing it yes I love it I love code.org as an organization and as a curriculum oh my God whoa it has to move three steps let's turn right and then ask to go straight again they're not just doing programming but they're actually using it to express what they've learned in math and reading and our normal curriculum for this side adjacent to this one you need to change that that's the main thing oh yeah just the other piece about learning how to think I mean how do we go wrong here you know I don't know that we do programming is fun and pretty easy you can do anything your mind wants to do I guess I'd like to encourage administrators and teachers to just be open to the idea because I know that initially I was skeptical if it's something engaging and it's something fun for them and it builds these critical thinking problems solving skills then we're only setting them up for success in it we should be using it I feel pretty passionate about making sure that we're equipping our kids with a real tool set when they leave K12 education and that's part of our test is to educate students that you know what computer science is not for them over there or somewhere else that's for you here now
