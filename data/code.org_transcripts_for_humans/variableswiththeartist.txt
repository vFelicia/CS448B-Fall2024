00:04 - hello I'm Olga I grew up in Russia and
00:07 - then I went to the University of
00:09 - Maryland College Park and got a degree
00:11 - in computer science from there in 2009
00:14 - after that I went and join Amazon as a
00:16 - software developer a position I was
00:18 - really excited about because I love
00:20 - reading and I love books I love reading
00:23 - historical fiction and also a lot of
00:26 - non-fiction biographies of interesting
00:29 - people such as Steve Jobs or Tina
00:34 - Fe a variable is a container that you
00:37 - can store a value in when you use that
00:39 - variable in an algorithm it opens up the
00:42 - container and looks at the value inside
00:45 - this lets you write smarter algorithms
00:47 - that behave differently depending on the
00:48 - value stored in the variable for example
00:51 - if you wanted to write an algorithm to
00:53 - say happy birthday you're turning 10 to
00:56 - my little brother that's great now but
00:59 - when I run it next year I'd want it to
01:01 - say happy birthday you're turning 11 I
01:05 - could create a variable called age to
01:07 - store my brother's age and write my
01:09 - algorithm that say Happy Birthday you're
01:11 - turning age instead because variables
01:14 - can change each year I can update the
01:17 - variable age to equal age +
01:20 - 1 in this puzzle we're going to be using
01:23 - a variable that will set the length of
01:26 - the line our artist draws later on in
01:28 - our code the move for board block will
01:30 - look at that length variable to see what
01:33 - value you've set it
01:35 - to
