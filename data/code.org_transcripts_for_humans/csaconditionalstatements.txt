00:10 - one of the most exciting things as a
00:12 - teenager is getting a driver's license
00:15 - but a person has to be a certain age to
00:16 - qualify for one
00:18 - to check if someone is allowed to get a
00:20 - driver's license we can use something
00:21 - called a conditional statement
00:24 - a conditional statement is a statement
00:25 - that only executes when a condition is
00:27 - true
00:28 - to tell the difference between true and
00:30 - false we use something called a boolean
00:33 - a boolean is a primitive data type that
00:35 - can be either true or false
00:39 - one way to write a conditional statement
00:40 - is by starting with the keyword if
00:43 - an if statement has two main components
00:46 - first we need to specify the condition
00:48 - we want to check
00:50 - inside the parentheses we can write any
00:52 - statement that will result in a boolean
00:54 - value either true or false
00:57 - in this case we want to check whether or
00:58 - not someone is 16 or older
01:01 - secondly we want to specify what should
01:03 - happen if the condition is true
01:05 - inside the curly braces we write the
01:07 - code we want to execute if the condition
01:09 - is true
01:10 - in this case anyone over 16 will obtain
01:13 - a license
01:14 - the code and the body of the if
01:16 - statement will execute only if the
01:17 - condition is true
01:19 - if the condition returns false
01:22 - then no license is given
01:24 - we can now write code that makes
01:25 - decisions this is the beginning of
01:27 - designing flexible programs that can
01:29 - solve more complex problems and work in
01:31 - multiple situations
01:41 - you
