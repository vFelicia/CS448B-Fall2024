00:07 - hi my name is ji and I'm an engineer at
00:10 - Twitter I like the work I do a lot it's
00:13 - incredible the scale at which Twitter
00:15 - operates so being able to affect you
00:18 - know millions of people um sometimes
00:22 - significantly is incredibly rewarding
00:24 - and super exciting I think Engineers
00:27 - just love to solve puzzles and that's
00:29 - that's a huge part of our jobs is to
00:32 - find these big real world problems and
00:35 - then try to break them down into smaller
00:37 - parts and then solve them like a puzzle
00:40 - this lesson is called variables in
00:42 - envelopes we're going to learn how we
00:44 - can build sentences when we're still
00:46 - missing pieces of information most of us
00:49 - are already familiar with the idea of
00:50 - filling in a blank we do it when we're
00:52 - putting a name on our homework sometimes
00:55 - there's more than one blank that needs
00:56 - to be filled out and in that case we
00:59 - give the blank of a label so that we
01:01 - know which piece of information goes
01:03 - where variables are placeholders for
01:06 - pieces of information that can change by
01:08 - using a variable for missing information
01:10 - we can continue working on whatever we
01:12 - were doing and let someone else fill in
01:14 - the missing information later in
01:17 - software we use variables a lot we use
01:20 - variables as placeholders for name email
01:22 - address and even username that way we
01:25 - can let the program know where those
01:26 - details will appear after the user fills
01:29 - them in we use variables all the time in
01:32 - our work so anytime you need to store a
01:34 - piece of information for later we'll use
01:36 - a variable let's say we need to count
01:39 - the number of times that a user has
01:41 - tweeted every time that user tweets
01:43 - We'll add one to that number and every
01:46 - time that user deletes a tweet we'll
01:48 - decrease that number by one anytime we
01:50 - need to know how many times the user is
01:52 - tweeted we'll just look at that variable
