00:00 - hey I'm Josh and I'm gonna be your co
00:02 - facilitator today we're gonna watch G
00:04 - tear on his TLO take some notes about
00:06 - things that we see him as the teacher do
00:08 - and also things that we're seeing in the
00:09 - classroom and the students so let's let
00:12 - him get started
00:13 - hey everyone good morning I have a
00:15 - question for you
00:17 - when you send text messages to your
00:20 - friends
00:20 - do you always spell the words exactly
00:22 - correctly no all right oh cool what I
00:27 - want you to do is think in your head
00:29 - silently alright and come up with some
00:32 - of the words that you don't always spell
00:34 - exactly correctly maybe you make them a
00:36 - little shorter maybe you use numbers or
00:39 - something I don't want to tell you what
00:40 - you do come up with at least three
00:42 - examples silently in your head and we'll
00:43 - share them with the class give you like
00:45 - 30 seconds
00:49 - seeing some nods so I'm gonna have you
00:51 - just shout them out I mean what do you
00:53 - got
00:53 - what are your words our ETF lol alright
00:56 - I'm gonna skip that one tomorrow okay
01:00 - great just a long one that's all what do
01:02 - you got over here Thanks thx okay all
01:05 - right
01:06 - you know you know I've definitely done
01:09 - that myself because nice nice Wow very
01:18 - short very very short great these are
01:22 - all good examples what I want to know
01:24 - though is why why do you why use these
01:27 - shorter versions of words save time it's
01:32 - easier okay totally just one hand all
01:40 - right I like that anyone else doesn't
01:43 - take up as much space limited okay
01:46 - so maybe you just don't you don't have
01:48 - as much space that you can use well
01:50 - that's great so this is the reason you
01:53 - all do this this is actually an
01:55 - important computer science concept that
01:56 - we're gonna be talking about today and
01:59 - it's called compression now we've been
02:05 - talking about bits bits of information
02:07 - and here what this means is you're
02:13 - sending the same information but you're
02:17 - using fewer bits all right so we're
02:25 - gonna be exploring this computer science
02:27 - concept today Before we jump in who can
02:29 - just rattle off some files that use
02:32 - compression some file formats who knows
02:34 - some just 10 seconds here J jiff zip
02:37 - great good job MPEG great answer
02:42 - wonderful anyone else all right
02:47 - awesome job well it seems like all of
02:50 - you already basically know a lot about
02:52 - this so this is gonna be a lot of fun I
02:55 - want you to look at the people across
02:56 - from you look at these people today we
03:00 - are going to be having a competition
03:02 - with one another you're gonna be
03:03 - competing to see who can compress things
03:05 - the most you excited yeah all right I
03:09 - think so
03:10 - so why don't we all go and get out
03:12 - laptops alrighty and if you can join me
03:23 - we're at unit 2 lesson 2 all right and
03:27 - I'm gonna have everybody get together in
03:28 - pairs so there's a video but let's just
03:33 - get that I know how the Tool Works I'll
03:35 - show it to you I'm here in bubble 3 you
03:39 - don't have to go there yet I'll take
03:40 - care of it
03:41 - eyes up here we have got a message that
03:47 - we want to send and we're gonna be
03:50 - compressing it so I was trying this out
03:53 - last night let me just show you how it
03:55 - works we want to find some things that
03:59 - show up all the time let's find a word
04:02 - that shows up a few times no see that
04:08 - typed it here what are you noticing over
04:11 - here all right there's a symbol yeah I
04:16 - saw that too I thought that was pretty
04:18 - cool so then maybe I want to add another
04:21 - word who is another word they think I
04:24 - should use time great all right so let
04:31 - me break it down let me tell you exactly
04:32 - what's going on here all right we've got
04:35 - our message here don't hold off a second
04:38 - we've got our message here and then
04:40 - we're putting words into the dictionary
04:42 - do you see that uh-huh great okay and
04:47 - then we've got our bytes in the
04:51 - compression ratio that's giving us how
04:54 - much it's getting compressed as a
04:56 - percentage of the original message
04:58 - following okay so then the other thing
05:03 - you can do is sometimes you can put in
05:06 - where I ran into this last night
05:07 - sometimes you can put in words that like
05:09 - aren't even in there and it makes it
05:11 - like if I just put X X did you see how
05:14 - it made it worse
05:16 - let me do it again I'll put in a new one
05:20 - see how it made it worse it used to be
05:22 - ten now it's nine so it's getting worse
05:25 - okay seems like you all are getting the
05:28 - hang of it so I'm gonna let you work
05:30 - with your partner now and just explore
05:31 - in this bubble for a little bit to see
05:33 - if you can figure out for yourself how
05:35 - this Tool Works so what if we just had
06:05 - one even if it's just to throw peanuts
06:08 - more than one yeah I chose to underscore
06:12 - and that's a little better
06:20 - looks like there's a good number than we
06:22 - have oh I totally forgot
06:27 - everybody laptops 45 let's get them
06:30 - close a little bit yeah you know if
06:32 - close them all the way I know you're all
06:33 - doing a really good job I just
06:34 - remembered
06:36 - you don't need to just be one word so
06:40 - what was I'm sorry okay like didn't know
06:44 - is two words but you can you can put
06:52 - them together so I didn't know if I said
06:53 - that before
06:54 - but I think about that and as you're you
06:57 - know figuring out if you're gonna be the
06:59 - best compression in the room like do
07:01 - that - okay sound good all right get
07:03 - back to it you know how's it going team
07:10 - what's going on do you have a question
07:12 - is there a way to actually put one of
07:14 - the icons here oh yeah here let me show
07:18 - you okay I know I always thinking the
07:20 - same thing
07:21 - BAM
07:25 - and you just copy-paste easy right okay
07:28 - yeah all right well there you go thank
07:31 - you
07:31 - yes it seems like you just copied and
07:37 - pasted you think that looks pretty good
07:42 - we're never gonna win like that it's
07:45 - gotta be like this it's much better okay
07:52 - and then that's it cool yeah cool we're
07:55 - done
07:58 - hey team saw two laptops up doing a
08:01 - little a little bit of email here yeah
08:03 - yeah all done yeah we're done okay I'm
08:06 - gonna say you all if you need to do
08:07 - email for a minute just do that I need
08:09 - Learner hats on maybe in like two
08:10 - minutes okay but if you got an email or
08:12 - something just take care of it okay
08:18 - all righty everybody we're almost out of
08:21 - time so let's bring it back together
08:23 - eyes on me it's about all the time we
08:26 - have today for this I wanted to quickly
08:28 - see what compression ratio everyone got
08:30 - so here's what we're gonna do I want
08:32 - hands up if you have a 25% hands all the
08:36 - way up nice all right 30 32 he's 34 36
08:44 - okay 38 all right how what do we do over
08:50 - here Wow let's give a big round of
08:54 - applause to the winners of the day y'all
08:57 - could learn a thing or two it sounds
08:58 - like great let's have a quick a quick
09:01 - wrap-up reflection here I want you to
09:03 - think to yourself what makes compression
09:06 - hard you can think about that silently
09:09 - to yourself and we're gonna share out
09:13 - already let's just let's just share that
09:16 - out who wants to share out something
09:17 - they thought about if we put yeah words
09:21 - that are too big in the dictionary it
09:23 - brings down the ratio okay so there's
09:25 - this balance it sounds like that you
09:27 - need nice anyone else
09:32 - yeah there's just a lot of different
09:34 - combinations to try it takes a while
09:36 - yeah absolutely all right well that's
09:41 - all the time we have today tomorrow
09:42 - we're going to be practicing how to get
09:44 - even better compression ratios so class
09:48 - dismissed
09:49 - thank you all very much all right so now
09:53 - that GTS finished his lessons let's go
09:55 - over our notes and see if we can
09:56 - identify some themes and maybe some
09:58 - questions that'll drive the debrief

some nods so I'm gonna have you just shout them out I mean what do you got what are your words our ETF lol alright I'm gonna skip that one tomorrow okay great just a long one that's all what do you got over here Thanks thx okay all right you know you know I've definitely done that myself because nice nice Wow very short very very short great these are all good examples what I want to know though is why why do you why use these shorter versions of words save time it's easier okay totally just one hand all right I like that anyone else doesn't take up as much space limited okay so maybe you
