00:33 - We had a programmer who
wrote down this program with arrows,
00:39 - and we have a robot who 
is reading the arrows
00:42 - trying to figure out what
they need to stack using the cups.
00:47 - So she'll translate the arrows
into specific movements
00:50 - to try and make one
of these stacks.

This is a fantastic lesson called my robotic friends. It's a lot of fun. We teach programming without using computers. So, we get groups together, where people program their robotic friends to stack cups in a certain configuration just by drawing arrows on paper. So right now, we are implementing the activity that they've been working on. We had a programmer who wrote down this program with arrows, and we have a robot who is reading the arrows trying to figure out what they need to stack using the cups. So she'll translate the arrows into specific movements to try and make one of these stacks.
