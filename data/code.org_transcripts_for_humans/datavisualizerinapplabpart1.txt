00:05 - hi everyone i'm going to show you how to
00:07 - use the data visualizer tool in app lab
00:10 - this tool will let you look at the data
00:12 - in the different data sets in a number
00:13 - of different ways i'll show you how to
00:15 - access it and how to use its features
00:17 - first you're going to want to go to the
00:18 - data tab over here
00:20 - the first thing you're going to want to
00:21 - do is import a data set so you can look
00:24 - through the categories of data sets here
00:31 - you can even preview what's in a data
00:33 - set by clicking on this preview button
00:34 - right here
00:37 - this will give you an example of the
00:38 - data that's contained in this data set
00:41 - this might give you an idea of whether
00:42 - you're interested in using this data or
00:44 - not
00:46 - you can also click on this more info
00:47 - button
00:48 - to see the metadata associated with that
00:51 - data set this will tell you about the
00:52 - source of the data any cleaning that
00:55 - might have been done to the data set and
00:56 - more details about the data that's
00:58 - contained in each of the columns
01:01 - once you've imported the data set it
01:03 - should show up over here on the right
01:05 - hand side
01:07 - let's take a look at this ap computer
01:09 - science test taker data set
01:11 - once you click on it you'll see all the
01:14 - data show up here with the columns
01:16 - across the top and the values going down
01:18 - the visualizer tool is up here where it
01:20 - says visualize data once you click on it
01:23 - you'll see this pop-up show up
01:25 - this is where you're going to do the
01:26 - work of actually creating your data
01:28 - visualizations
01:30 - across the top you'll see that there's a
01:31 - place to put a title in for your chart
01:34 - you can choose between
01:36 - what type of chart you want to make you
01:38 - can make a bar chart a histogram
01:40 - a scatter plot or a cross tab
01:44 - let's start by looking at a bar chart
01:49 - if we're going to make a bar chart we
01:50 - first need to decide which value it is
01:52 - that we want to graph
01:54 - now we can look at these values in this
01:56 - drop-down and choose that way
01:58 - or we can go back to the metadata tab
02:01 - over here and read a little bit more
02:03 - about what each column contains
02:06 - let's say we're interested in this
02:08 - column right here total percent female
02:11 - what percentage
02:12 - of students who took an apcs test in
02:15 - that state were female
02:20 - go back over here to the visualizer tab
02:23 - and select that variable from this
02:25 - drop-down
02:27 - now this bar chart shows across the
02:29 - x-axis the percentages so the total
02:32 - percentage of test takers in an estate
02:34 - that identified as female the height of
02:36 - each bar
02:38 - shows the number of states that shared
02:39 - that percentage so for example
02:42 - six different states had 30 percent of
02:45 - their cs test takers identify as female
02:48 - and now this bar chart is helpful for
02:51 - answering certain types of questions
02:53 - it's helpful for learning some
02:54 - information
02:55 - but there are other ways that we can
02:56 - visualize this data as well
02:59 - for example we can make a histogram
03:03 - and let's look at the same value as
03:05 - before total percent female
03:08 - when we make a histogram the first thing
03:10 - we need to decide is the bucket size or
03:13 - the range that each categories are going
03:15 - to represent in this case percent so we
03:18 - could have each category be
03:20 - two percent and this is what the chart
03:22 - would look like
03:24 - we can have it be ten percent
03:26 - and this is what the chart would like
03:28 - again this is the same data just being
03:31 - visualized in different ways
03:33 - let's go with five percent buckets
03:37 - now this is the same data we looked at
03:39 - in the bar chart but we can see
03:41 - different things here
03:43 - so instead of unique percentages we can
03:46 - see a range of percentages so we can see
03:48 - that 22 states
03:50 - had between 25 and 30
03:53 - of their cs test takers identify as
03:55 - female
03:56 - and this type of visualization can be
03:58 - helpful for answering different types of
04:00 - questions and learning different type of
04:02 - information
04:03 - later we'll learn more about the other
04:05 - types of visualizations you can make
04:07 - with this visualizer tool
04:10 - [Music]
04:18 - you

hi everyone i'm going to show you how to use the data visualizer tool in app lab this tool will let you look at the data in the different data sets in a number of different ways i'll show you how to access it and how to use its features first you're going to want to go to the data tab over here the first thing you're going to want to do is import a data set so you can look through the categories of data sets here you can even preview what's in a data set by clicking on this preview button right here this will give you an example of the data that's contained in this data set this might give you an idea of whether you're interested in using this data or not you can also click on this more info button to see the metadata associated with that data set this will tell you about the source of the data any cleaning that might have been done to the data set and more details about the data that's contained in each of the columns once you've imported the data set it should show up over here on the right hand side let's take a look at this ap computer science test taker data set once you click on it you'll see all the data show up here with the columns across the top and the values going down the visualizer tool is up here where it says visualize data once you click on it you'll see this popup show up this is where you're going to do the work of actually creating your data visualizations across the top you'll see that there's a place to put a title in for your chart you can choose between what type of chart you want to make you can make a bar chart a histogram a scatter plot or a cross tab let's start by looking at a bar chart if we're going to make a bar chart we first need to decide which value it is that we want to graph now we can look at these values in this dropdown and choose that way or we can go back to the metadata tab over here and read a little bit more about what each column contains let's say we're interested in this column right here total percent female what percentage of students who took an apcs test in that state were female go back over here to the visualizer tab and select that variable from this dropdown now this bar chart shows across the xaxis the percentages so the total percentage of test takers in an estate that identified as female the height of each bar shows the number of states that shared that percentage so for example six different states had 30 percent of their cs test takers identify as female and now this bar chart is helpful for answering certain types of questions it's helpful for learning some information but there are other ways that we can visualize this data as well for example we can make a histogram and let's look at the same value as before total percent female when we make a histogram the first thing we need to decide is the bucket size or the range that each categories are going to represent in this case percent so we could have each category be two percent and this is what the chart would look like we can have it be ten percent and this is what the chart would like again this is the same data just being visualized in different ways let's go with five percent buckets now this is the same data we looked at in the bar chart but we can see different things here so instead of unique percentages we can see a range of percentages so we can see that 22 states had between 25 and 30 of their cs test takers identify as female and this type of visualization can be helpful for answering different types of questions and learning different type of information later we'll learn more about the other types of visualizations you can make with this visualizer tool you
