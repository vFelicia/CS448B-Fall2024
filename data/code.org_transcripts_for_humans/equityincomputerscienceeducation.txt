00:00 - computer science is changing the world
00:03 - and we need everybody at the table with
00:05 - their perspectives helping to make those
00:07 - changes students should be introduced to
00:09 - computer science the moment that they
00:12 - get into schools it's just one of those
00:13 - skills that it has to be tapped into
00:15 - early and has to bring out the joy in
00:18 - their involvement in it as it is right
00:20 - now there's very few groups of people in
00:23 - computer science and it's not
00:24 - representative if we don't have equity
00:26 - and inclusion in our classrooms then
00:28 - we're not going to have a diverse set of
00:31 - people who are building these systems
00:34 - that are impacting everybody in order to
00:36 - have representation and diversity in
00:38 - computer science we need to focus on
00:41 - equity and computer science education
00:43 - equity is when people get what they need
00:47 - to succeed there are three major themes
00:49 - in equity work
00:51 - access inclusion and diversity first
00:54 - they need access they need the spaces to
00:56 - be able to learn computer science access
00:58 - is huge every single student that comes
01:02 - through our door has the opportunity to
01:05 - take computer science in order for you
01:07 - to learn about computer science or
01:09 - coding you have to have that access to
01:12 - someone not just like the materials
01:14 - itself but someone to like help you
01:16 - learn about what's going on i had a
01:19 - computer i had internet and i couldn't
01:21 - learn it by myself access has to happen
01:24 - really young so that students can feel
01:27 - like they can take these courses and be
01:29 - a part of it they're not shying away
01:31 - because they don't think it's for them
01:39 - the classes in computer science should
01:41 - look just like the school does we need
01:43 - diversity in all of our computer science
01:46 - diversity if everybody from different
01:47 - backgrounds comes to take it'll make it
01:48 - more open it'll really inspire other
01:50 - people to come take it and there may be
01:52 - a wide range of diversity in your
01:54 - classroom that you don't even know about
01:56 - we have to look at diversity of thought
01:58 - a diversity of abilities my perspective
02:00 - and your perspective it's going to be
02:02 - different and that's awesome because if
02:04 - we all think alike i think a lot of
02:05 - things will not be invented the more
02:07 - ideas and people we can get involved in
02:09 - computer science i think the better it
02:11 - will be getting diversity in the
02:13 - classroom is not easy we have an uphill
02:15 - battle
02:16 - but it is not an insurmountable battle
02:18 - no one wants to take a class where it
02:20 - looks like you're just staring at a
02:21 - computer screen for hours computer
02:23 - science isn't just coding it is
02:25 - collaborative it is out in the world it
02:28 - is in nature you don't have to be in an
02:31 - office to be a computer scientist
02:33 - proving that to kids has been the
02:35 - greatest success for me in creating a
02:37 - more diverse computer science classroom
02:40 - so inclusion when it comes to computer
02:42 - science means that every student's voice
02:45 - is heard they have a hands-on experience
02:48 - where they feel like they are a part of
02:49 - the class they feel safe they feel
02:52 - supported and that they feel like they
02:54 - can succeed once the teacher connects
02:56 - with you that's when all the students
02:59 - will be able to connect and like they'll
03:00 - feel more comfortable it is really
03:02 - important to build an inclusive
03:04 - classroom and there's a number of
03:06 - techniques one is through pair
03:08 - programming and switching the pairs and
03:10 - having that be very structured another
03:12 - is allowing students to create projects
03:14 - that are meaningful to themselves you
03:17 - can ask each one individually what they
03:19 - want or like what they're interested in
03:20 - create a mix of everything so that
03:22 - student feels like their voice is being
03:24 - heard in the classroom if you're a
03:26 - computer science teacher i want to tell
03:27 - you that you can make so much difference
03:30 - and impact on your students we have had
03:32 - a lot of students that have chose
03:35 - computer science because of you computer
03:37 - science teachers we provide students
03:39 - with the opportunity to find success and
03:42 - build up their own confidence in areas
03:44 - that historically they may not have
03:46 - found success or found a passion having
03:49 - a welcoming and supporting teacher has
03:52 - really positively impacted my experience
03:55 - in the computer science field i've
03:57 - definitely grown since i took computer
04:00 - science in sixth grade and i'm thinking
04:03 - of doing it potentially as an ap class
04:05 - in high school probably go to college
04:08 - for
04:09 - the youth of today are just incredibly
04:12 - resilient and if we can get those kids
04:14 - into computer science they're going to
04:16 - change the world
