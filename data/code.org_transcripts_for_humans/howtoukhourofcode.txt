00:03 - the hour of code is an hourlong
00:05 - introduction to computer science for all
00:07 - students no previous experience is
00:09 - required and the activities are designed
00:10 - to be self-guided empowering students to
00:13 - learn at their own pace this matters
00:15 - because the number of computing jobs in
00:17 - this country is rising three times
00:19 - faster than the number of computer
00:20 - science graduates we expect to have more
00:22 - than a dozen different 1our tutorials to
00:24 - choose from each introducing computer
00:27 - science in its own way for all students
00:29 - from K through 12
00:30 - for example we are expecting one
00:32 - tutorial to teach how to create an
00:34 - interactive card using the programming
00:35 - environment scratch our own tutorial
00:38 - will introduce some computer science
00:39 - principles through a series of puzzles
00:41 - that are fun to
00:43 - solve you can offer the hour of code on
00:45 - a range of devices including tablets PCS
00:48 - Macs and smartphones there will even be
00:51 - unplugged tutorials that can be
00:53 - completed without any computers at all
00:55 - the first thing you will need to figure
00:56 - out is where you will do your hour of
00:58 - code one option is to use a computer lab
01:01 - with internet connected PCS or Macs
01:03 - another option is to do the hour of code
01:05 - in your classroom using tablets or
01:06 - smartphones as long as they can access
01:08 - the internet students can also take
01:11 - turns doing the hour of code in your
01:12 - classroom using a shared Internet
01:14 - connected computer in fact we encourage
01:17 - students to do the hour of code together
01:18 - in pairs or small groups research shows
01:21 - that students retain more when they're
01:22 - programmed together the unplugged
01:25 - options can be done anywhere even
01:26 - Outdoors these activities are especially
01:29 - fun for group and really illustrate the
01:31 - point computational thinking does not
01:33 - require a computer we encourage you to
01:35 - try doing the selected tutorial yourself
01:37 - before your class does it so you can
01:39 - answer any questions that might come up
01:41 - finally it will be time for your
01:43 - students to do the hour of code
01:44 - themselves have them visit our website
01:46 - and choose the tutorial that you
01:48 - selected if you're doing an unplugged
01:50 - tutorial pass out the materials and
01:52 - explain the rules your students will
01:54 - enjoy doing the hour of code the
01:56 - tutorials are designed to be fun
01:58 - students who finish early can try a
02:00 - different perhaps more advanced tutorial
02:02 - or help other students and that's it as
02:05 - you've seen offering the hour of code to
02:06 - your students is easy it requires
02:08 - minimal prior preparation and no prior
02:11 - experience in just 1 hour you will have
02:13 - given your students an engaging and
02:15 - meaningful exposure to the world of
02:16 - computer science and help demystify what

the hour of code is an hourlong introduction to computer science for all students no previous experience is required and the activities are designed to be selfguided empowering students to learn at their own pace this matters because the number of computing jobs in this country is rising three times faster than the number of computer science graduates we expect to have more than a dozen different 1our tutorials to choose from each introducing computer science in its own way for all students from K through 12 for example we are expecting one tutorial to teach how to create an interactive card using the programming environment scratch our own tutorial will introduce some computer science principles through a series of puzzles that are fun to solve you can offer the hour of code on a range of devices including tablets PCS Macs and smartphones there will even be unplugged tutorials that can be completed without any computers at all the first thing you will need to figure out is where you will do your hour of code one option is to use a computer lab with internet connected PCS or Macs another option is to do the hour of code in your classroom using tablets or smartphones as long as they can access the internet students can also take turns doing the hour of code in your classroom using a shared Internet connected computer in fact we encourage students to do the hour of code together in pairs or small groups research shows that students retain more when they're programmed together the unplugged options can be done anywhere even Outdoors these activities are especially fun for group and really illustrate the point computational thinking does not require a computer we encourage you to try doing the selected tutorial yourself before your class does it so you can answer any questions that might come up finally it will be time for your students to do the hour of code themselves have them visit our website and choose the tutorial that you selected if you're doing an unplugged tutorial pass out the materials and explain the rules your students will enjoy doing the hour of code the tutorials are designed to be fun students who finish early can try a different perhaps more advanced tutorial or help other students and that's it as you've seen offering the hour of code to your students is easy it requires minimal prior preparation and no prior experience in just 1 hour you will have given your students an engaging and meaningful exposure to the world of computer science and help demystify what can be an intimidating subject to some
