00:09 - you'll be completing this online course
00:11 - on code studio which is code.org's
00:13 - online learning platform it's the same
00:16 - platform that you'll use with your
00:17 - students if you choose to deliver our
00:19 - curriculum
00:20 - at different points throughout the
00:22 - course you'll be asked to click over to
00:23 - other websites including our
00:25 - professional learning forum twitter and
00:27 - other resources that will help enrich
00:29 - your study
00:30 - additionally anytime you have a question
00:33 - or are feeling lost you can reach out to
00:35 - us for support by tweeting at us at
00:37 - teach code
00:38 - let's have a look
00:43 - you'll notice that this course is broken
00:44 - down into stages
00:46 - the first few stages in this course will
00:48 - provide you with a basic introduction to
00:50 - computer science and some key vocabulary
00:52 - that you need to know to be successful
00:54 - in the meat of the course the mastering
00:56 - the basics section you'll actually learn
00:58 - how to code in the same way that your
01:00 - students will by completing puzzles and
01:02 - viewing videos that explain the basic
01:04 - concepts
01:05 - you'll learn all about sequencing
01:07 - looping functions events and
01:09 - conditionals
01:11 - as you work your way through we'll be
01:12 - giving you some tips on how you might
01:14 - teach these concepts including links to
01:16 - lesson plans videos and instructional
01:18 - materials
01:19 - each of the stages in the course is
01:21 - further subdivided into levels
01:23 - as you work your way through each level
01:25 - you'll see a green check mark appears to
01:27 - indicate that you've completed the
01:28 - reading viewing or activity listed on
01:30 - that page
01:32 - this allows you to track your progress
01:33 - so you can pick up where you left off at
01:35 - any time
01:39 - with the code studio curriculum you'll
01:41 - notice that many of the levels are
01:42 - puzzles that are completed on the
01:44 - computer but there's also a number of
01:46 - what we call unplugged lessons
01:48 - these are more hands-on activities that
01:50 - give your class an understanding of how
01:52 - computer science principles can be seen
01:54 - in the real world
01:55 - the lesson plans for these activities
01:57 - include videos demonstrating how the
01:59 - lesson can be taught
02:01 - finally for the last few stages of the
02:02 - course you'll transition into thinking
02:04 - about how you might teach computer
02:06 - science
02:07 - based on what you know about coding from
02:08 - the previous stages you'll think about
02:10 - instructional design classroom
02:12 - management and how to bring these
02:13 - concepts to your students
02:15 - at the close of the course you'll find a
02:17 - list of resources and places you can go
02:19 - to continue your learning and find
02:20 - additional support
02:22 - and that's it when you finish the course
02:24 - you'll receive a digital certificate and
02:26 - you'll be ready to teach computer
02:27 - science fundamentals or any other cs
02:29 - curriculum that interests you
