00:08 - pair programming is the practice of
00:10 - matching up two programmers to work
00:11 - collaboratively on one device
00:14 - in the tech industry pair programming is
00:16 - used by many companies as a powerful way
00:18 - to support and develop coders while also
00:20 - ensuring that the code being developed
00:22 - is top notch
00:23 - in your classroom pair programming has
00:25 - the same benefits plus more
00:28 - working in pairs allows your students to
00:30 - teach each other and encourages them to
00:31 - practice teamwork and communication
00:34 - they get a hands-on learning experience
00:35 - while you get to take a more supporting
00:37 - role in the lesson
00:39 - pair programming also allows you to
00:40 - stretch your resources with students
00:42 - working together you only need half as
00:44 - many devices
00:45 - here's how it works
00:47 - step one create your pairs consider the
00:50 - best way to match up your students
00:52 - perhaps you could pair students who are
00:53 - struggling with students who are further
00:54 - ahead pair students with their friends
00:56 - or have them work with someone new you
00:58 - know your classroom best and what it
01:00 - will take for your students to be
01:01 - successful
01:02 - step two explain the details once
01:05 - students are divided up assign one
01:06 - student to be the navigator and one
01:08 - student to be the driver describe how
01:10 - only the driver should touch the device
01:12 - while the navigator thinks ahead make
01:14 - sure students understand that each role
01:15 - is important and encourage them to
01:17 - switch often
01:18 - if you want to drive home this idea
01:19 - further you can show them the code.org

01:24 - step three program
01:26 - have students work in their pairs on a
01:28 - code studio puzzle or other online
01:30 - activity if you have time debrief the
01:32 - experience how does pair programming add

pair programming is the practice of matching up two programmers to work collaboratively on one device in the tech industry pair programming is used by many companies as a powerful way to support and develop coders while also ensuring that the code being developed is top notch in your classroom pair programming has the same benefits plus more working in pairs allows your students to teach each other and encourages them to practice teamwork and communication they get a handson learning experience while you get to take a more supporting role in the lesson pair programming also allows you to stretch your resources with students working together you only need half as many devices here's how it works step one create your pairs consider the best way to match up your students perhaps you could pair students who are struggling with students who are further ahead pair students with their friends or have them work with someone new you know your classroom best and what it will take for your students to be successful step two explain the details once students are divided up assign one student to be the navigator and one student to be the driver describe how only the driver should touch the device while the navigator thinks ahead make sure students understand that each role is important and encourage them to switch often if you want to drive home this idea further you can show them the code.org video about pair programming in the link below step three program have students work in their pairs on a code studio puzzle or other online activity if you have time debrief the experience how does pair programming add value to your computer science learning it's as easy as that be sure to post repair programming tips and stories to twitter and tag at teach code
