00:12 - learning engineering manager at spotify
00:14 - i teach machines how to understand
00:16 - humans
00:17 - natural language processing is used in
00:19 - almost
00:20 - all
00:21 - corners of spotify there are two things
00:23 - natural language processing and natural
00:24 - language understanding both of them
00:26 - involve using computers that we teach
00:29 - algorithms to extract information from
00:32 - language or to produce language
00:35 - we can look at what billions of other
00:37 - people have called playlists and titled
00:39 - their favorite sets of songs then
00:42 - extract relationships between words
00:44 - automatically and learn that when you
00:47 - say this you're looking for these kinds
00:48 - of songs just by analyzing the language
00:51 - other people have used to describe them
00:53 - [Music]
00:54 - the famous spotify recommendation
00:55 - algorithm right that powers a lot of our
00:58 - personalization experience is applying
01:01 - natural language processing algorithms
01:03 - to just the sequence of songs in a
01:05 - playlist we treat songs and playlists
01:08 - like words and sentences and we learn
01:10 - the language of music and musical
01:12 - expression and then we speak that
01:14 - language back to you when we personalize
01:16 - your listening experience
01:18 - by understanding the contents of the
01:20 - podcast and then searching within them
01:23 - we can really enhance your experience so
01:25 - that we're getting you the niche content
01:26 - that's perfect for you in the moment
01:29 - it's used to both enable the core
01:31 - experience and enhance it by making it
01:33 - personalized and much more contextual
01:35 - for our users
01:37 - so the natural language processing
01:39 - systems we built today they have
01:41 - billions of parameters they're
01:42 - incredibly complex but then you just set
01:45 - them up
01:46 - you feed them the data
01:48 - they train for a few days and then
01:50 - they just work in five to ten years i
01:53 - think everyone working in the software
01:54 - engineering field will be touching
01:56 - natural language processing in some way
01:58 - shape or form this is becoming the main
02:00 - modality of interaction to software and
02:02 - computer systems right it's a uniquely
02:04 - human trait language and so whenever
02:06 - you're working with natural language
02:07 - processing you're doing something that
02:08 - really touches the most human thing
02:10 - there is it often feels like you're
02:12 - working with magic
02:14 - [Music]
02:23 - you

my name is jakov i'm a senior machine learning engineering manager at spotify i teach machines how to understand humans natural language processing is used in almost all corners of spotify there are two things natural language processing and natural language understanding both of them involve using computers that we teach algorithms to extract information from language or to produce language we can look at what billions of other people have called playlists and titled their favorite sets of songs then extract relationships between words automatically and learn that when you say this you're looking for these kinds of songs just by analyzing the language other people have used to describe them the famous spotify recommendation algorithm right that powers a lot of our personalization experience is applying natural language processing algorithms to just the sequence of songs in a playlist we treat songs and playlists like words and sentences and we learn the language of music and musical expression and then we speak that language back to you when we personalize your listening experience by understanding the contents of the podcast and then searching within them we can really enhance your experience so that we're getting you the niche content that's perfect for you in the moment it's used to both enable the core experience and enhance it by making it personalized and much more contextual for our users so the natural language processing systems we built today they have billions of parameters they're incredibly complex but then you just set them up you feed them the data they train for a few days and then they just work in five to ten years i think everyone working in the software engineering field will be touching natural language processing in some way shape or form this is becoming the main modality of interaction to software and computer systems right it's a uniquely human trait language and so whenever you're working with natural language processing you're doing something that really touches the most human thing there is it often feels like you're working with magic you
