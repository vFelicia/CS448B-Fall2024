00:00 - An if-else statement is a decision between
two things. For example, IF Scrat the squirrel
00:06 - finds the acorn, then he's happy. ELSE he's
sad, and keeps searching. Now let's see how
00:11 - we can use an if-else statement with our buddy
Scrat. This block looks the same as the "if"
00:17 - block, but there's an extra part on the bottom
that says "else". If I put a "move forward"
00:22 - block where it says "do" and a "turn left"
block where it says "else", that means Scrat
00:27 - the squirrel will move forward if there's
a path ahead. If there's not a path ahead,
00:31 - Scrat will turn left. It's making a decision
and doing one of the two actions based on
00:37 - that decision. And just like "if" blocks,
you can put "if-else" blocks inside "repeat"
00:42 - blocks. Now let's help Scrat the squirrel
get that acorn!
