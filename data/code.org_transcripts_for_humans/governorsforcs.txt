00:00 - Less than half of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science.
00:03 - But state by state that is changing.
00:06 - I'm of the generation they didn't teach coding
so these kids are teaching me.
00:11 - I'm here to show the governor how to code
and what I've learned through coding.
00:15 - I'm going to be coding with my governor today.
00:18 - Turn left again.
00:19 - Wow, where are you getting all--how do you
know all of this?
00:22 - You started this year?
00:23 - I started this 2 years ago.
00:25 - Now you need the destroy block.
00:28 - And shear the second sheep.
00:33 - All right!
00:34 - We did it, yeah?
00:35 - Mission accomplished!
00:37 - We just did it!
00:38 - You just did it?
00:39 - They taught it to me and it was very effective.
00:41 - It's my first ever line of code.
00:44 - I just taught Governor Hogan how to code in
Minecraft.
00:48 - I was probably the only candidate in America
that's ever used coding in a political ad.
00:54 - But I got elected on that, it was my signature
issue.
00:58 - I'm very proud in Virginia we just made it
a core requirement of elementary, middle,

01:05 - We can be in all parts of our country and
have the talent to develop the tech businesses
01:11 - that we need to drive our economy in the future.
01:14 - We're competitive like all the other states
and we're doing everything we can to really
01:17 - build out the Hour of Code and make sure we
bring down that 75% of schools that aren't
01:22 - offering [computer science].
01:23 - I think collectively of the states and the
governors we can help make that happen.
01:27 - If you are a parent out there, if you're an
educator, if you're a student, if you're an
01:31 - employer and you're not actively engaged in
how we can pour into the next generation in
01:37 - terms of computer science, coding, and technology--we're missing the boat.
01:41 - It's critical, if you're not paying attention
get on board.
01:43 - What is your state doing?
