00:03 - welcome to computer science connections
00:06 - coding book covers this module makes
00:08 - connections between Ela and computer
00:11 - science specifically it can introduce
00:14 - reinforce or extend any student learning
00:17 - related to reading novels if you're
00:19 - teaching about fiction non-fiction
00:21 - autobiographies or just want to get your
00:24 - students coding you come to the right
00:28 - place in this module students will learn
00:31 - the basics of sprite lab a block-based
00:33 - coding platform the main computer
00:36 - science Concepts in this module are
00:38 - Sprites and events a Sprite is something
00:41 - you interact with like a character or an
00:44 - object in a scene each Sprite can have
00:46 - different properties like its
00:48 - costume size and location in coding
00:53 - there are cause and effects
00:54 - relationships we trigger with events an
00:57 - event is an action that tells a specific
01:00 - code segment to run you can use events
01:03 - to make your Sprite speak move across
01:05 - the screen or change with a click of a
01:07 - button for example by assigning a spin
01:10 - right Behavior with a mouse click event
01:13 - we can command this hamburger to spin to
01:15 - the right when it's
01:21 - clicked there are four lessons in this
01:24 - module in lesson one students will learn
01:26 - to code a digital book cover students
01:29 - will learn to add in a title author and
01:32 - background then they will add in Sprites
01:35 - and make the scene
01:43 - interactive the second lesson is an
01:45 - unplug lesson where students will plan
01:47 - out their own book covers students will
01:49 - Begin by reflecting on the books they
01:51 - have read and selecting one to design a
01:53 - book cover for students should imagine
01:56 - they are recommending the book to
01:57 - someone else and peing their interest in
01:59 - read reading it by designing a new
02:01 - interactive
02:06 - cover in lesson three students use the
02:09 - skills they learned in the first lesson
02:11 - to code out the book cover design they
02:13 - brainstormed students will warm up with
02:15 - the Spiral Review of the coding blocks
02:17 - needed then they will be instructed to
02:20 - code their own Sprite lab project step
02:22 - by step to include the title author main
02:26 - characters setting and summary of the
02:29 - book they
02:34 - chose in the final unplug lesson
02:36 - students will share their book covers
02:38 - with one another in a gallery Walk
02:40 - activity students will explore and play
02:43 - test their classmates book cover
02:45 - projects leaving their thoughts and
02:46 - feedback on each other's work the class
02:49 - concludes with a discussion highlighting
02:51 - the role of book covers in conveying
02:53 - information and the uniqueness of
02:55 - individual
02:58 - designs
03:00 - often students try to snap a green event
03:03 - block under the when run block but this
03:06 - will not work the event block stands on
03:08 - its own and any code added to it will
03:11 - run when the event is triggered to test
03:14 - students will need to press run trigger
03:16 - the event they coded and make sure it's
03:18 - working
03:22 - correctly students will encounter bugs
03:24 - if their selections are inconsistent if
03:27 - they experience bugs have students
03:29 - double check that they've selected the
03:30 - correct options if there are
03:33 - inconsistencies in their selection the
03:35 - program will not run as expected in this
03:38 - example the coder wants Wilbur the pig
03:40 - to introduce himself however the coder
03:43 - mistakenly assigned the spider Sprite to
03:46 - say those words because there is no Pig
03:48 - Sprite in the event in the workspace the
03:51 - text will not appear when the pig Sprite
03:53 - is clicked to debug change the spider to
03:57 - the pig Sprite in the say block
03:59 - connected under the event
04:05 - Block in every lesson plan discussion
04:08 - questions are coupled with discussion
04:10 - goals check for understanding and
04:12 - promote student Reflection by
04:14 - incorporating these discussion questions
04:16 - into your
04:23 - teaching this module is aligned with
04:25 - common core Ela and the computer science
04:28 - Teachers Association standards in order
04:30 - to align to Concepts you already teach
04:33 - to help you think of ways to integrate
04:35 - ask yourself how might this module
04:37 - support the content I'm already teaching
04:39 - and should I use this module to
04:41 - introduce reinforce or extend student
04:45 - learning on this
04:49 - topic don't forget about the hide and
04:52 - show feature for each lesson it's best
04:54 - practice to only show the lesson
04:56 - students are currently working on if you
04:58 - do not hide the the following lessons
05:00 - students will be moved to the next
05:02 - lesson
05:06 - automatically before teaching the module
05:09 - complete each coding level on your own
05:11 - you can write your own code as an
05:13 - example for students make sure to review
05:15 - the lesson plans and additional
