00:04 - my name's jasmine i'm 26 years old and i
00:06 - currently work at zillow i'm a software
00:08 - development engineer i think what i
00:11 - really like about programming is that it
00:12 - helps me solve problems that i wouldn't
00:15 - be able to solve on my own especially as
00:17 - someone who's dyslexic i like the fact
00:19 - that programming allows me to repeat
00:20 - something over and over again and i
00:22 - don't have to like worry about
00:23 - misspelling stuff a lot so
00:27 - a programming language is a coding
00:29 - language that's used to dictate specific
00:31 - instructions to a computer
00:33 - just like there are thousands of human
00:35 - languages that are used to communicate
00:36 - amongst humans there are hundreds of
00:38 - different programming languages that
00:40 - have been created for humans to
00:41 - communicate with
00:42 - computers the language you use will
00:45 - often depend on what you're trying to do
00:47 - but nearly all programming languages are
00:49 - equivalent in terms of being able to
00:51 - express any algorithm
00:53 - a programming environment is a formal
00:55 - term for a tool which you use to write
00:57 - and run computer programs
01:00 - in this class you'll be learning the
01:02 - programming language javascript this
01:04 - language is widely used to make
01:06 - interactive websites and mobile apps the
01:09 - programming environment you'll be using
01:11 - is called app lab app lab was designed
01:14 - with new javascript programmers in mind
01:16 - although it was made for novices it has
01:18 - many powerful features
01:20 - which makes creating shareable mobile
01:23 - applications fast and easy we will start
01:26 - by learning to program using a virtual
01:28 - robot called the turtle
01:31 - in app lab the turtle looks like this
01:34 - now i know what you're thinking
01:36 - why are we learning to program with a
01:37 - turtle and why does it look nothing like
01:39 - an actual turtle
01:41 - historically the turtle has been one of
01:43 - the more popular ways to learn to
01:45 - program originally it was an actual
01:47 - robot students could program it to move
01:50 - and turn while the robot dragged a pen
01:52 - on the floor this would create simple
01:54 - drawings the original robot was actually
01:56 - domed in shape which made it kind of
01:58 - look like a turtle hence the name
02:00 - as graphics technology improved turtle
02:03 - programming migrated to the computer
02:05 - here the turtle was sometimes depicted
02:07 - as a little turtle but often just an
02:10 - arrow
02:11 - turtle programming is a powerful
02:13 - metaphor for programming in general
02:15 - starting with simple commands you can
02:17 - build up to some very sophisticated
02:19 - behavior
02:21 - the programming and problem solving
02:22 - techniques you'll learn using the turtle
02:25 - will apply every time you're trying to
02:27 - solve a problem of code this applies
02:29 - whether you're building game designing a
02:31 - mobile application or creating a
02:33 - simulation
02:34 - so let's get started
02:36 - initially you'll have to solve problems
02:38 - only with a very small set of commands
02:40 - in fact you'll have to do everything
02:43 - with only move forward turn left pen up
02:46 - and pin down
02:48 - in app lab here's how you add lines of
02:50 - code you can drag blocks from the
02:52 - toolbox and snap them together
02:54 - then click run to see your code in
02:56 - action or if you prefer
02:59 - you can type the commands in yourself
03:01 - either way you write code you can always
03:03 - flip between block mode and text mode in
03:06 - fact you can work in text mode and drag
03:08 - the blocks out to insert more text
03:11 - if you want to practice typing code
03:13 - that's awesome
03:15 - if you make an error you can use the
03:16 - blocks to check the correct way to enter
03:18 - code
03:19 - if you want to get rid of a line of code
03:21 - that's easy too just drag it off the
03:23 - screen or delete the line of text
03:26 - learning a programming language with the
03:28 - turtle is fun and can require a
03:30 - surprising amount of creativity even if
03:32 - you programmed in a similar way before
03:34 - you'll probably find this simple looking
03:36 - turtle can pose some fun and challenging
03:38 - puzzles as we develop our javascript
03:40 - programming skills we'll eventually
03:42 - leave the turtle behind
03:50 - you
