00:05 - that to make a cool color image you're
00:07 - going to need a lot of bits to do it and
00:10 - looking at a screen full of binary code
00:12 - is hard to keep track of this is an
00:14 - instance where looking at the binary and
00:16 - hexadecimal is quite useful let me set
00:19 - bits per pixel to 12 and then make a
00:21 - single red pixel with all four bits for
00:24 - red turned on 1 one one one and then
00:29 - zero for the green and the blue this is
00:32 - our old friend the red
00:34 - pixel you might remember that the
00:36 - heximal number system has 16 possible
00:39 - digits and that four bits has 16
00:42 - possible configurations so a single hex
00:45 - digit can be used to represent a 4 bit
00:48 - chunk rather than looking at the raw 12
00:50 - bits for each pixel we can switch into
00:53 - hex mode and we can see three hex digits
00:55 - that represent the exact same data much
00:58 - easier to look at
01:00 - notice that we now have three digits F 0
01:04 - 0 for the first pixel we know that f is
01:08 - the largest hex digit and represents
01:10 - four bits 1 1 1 1 so working in HEX
01:16 - we're still thinking about mixing red
01:18 - green and blue light but only have to
01:21 - set a single character for each so to
01:23 - turn down the red light I just pick a
01:25 - hex digit less than F let's say seven so
01:30 - 700 is a darker red if I flip the tool
01:34 - back to show binary I can see it's all
01:37 - still
01:39 - there professional Graphics typically
01:42 - use 24 bits per pixel this too is easy
01:46 - to view in HEX and is actually a very
01:48 - common representation you see in web
01:50 - design and in other tools with 24 bits
01:53 - per pixel it means eight bits for each
01:55 - of the red green and blue which means I
01:58 - can set each with two hex digits in this
02:01 - mode red would be FF
02:05 - 000000 and a teal color would be 0 a a a
02:10 - a of course with two hex digits there
02:13 - are 256 different settings for each of
02:16 - the red green and blue lights for a
02:18 - total of
02:20 - 16,777,216
02:23 - different colors so being able to view
02:26 - and manipulate binary code and heximal
02:28 - is a handy thing to do
02:30 - try it out for yourself and make your
02:32 - own
02:33 - colors
