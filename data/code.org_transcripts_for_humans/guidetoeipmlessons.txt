00:04 - many of code.org programming units are
00:06 - taught using four lesson types
00:09 - explore investigate practice and make
00:13 - we call this model
00:15 - e-i-p-m
00:17 - and right now we're going to take a look
00:19 - at each of these lesson types to give
00:21 - you a better understanding of what they
00:22 - look like individually and how they work
00:24 - together
00:29 - hey class today we are gonna be each
00:31 - explore lesson is teacher-led hands-on
00:34 - and has an activity that typically uses
00:36 - manipulatives to introduce students to a
00:39 - programming concept
00:46 - all right class today we are going to be
00:47 - doing three things we are going to be
00:49 - reading code in investigate lessons the
00:52 - teacher leads the class through a set of
00:53 - activities where students recode in a
00:56 - working app discuss the code with their
00:58 - classmates and make small modifications
01:00 - to existing code
01:08 - in practice lessons
01:10 - students work individually or in paris
01:12 - on a set of programming tasks that
01:15 - require them to write as well as debug
01:17 - code
01:22 - finally in make lessons students create
01:25 - an app for which they are given screen
01:27 - elements but little to no starter code
01:31 - a programming unit will have two or
01:33 - three of these eipm sequences
01:36 - one for each major concept
01:38 - at the end of the unit students complete
01:40 - a project that challenges them to
01:42 - independently and creatively apply what
01:44 - they've learned
01:46 - this video series is designed to help
01:48 - you understand each part of the eipm
01:50 - model in detail you'll learn how the
01:53 - role of the teacher shifts from one
01:54 - lesson to the next and you'll have an
01:56 - opportunity to see examples of what
01:58 - these different teaching strategies look
02:00 - like in practice
02:02 - we even have tips about how you can
02:04 - prepare before teaching this lesson
02:07 - there are two important things to
02:08 - remember first look for connections eipm
02:12 - lessons are designed to work together
02:14 - keep an eye out for how the different
02:15 - lessons build on one another
02:18 - second
02:19 - expect to practice this series gives you
02:22 - an introduction to eipm but you'll need
02:23 - to practice it in your own classroom as
02:26 - time goes on you'll grow more
02:27 - comfortable using it and be able to make
02:30 - modifications to meet your students
02:32 - needs
02:33 - now let's dig in and see what eipm is
02:36 - all about
