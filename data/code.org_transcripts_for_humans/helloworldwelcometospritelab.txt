00:08 - Hi, my name
00:09 - is Erin, and
I'm a software engineer here at Code.org.
00:13 - I'm so excited because I got to work
on the tutorial that you're about to do.
00:18 - We call it Hello World,
00:20 - Hello World is a famous phrase
in computer science,
00:24 - and displaying that phrase is a common
first step in learning computer science.
00:30 - Over the next hour,
you're going to get started
00:32 - with computer science
by programing in Sprite Lab.
00:36 - Sprite Lab is a tool you can use to build
00:39 - imaginative and fun projects.
00:42 - You'll see that your screen
00:44 - is split into three main parts.
00:47 - On the left is the play space.
00:50 - This is where your sprites will show up.
00:53 - Sprites are objects on the screen
that you can interact
00:56 - with, like a character
or item in a story or game.
01:00 - This middle area is the toolbox.
01:03 - New blocks of code
01:04 - will become available in this space
as you go through the lesson.
01:09 - The space on the right is the work space.
01:12 - You can drag blocks out of the tool box
and into the workspace
01:16 - to build your program.
01:20 - The instructions for each
01:21 - level will be up here
at the top of the screen.
01:24 - If you want a hint.
01:26 - Click on the light bulb.
01:29 - To start off, let's make a sprite.
01:32 - This block lets you give your Sprite
a costume and a location.
01:37 - Costume is the word
we use to describe a sprites
01:40 - appearance.
To change the sprite's location.
01:44 - You can click the pin
icon in the location block.
01:48 - And then click where you want it to go.
01:53 - Now, let's have the sprite introduce
itself. To make the sprite say something
01:58 - use this say block and
add it to your program.
02:03 - Make sure that the costume selected
02:05 - in your say block
matches the costume in your sprite.
02:09 - When you press run, the sprite will say
whatever text you tell it to.
02:16 - Now it's time to get started with
02:18 - Sprite Lab
and see where your imagination leads you.

Hi, my name is Erin, and I'm a software engineer here at Code.org. I'm so excited because I got to work on the tutorial that you're about to do. We call it Hello World, Hello World is a famous phrase in computer science, and displaying that phrase is a common first step in learning computer science. Over the next hour, you're going to get started with computer science by programing in Sprite Lab. Sprite Lab is a tool you can use to build imaginative and fun projects. You'll see that your screen is split into three main parts. On the left is the play space. This is where your sprites will show up. Sprites are objects on the screen that you can interact with, like a character or item in a story or game. This middle area is the toolbox. New blocks of code will become available in this space as you go through the lesson. The space on the right is the work space. You can drag blocks out of the tool box and into the workspace to build your program. The instructions for each level will be up here at the top of the screen. If you want a hint. Click on the light bulb. To start off, let's make a sprite. This block lets you give your Sprite a costume and a location. Costume is the word we use to describe a sprites appearance. To change the sprite's location. You can click the pin icon in the location block. And then click where you want it to go. Now, let's have the sprite introduce itself. To make the sprite say something use this say block and add it to your program. Make sure that the costume selected in your say block matches the costume in your sprite.
