00:12 - year million students across 170
00:16 - countries learned an hour of code during
00:19 - Computer Science Education week and that
00:22 - week more girls tried computer science
00:25 - science than in the last 70 years by
00:28 - 2020 there will be 1. 4 million jobs in
00:31 - technology in the US and currently only
00:34 - 18% of students in computer science are
00:36 - female I mean we're half the population
00:40 - so we should be a bigger part of our
00:42 - nation's future don't you think I'm so
00:45 - excited to know that I'm speaking to the
00:46 - next generation of kids that are going
00:48 - to change the world in 2012 when I had
00:51 - an idea to start a safe and healthy
00:54 - lifestyle company I knew the only way to
00:56 - do it was to utilize technology by
00:58 - launching honest
01:01 - you all live in a time where expressing
01:03 - yourself learning about different people
01:05 - making a business and a real difference
01:07 - in your communities is all totally
01:09 - possible with computers it's right at
01:12 - your
01:13 - fingertips I got mine always with me
01:16 - with an hour of code you were given the
01:19 - power to create a lifetime of change and
01:21 - a lot of success I'm honored to be part
01:23 - of the movement to make computer science
01:25 - and mainstain education across the
01:26 - country if we can reach a 100 million
01:29 - students by the end of the year Well at
01:31 - least 100,000 students by the end of the
01:34 - year the future will be a whole lot
01:36 - brighter for all of us so let's stay
01:38 - connected and start
01:42 - coding um now I get the pleasure of
01:45 - introducing someone that makes me really
01:47 - excited to talk about coding every day
01:50 - Stefan Hoffman is not only one of the
01:52 - best coders you'll ever meet um but also
01:55 - one of the coolest he played keyboard
01:58 - and a rock band that tour the country
01:59 - country and he was already a success
02:02 - with a view of his own startups all
02:05 - before he came to work with us um at The
02:08 - Honest Company Stefan is a guy who makes
02:11 - the dreams we have come true
02:15 - daily uh right there on our computer
02:17 - screen sometimes I think he's a magician
02:20 - but I know it's more than magic it's
02:22 - code it's code
02:24 - guys uh thank you Jess for the awesome
02:27 - intro uh I work alongside Jess every day
02:30 - to take her ideas and visions and make
02:32 - those come to life on the computer
02:33 - screen and actually just today we're
02:36 - looking at the honest.com site on a few
02:38 - new things that we're working on and uh
02:40 - there was this little modal window this
02:41 - popup window that really wasn't that
02:44 - great looking um so we thought we could
02:47 - do it a little bit better do something a
02:48 - little bit more on brand so since we're
02:51 - here if you want to jump into some code
02:53 - write a little JavaScript function and
02:55 - get that new modal working that would be
02:57 - fantastic now mind you guys guys I have
03:01 - never written code before I mean I watch
03:03 - him do it all day long and I'm more of
03:07 - the hey that should go over there and
03:09 - what if we try this and how about
03:11 - putting an image versus just some
03:13 - text um and so he knows my style so uh
03:18 - you know we have a shorthand but this is
03:20 - going to be officially my first time
03:22 - like writing actually writing code so
03:25 - the tables have turned yeah all right
03:28 - let's let's dive into it okay
03:30 - so right here is the page and question
03:32 - just a simple newsletter signup and when
03:35 - you click this button you get kind of
03:38 - this ugly popup that we're talking about
03:39 - it's it's really not on brand we want to
03:41 - do something a lot cooler yeah I mean it
03:43 - looks like it's just very standard yeah
03:45 - standard exactly so to make that happen
03:48 - we're gonna H hop over to our text
03:50 - editor right here and here's all the
03:53 - elements that make up this web page we
03:55 - have the all the HTML that has the page
03:58 - it's uh the has the sign up button
04:00 - itself and all the other stuff going on
04:02 - so here's the sign up button right down
04:03 - here we have the new modal window which
04:06 - is all ready to go I called it awesome
04:08 - modal right up here and then we have the
04:10 - Javascript file which is going to make
04:12 - all this stuff come to life and and
04:14 - animate that window on the page so if
04:17 - you want to take the Reigns and go ahead
04:19 - and get started sure I'll walk you
04:21 - through with your first function okay so
04:23 - right now that function is on line three
04:26 - and it says you've signed up and that's
04:28 - it and it's just typed out with that
04:31 - that default alert window that shows up
04:33 - so we're going to delete line three all
04:35 - right we're deleting that perect and
04:38 - we're going to call that new modal
04:39 - window so start off with Dollar Sign
04:41 - dollar sign parenthesis okay and then
04:46 - put double quotes inside the parenthesis
04:48 - okay and now we're going to call that
04:49 - modal element uh
04:52 - hashtag
04:54 - okay awesome Dash modal
04:58 - okay
05:01 - and now modal is just a name for Popup
05:04 - yeah modal is just another name it's
05:06 - kind of like cod speak for Popup window
05:08 - okay so whenever you see a popup window
05:10 - and you click you know on a website or
05:12 - on a video game or an app or anything
05:15 - that's called modal yeah they usually
05:17 - called a modal window okay they're used
05:19 - interchangeably though okay okay so at
05:22 - the end of this right after that last
05:24 - parenthesis do a
05:26 - DOT oh Sor on the outside that's okay
05:30 - okay and write modal
05:33 - again okay
05:37 - parenthesis okay double
05:40 - quotes um double quotes perfect and just
05:44 - write a show inside
05:45 - there all right awesome so the new
05:48 - function looks great I'm just going to
05:50 - save out the page really
05:52 - quick hop
05:54 - over to the web page give it a refresh
05:57 - and if you want to do the honors and hit
05:58 - the sign me up button all
06:01 - right awesome much much better looking a
06:04 - nice lifestyle image yeah bold letters
06:08 - good font and it looks like it's in line
06:11 - with Our Brands it wasn't too bad no no
06:12 - that was like weirdly easy one line so
06:17 - basically learning uh how to code is uh
06:20 - it's sort of like learning another
06:22 - language but it is English somewhat yeah
06:28 - every code's different they all have own
06:29 - different syntax but it's more about
06:31 - kind of math and it's a combination of
06:34 - things right yeah it gets tricky there's
06:36 - there's all kinds of math equations
06:38 - different kinds of functions different
06:39 - Frameworks to to help you do these kind
06:42 - of things have you always been
06:44 - interested in in computer science and
06:46 - coding and was it video games that got
06:49 - you interested in yeah I was I was a big
06:50 - gamer when I was younger but I kind of
06:53 - gave that up to focus more you know on
06:55 - on creating your own I'm actually more
06:57 - of a designer by by trade and uh I've
06:59 - just had to pick up coding um out of
07:01 - necessity to make things work to make my
07:03 - ideas you know come to life and explain
07:05 - them a little bit better right so like
07:06 - as a creative person you can express
07:09 - yourself through coding yeah and you can
07:11 - create your own path to whatever you
07:13 - want to make it's very much like having
07:14 - a canvas and you're the artists cool
07:18 - awesome well I learned something new
07:20 - today now it's time you learn a little
07:23 - more about each other does anyone have
07:25 - any
07:28 - questions George Washington uh Carver
07:31 - Middle School in Springfield Missouri hi
07:35 - is it cold in Missouri right now uh
07:38 - right now it actually is pretty cold it
07:40 - is it's kind of cold here in New York
07:42 - too it just started
07:45 - snowing okay well my my question is uh
07:50 - what was your first exposure to computer
07:52 - science and were you intimidated by
07:55 - it um no I wasn't intimidated by
07:59 - um I think my first real exposure my dad
08:02 - actually was in the military he was in
08:04 - the Air Force and he was in the
08:06 - Personnel depart department and believe
08:08 - it or not he was the IT guy um and back
08:12 - then uh computers were much more simple
08:15 - and I think I only really like played a
08:18 - very simple video game on a computer and
08:22 - it was like a ball that went back and
08:23 - forth and there was like a little line
08:25 - across and you just tried to make it not
08:27 - drop um I don't remember what the name
08:30 - of the game was but I used uh you know
08:34 - in uh as an actress when I was young um
08:38 - I was exposed to it because a lot of um
08:41 - visual
08:42 - effects um are done and utilizing
08:46 - technology and um in computer programs
08:49 - and all of that so that was kind of my
08:51 - first real big introduction to
08:54 - it um and at honest um my first first
08:59 - exposure to like building wireframes and
09:03 - a website and um you
09:07 - know what the customer sees versus the
09:10 - backend technology what you see as a
09:12 - company and data and analytics and all
09:15 - of those types of things in
09:17 - technology uh I was exposed to that for
09:20 - the first time just a couple of years
09:22 - ago um so that you know opened my mind
09:27 - to A Whole New World of possib abilities
09:29 - which is really
09:32 - cool all
09:33 - right uh Frank Conwell Middle School
09:37 - from New Jersey uh City will ask the
09:39 - next
09:41 - question how did you become interested
09:43 - in the technology field and how has
09:45 - impacted your
09:47 - career I became interested in it just as
09:50 - a consumer I mean uh the more advanced
09:55 - uh phones uh and computers got
09:59 - um you know just different devices that
10:03 - make my life easier you know um I if I
10:06 - need a great recipe if I want to read up
10:10 - on a product and I want to know how it
10:12 - works and the functionality of it um
10:17 - to you know really encyclopedia
10:20 - britanica used to be my only source of
10:22 - reference now I Google everything so it
10:25 - really was just purely as a as someone
10:28 - who uses it for day-to-day problem
10:31 - solving and then the more I realize the
10:35 - potential like any of you if you know
10:37 - how to code you can create an app you
10:40 - can create a Facebook you can create a
10:43 - Snapchat you can
10:45 - create uh uh uh um video
10:50 - games um what is my daughter interest in
10:53 - into uh what's that first person
10:57 - the oh where you create your own world
11:00 - my daughter's really into this
11:02 - game um ah it's really what what video
11:06 - games do you guys like before I used to
11:08 - W uh play like uh Nintendo which is
11:12 - Minecraft that's what it is my my even
11:15 - my six-year-old is like talking to me
11:17 - about Minecraft so um I don't know it's
11:20 - it's not intimidating as much as it just
11:23 - it just opens people's minds up and
11:25 - there's so much that is possible uh with
11:28 - techn techology and if especially if you
11:30 - can learn how to code um and create uh
11:35 - really you can create anything you want
11:36 - and you can reach everyone in the world
11:38 - which I think is really cool as well you
11:40 - don't have to be born in into a certain
11:43 - type of family or circumstance you don't
11:46 - have to come from a certain neighborhood
11:49 - you don't have to live in an urban or uh
11:52 - a different type of area uh you really
11:55 - can be anywhere in the world and
11:57 - everybody can have access to what you
11:59 - create and I think that's really
12:01 - cool all right our next question comes
12:03 - from uh Bristol Road Middle School in
12:06 - Ontario
12:08 - Canada oh I know Canada's cold I lived
12:11 - there for five years how are you guys
12:15 - [Music]
12:21 - doing we see many people in the end
12:24 - credits who have worked on a movie does
12:26 - anyone that works in the movie industry
12:28 - need to know
12:30 - code
12:31 - totally um animate an like basically any
12:35 - animated movie and any CGI and special
12:39 - effects um a a lot of movies I've done
12:43 - have you know people have had to to code
12:46 - in order to turn me into a superhero I
12:49 - mean I wouldn't have been able to do any
12:51 - of the stuff I did as s storm in the
12:54 - Fantastic Four movies um or even in Spy
12:57 - Kids um all that stuff uh with special
13:04 - effects and required
13:07 - coding thanks Jessica um our next
13:10 - question comes from Del delh housy
13:13 - Manitoba
13:16 - Canada another
13:18 - Canadian city hi
13:25 - guys
13:27 - hello
13:30 - oh are they coming
13:33 - in I think
13:39 - so what was your inspiration behind
13:41 - creating The Honest
13:43 - Company my
13:45 - inspiration gosh it really came from two
13:49 - things one is when I was little when I
13:53 - was your age I was really sick and I was
13:56 - in the hospital all the time I had
13:58 - really really bad asthma and allergies
14:02 - and all like almost everything I ate uh
14:06 - would give me these rashes and I would
14:07 - have to go to the hospital and my throat
14:09 - would close um whenever I got a cold it
14:13 - would turn into pneumonia and I had to
14:15 - be in the hospital and um when I had my
14:19 - baby uh six years ago she was born I
14:23 - wanted my baby to not be sick and I
14:26 - wanted to make sure that she didn't have
14:28 - to spend time in the hospital the way
14:30 - that I did when I was little and um when
14:32 - I did research and I found out that all
14:35 - of these things that are in my home from
14:38 - you know what I wash my dishes with to
14:41 - clothes to even shampoos toothpaste
14:44 - everything has these bad chemicals that
14:47 - could make my baby sick and make her
14:50 - have you know allergies and Asthma and
14:53 - things like that so I really created a
14:55 - company because I didn't want her to be
14:58 - sick and I didn't I didn't think any
14:59 - baby should have to be sick or person
15:02 - for that matter so that's why I have so
15:04 - many products um yeah we have diapers
15:07 - and wipes but we do everything from
15:09 - laundry detergent to multi-surface
15:11 - sprays to candles even um all using the
15:15 - highest quality ingredients but at an
15:17 - affordable price because a lot of times
15:20 - the healthier products are super
15:21 - expensive and most people can afford
15:24 - them so I wanted to make sure everybody
15:26 - could afford them and everyone can get
15:28 - them and that's why I wanted to create
15:30 - my company and put it online on
15:32 - honest.com
15:33 - because you know doesn't matter where
15:35 - you live whether you're in
15:37 - Canada whether you're in New York City
15:40 - whether uh you're uh really anywhere in
15:43 - the world uh hopefully you'll have
15:45 - access to honest.com right now it's just
15:48 - the United States and Canada but um you
15:50 - know my company's only two almost three
15:53 - years old but in about a year uh we plan
15:56 - on expanding uh overseas
16:00 - thanks Jessica um our next question
16:02 - comes from Bellevue East High School in
16:05 - Bellevue
16:06 - Nebraska hi
16:08 - Nebraska hello um we were wondering what
16:11 - kind of Technologies do you use on a
16:13 - daily
16:15 - basis oh Lord I use my phone on a daily
16:18 - basis it is my
16:20 - brain it's how I speak to my
16:23 - family uh it's how I find my you know
16:26 - restaurants that I want to eat at uh
16:29 - music it's it's um when I'm working out
16:33 - or driving um it's how I communicate on
16:37 - social
16:38 - media
16:40 - um you know I I use also like uh my iPad
16:45 - for recipes and things like that um my
16:49 - kids when we travel uh you know they
16:51 - watch movies on it they play educational
16:54 - games um and then my you know basically
16:58 - my off office I I like to say is is my
17:01 - laptop so I I use all three of my
17:03 - devices pretty heavily on a daily basis
17:07 - um the only problem is when you're in
17:09 - constant communication like that it's
17:12 - hard to shut off um and uh I think
17:15 - that's the only bad thing about
17:17 - technology is you just you're on all the
17:20 - time you're available all the time and
17:23 - uh you're always communicating and
17:26 - sometimes it's nice to rest a little bit
17:28 - um I guess that's what sleeping is for
17:31 - which I don't get a lot
17:33 - of thank you Jessica our next question
17:36 - comes from eer Hill Middle School in
17:39 - Park City
17:42 - Utah
17:43 - hi
17:47 - hi what do you think all students should
17:50 - be exposed to computer science why or
17:53 - why not
17:54 - absolutely um computer science is the
17:57 - future
17:59 - uh if you want to participate in the
18:01 - modern world and where everything is
18:04 - going you have to know uh how to use
18:08 - computers I mean from a
18:10 - presentation uh if you work at any
18:13 - company you need to be able to use your
18:16 - computers and uh and do things digitally
18:21 - um
18:22 - communicating on every level um you you
18:26 - have to have some computer science
18:28 - skills but certainly if you want to
18:30 - compete in a modern world and in the job
18:33 - market basically from today on you have
18:36 - to have computer science skills
18:41 - absolutely all right next question comes
18:44 - from Hobbs Middle School in Milton
18:56 - Florida go ahead do you think your
18:59 - daughters will learn to code and if so
19:01 - how old should they be when they start
19:04 - how old are you I'm 14 what's your name
19:08 - Ashley hi Ashley hello do you know how
19:12 - to code yet Ashley are you gonna
19:13 - learn possibly
19:19 - yes
19:21 - um uh yeah I think my kids should learn
19:25 - how to code absolutely why not I mean
19:27 - it's like why not learn how to do
19:30 - everything that you can
19:32 - um especially if you want
19:35 - to you know have all the opportunities
19:38 - you never know what you're going to want
19:39 - to do in your life when you're an adult
19:42 - when you're 10 you have ideas about it
19:44 - when you're 14 you have ideas about it
19:47 - when you're 20 you have ideas about it
19:49 - but unless you're armed with uh an
19:52 - education and you know uh how to do it
19:55 - it wouldn't it won't even be an option
19:57 - for you
19:58 - um if you want to be an entrepreneur you
20:00 - may when you're
20:01 - 25 or 30 my age when you're old like me
20:06 - you may decide that you want to create
20:08 - and start a company um and you could be
20:12 - inspired by whatever it is in your life
20:14 - and if you know how to code you have the
20:16 - power to do that no matter where you are
20:18 - in the world and that's really cool so I
20:21 - absolutely want my daughters to know uh
20:24 - how to code and and I think it's
20:25 - important for everybody to be armed with
20:27 - that that educ in that
20:30 - information all right the last questions
20:32 - coming from chastang middle school in
20:35 - MOA
20:36 - Alabama
20:54 - Alabama go ahead and ask your question
20:57 - yes learn more computer science what's
20:59 - something you would love to deal with
21:01 - your
21:03 - skills as I learn more what is something
21:06 - I would love to build with my
21:10 - skills
21:12 - um
21:16 - gosh I would love to make
21:20 - uh oh there's so many things right now
21:24 - I'm actually working on um a Beauty
21:26 - company and and uh and it would be cool
21:31 - if I didn't have to inundate poor Stefan
21:33 - with so much work and if I could you
21:37 - know do something uh on my own that
21:41 - would be awesome certainly um making the
21:44 - website you know uh work faster you know
21:48 - how annoying it is when you get that
21:49 - Spinning Wheel while the computer's
21:53 - thinking um you know with code you could
21:56 - actually uh eliminate at that thinking
21:59 - time and you can make things go
22:01 - faster um so that would be something
22:04 - especially with a a company like mine an
22:06 - e-commerce platform um that's what it's
22:09 - called when you sell things on the
22:11 - internet online and your company is
22:14 - online it's called e-commerce um it
22:17 - would be cool if we could make it just
22:19 - really fast so people didn't have to
22:21 - wait for that Spinning
22:23 - Wheel um because that's the bane of my
22:25 - existence right
22:26 - now what would you make if you could do
22:31 - anything with computer science would you
22:33 - make like a cool video game or would you
22:35 - do like a cool app or
22:38 - something cool app what would your app
22:45 - do

22:54 - awesome um another thing that would be
22:56 - cool is if if if there was an app to
22:59 - tell you how healthy you were like if
23:02 - there was like an app where you could
23:03 - just like put in your information
23:05 - something quick and then it could just
23:08 - say oh you need to you know drink a
23:11 - little bit more water and take like five
23:14 - more walks a day or something and then
23:16 - you'd be healthier I don't know

Cleaned transcript:

year million students across 170 countries learned an hour of code during Computer Science Education week and that week more girls tried computer science science than in the last 70 years by 2020 there will be 1. 4 million jobs in technology in the US and currently only 18% of students in computer science are female I mean we're half the population so we should be a bigger part of our nation's future don't you think I'm so excited to know that I'm speaking to the next generation of kids that are going to change the world in 2012 when I had an idea to start a safe and healthy lifestyle company I knew the only way to do it was to utilize technology by launching honest you all live in a time where expressing yourself learning about different people making a business and a real difference in your communities is all totally possible with computers it's right at your fingertips I got mine always with me with an hour of code you were given the power to create a lifetime of change and a lot of success I'm honored to be part of the movement to make computer science and mainstain education across the country if we can reach a 100 million students by the end of the year Well at least 100,000 students by the end of the year the future will be a whole lot brighter for all of us so let's stay connected and start coding um now I get the pleasure of introducing someone that makes me really excited to talk about coding every day Stefan Hoffman is not only one of the best coders you'll ever meet um but also one of the coolest he played keyboard and a rock band that tour the country country and he was already a success with a view of his own startups all before he came to work with us um at The Honest Company Stefan is a guy who makes the dreams we have come true daily uh right there on our computer screen sometimes I think he's a magician but I know it's more than magic it's code it's code guys uh thank you Jess for the awesome intro uh I work alongside Jess every day to take her ideas and visions and make those come to life on the computer screen and actually just today we're looking at the honest.com site on a few new things that we're working on and uh there was this little modal window this popup window that really wasn't that great looking um so we thought we could do it a little bit better do something a little bit more on brand so since we're here if you want to jump into some code write a little JavaScript function and get that new modal working that would be fantastic now mind you guys guys I have never written code before I mean I watch him do it all day long and I'm more of the hey that should go over there and what if we try this and how about putting an image versus just some text um and so he knows my style so uh you know we have a shorthand but this is going to be officially my first time like writing actually writing code so the tables have turned yeah all right let's let's dive into it okay so right here is the page and question just a simple newsletter signup and when you click this button you get kind of this ugly popup that we're talking about it's it's really not on brand we want to do something a lot cooler yeah I mean it looks like it's just very standard yeah standard exactly so to make that happen we're gonna H hop over to our text editor right here and here's all the elements that make up this web page we have the all the HTML that has the page it's uh the has the sign up button itself and all the other stuff going on so here's the sign up button right down here we have the new modal window which is all ready to go I called it awesome modal right up here and then we have the Javascript file which is going to make all this stuff come to life and and animate that window on the page so if you want to take the Reigns and go ahead and get started sure I'll walk you through with your first function okay so right now that function is on line three and it says you've signed up and that's it and it's just typed out with that that default alert window that shows up so we're going to delete line three all right we're deleting that perect and we're going to call that new modal window so start off with Dollar Sign dollar sign parenthesis okay and then put double quotes inside the parenthesis okay and now we're going to call that modal element uh hashtag okay awesome Dash modal okay and now modal is just a name for Popup yeah modal is just another name it's kind of like cod speak for Popup window okay so whenever you see a popup window and you click you know on a website or on a video game or an app or anything that's called modal yeah they usually called a modal window okay they're used interchangeably though okay okay so at the end of this right after that last parenthesis do a DOT oh Sor on the outside that's okay okay and write modal again okay parenthesis okay double quotes um double quotes perfect and just write a show inside there all right awesome so the new function looks great I'm just going to save out the page really quick hop over to the web page give it a refresh and if you want to do the honors and hit the sign me up button all right awesome much much better looking a nice lifestyle image yeah bold letters good font and it looks like it's in line with Our Brands it wasn't too bad no no that was like weirdly easy one line so basically learning uh how to code is uh it's sort of like learning another language but it is English somewhat yeah every code's different they all have own different syntax but it's more about kind of math and it's a combination of things right yeah it gets tricky there's there's all kinds of math equations different kinds of functions different Frameworks to to help you do these kind of things have you always been interested in in computer science and coding and was it video games that got you interested in yeah I was I was a big gamer when I was younger but I kind of gave that up to focus more you know on on creating your own I'm actually more of a designer by by trade and uh I've just had to pick up coding um out of necessity to make things work to make my ideas you know come to life and explain them a little bit better right so like as a creative person you can express yourself through coding yeah and you can create your own path to whatever you want to make it's very much like having a canvas and you're the artists cool awesome well I learned something new today now it's time you learn a little more about each other does anyone have any questions George Washington uh Carver Middle School in Springfield Missouri hi is it cold in Missouri right now uh right now it actually is pretty cold it is it's kind of cold here in New York too it just started snowing okay well my my question is uh what was your first exposure to computer science and were you intimidated by it um no I wasn't intimidated by um I think my first real exposure my dad actually was in the military he was in the Air Force and he was in the Personnel depart department and believe it or not he was the IT guy um and back then uh computers were much more simple and I think I only really like played a very simple video game on a computer and it was like a ball that went back and forth and there was like a little line across and you just tried to make it not drop um I don't remember what the name of the game was but I used uh you know in uh as an actress when I was young um I was exposed to it because a lot of um visual effects um are done and utilizing technology and um in computer programs and all of that so that was kind of my first real big introduction to it um and at honest um my first first exposure to like building wireframes and a website and um you know what the customer sees versus the backend technology what you see as a company and data and analytics and all of those types of things in technology uh I was exposed to that for the first time just a couple of years ago um so that you know opened my mind to A Whole New World of possib abilities which is really cool all right uh Frank Conwell Middle School from New Jersey uh City will ask the next question how did you become interested in the technology field and how has impacted your career I became interested in it just as a consumer I mean uh the more advanced uh phones uh and computers got um you know just different devices that make my life easier you know um I if I need a great recipe if I want to read up on a product and I want to know how it works and the functionality of it um to you know really encyclopedia britanica used to be my only source of reference now I Google everything so it really was just purely as a as someone who uses it for daytoday problem solving and then the more I realize the potential like any of you if you know how to code you can create an app you can create a Facebook you can create a Snapchat you can create uh uh uh um video games um what is my daughter interest in into uh what's that first person the oh where you create your own world my daughter's really into this game um ah it's really what what video games do you guys like before I used to W uh play like uh Nintendo which is Minecraft that's what it is my my even my sixyearold is like talking to me about Minecraft so um I don't know it's it's not intimidating as much as it just it just opens people's minds up and there's so much that is possible uh with techn techology and if especially if you can learn how to code um and create uh really you can create anything you want and you can reach everyone in the world which I think is really cool as well you don't have to be born in into a certain type of family or circumstance you don't have to come from a certain neighborhood you don't have to live in an urban or uh a different type of area uh you really can be anywhere in the world and everybody can have access to what you create and I think that's really cool all right our next question comes from uh Bristol Road Middle School in Ontario Canada oh I know Canada's cold I lived there for five years how are you guys doing we see many people in the end credits who have worked on a movie does anyone that works in the movie industry need to know code totally um animate an like basically any animated movie and any CGI and special effects um a a lot of movies I've done have you know people have had to to code in order to turn me into a superhero I mean I wouldn't have been able to do any of the stuff I did as s storm in the Fantastic Four movies um or even in Spy Kids um all that stuff uh with special effects and required coding thanks Jessica um our next question comes from Del delh housy Manitoba Canada another Canadian city hi guys hello oh are they coming in I think so what was your inspiration behind creating The Honest Company my inspiration gosh it really came from two things one is when I was little when I was your age I was really sick and I was in the hospital all the time I had really really bad asthma and allergies and all like almost everything I ate uh would give me these rashes and I would have to go to the hospital and my throat would close um whenever I got a cold it would turn into pneumonia and I had to be in the hospital and um when I had my baby uh six years ago she was born I wanted my baby to not be sick and I wanted to make sure that she didn't have to spend time in the hospital the way that I did when I was little and um when I did research and I found out that all of these things that are in my home from you know what I wash my dishes with to clothes to even shampoos toothpaste everything has these bad chemicals that could make my baby sick and make her have you know allergies and Asthma and things like that so I really created a company because I didn't want her to be sick and I didn't I didn't think any baby should have to be sick or person for that matter so that's why I have so many products um yeah we have diapers and wipes but we do everything from laundry detergent to multisurface sprays to candles even um all using the highest quality ingredients but at an affordable price because a lot of times the healthier products are super expensive and most people can afford them so I wanted to make sure everybody could afford them and everyone can get them and that's why I wanted to create my company and put it online on honest.com because you know doesn't matter where you live whether you're in Canada whether you're in New York City whether uh you're uh really anywhere in the world uh hopefully you'll have access to honest.com right now it's just the United States and Canada but um you know my company's only two almost three years old but in about a year uh we plan on expanding uh overseas thanks Jessica um our next question comes from Bellevue East High School in Bellevue Nebraska hi Nebraska hello um we were wondering what kind of Technologies do you use on a daily basis oh Lord I use my phone on a daily basis it is my brain it's how I speak to my family uh it's how I find my you know restaurants that I want to eat at uh music it's it's um when I'm working out or driving um it's how I communicate on social media um you know I I use also like uh my iPad for recipes and things like that um my kids when we travel uh you know they watch movies on it they play educational games um and then my you know basically my off office I I like to say is is my laptop so I I use all three of my devices pretty heavily on a daily basis um the only problem is when you're in constant communication like that it's hard to shut off um and uh I think that's the only bad thing about technology is you just you're on all the time you're available all the time and uh you're always communicating and sometimes it's nice to rest a little bit um I guess that's what sleeping is for which I don't get a lot of thank you Jessica our next question comes from eer Hill Middle School in Park City Utah hi hi what do you think all students should be exposed to computer science why or why not absolutely um computer science is the future uh if you want to participate in the modern world and where everything is going you have to know uh how to use computers I mean from a presentation uh if you work at any company you need to be able to use your computers and uh and do things digitally um communicating on every level um you you have to have some computer science skills but certainly if you want to compete in a modern world and in the job market basically from today on you have to have computer science skills absolutely all right next question comes from Hobbs Middle School in Milton Florida go ahead do you think your daughters will learn to code and if so how old should they be when they start how old are you I'm 14 what's your name Ashley hi Ashley hello do you know how to code yet Ashley are you gonna learn possibly yes um uh yeah I think my kids should learn how to code absolutely why not I mean it's like why not learn how to do everything that you can um especially if you want to you know have all the opportunities you never know what you're going to want to do in your life when you're an adult when you're 10 you have ideas about it when you're 14 you have ideas about it when you're 20 you have ideas about it but unless you're armed with uh an education and you know uh how to do it it wouldn't it won't even be an option for you um if you want to be an entrepreneur you may when you're 25 or 30 my age when you're old like me you may decide that you want to create and start a company um and you could be inspired by whatever it is in your life and if you know how to code you have the power to do that no matter where you are in the world and that's really cool so I absolutely want my daughters to know uh how to code and and I think it's important for everybody to be armed with that that educ in that information all right the last questions coming from chastang middle school in MOA Alabama Alabama go ahead and ask your question yes learn more computer science what's something you would love to deal with your skills as I learn more what is something I would love to build with my skills um gosh I would love to make uh oh there's so many things right now I'm actually working on um a Beauty company and and uh and it would be cool if I didn't have to inundate poor Stefan with so much work and if I could you know do something uh on my own that would be awesome certainly um making the website you know uh work faster you know how annoying it is when you get that Spinning Wheel while the computer's thinking um you know with code you could actually uh eliminate at that thinking time and you can make things go faster um so that would be something especially with a a company like mine an ecommerce platform um that's what it's called when you sell things on the internet online and your company is online it's called ecommerce um it would be cool if we could make it just really fast so people didn't have to wait for that Spinning Wheel um because that's the bane of my existence right now what would you make if you could do anything with computer science would you make like a cool video game or would you do like a cool app or something cool app what would your app do makeup what do you say make cool that would be awesome um another thing that would be cool is if if if there was an app to tell you how healthy you were like if there was like an app where you could just like put in your information something quick and then it could just say oh you need to you know drink a little bit more water and take like five more walks a day or something and then you'd be healthier I don't know something like that would be neat because I feel like everybody's always getting sick especially now in the winter all right thank you J questions any more questions all right um thank you Jessica for joining us today and answering the questions and sharing about yourself uh interested in technology can everybody give Jessica a warm well uh thank you awesome well if there's no more questions I want to thank you all for letting me spend time with you today and I hope you guys will continue to learn about computer science and coding and use these skills to make your imprint on the world and when you guys get a little bigger I would love to see you come and work at The Honest Company bye bye
