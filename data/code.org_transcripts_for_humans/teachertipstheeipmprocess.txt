00:09 - those are the lessons where my students
00:11 - have had the aha moments it lays the

00:18 - practice and the make lessons so the
00:21 - eipm sequence can be a little
00:22 - intimidating at first especially for a
00:25 - non-cs teacher and that the explore
00:28 - lesson really is teacher heavy you're
00:29 - providing manipulatives you're providing
00:31 - post-it notes and ziploc bags and
00:33 - sometimes that can be heavy in terms of
00:34 - preparation but that explore lesson is
00:37 - really important for you in terms of
00:39 - understanding the content and students
00:41 - to have at least that shared vocabulary
00:43 - when students are using their hands in
00:45 - an unplugged manner where they're not
00:48 - distracted by their phones or their
00:49 - laptops or their chromebooks or whatever
00:52 - and they're seeing things happen
00:55 - with their hands it makes a connection
00:58 - in their brain
00:59 - and then when they move on to the other
01:01 - aspects of the ipm
01:04 - it's not like we're learning something
01:05 - new they're like oh i've heard of the
01:07 - word traversal before or i've heard of
01:09 - the word list before
01:10 - so it eases them into the coding part
01:13 - because they already have an idea of
01:15 - what they're going to be coding
01:17 - they
01:18 - use those tools that they have been
01:20 - building in class
01:21 - that you help them
01:23 - discover rediscover they had it all the
01:26 - time
01:26 - but they rediscovered these skills they
01:28 - had and now they can build something new
01:31 - so when you get to the make lessons and
01:33 - your students get to the screen and they
01:36 - see that they have all the user
01:39 - interface items already there i tell my
01:41 - students think about structuring your
01:43 - app
01:44 - in sections you have your variables
01:46 - first then you're on events for your
01:49 - buttons where you want to click and your
01:51 - interactivity and then you have your
01:52 - functions after that and if you get to
01:55 - the point where you have looping in
01:57 - there also then you
01:59 - also structure that in there
02:09 - you
