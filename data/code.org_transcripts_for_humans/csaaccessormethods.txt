00:10 - hi i'm eddie i'm a software engineer and
00:13 - game designer at valve software
00:15 - engineering is a tool to make users
00:17 - feel or experience or just have an
00:20 - easier life in some way so for me the
00:22 - passion comes from
00:23 - the ability that i'm empowering people
00:27 - i'm shopping online for a shirt i want
00:29 - to know what color the shirt comes in so
00:31 - i click a button and it tells me the
00:33 - color of the shirt i'm able to get the
00:35 - color of the shirt because the website
00:36 - gave me the information when i clicked
00:38 - that button
00:39 - but how is the website able to give me
00:41 - that information
00:42 - in java we use an accessor method an
00:44 - accessor method is a method that gets a
00:46 - value stored in an instance variable
00:49 - an accessor method is public which means
00:51 - it can be called from outside the class
00:54 - an accessor method is written inside of
00:55 - a class so it can access the instance
00:57 - variables in the class
00:59 - the shirt class has an instance variable
01:01 - called color
01:03 - let's write an accessor method to get
01:05 - the value of color
01:07 - the method signature begins with the
01:09 - word public
01:11 - next we write the return type to tell
01:13 - java whether we want to get an int a
01:15 - double a string or something entirely
01:17 - different from the method
01:19 - in this case since color is a string we
01:21 - want the method to return a string
01:24 - finally we give a name for the method
01:27 - we typically name these methods get and
01:29 - then the name of the instance variable
01:30 - we are accessing
01:32 - in this case we have get color as the
01:34 - name of our accessor method inside the
01:36 - method body we use the keyword return
01:39 - followed by the instance variable
01:41 - here we are returning the information
01:42 - stored in the instance variable color
01:45 - now let's use the method
01:47 - first we create some shirt objects in a
01:50 - tester class
01:52 - let's name these objects my red shirt my
01:54 - blue shirt and my yellow shirt
01:57 - to get the color of each of our shirt
01:59 - objects we call their accessor methods
02:02 - my red shirt dot get color empty
02:04 - parentheses my blue shirt dot get color
02:07 - empty parentheses my yellow shirt dot
02:09 - get color empty parenthesis
02:12 - i can also call the accessor method to
02:14 - print the color of my red shirt
02:16 - my blue shirt and my yellow shirt
02:19 - when i run my code my output displays as
02:22 - this shirt is red
02:24 - this shirt is blue
02:25 - this shirt is yellow
02:27 - with our accessory methods we can get
02:28 - information about objects from other
02:30 - classes
