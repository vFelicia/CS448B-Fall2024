00:10 - sometimes we need to traverse a 2d array
00:12 - one column at a time instead of one row
00:15 - at a time
00:16 - hollow major order is traversing a 2d
00:18 - array by accessing each column from left
00:21 - to right
00:23 - here is our 2d array of students daily
00:25 - quiz scores
00:26 - each row represents an individual
00:28 - student each column represents the
00:30 - scores for that day
00:32 - as we access each column we can get the
00:34 - scores for each day of the week for all
00:37 - students
00:38 - this is traversing the 2d array in
00:40 - column major order
00:42 - to set up this kind of traversal in java
00:44 - we need to use two nested for loops the
00:47 - outer loop will traverse each column in
00:49 - the 2d array it starts at index 0 and
00:52 - repeats for the number of columns in the
00:54 - row
00:55 - the number of columns is equal to the
00:57 - length of the inner array
00:58 - we use index 0 to refer to the first row
01:01 - and get its length
01:03 - the inner loop will traverse each row in
01:06 - the current column it also starts at
01:08 - index 0 and repeats for the number of
01:10 - rows in the column the number of rows is
01:13 - equal to the length of the outer array
01:16 - if we include a print statement and run
01:18 - the code
01:19 - the outer loop would start with column 0
01:22 - and the inner loop would iterate through
01:23 - each row
01:25 - once we traverse a full column the inner
01:27 - for loop is done
01:29 - the outer loop now increments the index
01:31 - of the column to move us to the next
01:33 - column
01:34 - now the inner loop repeats starting over
01:37 - at row 0 and moves through the array
01:40 - this process continues until the outer
01:42 - loop reaches the last column
01:45 - when we access data by traversing each
01:48 - column from left to right we are
01:50 - traversing in column major order
