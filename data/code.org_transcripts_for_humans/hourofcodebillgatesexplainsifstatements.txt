00:00 - People make decisions every day.
00:03 - For example before you go outside
00:05 - you kind of have an IF statement that says,
00:06 - IF it's raining,
THEN I need to get my jacket.
00:10 - And, computers are amazing once you decide those kinds of statements,
00:16 - that they can reliably execute those things at unbelievable speed.
00:21 - And so, a computer program really
00:24 - is a little bit of math and some
00:27 - IF statements, where the decision gets made.
00:31 - So, in this puzzle the
00:34 - IF block helps the zombie make a decision,
00:37 - it checks something.
00:39 - For example let's use the block that says, "if there's a path to the left,"
00:45 - and put a "turn left" command inside it.
00:48 - So, we're telling the zombie to check its surroundings,
00:51 - see if there's that path on the left,
00:53 - and if so, make that turn.
00:56 - And then we use the "move forward" block inside this "repeat"
01:01 - to get it to keep moving forward as long as
01:04 - it just wants to go straight.
01:06 - Then when there's the turn, the IF block
will tell it to make this turn to the left.
01:12 - And you can see, if we do that
01:13 - if we're taking the turn to the left and otherwise moving forward, 
we'll achieve our goal.
01:18 - So it's an example of using an IF statement,
01:21 - which is really a fundamental concept in computer programming.
01:26 - One of the first things I learned was how to write a program to play tic-tac-toe.
01:32 - So I had IF statements to say okay,
01:34 - IF the other person is about to win go ahead and block that spot.
01:39 - So have fun learning how to use IF statements. It's a key concept.
