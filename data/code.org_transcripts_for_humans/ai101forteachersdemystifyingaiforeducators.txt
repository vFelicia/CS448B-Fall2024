00:10 - welcome to session two of the AI 101 for
00:14 - teachers professional learning series
00:16 - in the last session you were introduced
00:18 - to Ai and learned about the potential
00:20 - uses for AI and education in this
00:23 - session we are going to pull the curtain
00:25 - back and learn more about what large
00:27 - language models are and how we can use
00:30 - them to perform common teacher tasks
00:32 - like creating formative assessments or
00:35 - writing an email to a parent
00:37 - leveraging AI for these time-consuming
00:40 - tasks will give you more time for the
00:42 - tasks that really matter most like
00:45 - engaging with your students let's get
00:47 - started
00:49 - foreign
00:54 - I hope you're all as excited as we are
00:57 - to dive into the fascinating world of
00:59 - generative AI my name is Amanda I am a
01:01 - former High School teacher and digital
01:03 - learning specialist I now work as a
01:05 - member of the professional learning team
01:07 - at code.org and I'm Tiffany an
01:09 - elementary and middle school stem
01:11 - teacher the potential of generative Ai
01:13 - and education truly excites me but I'm
01:15 - not alone in this enthusiasm let's hear
01:17 - what other Educators say about ai's role
01:19 - in education AI is going to be
01:22 - everywhere as a teacher it's going to
01:26 - give me new resources I'm looking
01:28 - forward in encouraging the kids to seek
01:33 - out AI enhancement and to use what they
01:37 - can find expand beyond the classroom I
01:40 - already actively encourage them to reach
01:42 - out beyond the scope of the class to
01:46 - learn what they can on their own and
01:48 - this is just another tool for doing that
01:50 - I hope AI can make my job better in
01:54 - helping me do things that you know might
01:57 - be something I put off to the end or
02:00 - it's really hard for me to do or hard to
02:02 - find time for doing some of these things
02:04 - and I think if we use our tools
02:06 - appropriately they can really give you
02:10 - time back the one thing that we could do
02:12 - that's a total disservice to our kids
02:14 - and to education is to say hey this is a
02:18 - scary thing that we don't want to talk
02:19 - about but it's like out here and it's
02:21 - like a thing we don't know a whole lot
02:22 - about instead it's like hey we do know a
02:25 - lot about AI this is what we know and
02:27 - this is how it's developed and teaching
02:30 - our kids like hey ai's not a scary thing
02:32 - but we do need to understand how AI
02:35 - works because those kids who are our
02:37 - youngest Learners right now are going to
02:39 - be the students and the adults of
02:41 - tomorrow they're going to be helping to
02:43 - develop this technology to make sure
02:46 - that it stays safe and Equitable and all
02:49 - of those things for our future to make
02:51 - sure that it is a technology that is
02:53 - evolving for good artificial
02:55 - intelligence is going to help us
02:57 - understand our students better as much
03:00 - as we don't like testing and as much as
03:02 - we don't like evaluating our students we
03:04 - have to do it but what AI can do is it
03:06 - processes that information is it's going
03:08 - to give us a new insight into our
03:10 - students
03:12 - foreign
03:16 - [Music]
03:18 - telligence also known as AI is a
03:21 - technology that imitates human
03:23 - intelligence performing tasks like
03:25 - understanding language recognizing
03:27 - patterns and making decisions
03:30 - ranging from specific systems like
03:32 - recommending movies to Advanced forms
03:35 - that generate content or predict
03:36 - outcomes ai's rapidly evolving
03:39 - technology enables machines to learn
03:42 - adapt and perform human-like tasks often
03:46 - more efficiently AI has been integrated
03:49 - into our lives already many of the
03:51 - Technologies we comfortably use in
03:53 - school and at home use ai ai is
03:56 - widespread some examples you may have
03:58 - seen before include self-driving cars
04:01 - Siri or Alexa speech to text Google
04:04 - translate Snapchat filters and the list
04:06 - goes on while there are many different
04:08 - types of AI all of which are useful and
04:11 - fascinating we know the type that is
04:13 - weighing most heavily on Educators Minds
04:15 - at the current moment generative AI
04:18 - generative AI is a type of AI that uses
04:21 - patterns from existing content to create
04:23 - new content such as new text or new
04:26 - images in this video we will focus on
04:28 - generative AI we'll use four guiding
04:31 - principles to understand the best ways
04:33 - to interact with AI and in particular
04:35 - generative AIS like chat GPT
04:38 - for educators you can think of using AI
04:40 - for Education like your own personal
04:42 - teaching assistant AI makes mistakes
04:46 - although teaching assistants are
04:47 - generally trustworthy they can make
04:49 - mistakes
04:50 - even though AI is run off of powerful
04:53 - algorithms those algorithms can't always
04:56 - tell fact from fiction or recognize the
04:58 - meaning of a complex question AI needs
05:00 - your guidance teaching assistance can't
05:02 - do everything on their own generally the
05:06 - more information you give image
05:08 - generators large language models and
05:10 - other AI systems the more the results
05:12 - will reflect what you were seeking your
05:16 - input to the system will make or break
05:18 - its usefulness AI systems have
05:21 - limitations AI systems have guardrails
05:23 - in place to prevent misuse for example
05:25 - chat GPT won't help you carry out an
05:27 - illegal plot and the image generator
05:29 - mid-journey won't create graphic content
05:31 - Beyond these guardrails systems also
05:33 - have actions that can't perform for
05:36 - example as of August 2023 chat GPT can't
05:40 - interpret images
05:42 - a is changing just like a teaching
05:44 - assistant will learn over time AI
05:46 - systems are becoming more sophisticated
05:48 - capable and Adept at understanding and
05:50 - addressing human needs what works today
05:52 - with AI may work differently tomorrow
06:00 - chat box like Chad gbt are based on a
06:03 - new type of AI technology that's called
06:05 - large language models so instead of a
06:09 - typical neural network which trains on a
06:11 - specific task like how to recognize
06:14 - faces or images a large language model
06:17 - is trained on the largest amount of
06:19 - information possible such as everything
06:22 - available on the internet
06:25 - training to then be able to generate
06:28 - completely new information
06:30 - like to write essays or poems have
06:33 - conversations or even write code
06:37 - the possibilities seem endless but how
06:39 - does this work and what are its
06:41 - shortcomings let's Dive In
06:44 - while a chat bot built on a large
06:47 - language model may seem magical it works
06:50 - based on some really simple ideas in
06:53 - fact most of the magic of AI is based on
06:56 - very simple math concepts from
06:59 - statistics applied billions of times
07:01 - using fast computers the AI uses
07:04 - probabilities to predict the text that
07:06 - you wanted to produce based on all the
07:08 - previous texts that it has been trained
07:11 - on
07:11 - suppose that we want to train a large
07:13 - language model to read every play
07:16 - written by William Shakespeare so that
07:18 - it could write new plays in the same
07:20 - style we'd start with all the texts from
07:23 - Shakespeare's plays stored letter by
07:26 - letter in a sequence next we'd analyze
07:29 - each letter to see what letter is most
07:32 - likely to come next after an eye the
07:35 - next most likely letters that show up in
07:37 - Shakespeare plays are s or n
07:41 - after an s
07:43 - T C or h and so on this creates a table
07:48 - of probabilities
07:50 - with just this we can try to generate
07:53 - new writing
07:55 - we've entered a new era of large
07:57 - language models Advanced large language
07:59 - models are now widely available as
08:01 - interactive chat Bots they can easily
08:04 - perform simple and complex tasks that
08:07 - you as the user can benefit from
08:09 - remember however that it is important to
08:13 - always scrutinize the output as you
08:14 - would any resource from the internet
08:16 - here are a few examples of some chat
08:18 - Bots that have gained notoriety in the
08:20 - recent past note that all of this
08:22 - information is current as of the
08:24 - publishing of this video but AI is
08:26 - rapidly shifting field and some of this
08:28 - information may be out of date by the
08:30 - time you watch the recording chatgpt is
08:33 - a large language model chat bot from
08:35 - openai it has undergone multiple
08:38 - versions
08:39 - gbt4 is the newest and most powerful
08:42 - version yet chat GPT 3.5 is currently
08:46 - available for free
08:47 - released by Google bard is powered by a
08:49 - lightweight and optimized version of the
08:52 - Lambda large language model with a few
08:54 - minor differences it functions much like
08:56 - chat GPT
08:57 - Bing AI created by Microsoft is built on
09:01 - the same technology as chat GPT but it
09:03 - has the added benefit of being connected
09:05 - to the internet and can access
09:07 - up-to-date information
09:08 - chatgpt and Bard are not and cannot
09:12 - access anything after 2021 which is the
09:15 - database it was trained on although we
09:17 - will primarily be focusing on generating
09:19 - new texts using large language models it
09:22 - is important to note that there are also
09:24 - generative AI tools that create other
09:27 - types of Novel outputs such as images
09:29 - tools like dolly or mid-journey are
09:32 - capable of creating images that nobody
09:34 - has ever seen before prompting an image
09:37 - generator is similar to prompting a text
09:39 - generator if you've tried one of these
09:41 - chat box you might realize that you
09:43 - won't always receive the right
09:45 - information from the large language
09:46 - model at first users are fine-tuning
09:49 - their skills of prompt engineering to
09:52 - get the most out of large language
09:53 - models prompt engineering refers to
09:56 - creating and tweaking prompts pumps to
09:58 - reach a desired output you could think
10:00 - of this like the process of clarifying a
10:03 - point to a friend in a conversation
10:05 - sometimes it's useful to add more
10:07 - information and specificity to be
10:10 - understood AI is pretty cool and has a
10:12 - lot of capabilities but how does AI fit
10:15 - into your life as an educator well we
10:18 - know that there are average teacher in
10:20 - the United States where it's 50 hours
10:22 - per week of the 50 hours a teacher Works
10:25 - per week in the U.S administrative tasks
10:27 - take up over 50 percent of teachers time
10:30 - leaving only 49 of their time for
10:32 - student interaction although these
10:35 - numbers differ from country to Country
10:37 - teachers across the globe are spending a
10:40 - tremendous amount of time on Preparation
10:43 - grading feedback and administrative
10:45 - tasks tasks where the teacher doesn't
10:47 - directly interact with students
10:50 - so consider AI to be your teaching
10:52 - assistant an AI teaching assistant can
10:55 - help cut down the time and mental effort
10:57 - you spend on these administrative types
10:59 - of tasks as well as both student
11:02 - learning and surprising ways it can
11:05 - suggest creative activity ideas draft
11:08 - parent emails write-up notes in up your
11:11 - design game for lesson materials
11:13 - ultimately a teaching assistant doesn't
11:15 - just help teachers but students as well
11:19 - as teachers increasingly shoulder more
11:21 - burdens AI can improve their ability to
11:24 - reach all students and students in their
11:27 - own terms if we wanted to fully harness
11:29 - its potential of AI tools we need to
11:31 - allow our new teaching assistants to
11:33 - help out in the learning process
11:36 - using AI as part of your workflow may be
11:39 - intimidating at first so let's first
11:41 - start by acknowledging the very real
11:43 - concerns Educators and people generally
11:45 - have about AI in the classroom cheating
11:48 - issues such as plagiarism unfair
11:50 - advantages and loss of critical thinking
11:52 - content issues like misinformation and
11:55 - AI fiction and student safety issues
11:58 - such as data privacy and misuse the idea
12:01 - we want to share with you today is that
12:03 - AI is akin to the calculator or the
12:05 - internet a completely game-changing tool
12:07 - that will transform education whether we
12:10 - are ready for it or not ultimately we
12:12 - will leave students behind if we don't
12:14 - prepare them for the future of education
12:16 - and the future of work
12:18 - we're not here to say that responding to
12:20 - this AI craze is easy because we know
12:23 - this is a significant challenge for
12:25 - teachers
12:26 - let's reframe each concern one by one
12:29 - cheating AI has the potential to enhance
12:32 - students learning when used with care
12:34 - and clear guidelines in place
12:37 - content with strong safeguards and an
12:39 - emphasis on critical thinking students
12:42 - can learn to evaluate AI tools responses
12:44 - with an eye for misinformation student
12:47 - safety like with all online tools of
12:50 - which students use many proper
12:52 - safeguards can help protect student data
12:54 - I know that doesn't address all of your
12:56 - concerns but throughout this video
12:58 - series we're going to continue to break
13:00 - down Ai and provide you with additional
13:02 - resources to take your learning to the
13:05 - next level now let's get back to using
13:08 - AI as a teaching assistant
13:12 - [Music]
13:15 - all right now we're here with my
13:16 - colleague Sherry we're going to explore
13:17 - examples of how we can use generative AI
13:20 - Sherry do you have any examples how you
13:22 - would use chat GPT
13:23 - I really would like to send an email to
13:26 - a parent that
13:28 - is concerned about their child's grade
13:30 - regarding the reading challenge that we
13:31 - have here at school they're being
13:34 - required the students are being required
13:36 - to read
13:37 - books throughout the year and meet a
13:40 - reading goal of certain page count and
13:43 - their child's a reluctant reader and
13:46 - they don't really know what to do and
13:49 - they're asking me for suggestions and
13:52 - um do you think that gbt would be
13:55 - something that I could use to help me
13:56 - with that yes Chachi PT would be great
13:59 - for that what are your initial thoughts
14:00 - when you start writing your emails
14:03 - the first thing I think would be asking
14:06 - it if
14:08 - the books that their child is reluctant
14:11 - to read is there anything the
14:13 - suggestions on types of books of reading
14:16 - levels you can just tell chat gbt what
14:19 - you're trying to do
14:20 - okay
14:22 - um write me
14:24 - an email reply
14:27 - to a
14:30 - student's
14:32 - parent
14:38 - about
14:40 - the
14:43 - book challenge
14:46 - and recommendations
14:50 - oh oh
14:52 - wow
14:55 - so it looks like it could be a little
14:58 - bit better
15:00 - um I think that I need to be a little
15:03 - bit more specific on the grade level
15:05 - because it just said student and it's
15:07 - giving me things that are a little lower
15:10 - but also maybe not in the genre that
15:14 - maybe the student likes so do you think
15:18 - that maybe like we could fix the
15:20 - parameters or how to narrow it down yeah
15:24 - I think the more specifics you give it
15:25 - like the gray level the genre then chat
15:28 - GPT would be able to help you out a
15:30 - little bit further with your email
15:34 - wow I really like how it has customized
15:38 - what we told it it now says Dear parent
15:42 - I hope this email finds you well thank
15:45 - you for getting in touch regarding the
15:46 - book Challenge and recommendations for
15:48 - your 10th grade student so that's what I
15:50 - asked it to do
15:52 - um I'm delighted to assist in suggesting
15:54 - some captivity and mystery novels that I
15:57 - believe will ignite their imagination
15:58 - and contribute to the reading experience
16:00 - so that's really good that it kind of
16:04 - inserted that that new aspect that new
16:06 - customization here are the books that it
16:09 - suggested now instead The Westing Game
16:13 - genuine fraud one of us is lying truly
16:16 - devious and a study in Charlotte and
16:19 - then it goes on to say I encourage your
16:22 - student to reach out with their thoughts
16:24 - questions and insights so I really like
16:26 - what it has customized for me this time
16:29 - around okay I'm glad you like what
16:31 - Chachi PC came up with but the nice
16:33 - thing about chat you PPT is it's the
16:35 - starting point so do you agree with
16:36 - everything that the email suggested or
16:38 - would you make any edits to it
16:40 - um this new version the the
16:42 - customization that it has given me for a
16:45 - 10th grader now with the mystery genres
16:47 - looks I think so much better because
16:50 - it's actually giving me books that
16:54 - um are I think a better choice and I do
16:58 - like that the tone at the beginning it
17:01 - says that I want to extend my
17:03 - appreciation for your student's
17:04 - participation it's got words like
17:06 - dedication in it so the tone I think is
17:09 - really good
17:10 - um and I like the length of it maybe at
17:13 - the very end I wouldn't have three
17:14 - paragraphs but you know I think that's
17:16 - the beauty of it I can kind of mix and
17:18 - match and pick and choose what I want to
17:20 - use but um I think it's a great jumping
17:22 - off point for us
17:24 - um The Westing Game though the book that
17:26 - is listed first that was suggested I
17:30 - probably wouldn't include that even
17:32 - though it's a better choice of books
17:34 - overall the five that it gave the
17:36 - Westing Game is too low it's not a high
17:39 - school level book it's a middle school
17:40 - level book so I probably take that out
17:42 - and maybe change a little bit of the
17:44 - length but the tone of it is exactly
17:46 - what I was looking for yeah Chachi PT
17:48 - can revise and edit to whatever you
17:51 - would like so if you want to change the
17:52 - length of it if you want to change the
17:54 - style or the formality of it you can
17:57 - just ask it to change it so why don't
17:58 - you go ahead and give it a try Okay
18:01 - um rewrite
18:04 - for shorter
18:07 - length
18:09 - and take off
18:12 - The Westing Game
18:17 - improve
18:20 - opening
18:22 - paragraph
18:28 - okay let me see what it does
18:30 - I hope you're well okay it still looks
18:33 - good here are three engaging mystery
18:35 - novels so they kind of cut it down
18:36 - because it was a little wordy at the
18:38 - beginning
18:38 - and then they took out
18:41 - The Westing Game but it looks like they
18:44 - took out one other one as well so
18:46 - originally we had five choices and now
18:49 - there's three but one of the ones they
18:51 - took out was the one I wanted to take
18:53 - out so I'm curious why it wouldn't take
18:55 - out just one of the suggestions that I
18:58 - gave well if you notice if you if you
19:00 - use chat GPT you can go above and it
19:03 - saves all the prior emails so if there
19:04 - is something from a previous email you
19:06 - like you can just cut and paste it into
19:08 - your final email okay great I wasn't
19:11 - even thinking about that so that's great
19:13 - to have that suggestion this is just one
19:16 - example of how to work with AI to
19:18 - generate and then revise content we
19:20 - recommend that you pause the video here
19:22 - and try generating your own guardian or
19:24 - parent email using chat GPT if you need
19:27 - help creating an account check out these
19:29 - login instructions
19:34 - [Music]
19:37 - do you have any lesson plans that you
19:38 - are thinking about writing right now
19:40 - I think so I think I could think of
19:43 - something right now my students are
19:45 - learning about the Greek gods and
19:46 - goddesses and I'm always struggling to
19:48 - come up with ways to incorporate lessons
19:51 - that aren't the same thing I've done
19:53 - every single year so um I guess I'll
19:56 - just start by typing in the prompt box
19:59 - all right
20:01 - um let's see
20:02 - develop
20:07 - a research
20:09 - based
20:12 - writing
20:14 - assignment
20:17 - on the Greek
20:20 - gods
20:22 - and
20:24 - goddesses
20:27 - all right it says assignment choose one
20:30 - Greek god or goddess to research write a
20:33 - two to three page research paper about
20:35 - your chosen daughter goddess
20:37 - your paper should include the following
20:39 - it goes on to list what it needs to
20:41 - include and then even gives a grading
20:42 - rubric tips for researching Greek gods
20:45 - and goddesses
20:47 - this is pretty great yeah and it was
20:49 - great there any of you also add more
20:51 - specific keywords like lesson plan it
20:54 - will even break it down even further for
20:55 - you so you can see the exact lesson plan
20:58 - and probably still give you some of that
20:59 - same information okay
21:01 - um
21:02 - make it
21:04 - a lesson plan I didn't say that before
21:07 - make it a lesson plan
21:09 - for three days
21:14 - oh wow look it says here's a lesson plan
21:17 - for three days on Greek gods and
21:19 - goddesses day one it gives me five
21:21 - different tasks for the students to do
21:23 - day two it gives me tasks day three even
21:27 - gives me assessment suggestions and
21:28 - differentiation because I mean you know
21:31 - that there's different learning styles
21:32 - so it gives me one that talks about a
21:35 - longer research paper or it could be
21:37 - ones that who are wanting a challenge it
21:40 - could be a lesser known god or goddess
21:41 - and
21:43 - um I mean this has given me some really
21:45 - good suggestions this is just one
21:47 - example of how to work with AI to
21:49 - generate and then revise content we
21:51 - recommend that you pause the video here
21:53 - and try generating your own lesson plan
21:55 - using either chat gbt or bard
22:01 - [Music]
22:03 - yeah
22:05 - so one thing I love being for is because
22:07 - it's up to date and it's connected to
22:09 - the Internet so I can go on there I can
22:11 - prompt my students to go on there and
22:12 - get up-to-date information and I can
22:14 - give it specifics about what I'm looking
22:16 - for is there anything currently that
22:18 - you're looking for
22:20 - yeah with us coming back to school just
22:23 - being out of the summer time one of the
22:25 - things that our students are required to
22:26 - do is read a chosen book for them over
22:29 - the summer and they just got finished
22:31 - reading a book about a young boy who
22:34 - helped solve a mystery involving art
22:37 - Heist at the National Gallery Museum in
22:40 - DC and I would love for them to make an
22:44 - actual real world connection because
22:46 - these things do happen all over the
22:48 - world including here in the United
22:49 - States and specifically at the Isabella
22:52 - or Stewart Gardner Museum one of the
22:55 - things that they really connected on
22:57 - when they read the book was just how is
23:00 - it that people
23:01 - steal such Priceless works of art but
23:04 - also what is it about those works of art
23:07 - and artists and things like that and I
23:10 - would love to use this to dive deeper
23:13 - and for them to make those connections
23:15 - yeah I know it can definitely help you
23:17 - with that especially if you want the
23:19 - students to go to specific places you
23:21 - can make it be able to give you a
23:23 - formative assessment so you can type in
23:25 - specifics about what you want them to
23:27 - look for on the website
23:28 - okay
23:30 - um what I would really like is for them
23:31 - to have an assessment to look at this
23:35 - website from the Museum's website and
23:39 - try to really show me that they've
23:41 - walked away understanding what it is
23:43 - that I want them to understand about the
23:45 - artwork about the artists about the time
23:48 - period the value of the work etc so let
23:52 - me see what I can get it to tell us so I
23:56 - think I'm going to write the uh create
24:00 - a five question
24:04 - quiz based
24:07 - on the
24:10 - context of the website
24:15 - since it's linked to the internet I
24:17 - think that it should be able to do this
24:19 - okay so you can be more specific with
24:22 - you see that it didn't give you the
24:23 - website so when you type in your
24:25 - questions specifically type in the
24:27 - website along with what formative
24:28 - assessment you want it to give you and
24:31 - then it will give it will link the
24:32 - formative assessment with the website
24:34 - and give you the information you're
24:35 - looking for okay great
24:37 - um I just redid it and it says thank you
24:39 - for the link I see it's about the 13
24:41 - works of art from the Isabella Stewart
24:45 - Gardner Museum that was stolen in Boston
24:47 - so it says here are five questions and
24:49 - it goes on to give me those five
24:50 - questions and that really does help but
24:53 - actually I think I want it to be where
24:56 - maybe there's some multiple choice
24:58 - instead of just some short answer so let
25:01 - me tell it
25:02 - make it
25:05 - 50 percent
25:09 - multiple choice
25:12 - based
25:16 - great so now it's taken those questions
25:19 - and it's turning into a multiple choice
25:21 - based question
25:22 - so that's what I was hoping rather than
25:25 - be just completely short answer
25:29 - only problem is it didn't give me an
25:31 - answer key so with most teachers one in
25:34 - the end so the nice thing also you can
25:36 - extend it if you see five questions uh
25:38 - maybe for one class or one student may
25:40 - only need to research and do five
25:42 - questions you can also tell it to give
25:44 - you ten questions 20 questions and you
25:46 - can split it like you did 50 multiple
25:47 - choice some open-ended questions so I'm
25:50 - fill in the blanks but like you were
25:52 - saying most teachers want an answer key
25:53 - with it so go ahead and type in and try
25:55 - to get the answer key for what you just
25:57 - looked up answer key needed
26:06 - great look now it's giving me the answer
26:08 - key so this is perfect and now like you
26:11 - said I can extend it I can change the
26:13 - dynamic of the quiz if I wanted to go
26:15 - from true false or even maybe just a
26:18 - couple of short answers and only a
26:20 - couple of the multiple choice so this is
26:23 - great I love that it's linked to the
26:24 - website that I want them to look at
26:26 - without me having to go through and
26:29 - filter the entire content on the website
26:31 - so it does give you the answer key but
26:33 - just since it is coming from the
26:35 - internet you always need to go through
26:36 - yourself and check for accuracy just to
26:38 - make sure that it's giving you all the
26:39 - correct information and answers of
26:41 - course of course yeah so the multiple
26:43 - choice like you were saying you can do
26:44 - true or false you can do a lot of
26:45 - different options but if you want to do
26:47 - an extension for your students you can
26:49 - also ask it to maybe do some Hands-On
26:51 - activities or something like that so why
26:53 - don't we try to see okay
26:55 - um let's see creative
27:01 - ways
27:03 - to
27:04 - incorporate
27:07 - information
27:17 - wonderful so here it's telling me that
27:20 - some ways to incorporate the information
27:22 - would be they could create a crossword
27:24 - puzzle using key terms or information
27:26 - from the text they could write a short
27:28 - story where they pretend to be maybe one
27:31 - of the characters in the artwork or it
27:35 - could be they create their own artwork a
27:38 - song a poem they could even create a
27:40 - game so these are some great suggestions
27:42 - because I hadn't even thought about
27:43 - creating a crossword puzzle using the
27:46 - information that they learned about and
27:48 - were assessed about in the first place
27:50 - so now they can apply that information
27:51 - and you can always take it one step
27:53 - further for your creative students that
27:56 - want to write a song or a poem like the
27:57 - option there so what would you ask the
27:59 - website to do if you wanted a student to
28:01 - create a song
28:03 - I think I would want them to create a
28:05 - song using the
28:07 - artwork or the information from this
28:09 - website as their inspiration so let me
28:13 - see if I can get it to write an example
28:15 - song so I can show them what it's like
28:18 - or what it should look like when it's
28:19 - finished and done
28:21 - so create
28:24 - a song
28:26 - about the information
28:30 - learned
28:32 - from
28:34 - the
28:37 - website
28:40 - says here's a song I came up with based
28:43 - on the information from the website
28:48 - it does it has a verse one A Chorus a
28:52 - verse two A Chorus and I'm reading the
28:55 - lyrics and it's about the artwork stolen
28:58 - from the Isabella Gardner Museum so this
29:01 - is
29:02 - this is exactly like the information
29:04 - that they would have learned about the
29:06 - art Heist and the artwork itself
29:09 - we recommend that you pause here and try
29:12 - out developing formative assessment
29:13 - questions using chat gbt Bard or Bing
29:17 - we know that was a lot and I'm sure you
29:19 - still have questions about how to use AI
29:21 - to act as your own teaching assistant we
29:23 - put together a resource for educators to
29:25 - craft strong prompts to get the most out
29:27 - of the AI tool of your choice take a few
29:30 - minutes to review the document and try
29:31 - out some of the prompts bonus points if
29:33 - you try out the same prompt in different
29:35 - tools
29:37 - in this session we focus on AI as a tool
29:40 - for performing teacher tasks some of you
29:43 - might be wondering hey if I can use this
29:45 - to make my job easier what are my
29:48 - students going to do with it
29:49 - in the next session we are going to
29:51 - focus on ways that teachers can use AI
29:54 - to enhance the learning experience as
29:56 - opposed to detracting from it we will be
29:59 - joined by Dr Ethan Mullick a professor
30:02 - at the Wharton School at the University
30:04 - of Pennsylvania and Dr lilac Malik who
30:08 - works on interactive pedagogy and AI
30:11 - research at the Wharton School they will
30:14 - help us explore the possibilities of AI
30:17 - for student learning visit the AI 101
30:20 - for teachers website at co.org AI 101 to
30:24 - sign up for Early Access and to explore
30:27 - additional resources from code.org ETS
30:29 - IST and Khan Academy thanks for joining
30:33 - us see you in session three
30:39 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

foreign welcome to session two of the AI 101 for teachers professional learning series in the last session you were introduced to Ai and learned about the potential uses for AI and education in this session we are going to pull the curtain back and learn more about what large language models are and how we can use them to perform common teacher tasks like creating formative assessments or writing an email to a parent leveraging AI for these timeconsuming tasks will give you more time for the tasks that really matter most like engaging with your students let's get started foreign I hope you're all as excited as we are to dive into the fascinating world of generative AI my name is Amanda I am a former High School teacher and digital learning specialist I now work as a member of the professional learning team at code.org and I'm Tiffany an elementary and middle school stem teacher the potential of generative Ai and education truly excites me but I'm not alone in this enthusiasm let's hear what other Educators say about ai's role in education AI is going to be everywhere as a teacher it's going to give me new resources I'm looking forward in encouraging the kids to seek out AI enhancement and to use what they can find expand beyond the classroom I already actively encourage them to reach out beyond the scope of the class to learn what they can on their own and this is just another tool for doing that I hope AI can make my job better in helping me do things that you know might be something I put off to the end or it's really hard for me to do or hard to find time for doing some of these things and I think if we use our tools appropriately they can really give you time back the one thing that we could do that's a total disservice to our kids and to education is to say hey this is a scary thing that we don't want to talk about but it's like out here and it's like a thing we don't know a whole lot about instead it's like hey we do know a lot about AI this is what we know and this is how it's developed and teaching our kids like hey ai's not a scary thing but we do need to understand how AI works because those kids who are our youngest Learners right now are going to be the students and the adults of tomorrow they're going to be helping to develop this technology to make sure that it stays safe and Equitable and all of those things for our future to make sure that it is a technology that is evolving for good artificial intelligence is going to help us understand our students better as much as we don't like testing and as much as we don't like evaluating our students we have to do it but what AI can do is it processes that information is it's going to give us a new insight into our students foreign telligence also known as AI is a technology that imitates human intelligence performing tasks like understanding language recognizing patterns and making decisions ranging from specific systems like recommending movies to Advanced forms that generate content or predict outcomes ai's rapidly evolving technology enables machines to learn adapt and perform humanlike tasks often more efficiently AI has been integrated into our lives already many of the Technologies we comfortably use in school and at home use ai ai is widespread some examples you may have seen before include selfdriving cars Siri or Alexa speech to text Google translate Snapchat filters and the list goes on while there are many different types of AI all of which are useful and fascinating we know the type that is weighing most heavily on Educators Minds at the current moment generative AI generative AI is a type of AI that uses patterns from existing content to create new content such as new text or new images in this video we will focus on generative AI we'll use four guiding principles to understand the best ways to interact with AI and in particular generative AIS like chat GPT for educators you can think of using AI for Education like your own personal teaching assistant AI makes mistakes although teaching assistants are generally trustworthy they can make mistakes even though AI is run off of powerful algorithms those algorithms can't always tell fact from fiction or recognize the meaning of a complex question AI needs your guidance teaching assistance can't do everything on their own generally the more information you give image generators large language models and other AI systems the more the results will reflect what you were seeking your input to the system will make or break its usefulness AI systems have limitations AI systems have guardrails in place to prevent misuse for example chat GPT won't help you carry out an illegal plot and the image generator midjourney won't create graphic content Beyond these guardrails systems also have actions that can't perform for example as of August 2023 chat GPT can't interpret images a is changing just like a teaching assistant will learn over time AI systems are becoming more sophisticated capable and Adept at understanding and addressing human needs what works today with AI may work differently tomorrow chat box like Chad gbt are based on a new type of AI technology that's called large language models so instead of a typical neural network which trains on a specific task like how to recognize faces or images a large language model is trained on the largest amount of information possible such as everything available on the internet training to then be able to generate completely new information like to write essays or poems have conversations or even write code the possibilities seem endless but how does this work and what are its shortcomings let's Dive In while a chat bot built on a large language model may seem magical it works based on some really simple ideas in fact most of the magic of AI is based on very simple math concepts from statistics applied billions of times using fast computers the AI uses probabilities to predict the text that you wanted to produce based on all the previous texts that it has been trained on suppose that we want to train a large language model to read every play written by William Shakespeare so that it could write new plays in the same style we'd start with all the texts from Shakespeare's plays stored letter by letter in a sequence next we'd analyze each letter to see what letter is most likely to come next after an eye the next most likely letters that show up in Shakespeare plays are s or n after an s T C or h and so on this creates a table of probabilities with just this we can try to generate new writing we've entered a new era of large language models Advanced large language models are now widely available as interactive chat Bots they can easily perform simple and complex tasks that you as the user can benefit from remember however that it is important to always scrutinize the output as you would any resource from the internet here are a few examples of some chat Bots that have gained notoriety in the recent past note that all of this information is current as of the publishing of this video but AI is rapidly shifting field and some of this information may be out of date by the time you watch the recording chatgpt is a large language model chat bot from openai it has undergone multiple versions gbt4 is the newest and most powerful version yet chat GPT 3.5 is currently available for free released by Google bard is powered by a lightweight and optimized version of the Lambda large language model with a few minor differences it functions much like chat GPT Bing AI created by Microsoft is built on the same technology as chat GPT but it has the added benefit of being connected to the internet and can access uptodate information chatgpt and Bard are not and cannot access anything after 2021 which is the database it was trained on although we will primarily be focusing on generating new texts using large language models it is important to note that there are also generative AI tools that create other types of Novel outputs such as images tools like dolly or midjourney are capable of creating images that nobody has ever seen before prompting an image generator is similar to prompting a text generator if you've tried one of these chat box you might realize that you won't always receive the right information from the large language model at first users are finetuning their skills of prompt engineering to get the most out of large language models prompt engineering refers to creating and tweaking prompts pumps to reach a desired output you could think of this like the process of clarifying a point to a friend in a conversation sometimes it's useful to add more information and specificity to be understood AI is pretty cool and has a lot of capabilities but how does AI fit into your life as an educator well we know that there are average teacher in the United States where it's 50 hours per week of the 50 hours a teacher Works per week in the U.S administrative tasks take up over 50 percent of teachers time leaving only 49 of their time for student interaction although these numbers differ from country to Country teachers across the globe are spending a tremendous amount of time on Preparation grading feedback and administrative tasks tasks where the teacher doesn't directly interact with students so consider AI to be your teaching assistant an AI teaching assistant can help cut down the time and mental effort you spend on these administrative types of tasks as well as both student learning and surprising ways it can suggest creative activity ideas draft parent emails writeup notes in up your design game for lesson materials ultimately a teaching assistant doesn't just help teachers but students as well as teachers increasingly shoulder more burdens AI can improve their ability to reach all students and students in their own terms if we wanted to fully harness its potential of AI tools we need to allow our new teaching assistants to help out in the learning process using AI as part of your workflow may be intimidating at first so let's first start by acknowledging the very real concerns Educators and people generally have about AI in the classroom cheating issues such as plagiarism unfair advantages and loss of critical thinking content issues like misinformation and AI fiction and student safety issues such as data privacy and misuse the idea we want to share with you today is that AI is akin to the calculator or the internet a completely gamechanging tool that will transform education whether we are ready for it or not ultimately we will leave students behind if we don't prepare them for the future of education and the future of work we're not here to say that responding to this AI craze is easy because we know this is a significant challenge for teachers let's reframe each concern one by one cheating AI has the potential to enhance students learning when used with care and clear guidelines in place content with strong safeguards and an emphasis on critical thinking students can learn to evaluate AI tools responses with an eye for misinformation student safety like with all online tools of which students use many proper safeguards can help protect student data I know that doesn't address all of your concerns but throughout this video series we're going to continue to break down Ai and provide you with additional resources to take your learning to the next level now let's get back to using AI as a teaching assistant all right now we're here with my colleague Sherry we're going to explore examples of how we can use generative AI Sherry do you have any examples how you would use chat GPT I really would like to send an email to a parent that is concerned about their child's grade regarding the reading challenge that we have here at school they're being required the students are being required to read books throughout the year and meet a reading goal of certain page count and their child's a reluctant reader and they don't really know what to do and they're asking me for suggestions and um do you think that gbt would be something that I could use to help me with that yes Chachi PT would be great for that what are your initial thoughts when you start writing your emails the first thing I think would be asking it if the books that their child is reluctant to read is there anything the suggestions on types of books of reading levels you can just tell chat gbt what you're trying to do okay um write me an email reply to a student's parent about the book challenge and recommendations oh oh wow so it looks like it could be a little bit better um I think that I need to be a little bit more specific on the grade level because it just said student and it's giving me things that are a little lower but also maybe not in the genre that maybe the student likes so do you think that maybe like we could fix the parameters or how to narrow it down yeah I think the more specifics you give it like the gray level the genre then chat GPT would be able to help you out a little bit further with your email wow I really like how it has customized what we told it it now says Dear parent I hope this email finds you well thank you for getting in touch regarding the book Challenge and recommendations for your 10th grade student so that's what I asked it to do um I'm delighted to assist in suggesting some captivity and mystery novels that I believe will ignite their imagination and contribute to the reading experience so that's really good that it kind of inserted that that new aspect that new customization here are the books that it suggested now instead The Westing Game genuine fraud one of us is lying truly devious and a study in Charlotte and then it goes on to say I encourage your student to reach out with their thoughts questions and insights so I really like what it has customized for me this time around okay I'm glad you like what Chachi PC came up with but the nice thing about chat you PPT is it's the starting point so do you agree with everything that the email suggested or would you make any edits to it um this new version the the customization that it has given me for a 10th grader now with the mystery genres looks I think so much better because it's actually giving me books that um are I think a better choice and I do like that the tone at the beginning it says that I want to extend my appreciation for your student's participation it's got words like dedication in it so the tone I think is really good um and I like the length of it maybe at the very end I wouldn't have three paragraphs but you know I think that's the beauty of it I can kind of mix and match and pick and choose what I want to use but um I think it's a great jumping off point for us um The Westing Game though the book that is listed first that was suggested I probably wouldn't include that even though it's a better choice of books overall the five that it gave the Westing Game is too low it's not a high school level book it's a middle school level book so I probably take that out and maybe change a little bit of the length but the tone of it is exactly what I was looking for yeah Chachi PT can revise and edit to whatever you would like so if you want to change the length of it if you want to change the style or the formality of it you can just ask it to change it so why don't you go ahead and give it a try Okay um rewrite for shorter length and take off The Westing Game improve opening paragraph okay let me see what it does I hope you're well okay it still looks good here are three engaging mystery novels so they kind of cut it down because it was a little wordy at the beginning and then they took out The Westing Game but it looks like they took out one other one as well so originally we had five choices and now there's three but one of the ones they took out was the one I wanted to take out so I'm curious why it wouldn't take out just one of the suggestions that I gave well if you notice if you if you use chat GPT you can go above and it saves all the prior emails so if there is something from a previous email you like you can just cut and paste it into your final email okay great I wasn't even thinking about that so that's great to have that suggestion this is just one example of how to work with AI to generate and then revise content we recommend that you pause the video here and try generating your own guardian or parent email using chat GPT if you need help creating an account check out these login instructions do you have any lesson plans that you are thinking about writing right now I think so I think I could think of something right now my students are learning about the Greek gods and goddesses and I'm always struggling to come up with ways to incorporate lessons that aren't the same thing I've done every single year so um I guess I'll just start by typing in the prompt box all right um let's see develop a research based writing assignment on the Greek gods and goddesses all right it says assignment choose one Greek god or goddess to research write a two to three page research paper about your chosen daughter goddess your paper should include the following it goes on to list what it needs to include and then even gives a grading rubric tips for researching Greek gods and goddesses this is pretty great yeah and it was great there any of you also add more specific keywords like lesson plan it will even break it down even further for you so you can see the exact lesson plan and probably still give you some of that same information okay um make it a lesson plan I didn't say that before make it a lesson plan for three days oh wow look it says here's a lesson plan for three days on Greek gods and goddesses day one it gives me five different tasks for the students to do day two it gives me tasks day three even gives me assessment suggestions and differentiation because I mean you know that there's different learning styles so it gives me one that talks about a longer research paper or it could be ones that who are wanting a challenge it could be a lesser known god or goddess and um I mean this has given me some really good suggestions this is just one example of how to work with AI to generate and then revise content we recommend that you pause the video here and try generating your own lesson plan using either chat gbt or bard yeah so one thing I love being for is because it's up to date and it's connected to the Internet so I can go on there I can prompt my students to go on there and get uptodate information and I can give it specifics about what I'm looking for is there anything currently that you're looking for yeah with us coming back to school just being out of the summer time one of the things that our students are required to do is read a chosen book for them over the summer and they just got finished reading a book about a young boy who helped solve a mystery involving art Heist at the National Gallery Museum in DC and I would love for them to make an actual real world connection because these things do happen all over the world including here in the United States and specifically at the Isabella or Stewart Gardner Museum one of the things that they really connected on when they read the book was just how is it that people steal such Priceless works of art but also what is it about those works of art and artists and things like that and I would love to use this to dive deeper and for them to make those connections yeah I know it can definitely help you with that especially if you want the students to go to specific places you can make it be able to give you a formative assessment so you can type in specifics about what you want them to look for on the website okay um what I would really like is for them to have an assessment to look at this website from the Museum's website and try to really show me that they've walked away understanding what it is that I want them to understand about the artwork about the artists about the time period the value of the work etc so let me see what I can get it to tell us so I think I'm going to write the uh create a five question quiz based on the context of the website since it's linked to the internet I think that it should be able to do this okay so you can be more specific with you see that it didn't give you the website so when you type in your questions specifically type in the website along with what formative assessment you want it to give you and then it will give it will link the formative assessment with the website and give you the information you're looking for okay great um I just redid it and it says thank you for the link I see it's about the 13 works of art from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum that was stolen in Boston so it says here are five questions and it goes on to give me those five questions and that really does help but actually I think I want it to be where maybe there's some multiple choice instead of just some short answer so let me tell it make it 50 percent multiple choice based great so now it's taken those questions and it's turning into a multiple choice based question so that's what I was hoping rather than be just completely short answer only problem is it didn't give me an answer key so with most teachers one in the end so the nice thing also you can extend it if you see five questions uh maybe for one class or one student may only need to research and do five questions you can also tell it to give you ten questions 20 questions and you can split it like you did 50 multiple choice some openended questions so I'm fill in the blanks but like you were saying most teachers want an answer key with it so go ahead and type in and try to get the answer key for what you just looked up answer key needed great look now it's giving me the answer key so this is perfect and now like you said I can extend it I can change the dynamic of the quiz if I wanted to go from true false or even maybe just a couple of short answers and only a couple of the multiple choice so this is great I love that it's linked to the website that I want them to look at without me having to go through and filter the entire content on the website so it does give you the answer key but just since it is coming from the internet you always need to go through yourself and check for accuracy just to make sure that it's giving you all the correct information and answers of course of course yeah so the multiple choice like you were saying you can do true or false you can do a lot of different options but if you want to do an extension for your students you can also ask it to maybe do some HandsOn activities or something like that so why don't we try to see okay um let's see creative ways to incorporate information wonderful so here it's telling me that some ways to incorporate the information would be they could create a crossword puzzle using key terms or information from the text they could write a short story where they pretend to be maybe one of the characters in the artwork or it could be they create their own artwork a song a poem they could even create a game so these are some great suggestions because I hadn't even thought about creating a crossword puzzle using the information that they learned about and were assessed about in the first place so now they can apply that information and you can always take it one step further for your creative students that want to write a song or a poem like the option there so what would you ask the website to do if you wanted a student to create a song I think I would want them to create a song using the artwork or the information from this website as their inspiration so let me see if I can get it to write an example song so I can show them what it's like or what it should look like when it's finished and done so create a song about the information learned from the website says here's a song I came up with based on the information from the website it does it has a verse one A Chorus a verse two A Chorus and I'm reading the lyrics and it's about the artwork stolen from the Isabella Gardner Museum so this is this is exactly like the information that they would have learned about the art Heist and the artwork itself we recommend that you pause here and try out developing formative assessment questions using chat gbt Bard or Bing we know that was a lot and I'm sure you still have questions about how to use AI to act as your own teaching assistant we put together a resource for educators to craft strong prompts to get the most out of the AI tool of your choice take a few minutes to review the document and try out some of the prompts bonus points if you try out the same prompt in different tools in this session we focus on AI as a tool for performing teacher tasks some of you might be wondering hey if I can use this to make my job easier what are my students going to do with it in the next session we are going to focus on ways that teachers can use AI to enhance the learning experience as opposed to detracting from it we will be joined by Dr Ethan Mullick a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Dr lilac Malik who works on interactive pedagogy and AI research at the Wharton School they will help us explore the possibilities of AI for student learning visit the AI 101 for teachers website at co.org AI 101 to sign up for Early Access and to explore additional resources from code.org ETS IST and Khan Academy thanks for joining us see you in session three thank you
