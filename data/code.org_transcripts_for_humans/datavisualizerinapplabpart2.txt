00:05 - using the data visualizer tool in app
00:07 - lab we can also make scatter plots
00:09 - scatter plots are useful for answering
00:10 - questions about relationships between
00:13 - variables or attributes in your data set
00:15 - first we'll want to choose scatter plot
00:17 - from the drop down
00:20 - and let's start with some variables that
00:22 - we've looked at before
00:23 - and the x values will look at the total
00:25 - percent of female
00:27 - test takers
00:28 - now if i wanted to know about the
00:30 - relationship between the percentage of
00:32 - female cs test takers in a state and the
00:35 - percentage of schools in that state that
00:38 - offer an ap program i could make this
00:40 - scatter plot
00:43 - now this scatter plot shows along the
00:44 - x-axis the total percent of female test
00:47 - takers and on the y-axis the percentage
00:50 - of schools in a state that offer an ap
00:52 - program
00:53 - each dot represents a particular state
00:56 - so for example we can see that this
00:58 - state right here
01:00 - had 38 percent of the schools in that
01:01 - state offer an ap program and 29 of the
01:05 - test takers in that state identified as
01:07 - female
01:08 - by looking at this entire graph we can
01:11 - see what if any relationship exists
01:14 - between these two variables
01:16 - we can also use the filter tool at the
01:18 - bottom
01:19 - to narrow down our investigation
01:23 - let's say we're interested in looking at
01:25 - only states where a large amount of
01:27 - tests were taken
01:29 - let's say two thousand
01:30 - we can choose the appropriate value here
01:33 - total apcs exams
01:36 - we can choose greater than or equal to
01:40 - and then we'll find the first value
01:42 - that's larger than two thousand here two
01:44 - thousand two hundred and fifteen
01:47 - now this graph still shows the same
01:49 - variables it's just that we're looking
01:50 - at only the states where there were 2
01:53 - 000 or more cs tests taken the last type
01:57 - of visual we can make is a cross tab
01:59 - cross tabs are useful
02:01 - for looking at data sets that involve
02:04 - some values that are strings instead of
02:06 - numbers so for this type of
02:08 - visualization let's look at another data
02:11 - set
02:16 - this data set comes from the publication
02:18 - the root and contains information about
02:20 - the 100 most influential
02:22 - african-americans
02:25 - after we import it we can look at it
02:27 - here
02:30 - let's say
02:32 - we wanted to get a sense of the most
02:34 - common type of people included in this
02:37 - list maybe with respect to
02:39 - the sector that they're in and their age
02:43 - we can choose those two variables here
02:45 - for our x
02:46 - and y
02:47 - values
02:48 - and now you'll see this table that shows
02:51 - up
02:52 - each of these values here in different
02:54 - shades of blue show the frequency at
02:57 - which these different combinations
02:58 - showed up so for example we can see here
03:01 - that in this entire data set four of the
03:04 - people on this list are age 39 and work
03:07 - in the community sector and we can see
03:09 - that that's the most combination out of
03:11 - all the possible combinations in this
03:12 - data set there are any number of
03:14 - possible questions you can investigate
03:16 - using these visualizations from
03:18 - understanding the variability in your
03:20 - data set to starting to uncover patterns
03:23 - and relationships in the data
03:25 - these visualizations will help you gain
03:27 - insight into topics that are of interest
03:29 - to you and are important to you

using the data visualizer tool in app lab we can also make scatter plots scatter plots are useful for answering questions about relationships between variables or attributes in your data set first we'll want to choose scatter plot from the drop down and let's start with some variables that we've looked at before and the x values will look at the total percent of female test takers now if i wanted to know about the relationship between the percentage of female cs test takers in a state and the percentage of schools in that state that offer an ap program i could make this scatter plot now this scatter plot shows along the xaxis the total percent of female test takers and on the yaxis the percentage of schools in a state that offer an ap program each dot represents a particular state so for example we can see that this state right here had 38 percent of the schools in that state offer an ap program and 29 of the test takers in that state identified as female by looking at this entire graph we can see what if any relationship exists between these two variables we can also use the filter tool at the bottom to narrow down our investigation let's say we're interested in looking at only states where a large amount of tests were taken let's say two thousand we can choose the appropriate value here total apcs exams we can choose greater than or equal to and then we'll find the first value that's larger than two thousand here two thousand two hundred and fifteen now this graph still shows the same variables it's just that we're looking at only the states where there were 2 000 or more cs tests taken the last type of visual we can make is a cross tab cross tabs are useful for looking at data sets that involve some values that are strings instead of numbers so for this type of visualization let's look at another data set this data set comes from the publication the root and contains information about the 100 most influential africanamericans after we import it we can look at it here let's say we wanted to get a sense of the most common type of people included in this list maybe with respect to the sector that they're in and their age we can choose those two variables here for our x and y values and now you'll see this table that shows up each of these values here in different shades of blue show the frequency at which these different combinations showed up so for example we can see here that in this entire data set four of the people on this list are age 39 and work in the community sector and we can see that that's the most combination out of all the possible combinations in this data set there are any number of possible questions you can investigate using these visualizations from understanding the variability in your data set to starting to uncover patterns and relationships in the data these visualizations will help you gain insight into topics that are of interest to you and are important to you
