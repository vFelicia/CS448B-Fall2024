00:10 - when artists go to work they can express
00:12 - themselves in many different ways they
00:15 - can sing a song choreograph a dance or
00:17 - write a poem each is a unique type of
00:20 - expression but they're all considered
00:21 - forms of art
00:23 - in programming there's a concept called
00:25 - polymorphism
00:27 - polymorphism is the potential for an
00:29 - action to be implemented in many
00:31 - different ways
00:32 - poly is many and morphism is forms
00:36 - many forms
00:38 - we can represent artists with an artist
00:40 - class and subclasses for each type of
00:43 - artist
00:45 - musician
00:46 - choreographer
00:48 - and poet
00:49 - all artists have something they produce
00:52 - but each artist creates a different type
00:54 - of art
00:55 - for instance a musician writes song
00:57 - lyrics
00:58 - a poet writes poems
01:01 - and a choreographer writes instructions
01:03 - for dance moves
01:04 - each class has a create method but all
01:07 - have different versions of the create
01:09 - method
01:10 - what is the benefit of having different
01:12 - versions of the create method for each
01:14 - type of artist
01:16 - we could store any or all of these
01:18 - classes in one single array of type
01:20 - artist
01:21 - polymorphism allows for the create
01:23 - method for each type of artist to be
01:26 - called as each are accessed
01:28 - for example if we initialize an artist
01:30 - array with the following objects
01:35 - and call the create method on each of
01:37 - the artist objects in the array like so
01:43 - we would see this group of artists make
01:45 - a song a poem
01:47 - and a dance based on their versions of
01:49 - the create method
01:51 - polymorphism is beneficial because we
01:54 - can accomplish one action many different
01:56 - ways depending on the specifics of the
01:58 - object performing the action
