00:03 - welcome to computer science connections
00:05 - coding interactive maps this module
00:07 - makes connections between social studies
00:10 - and computer science specifically it can
00:12 - introduce reinforce or extend student
00:15 - learning related to geography if you're
00:18 - teaching about cardinal directions State
00:21 - history or just want to get your
00:23 - students coding you've come to the right
00:28 - place in the this module students will
00:31 - learn the basics of sprite lab a
00:33 - block-based coding platform the main
00:35 - computer science Concepts in this module
00:37 - are Sprites and events a Sprite is
00:41 - something you interact with like a
00:43 - character or an object in a scene each
00:46 - Sprite can have different properties
00:48 - like its
00:49 - costume size and
00:53 - location in coding there are cause and
00:55 - effect relationships we trigger with
00:57 - events an event is an act action that
01:00 - tells a specific chunk of code to run
01:03 - events allow us to change our programs
01:06 - in real time for example by assigning a
01:10 - spin right Behavior with a mouse click
01:12 - event we can command this hamburger to
01:16 - spin right when it's
01:24 - clicked there are four lessons in this
01:26 - module in lesson one students learn the
01:29 - basics of coding by adding a tour guide
01:31 - Sprite and landmark Sprites they'll
01:34 - learn how to set a sprite's location
01:36 - change its size assign it a behavior and
01:40 - use events to make their programs
01:42 - interactive notice the compass at the
01:44 - top of the play Space it's a special
01:47 - feature in this module whenever the user
01:50 - presses an arrow key the corresponding
01:53 - direction is
01:57 - highlighted the second lesson is an
01:59 - unplugged lesson each student will
02:01 - create a project plan to get ready to
02:03 - code their interactive
02:08 - map in lesson three students will code
02:11 - their interactive map according to the
02:13 - plan they made in the previous lesson
02:15 - they'll use the coding skills they
02:17 - learned in lesson
02:21 - one the final lesson is also unplugged
02:24 - students will have time to reflect on
02:27 - their process and present their project
02:29 - to their
02:34 - peers often students try to snap a green
02:37 - event block under the win run block but
02:40 - this won't work the event block stands
02:43 - on its own and any code added to it will
02:45 - run when the event is triggered
02:49 - encourage students to frequently test
02:51 - their code they will need to press run
02:53 - then use the play Space to trigger the
02:58 - events
03:00 - a student might encounter a bug if their
03:02 - Sprite costume selections are
03:04 - inconsistent have students double check
03:06 - that they have selected the correct
03:07 - costume to call the intended Sprite in
03:10 - this example the coder wants the Sprite
03:13 - with the girl costume to say this when
03:16 - she touches the star Sprite however the
03:19 - coder mistakenly assigned the chicken
03:21 - Sprite to say these words because there
03:24 - is no chicken Sprite nothing will happen
03:27 - to debug change the costume from the
03:30 - chicken to the girl in the event
03:36 - block the location pins can be
03:38 - challenging to navigate for some
03:40 - students model have to click on the pin
03:42 - in the coding block then go to the play
03:44 - space and click where you want your
03:46 - Sprite to be
03:52 - located in every lesson plan discussion
03:55 - questions are coupled with discussion
03:56 - goals check for understanding and
03:59 - promote student Reflection by
04:00 - incorporating these discussion questions
04:02 - into your
04:07 - teaching this module is aligned with the
04:10 - college career and Civic life framework
04:12 - and the computer science Teachers
04:14 - Association standards in order to align
04:17 - to the concepts you already teach to
04:20 - help you think of ways to integrate ask
04:22 - yourself how might this module support
04:24 - the content I'm already teaching and
04:26 - should I use this module to introduce re
04:29 - force or extend student learning on this
04:35 - topic don't forget about the hide and
04:37 - show feature for each lesson it's best
04:40 - practice to only show the lesson
04:41 - students are currently working on if you
04:44 - do not hide the following lessons
04:46 - students will be moved to the next
04:47 - lesson
04:50 - automatically students can personalize
04:52 - their maps in two ways they can draw a
04:55 - new costume or background using the
04:57 - pisol editor or they can use it
04:59 - animation upload feature this allows
05:02 - students to upload a picture or image
05:05 - that is saved to their
05:11 - computers before teaching the module
05:14 - complete each coding level on your own
05:16 - you can write your own code as an
05:18 - example for students make sure to review
05:21 - the lesson plans and additional
05:23 - resources code.org provides resources
05:25 - like slides student handouts and helpful
05:28 - hints to help you and your students get
