00:04 - You wouldn't even qualify for the race if
you don't have people that are proficient in
00:09 - computer science because of how much data
the cars collect and the necessity to be able
00:15 - to have people that can write programs to
figure out how you continue to figure out
00:20 - how to build performance. In these puzzles,
you'll be an artist that uses a pencil to
00:24 - draw different shapes. Wherever your artist
goes, it will draw a line behind you. To move
00:29 - around the canvas, you'll use the move forward
block. Here the move forward block says move
00:34 - forward by 100 pixels. When we hit run, what
happens? The artist moves forward a certain
00:41 - amount and that amount is 100 pixels. Pixels
are basically very tiny squares on your computer
00:47 - screen. The other block we have in this puzzle
says turn right by 90 degrees. And when we
00:55 - drag that out that makes our artist turn a
certain amount. So you can play around with
00:59 - how far you want the artist to turn. This
is a 90 degree turn. And this is a 120 degree
01:07 - turn. And remember, you can change these values
by clicking the arrows next to the numbers
01:12 - for pixels and degrees. Enjoy drawing with
your artist!
