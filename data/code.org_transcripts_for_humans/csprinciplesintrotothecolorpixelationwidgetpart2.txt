00:03 - so that's the basics of rgb color
00:07 - now of course you're asking how can i
00:09 - make more and different colors well
00:11 - the answer is that we must use more bits
00:14 - per pixel let's get rid of the image
00:16 - data we just created and then change the
00:18 - image to be 4 pixels by 4 pixels and 6
00:21 - bits per pixel
00:23 - now let's try to make a red pixel by
00:25 - turning on just the red light since i
00:27 - have 6 bits per pixel here that means
00:30 - that i have 2 bits to set each of the
00:32 - red green and blue light
00:35 - so that means the amount of red light is
00:37 - now a 2-bit setting instead of a single
00:39 - bit setting like the last time
00:42 - the largest 2-bit number i can make is
00:44 - one one
00:46 - so let me try that
00:47 - red on
00:48 - one one
00:50 - green off zero zero
00:53 - blue off zero zero hey look it's our old
00:56 - friend the red pixel
00:58 - now comes the fun part since the red
01:00 - light of the rgb value has four possible
01:04 - settings let's try each of them out and
01:06 - put the pixels next to each other to see
01:08 - the differences
01:10 - now let's add more pixels with different
01:12 - amounts of red
01:14 - we've got red at one one
01:16 - let's do the next one
01:18 - one zero for red then zeros for green
01:21 - and blue
01:23 - now how about zero one for red
01:27 - followed by zeros for green and blue
01:29 - and finally
01:31 - zero zero oh that's just black again
01:34 - makes sense
01:37 - so with a two bit setting for red it
01:39 - means i can set the brightness of the
01:41 - red light to 4 different levels which
01:43 - are different shades of red
01:45 - to make more colors you just continue to
01:48 - mix different intensities of red green
01:50 - and blue light
01:51 - why don't you try some color mixes 6
01:54 - bits per pixel can you make your
01:55 - favorite color

so that's the basics of rgb color now of course you're asking how can i make more and different colors well the answer is that we must use more bits per pixel let's get rid of the image data we just created and then change the image to be 4 pixels by 4 pixels and 6 bits per pixel now let's try to make a red pixel by turning on just the red light since i have 6 bits per pixel here that means that i have 2 bits to set each of the red green and blue light so that means the amount of red light is now a 2bit setting instead of a single bit setting like the last time the largest 2bit number i can make is one one so let me try that red on one one green off zero zero blue off zero zero hey look it's our old friend the red pixel now comes the fun part since the red light of the rgb value has four possible settings let's try each of them out and put the pixels next to each other to see the differences now let's add more pixels with different amounts of red we've got red at one one let's do the next one one zero for red then zeros for green and blue now how about zero one for red followed by zeros for green and blue and finally zero zero oh that's just black again makes sense so with a two bit setting for red it means i can set the brightness of the red light to 4 different levels which are different shades of red to make more colors you just continue to mix different intensities of red green and blue light why don't you try some color mixes 6 bits per pixel can you make your favorite color
