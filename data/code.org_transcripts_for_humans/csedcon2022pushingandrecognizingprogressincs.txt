00:00 - we're gonna break some new ground this
00:01 - morning so we have a two-part session
00:03 - for you first you will hear short
00:05 - pitches from some CS leaders on ideas to
00:09 - accelerate progress for Computer Science
00:12 - Education the movement and after that
00:14 - we'll celebrate some champions for K-12
00:16 - Computer Science Education
00:18 - so yesterday you heard a lot about the
00:22 - progress of the K-12 computer science
00:24 - movement
00:25 - as someone who's been at code.org for 10
00:27 - years I've been reflecting on this a lot
00:29 - lately I continue to be amazed that
00:33 - around each turn
00:35 - of the journey our community has taken
00:37 - and been on for this movement we've come
00:40 - together to do numerous things that many
00:42 - would have thought were impossible
00:47 - so reflect that as a community we've
00:50 - created hundreds of Champions at the
00:52 - highest levels
00:53 - of government industry and education
00:56 - with CEOs Governors even presidents
00:59 - writing lines of code with students and
01:02 - now we have 12 State Chiefs attending CS
01:05 - edcon
01:06 - we've prepared thousands of teachers
01:08 - with little to no background of in
01:10 - computer science that are now teaching
01:12 - hundreds of thousands of students
01:14 - we now have a global movement with
01:17 - numerous countries expanding instruction
01:19 - for computer science or policies to
01:22 - support our field
01:24 - and while there's much work that needs
01:26 - to do on this front we have greatly
01:27 - expanded access to and participation in
01:30 - computer science from underrepresented
01:33 - groups
01:34 - so my reflection on all this brings me
01:37 - back to where the K-12 CS movement began
01:42 - you might think it started with
01:43 - government
01:45 - or non-profits or the tech sector or
01:48 - policy makers or administrators where it
01:51 - really took off was with teachers
01:54 - I think about the story of Valerie
01:56 - Crawford she is a teacher here in
01:58 - Broward County and she started as an
02:01 - English language arts teacher in Middle
02:03 - School
02:04 - then she went to Summer professional
02:06 - development for our middle school
02:08 - computer science course
02:10 - the deal she had with her principal
02:13 - was that she would teach one section of
02:17 - computer science in five sections of ela
02:19 - by the time she started in the fall
02:22 - there was so much demand for computer
02:24 - science at our school that she was
02:26 - teaching five sections of ela I'm sorry
02:29 - computer science
02:31 - um I think she's a signing example of
02:33 - someone who now views computer science
02:36 - as her profession and not a side gig
02:40 - and she's not an exception in our field
02:44 - we've heard a lot about the top-down
02:46 - efforts for Computer Science Education
02:47 - from numerous CEOs or Governors or
02:50 - policy changes like graduation
02:52 - requirements it is exactly the right
02:54 - time for us to double down on these
02:56 - efforts
02:58 - because they will help expand
03:00 - instruction for Computer Science
03:02 - Education and we have helped build the
03:04 - capacity necessary to accelerate these
03:07 - movements but as we do these things as
03:09 - we're making this push the one idea I
03:12 - want to leave with you is Empower
03:14 - teachers to build the profession
03:17 - of Cs teaching
03:20 - cut teachers free to innovate in our
03:22 - field
03:23 - trust in them
03:25 - to bring the excitement and energy to
03:27 - K-12 computer science from their
03:30 - students
03:31 - let's think differently about what the
03:33 - K-12 computer science classroom can look
03:35 - like and what's the Cs teaching
03:37 - profession looks like
03:38 - here's some places I'll suggest as a
03:41 - start
03:42 - as the profession of computer science
03:44 - matures
03:46 - and the policy environment becomes more
03:48 - robust and deeper if you're a policy
03:50 - maker reflect on what we've done in
03:53 - other areas of education and the
03:55 - successes and mistakes and apply them to
03:57 - our field
03:59 - if you're a provider or somebody who's
04:01 - helping engage with teachers think about
04:04 - supporting teachers with more
04:06 - customization for tools in their
04:08 - classroom as they become more confident
04:11 - in teaching computer science
04:14 - think about modularity to enable
04:17 - flexible implementation to meet teachers
04:19 - where they are
04:20 - and where they will need to go in the
04:22 - future
04:24 - think about how empowering teachers can
04:27 - truly make CS a part of the core of our
04:30 - education system if you're an
04:32 - administrator think about how teachers
04:34 - can make computer science the one
04:36 - foundational piece of our system that we
04:39 - cannot do without
04:42 - so related to this idea
04:45 - progress on the idea of empowering
04:47 - teachers to build the profession of
04:49 - computer science has already started
04:51 - this summer
04:52 - the computer science Teachers
04:54 - Association one of the key Partners in
04:56 - our movement hosted 1700 teachers at
04:59 - their annual conference
05:01 - this was csta's largest conference ever
05:04 - and when they do virtual conferences
05:06 - they attract thousands of teachers
05:08 - Jake spoke yesterday about his
05:10 - excitement to welcome the world's
05:12 - largest computer science department and
05:14 - I think he's right to be excited I
05:16 - certainly am because the long-term
05:18 - success of accelerating the movement of
05:21 - Computer Science Education and
05:24 - continuing to make progress comes from
05:26 - truly empowering teachers to help build
05:28 - the world's largest education profession
05:32 - so thank you very much for a chance to
05:34 - share my thoughts with you
05:36 - and next up I'm going to introduce a old
05:40 - friend of mine an old colleague from
05:42 - Google who's a key partner of code.orgs
05:44 - and the Cs Community Karina box who's a
05:47 - head of Partnerships and ecosystems
05:49 - engagement lead for Google
05:51 - thanks Karina
05:57 - good morning everyone and thank you
05:59 - Cameron
06:01 - um all right
06:02 - so a thriving fair and vibrant future
06:06 - that we can all share in depends on
06:08 - young people having access to powerful
06:10 - learning opportunities and experiences
06:15 - since 2004 Google has invested over 240
06:19 - million dollars to bring Computer
06:20 - Science Education access to students
06:22 - particularly students from underserved
06:25 - communities
06:27 - we've done this through a combination of
06:29 - our own products and programs like CS
06:31 - first code next cssi and Grasshopper And
06:36 - investments in Partners like code.org
06:38 - the computer science Teachers
06:39 - Association scratch and esep
06:42 - as we saw in the opening keynote
06:44 - yesterday there are now schools like
06:46 - digital Pioneers Academy where every
06:49 - student receives CS instruction
06:51 - progress has been made
06:54 - but we still have a long way to go
06:57 - before all students have equal access to
07:00 - CS
07:01 - I'd like to challenge the audience to
07:03 - imagine a future where all kids are
07:06 - learning CS no matter their zip code or
07:09 - identity
07:10 - in this world before us can students
07:13 - continue to only learn the basics like
07:15 - HTML or css
07:18 - is this inspiring I think not
07:21 - I want us to get radical about what's
07:23 - taught in CS classrooms
07:27 - what if we looked to the Technologies of
07:29 - the future to determine what we teach
07:31 - today where should we start
07:34 - my software developer colleagues would
07:35 - tell you see us students today should be
07:38 - learning how to program AI or build
07:40 - machine learning models as these tools
07:42 - will set the foundation for future
07:44 - products
07:46 - in fact Google CEO Sandra pichai said on
07:49 - a BBC podcast last year I expect AI to
07:53 - play a foundational role pretty much
07:55 - across every aspect of Our Lives be it
07:58 - Healthcare be it education we be it how
08:01 - we manufacture things or how we consume
08:04 - information and so I view it as a
08:07 - profound enabling technology
08:11 - today terms like Ai and ml may seem like
08:14 - buzzwords
08:16 - but Ai and ml are already being used to
08:19 - help improve products we interact with
08:21 - daily and it's important that our
08:24 - students understand how they work as
08:27 - well as how to create them
08:29 - take YouTube for example
08:31 - more than 500 hours of content is
08:34 - uploaded to YouTube every minute
08:37 - machine learning helps us flag
08:39 - questionable content to reviewers this
08:42 - allows us to more quickly identify and
08:44 - remove spam or harmful content
08:46 - in the first quarter of this year more
08:49 - than 90 percent of the 3.8 million
08:51 - videos we removed were first flagged by
08:54 - an automated system making our platforms
08:57 - safer for users this would be impossible
09:00 - without machine learning
09:03 - another way we're using machine learning
09:05 - is in Google Translate Google Translate
09:07 - helps millions of people around the
09:09 - globe communicate with each other
09:11 - it listens to their speech and
09:14 - automatically translates it to another
09:16 - language the platform now supports over
09:18 - a hundred and thirty million or 130
09:21 - languages sorry and it learns them
09:23 - through machine learning in fact the
09:26 - technology is so Advanced that it can
09:28 - learn new languages without ever seeing
09:31 - an example translation
09:33 - foreign
09:34 - to teaching the Next Generation learning
09:37 - how to use and build this technology is
09:40 - not enough
09:41 - we also have to teach students how to do
09:44 - so responsibly
09:46 - the development of AI is creating new
09:48 - opportunities to improve lives around
09:51 - the world from business to health care
09:53 - to education it's also raising new
09:57 - questions about how we build fairness
09:59 - interpretability privacy and security
10:02 - into these systems
10:05 - this is why Google has publicly shared
10:07 - seven AI principles and published a
10:10 - guide on responsible AI practices which
10:13 - include practices like be socially
10:15 - beneficial and avoid creating or
10:17 - reinforcing unfair bias I encourage you
10:20 - to check them out
10:22 - so you may be thinking okay Karina this
10:25 - is a great aspiration but how can I get
10:28 - started today
10:31 - the great news is there are already
10:33 - courses available for you to use in
10:35 - classrooms at Google we have a
10:37 - foundational series of lessons called
10:39 - discover Ai and daily life which
10:41 - introduces students to artificial
10:43 - intelligence Concepts
10:45 - if your students are ready for something
10:46 - more advanced you can check out machine
10:49 - learning crash course which has 15 hours
10:51 - of interactive lessons and exercises
10:54 - and we're not just investing in our own
10:56 - programs we've also partnered with
10:58 - non-profits like the AI education
11:00 - project to help them bring their
11:02 - nine-week curricula introduction to
11:04 - artificial intelligence to more school
11:05 - districts
11:07 - let's work together to build schools
11:10 - where all kids can be the computer build
11:13 - this computer science skills they need
11:15 - to chart their path in our ever-evolving
11:17 - world
11:18 - thank you
11:20 - [Applause]
11:29 - uh next I'd like to welcome to the stage
11:31 - another uh key partner of code.orgs in
11:34 - the Cs Community General broadly Victor
11:36 - inoso who's Global Director of Education
11:39 - and philanthropy at Amazon thank you
11:41 - Cameron
11:42 - [Applause]
11:48 - so CS for all is a universal goal we all
11:52 - share everyone here in this room shares
11:55 - Universal goals appeal to our
11:58 - pluralistic ideals of equality
12:00 - but the challenge of universal goals
12:03 - is that there are no Universal Solutions
12:07 - or to put a finer point on it there are
12:10 - no Equitable Universal Solutions
12:13 - Universal public education does not give
12:16 - us access to Universal high quality
12:19 - education
12:21 - Universal covid vaccines testing and
12:24 - relief do not protect us equitably
12:28 - almost every attempt at Universal
12:31 - Solutions consciously or unconsciously
12:34 - propagates privilege and more often than
12:37 - not widens inequality
12:41 - almost
12:42 - so what so what should we do if we want
12:45 - to Center equity
12:48 - in our drive towards a universal good
12:52 - John Powell and his team at the Berkeley
12:55 - Center for institute for othering and
12:57 - belonging have shown that the Equitable
13:00 - path to a universal good is through what
13:03 - they call targeted universalism
13:07 - we've adopted targeted universalism in
13:09 - our work at Amazon future engineer
13:12 - targeted universalism means setting
13:15 - Universal goals pursued by targeted
13:18 - strategies and processes these
13:21 - strategies are targeted based upon how
13:25 - different groups are situated within
13:28 - structures culture and across
13:31 - geographies
13:33 - so while we simplistically say that our
13:36 - Target population our young people from
13:40 - underserved and historically
13:41 - underrepresented communities
13:44 - we cannot use the same approach for each
13:47 - of those communities
13:50 - tailoring strategies for each Community
13:52 - can seem counter-intuitive in an
13:55 - industry that is all about economies of
13:57 - scale
14:00 - so when we see in code.org's latest
14:04 - state of Cs report that only 20 percent
14:07 - of high schools on reservations offer
14:10 - any sort of foundational computer
14:13 - science coursework
14:15 - or when we see in the latest data that
14:18 - the number of college graduates in CS
14:20 - related fields that identify as native
14:23 - is a double-digit number
14:29 - we know
14:30 - that what has Advanced Computer Science
14:33 - Education for these last 10 years is not
14:36 - serving indigenous communities
14:40 - we've spent much of this year working
14:43 - with our indigenous partner the one
14:45 - generation fund or one gen
14:48 - to craft a targeted solution to this
14:50 - overlooked problem
14:52 - from conversations with indigenous
14:55 - Educators and youth we know that
14:58 - technology can be Central to overcoming
15:01 - the challenges facing indigenous
15:03 - communities from language revitalization
15:06 - to Economic Development
15:09 - and that indigenous students like
15:12 - students everywhere want to learn
15:15 - computer science
15:16 - and their families are asking that it be
15:19 - taught
15:22 - we also know that any effort to support
15:25 - indigenous education
15:27 - has to come
15:29 - from indigenous communities
15:33 - and that's why we're excited to announce
15:36 - a 2.25 million dollar commitment from
15:39 - Amazon future engineer to support the
15:42 - launch of indigitized computer science
15:46 - a new initiative in partnership with one
15:48 - gen that will engage 10 000 indigenous
15:51 - youth in computer science over the next
15:54 - two and a half years
16:03 - in digitize will support indigenous
16:06 - schools and school districts to build
16:08 - and launch culturally responsive
16:10 - computer science curriculum
16:12 - it'll create Partnerships to teach CS
16:15 - online and out of school
16:18 - and will support early stage approaches
16:21 - to indigenous CS education
16:23 - to seed Innovation and build momentum
16:27 - we are inspired by the Brilliance of
16:30 - indigenous youth
16:32 - from Corey Ashley who's here in the
16:34 - audience who created an app that helps
16:36 - Navajo youth understand their kinship
16:38 - relationships to Danielle Boyer who
16:41 - invented an interactive and wearable
16:43 - educational robot that can speak to
16:46 - youth in their native language
16:49 - we are also going to be working with one
16:52 - gen to build a coalition of indigenous
16:54 - researchers
16:55 - and indigenous-led research
16:58 - organizations like native pathways
17:01 - along with indigenous communities to
17:04 - conduct a culturally responsive study of
17:07 - the interest in an access to Computer
17:09 - Science Education among U.S Native
17:12 - American students there is
17:15 - precious little data in this area and so
17:18 - the results of this work will be
17:20 - invaluable
17:22 - we cannot wait to see what the next
17:26 - generation of indigenous youth create
17:28 - for their communities and for the world
17:31 - please join us
17:34 - thank you
17:42 - thank you Victor that was great uh next
17:44 - I'd like to uh welcome to stage and
17:46 - Andrea Russo whose field enablement lead
17:48 - for Microsoft Microsoft's been a key
17:50 - partner in the movement for computer
17:51 - science education for a number of years
17:53 - and for code.org welcome Andrea
18:01 - good morning everybody so I have to give
18:03 - a slightly cheesy computer science joke
18:05 - because you guys are my people and
18:07 - you'll get it so I'm a former classroom
18:09 - teacher and I had a struggling student
18:12 - and you know she was really working on
18:14 - this program and she asked one of her
18:17 - classmates hey can you give me your code
18:20 - because I'm really struggling and I need
18:22 - help and he's like no it's private and
18:26 - she's like but we're in the same class
18:28 - foreign
18:31 - I don't know um banana a more serious
18:34 - note you know we are currently in a
18:38 - changing world and today I'm here to
18:40 - talk to you about Microsoft's commitment
18:42 - to inclusive Computer Science Education
18:45 - so the reality is the world is changing
18:48 - we are continued to be confronted by
18:51 - Public Health crisis economic crisis
18:55 - social inequities and injustices and I'd
18:58 - be remiss if I don't mention the
19:00 - devastating impact on climate change
19:02 - that's happening on our communities
19:06 - rapid changes in technology is reshaping
19:09 - the way we live the way we work the way
19:11 - we learn
19:12 - and while technology is creating great
19:15 - opportunities
19:16 - and can solve society's biggest problems
19:19 - quite unfortunately it's also creating
19:22 - new challenges as well as new injustices
19:25 - within our communities
19:27 - it's critical that we apply Innovation
19:30 - and Technology while we are keeping the
19:34 - core values of education and inclusion
19:37 - embedded
19:40 - together we can reimagine a better
19:42 - future
19:43 - the fact is computer science is global
19:47 - we know that no person no community no
19:52 - individual can solve these problems
19:54 - alone
19:55 - and we need to face these complex
19:57 - challenges together
20:00 - and we need to Foster Partnerships and
20:02 - solutions that have lasting impact
20:04 - across these are our four connected
20:07 - areas within Corporate social
20:09 - responsibility at Microsoft that we're
20:10 - focused on my focus is really to think
20:13 - about how we can create
20:15 - Equitable Computer Science Education for
20:18 - all
20:19 - We Believe That Computer Science
20:21 - Education should be inclusive for every
20:23 - student regardless of their gender their
20:25 - class and their geography
20:27 - and the challenge that no one company
20:29 - can address is working across these
20:31 - sectors we need businesses we need
20:34 - educational institutions we need
20:36 - governments we need non-profits and we
20:39 - need organizations to ensure everyone
20:41 - can participate in the digital economy
20:45 - we need to support communities such as
20:47 - in Juarez Mexico in New Orleans in New
20:51 - York City and Atlanta Georgia in rural
20:54 - Kentucky so that they can have access we
20:57 - need to think about how our partners
20:59 - like code.org like csta like the
21:02 - computer CS for all like reboot how we
21:06 - can accelerate each other's work and
21:08 - amplify each other's work because we
21:10 - really are stronger together
21:12 - finally we need to support lasting
21:14 - systematic change
21:16 - um such as the work we're seeing with
21:19 - the increase at 53 so exciting
21:25 - one of the programs we do this is
21:27 - through our signature project which is
21:29 - the teals program so technology
21:31 - education and literacy support build
21:34 - teacher capacity by pairing industry
21:36 - professionals with classroom teachers
21:38 - in this photo you're going to see two
21:40 - students and a volunteer this is in
21:42 - Detroit Michigan at Henry Ford Academy
21:45 - now we are working with over 500 schools
21:50 - 650 classes
21:52 - 1600 volunteers from over 700 different
21:56 - companies it really is collective action
21:58 - that we are working together on this
22:01 - issue
22:02 - now as we are wrapping up I know and I
22:05 - want to acknowledge that the last few
22:08 - years has had many many obstacles for
22:11 - all of us to overcome
22:13 - I want to express my deepest gratitude
22:15 - for all of the classroom teachers
22:17 - administrators School staff government
22:20 - Representatives non-profits corporations
22:23 - and I'd say most importantly in this
22:26 - room computer science advocates
22:29 - to make computer science a reality for
22:32 - your students
22:34 - like we saw in Henry Ford Academy I hope
22:36 - that this wonderful experience
22:38 - throughout these last few days and again
22:41 - today is really going to open up
22:43 - communications for all of you
22:45 - um for those of you here in the United
22:47 - States uh the digital Equity act has
22:50 - created 2.5 billion dollars for
22:53 - infrastructure support I recommend
22:55 - looking into it there's uh connectivity
22:57 - there's devices there's training that's
22:59 - connected with those money
23:01 - um I would say let's put computer
23:03 - science education at the Forefront of

37:20 - share with us more information about the
37:21 - incredible work they're doing around
37:23 - rethinking education and ensuring
37:25 - children are still learning during a
37:27 - difficult time
37:28 - please join me in welcoming dimitro
37:34 - [Applause]
37:58 - yeah thank you so much for this Applause
38:02 - and for having me here today
38:05 - um
38:06 - I came from Ukraine
38:09 - um and I'm very glad to be here today uh
38:12 - I would be short I would like to let's
38:15 - say first to tell a story then to share
38:19 - some insights from the story and then
38:21 - ask for help
38:23 - so the story will be around Ukraine
38:26 - about Ukraine I'm sorry
38:28 - we have a beautiful country who is the
38:30 - sea mountains big cities small towns and
38:34 - more importantly more than four million
38:36 - school children in the country and for
38:38 - previous two years
38:40 - uh when during my work in the Ministry
38:42 - of Education we have very ambitious
38:45 - goals in digital transformation in our
38:47 - government one of the most important
38:49 - goal was to grow up and to strengthen
38:52 - our Tech sector it is very important for
38:55 - the country and for the experts and
38:56 - other things and so on so among other
38:59 - things we have started to reform our
39:01 - education in the field of the computer
39:03 - science at all levels from drafting new
39:06 - curriculum for schools to making more
39:09 - public-private partnership in a higher
39:11 - education investing in in digital
39:13 - infrastructure making lots of tissue
39:16 - trainings so a lot of things happen and
39:19 - then in February Everything Has Changed
39:21 - Russians invaded our country
39:24 - simultaneously from nine different
39:26 - directions you can imagine that it was
39:29 - not about the computer science anymore
39:31 - for us
39:32 - so millions of ukrainians fled Ukraine
39:36 - they became refugees and all other
39:37 - countries Millions became internally
39:40 - displaced inside the country
39:42 - and while I was like searching for some
39:46 - images to show you how the country looks
39:50 - like if you Google Ukraine right now in
39:52 - the Google Images you will see like most
39:54 - of the pictures will be maps of invasion
39:57 - or something something like about the
39:59 - war
40:01 - but still the for now the vast territory
40:03 - suffered from occupation and
40:07 - unfortunately during the last 200 days
40:09 - more than two and a half thousand of
40:13 - different educational institutions have
40:15 - been damaged and more than 200
40:18 - they are completely destroyed
40:20 - so for one and 1.5 million children for
40:25 - now in Ukraine the only option to learn
40:27 - is online and unfortunately I'm the one
40:30 - who is in charge of the of this
40:32 - yeah
40:34 - many schools have become temporary
40:36 - shelters in the western part of Ukraine
40:38 - so it is impossible also to learn there
40:40 - uh in in offline way
40:43 - but let's say five minutes is not enough
40:45 - for me to tell you even a small part of
40:48 - all the consequences and tragedies
40:50 - tragedies that we are facing but at the
40:53 - same time
40:54 - even in this Darkest Hours there are a
40:57 - lot of people I call them like people
40:59 - made from light or with bravery and
41:02 - dignity and each Ukrainian citizen have
41:05 - now some friends or acquaintance who can
41:07 - represent these qualities and values so
41:10 - even during the war we decided to start
41:13 - the school year and now are trying to do
41:15 - our best to educate children and provide
41:17 - support
41:18 - to people who need it
41:20 - so the inside I want to share with you
41:24 - is that there are two most important
41:26 - things that I have learned
41:28 - that can help you to succeed in any kind
41:32 - of Crisis two things are persistence and
41:35 - innovation
41:37 - we have made a decision not to stop our
41:39 - Transformations our reforms our projects
41:42 - but to accelerate them we have started
41:45 - to Pilot our new computer science
41:47 - curriculum in 50 schools say we decided
41:51 - during during the war choose these 50
41:53 - schools and there have already started
41:56 - with the help of many partners we have
41:58 - introduced online courses from Coursera
42:00 - addicts udemy other platforms to our
42:03 - universities and allow universities to
42:05 - give credits for any courses they wish
42:08 - we are we have built new tools for
42:10 - electronic assessments like for instance
42:13 - we have this assessments done
42:15 - simultaneously in 31 country during
42:18 - summer because of a lot of refugees all
42:21 - around the world
42:22 - it was one of the biggest projects that
42:25 - I have been involved into in my life
42:27 - uh and we asked many companies to donate
42:30 - tablets laptops for our teachers and
42:33 - learners
42:34 - and I would like to say that the first
42:35 - track of with the thousands of Google
42:38 - Chromebooks is right now coming to our
42:40 - borders while we're sitting here
42:43 - so the whole process of the continuing
42:47 - transformation is also important for
42:48 - teachers and managers in the field they
42:51 - can see that we are we still care and
42:54 - that our goals for better education
42:55 - remain the same
42:57 - during last two months we have launched
42:59 - a project called it generation it is
43:02 - about a it is an opportunity to learn
43:04 - computer science for adults in more than
43:07 - 20 different private schools
43:10 - funded by the government in a
43:11 - partnership with 80 companies and for
43:14 - less than 2 000 scholarships that we
43:16 - have we received applications from more
43:19 - than 50 000 citizens in just two weeks
43:21 - during the war
43:22 - because like software engineering is is
43:25 - the major field and the expert
43:27 - opportunity and it is independent from
43:29 - Logistics or physical obstacles that we
43:32 - are facing right now so this is the
43:34 - computer science is also about the
43:36 - resilience
43:37 - in the nearest Future with the help of
43:39 - sales children and organization we are
43:41 - going to translate quote our courses to
43:43 - Ukrainian
43:46 - so you all have enemies and obstacles I
43:49 - I'm sure but in a similar time I think
43:52 - that all of them could be tackled with
43:55 - innovative ideas and persistence
43:58 - finally I would like you to believe me
44:01 - when I say that the sound of ways of the
44:04 - ocean and the opportunity to hear it
44:06 - here it's not something that is granted
44:08 - for free and there are people in the
44:11 - world risking their lives for their kids
44:13 - to have such an opportunity and they
44:15 - truly believe that it is in the hands of
44:17 - everyone to help
44:19 - to support with all devices books school
44:22 - buses to help a child from a refugee
44:25 - family or simply donate despite the war
44:29 - it is still our plan to build
44:32 - a learning ecosystem an environment
44:34 - where each child has an access to
44:36 - Quality education and the possibility to
44:39 - get relevant digital skills
44:42 - in in school or University or vocational
44:44 - education
44:45 - we already did a lot but there is more
44:48 - to go ahead and I hope that
44:51 - Learning Community worldwide will help
44:53 - us to issue these goals thank you very
44:55 - much
44:56 - [Applause]

Cleaned transcript:

we're gonna break some new ground this morning so we have a twopart session for you first you will hear short pitches from some CS leaders on ideas to accelerate progress for Computer Science Education the movement and after that we'll celebrate some champions for K12 Computer Science Education so yesterday you heard a lot about the progress of the K12 computer science movement as someone who's been at code.org for 10 years I've been reflecting on this a lot lately I continue to be amazed that around each turn of the journey our community has taken and been on for this movement we've come together to do numerous things that many would have thought were impossible so reflect that as a community we've created hundreds of Champions at the highest levels of government industry and education with CEOs Governors even presidents writing lines of code with students and now we have 12 State Chiefs attending CS edcon we've prepared thousands of teachers with little to no background of in computer science that are now teaching hundreds of thousands of students we now have a global movement with numerous countries expanding instruction for computer science or policies to support our field and while there's much work that needs to do on this front we have greatly expanded access to and participation in computer science from underrepresented groups so my reflection on all this brings me back to where the K12 CS movement began you might think it started with government or nonprofits or the tech sector or policy makers or administrators where it really took off was with teachers I think about the story of Valerie Crawford she is a teacher here in Broward County and she started as an English language arts teacher in Middle School then she went to Summer professional development for our middle school computer science course the deal she had with her principal was that she would teach one section of computer science in five sections of ela by the time she started in the fall there was so much demand for computer science at our school that she was teaching five sections of ela I'm sorry computer science um I think she's a signing example of someone who now views computer science as her profession and not a side gig and she's not an exception in our field we've heard a lot about the topdown efforts for Computer Science Education from numerous CEOs or Governors or policy changes like graduation requirements it is exactly the right time for us to double down on these efforts because they will help expand instruction for Computer Science Education and we have helped build the capacity necessary to accelerate these movements but as we do these things as we're making this push the one idea I want to leave with you is Empower teachers to build the profession of Cs teaching cut teachers free to innovate in our field trust in them to bring the excitement and energy to K12 computer science from their students let's think differently about what the K12 computer science classroom can look like and what's the Cs teaching profession looks like here's some places I'll suggest as a start as the profession of computer science matures and the policy environment becomes more robust and deeper if you're a policy maker reflect on what we've done in other areas of education and the successes and mistakes and apply them to our field if you're a provider or somebody who's helping engage with teachers think about supporting teachers with more customization for tools in their classroom as they become more confident in teaching computer science think about modularity to enable flexible implementation to meet teachers where they are and where they will need to go in the future think about how empowering teachers can truly make CS a part of the core of our education system if you're an administrator think about how teachers can make computer science the one foundational piece of our system that we cannot do without so related to this idea progress on the idea of empowering teachers to build the profession of computer science has already started this summer the computer science Teachers Association one of the key Partners in our movement hosted 1700 teachers at their annual conference this was csta's largest conference ever and when they do virtual conferences they attract thousands of teachers Jake spoke yesterday about his excitement to welcome the world's largest computer science department and I think he's right to be excited I certainly am because the longterm success of accelerating the movement of Computer Science Education and continuing to make progress comes from truly empowering teachers to help build the world's largest education profession so thank you very much for a chance to share my thoughts with you and next up I'm going to introduce a old friend of mine an old colleague from Google who's a key partner of code.orgs and the Cs Community Karina box who's a head of Partnerships and ecosystems engagement lead for Google thanks Karina good morning everyone and thank you Cameron um all right so a thriving fair and vibrant future that we can all share in depends on young people having access to powerful learning opportunities and experiences since 2004 Google has invested over 240 million dollars to bring Computer Science Education access to students particularly students from underserved communities we've done this through a combination of our own products and programs like CS first code next cssi and Grasshopper And investments in Partners like code.org the computer science Teachers Association scratch and esep as we saw in the opening keynote yesterday there are now schools like digital Pioneers Academy where every student receives CS instruction progress has been made but we still have a long way to go before all students have equal access to CS I'd like to challenge the audience to imagine a future where all kids are learning CS no matter their zip code or identity in this world before us can students continue to only learn the basics like HTML or css is this inspiring I think not I want us to get radical about what's taught in CS classrooms what if we looked to the Technologies of the future to determine what we teach today where should we start my software developer colleagues would tell you see us students today should be learning how to program AI or build machine learning models as these tools will set the foundation for future products in fact Google CEO Sandra pichai said on a BBC podcast last year I expect AI to play a foundational role pretty much across every aspect of Our Lives be it Healthcare be it education we be it how we manufacture things or how we consume information and so I view it as a profound enabling technology today terms like Ai and ml may seem like buzzwords but Ai and ml are already being used to help improve products we interact with daily and it's important that our students understand how they work as well as how to create them take YouTube for example more than 500 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute machine learning helps us flag questionable content to reviewers this allows us to more quickly identify and remove spam or harmful content in the first quarter of this year more than 90 percent of the 3.8 million videos we removed were first flagged by an automated system making our platforms safer for users this would be impossible without machine learning another way we're using machine learning is in Google Translate Google Translate helps millions of people around the globe communicate with each other it listens to their speech and automatically translates it to another language the platform now supports over a hundred and thirty million or 130 languages sorry and it learns them through machine learning in fact the technology is so Advanced that it can learn new languages without ever seeing an example translation foreign to teaching the Next Generation learning how to use and build this technology is not enough we also have to teach students how to do so responsibly the development of AI is creating new opportunities to improve lives around the world from business to health care to education it's also raising new questions about how we build fairness interpretability privacy and security into these systems this is why Google has publicly shared seven AI principles and published a guide on responsible AI practices which include practices like be socially beneficial and avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias I encourage you to check them out so you may be thinking okay Karina this is a great aspiration but how can I get started today the great news is there are already courses available for you to use in classrooms at Google we have a foundational series of lessons called discover Ai and daily life which introduces students to artificial intelligence Concepts if your students are ready for something more advanced you can check out machine learning crash course which has 15 hours of interactive lessons and exercises and we're not just investing in our own programs we've also partnered with nonprofits like the AI education project to help them bring their nineweek curricula introduction to artificial intelligence to more school districts let's work together to build schools where all kids can be the computer build this computer science skills they need to chart their path in our everevolving world thank you uh next I'd like to welcome to the stage another uh key partner of code.orgs in the Cs Community General broadly Victor inoso who's Global Director of Education and philanthropy at Amazon thank you Cameron so CS for all is a universal goal we all share everyone here in this room shares Universal goals appeal to our pluralistic ideals of equality but the challenge of universal goals is that there are no Universal Solutions or to put a finer point on it there are no Equitable Universal Solutions Universal public education does not give us access to Universal high quality education Universal covid vaccines testing and relief do not protect us equitably almost every attempt at Universal Solutions consciously or unconsciously propagates privilege and more often than not widens inequality almost so what so what should we do if we want to Center equity in our drive towards a universal good John Powell and his team at the Berkeley Center for institute for othering and belonging have shown that the Equitable path to a universal good is through what they call targeted universalism we've adopted targeted universalism in our work at Amazon future engineer targeted universalism means setting Universal goals pursued by targeted strategies and processes these strategies are targeted based upon how different groups are situated within structures culture and across geographies so while we simplistically say that our Target population our young people from underserved and historically underrepresented communities we cannot use the same approach for each of those communities tailoring strategies for each Community can seem counterintuitive in an industry that is all about economies of scale so when we see in code.org's latest state of Cs report that only 20 percent of high schools on reservations offer any sort of foundational computer science coursework or when we see in the latest data that the number of college graduates in CS related fields that identify as native is a doubledigit number we know that what has Advanced Computer Science Education for these last 10 years is not serving indigenous communities we've spent much of this year working with our indigenous partner the one generation fund or one gen to craft a targeted solution to this overlooked problem from conversations with indigenous Educators and youth we know that technology can be Central to overcoming the challenges facing indigenous communities from language revitalization to Economic Development and that indigenous students like students everywhere want to learn computer science and their families are asking that it be taught we also know that any effort to support indigenous education has to come from indigenous communities and that's why we're excited to announce a 2.25 million dollar commitment from Amazon future engineer to support the launch of indigitized computer science a new initiative in partnership with one gen that will engage 10 000 indigenous youth in computer science over the next two and a half years in digitize will support indigenous schools and school districts to build and launch culturally responsive computer science curriculum it'll create Partnerships to teach CS online and out of school and will support early stage approaches to indigenous CS education to seed Innovation and build momentum we are inspired by the Brilliance of indigenous youth from Corey Ashley who's here in the audience who created an app that helps Navajo youth understand their kinship relationships to Danielle Boyer who invented an interactive and wearable educational robot that can speak to youth in their native language we are also going to be working with one gen to build a coalition of indigenous researchers and indigenousled research organizations like native pathways along with indigenous communities to conduct a culturally responsive study of the interest in an access to Computer Science Education among U.S Native American students there is precious little data in this area and so the results of this work will be invaluable we cannot wait to see what the next generation of indigenous youth create for their communities and for the world please join us thank you thank you Victor that was great uh next I'd like to uh welcome to stage and Andrea Russo whose field enablement lead for Microsoft Microsoft's been a key partner in the movement for computer science education for a number of years and for code.org welcome Andrea good morning everybody so I have to give a slightly cheesy computer science joke because you guys are my people and you'll get it so I'm a former classroom teacher and I had a struggling student and you know she was really working on this program and she asked one of her classmates hey can you give me your code because I'm really struggling and I need help and he's like no it's private and she's like but we're in the same class foreign I don't know um banana a more serious note you know we are currently in a changing world and today I'm here to talk to you about Microsoft's commitment to inclusive Computer Science Education so the reality is the world is changing we are continued to be confronted by Public Health crisis economic crisis social inequities and injustices and I'd be remiss if I don't mention the devastating impact on climate change that's happening on our communities rapid changes in technology is reshaping the way we live the way we work the way we learn and while technology is creating great opportunities and can solve society's biggest problems quite unfortunately it's also creating new challenges as well as new injustices within our communities it's critical that we apply Innovation and Technology while we are keeping the core values of education and inclusion embedded together we can reimagine a better future the fact is computer science is global we know that no person no community no individual can solve these problems alone and we need to face these complex challenges together and we need to Foster Partnerships and solutions that have lasting impact across these are our four connected areas within Corporate social responsibility at Microsoft that we're focused on my focus is really to think about how we can create Equitable Computer Science Education for all We Believe That Computer Science Education should be inclusive for every student regardless of their gender their class and their geography and the challenge that no one company can address is working across these sectors we need businesses we need educational institutions we need governments we need nonprofits and we need organizations to ensure everyone can participate in the digital economy we need to support communities such as in Juarez Mexico in New Orleans in New York City and Atlanta Georgia in rural Kentucky so that they can have access we need to think about how our partners like code.org like csta like the computer CS for all like reboot how we can accelerate each other's work and amplify each other's work because we really are stronger together finally we need to support lasting systematic change um such as the work we're seeing with the increase at 53 so exciting one of the programs we do this is through our signature project which is the teals program so technology education and literacy support build teacher capacity by pairing industry professionals with classroom teachers in this photo you're going to see two students and a volunteer this is in Detroit Michigan at Henry Ford Academy now we are working with over 500 schools 650 classes 1600 volunteers from over 700 different companies it really is collective action that we are working together on this issue now as we are wrapping up I know and I want to acknowledge that the last few years has had many many obstacles for all of us to overcome I want to express my deepest gratitude for all of the classroom teachers administrators School staff government Representatives nonprofits corporations and I'd say most importantly in this room computer science advocates to make computer science a reality for your students like we saw in Henry Ford Academy I hope that this wonderful experience throughout these last few days and again today is really going to open up communications for all of you um for those of you here in the United States uh the digital Equity act has created 2.5 billion dollars for infrastructure support I recommend looking into it there's uh connectivity there's devices there's training that's connected with those money um I would say let's put computer science education at the Forefront of digital Equity conversations and finally I would recommend that we broaden our reach of a CS Community engagements such as these recreate a robust ecosystem where we really can create um and Technology to help speak the common language together I know I'm over time but last two plugs um if you want to learn more about what Microsoft is doing please check out our corporate social responsibility page um you can fill out a contact form within our teals page come say hi to me my counterparts who are in the room Gustavo Kiki Adam from The make code team so thank you all so much for everything that you've done thank you to these great speakers for this morning now we're going to change gears a little bit uh and keeping with the communitybased theme for uh this morning we're going to recognize some champions of Computer Science Education so I'm going to Welcome to the stage Amber Davis who is not only a Floridian but director of our government Affairs at co.org so welcome up Amber foreign good morning everyone so happy to be here with you all today as Cameron said my name is Amber Mariano Davis director of state government Affairs here at code.org and on the advocacy team we are so excited to see the progress

honor International organizations with outstanding localization translation and proofreading efforts those receiving this award are edos Global program foreign on behalf of global Francesco lakia on behalf of programmer futuro and matcha sizwa of Nicolas Copernicus University in Toronto Poland foreign we wanted to take this special opportunity to recognize the Ministry of Education and science of Ukraine for undertaking the localization of computer science fundamentals into Ukrainian even during a time of War receiving this recognition is dimitro zagorodnia director general of the directorate of trans digital transformation we would also like to ask dimitro to share with us more information about the incredible work they're doing around rethinking education and ensuring children are still learning during a difficult time please join me in welcoming dimitro yeah thank you so much for this Applause and for having me here today um I came from Ukraine um and I'm very glad to be here today uh I would be short I would like to let's say first to tell a story then to share some insights from the story and then ask for help so the story will be around Ukraine about Ukraine I'm sorry we have a beautiful country who is the sea mountains big cities small towns and more importantly more than four million school children in the country and for previous two years uh when during my work in the Ministry of Education we have very ambitious goals in digital transformation in our government one of the most important goal was to grow up and to strengthen our Tech sector it is very important for the country and for the experts and other things and so on so among other things we have started to reform our education in the field of the computer science at all levels from drafting new curriculum for schools to making more publicprivate partnership in a higher education investing in in digital infrastructure making lots of tissue trainings so a lot of things happen and then in February Everything Has Changed Russians invaded our country simultaneously from nine different directions you can imagine that it was not about the computer science anymore for us so millions of ukrainians fled Ukraine they became refugees and all other countries Millions became internally displaced inside the country and while I was like searching for some images to show you how the country looks like if you Google Ukraine right now in the Google Images you will see like most of the pictures will be maps of invasion or something something like about the war but still the for now the vast territory suffered from occupation and unfortunately during the last 200 days more than two and a half thousand of different educational institutions have been damaged and more than 200 they are completely destroyed so for one and 1.5 million children for now in Ukraine the only option to learn is online and unfortunately I'm the one who is in charge of the of this yeah many schools have become temporary shelters in the western part of Ukraine so it is impossible also to learn there uh in in offline way but let's say five minutes is not enough for me to tell you even a small part of all the consequences and tragedies tragedies that we are facing but at the same time even in this Darkest Hours there are a lot of people I call them like people made from light or with bravery and dignity and each Ukrainian citizen have now some friends or acquaintance who can represent these qualities and values so even during the war we decided to start the school year and now are trying to do our best to educate children and provide support to people who need it so the inside I want to share with you is that there are two most important things that I have learned that can help you to succeed in any kind of Crisis two things are persistence and innovation we have made a decision not to stop our Transformations our reforms our projects but to accelerate them we have started to Pilot our new computer science curriculum in 50 schools say we decided during during the war choose these 50 schools and there have already started with the help of many partners we have introduced online courses from Coursera addicts udemy other platforms to our universities and allow universities to give credits for any courses they wish we are we have built new tools for electronic assessments like for instance we have this assessments done simultaneously in 31 country during summer because of a lot of refugees all around the world it was one of the biggest projects that I have been involved into in my life uh and we asked many companies to donate tablets laptops for our teachers and learners and I would like to say that the first track of with the thousands of Google Chromebooks is right now coming to our borders while we're sitting here so the whole process of the continuing transformation is also important for teachers and managers in the field they can see that we are we still care and that our goals for better education remain the same during last two months we have launched a project called it generation it is about a it is an opportunity to learn computer science for adults in more than 20 different private schools funded by the government in a partnership with 80 companies and for less than 2 000 scholarships that we have we received applications from more than 50 000 citizens in just two weeks during the war because like software engineering is is the major field and the expert opportunity and it is independent from Logistics or physical obstacles that we are facing right now so this is the computer science is also about the resilience in the nearest Future with the help of sales children and organization we are going to translate quote our courses to Ukrainian so you all have enemies and obstacles I I'm sure but in a similar time I think that all of them could be tackled with innovative ideas and persistence finally I would like you to believe me when I say that the sound of ways of the ocean and the opportunity to hear it here it's not something that is granted for free and there are people in the world risking their lives for their kids to have such an opportunity and they truly believe that it is in the hands of everyone to help to support with all devices books school buses to help a child from a refugee family or simply donate despite the war it is still our plan to build a learning ecosystem an environment where each child has an access to Quality education and the possibility to get relevant digital skills in in school or University or vocational education we already did a lot but there is more to go ahead and I hope that Learning Community worldwide will help us to issue these goals thank you very much
