00:02 - [Music]
00:07 - hi welcome to session five of the AI 101
00:10 - for teachers professional learning
00:12 - series now that we've made it to the end
00:14 - of the series you may be wondering so
00:17 - now what how can I bring what I have
00:20 - learned into my
00:21 - classroom in this session we will
00:24 - explore resources that you can use in
00:26 - your classroom tomorrow we will also
00:28 - discuss topics for ating new AI tools
00:31 - resources and curricula let's get
00:35 - [Music]
00:39 - started as we start thinking about
00:41 - bringing AI to the classroom it is
00:43 - essential to distinguish between
00:45 - teaching with AI and teaching about AI
00:48 - when we teach with AI we are using AI as
00:51 - a tool to enhance teaching and learning
00:54 - when we teach with AI we are often also
00:56 - teaching students how to use AI as a
00:58 - tool when we teach about AI we teach
01:01 - students what AI is and how it works as
01:05 - with any technology we want students to
01:07 - move Beyond simply consuming the
01:09 - technology we want students to have the
01:11 - knowledge they need to be creators and
01:13 - critical evaluators of the technology
01:16 - you might be thinking if I want to teach
01:18 - about AI how do I know what I should be
01:20 - teaching what do my students really need
01:23 - to know we are in the early stages of AI
01:27 - in education although Comprehensive High
01:29 - high quality curricula may not be
01:31 - plentiful at the moment it is available
01:34 - and new curriculum will become more
01:37 - widely available over time these are
01:39 - some things to consider When selecting
01:41 - the curricula you will use with your
01:43 - students does the curricula provide
01:46 - teacher supports like lesson plans and
01:48 - Student Activities is there a focus on
01:51 - what AI is and how it works will
01:54 - students have the opportunity to think
01:56 - critically about the societal impacts of
01:58 - AI in a field often surrounded by hype
02:02 - and misinformation the curriculum should
02:04 - strive to dispel common misconceptions
02:06 - about AI clarifying its limitations and
02:09 - demystifying the fears around it always
02:12 - remember that teaching AI is not solely
02:14 - about the technology itself but also
02:16 - about cultivating critical thinking and
02:18 - informed judgment in students regarding
02:21 - its applications and
02:23 - implications let's take a look at an
02:25 - example of curriculum designed to teach
02:27 - students about AI hi my name is Anita
02:30 - dbar laen I taught artificial
02:33 - intelligence and machine learning to
02:36 - high school students for the last two
02:38 - years from the how AI Works page you'll
02:41 - notice a series of videos that c.org has
02:43 - put together to clearly explain
02:45 - different components of artificial
02:47 - intelligence though these could be
02:49 - Standalone videos each is supported with
02:51 - a comprehensive lesson plan with various
02:54 - components designed to make a learning
02:56 - process streamlined and efficient these
02:58 - elements are organized to provide both
03:01 - Educators and students with a cohesive
03:03 - and engaging learning
03:06 - experience let's take a look at the
03:08 - first lesson as you slowly scroll
03:10 - through the lesson plan take note that
03:13 - each lesson comes fully equipped with a
03:15 - complete set of resources to Aid in
03:17 - teaching including slides and activity
03:20 - guides clearly stated objectives warm up
03:23 - activities and guided notes accompany
03:26 - each lesson in addition to high quality
03:28 - videos you also find helpful teaching
03:31 - tips to enhance your delivery and a list
03:34 - of additional resources for further
03:36 - exploration all of these elements are
03:39 - meticulously designed to provide a rich
03:41 - well-rounded educational
03:44 - experience take time to become familiar
03:46 - with the material as you navigate
03:48 - through the lesson as we dive deeper
03:50 - into the course material it's important
03:53 - to highlight that some lessons come with
03:55 - interactive and engaging widgets these
03:57 - aren't just eye-catching elements
03:59 - they're designed with a pedagogical
04:01 - Focus to help simplify complex AI
04:04 - Concepts and make them more accessible
04:06 - to students to give you hands-on
04:09 - experience let's jump into our first
04:11 - activity recognizing fish this exercise
04:15 - is designed to introduce students to the
04:17 - fundamentals of machine learning which
04:19 - is a subset of AI here we'll be training
04:22 - about distinguish between images of fish
04:25 - and those that are not fish allow me to
04:28 - demonstrate
04:30 - as you can see I'm providing input data
04:33 - to the bot by categorizing their images
04:36 - so how does the AI bot use this data
04:40 - essentially it takes the information we
04:42 - provided whether an image represent a
04:44 - fish or not and looks for patterns that
04:46 - it can use to identify a fish over time
04:50 - and with enough data the bot becomes
04:53 - increasingly accurate at identifying
04:55 - fish thereby giving us a simplified but
04:58 - impactful glimpse into how machine
05:00 - learning algorithms work based on the
05:03 - training provided the next step is to
05:05 - test the AI to see how well it is learn
05:07 - to identify fish this will involve
05:10 - presenting the bot with new unseen
05:12 - images and evaluating its ability to
05:15 - correctly categorize them as fish or not
05:18 - fish your students will be able to
05:21 - analyze the results of the training and
05:23 - how the opportunity to continue training
05:25 - the bot to increase the
05:28 - accuracy the second part of the lesson
05:30 - is a more open-ended as students explore
05:33 - their own ideas and feelings about the
05:35 - implications of labeling data let's
05:38 - check out another interactive lesson on
05:40 - how neuron networks work just as our
05:42 - brains have neurons connected by
05:44 - synapsis neuron networks have layers of
05:47 - mathematical neurons that process
05:49 - information and adapt based on patterns
05:52 - they find allowing them to make
05:53 - decisions or
05:55 - predictions in this lesson students
05:58 - watch a video introduce producing neuron
06:00 - networks and then experience a gget
06:02 - simulating a video recommender system
06:05 - that makes recommendations based on
06:07 - certain
06:08 - input once they understand how the
06:10 - widget Works they have the opportunity
06:13 - to customize a widget in this
06:15 - recommendation similar to how a newer
06:17 - Network can customize its
06:18 - recommendations on popular media sites
06:21 - they also examine how the
06:23 - recommendations they see are limited by
06:25 - the data that the network uses leading
06:28 - to a discussion on how they can gather
06:30 - more data to make sure diverse opinions
06:33 - are
06:34 - represented let's check out another
06:36 - engaging lesson that uses the unplugged
06:38 - activity in the computer vision lesson
06:41 - students start by observing and
06:43 - evaluating optical illusions after
06:45 - watching a video that explains how
06:47 - computer Vision Works and how computer
06:50 - process visual information they design
06:52 - and test algorithm that uses a network
06:55 - to decide what number is shown on a
06:57 - seven segment display
07:00 - we recognize that not every educational
07:02 - setting allows for extended periods of
07:04 - instructions for those who are pressed
07:07 - for time we offer a optimized
07:09 - alternative how AI Works in a day this
07:13 - is a condensed version of the course
07:15 - specifically tat for educators who have
07:18 - who only have a single day or precisely
07:20 - 65 minutes to dedicate to teaching AI
07:24 - this compact lesson ensures that the
07:26 - essential topics are covered efficiently
07:29 - without sacrificing educational
07:35 - impact throughout this professional
07:37 - learning series we have learned a lot
07:39 - about teaching with AI artificial
07:42 - intelligence has opened up extraordinary
07:44 - possibilities for revolutionizing
07:47 - Education changing how we approach
07:49 - teaching and learning it promises to
07:51 - deliver personalized adaptive learning
07:54 - experiences for students while providing
07:56 - Educators with tools to optimize their
07:58 - teaching strategies and reduce their
08:01 - workload like any tool generative AI
08:04 - tools have strengths and weaknesses one
08:07 - significant consideration for teachers
08:09 - is whether the generative AI tools meet
08:11 - the needs of their
08:13 - classrooms when considering which AI
08:16 - tool you will use you may want to
08:17 - consider the following was the tool
08:20 - designed to be used in an educational
08:23 - setting does the teacher have visibility
08:25 - into how students are interacting with
08:28 - the AI tool what guard rails are in
08:31 - place to ensure student safety let's
08:34 - take a look at a tool that is designed
08:36 - specifically for use in K12 education

13:21 - that's one of K Migo's Specialties once
13:23 - I select the co-create a rubric feature
13:27 - cono requests the objective for for the
13:29 - lesson and wants to know what I'm
13:30 - planning to grade if I know the standard
13:33 - I can include that as well my students
13:36 - are going to be writing a research paper
13:38 - for the science lesson that we just
13:40 - finished kigo will then ask me a series
13:43 - of questions throughout this process so
13:45 - that we're truly collaborating to
13:47 - co-create the perfect rubric that I
13:50 - want once I've answered all of K Migo's

16:11 - the tool promote active dialogue between
16:13 - you and your
16:16 - students let's take a look at an example
16:19 - of an AI assisted assessment tool for
16:21 - writing hi I'm Mandy Figaroa the product
16:24 - owner for the Criterion interactive
16:26 - prototype and I'll be giving you a
16:27 - walkthrough of our application
16:30 - this product provides examples of how AI
16:32 - can help but not replace teachers in the
16:34 - classroom by providing Time Savings and
16:36 - structure but it still relies on the
16:38 - teacher for Hands-On guidance and
16:40 - coaching for their students the
16:42 - Prototype is built around this user flow
16:44 - but we'll be focusing on the places
16:46 - where AI offers teachers and students
16:48 - the most benefit scoring and providing
16:50 - feedback on student
16:51 - writing to begin with the teacher
16:53 - creates the assignment and then the
16:55 - student will work on planning their
16:56 - essay and writing their first draft the
16:58 - main focus for the first draft is
17:00 - planning and executing on that plan the
17:02 - focus of the second draft is revising
17:04 - the essay to ensure it closely aligns
17:05 - with the standards of a specific genre
17:07 - in this case persuasive writing teachers
17:09 - will be able to review the AI generated
17:11 - provisional scores and feedback before
17:13 - the students begin revising their essays
17:15 - the focus of the third draft is editing
17:17 - the essay to improve spelling and
17:19 - grammatical correctness teachers will
17:21 - again be able to review the AI generated
17:23 - provisional scores and feedback before
17:25 - students begin on this phase teachers
17:27 - who tested the protot type liked the
17:29 - structure of the app to help them manage
17:30 - writing assignments in their classroom
17:33 - we'll start our demo with the setup and
17:34 - planning phase which will guide teachers
17:36 - and students through getting started and
17:38 - creating their first draft the first
17:40 - step is for teachers to create the
17:42 - assignment for their students in the
17:43 - teacher application we guide teachers
17:46 - step by step through the creation
17:47 - process they can choose the genre the
17:49 - student will be writing
17:52 - in the learning
17:54 - objectives the assignment will focus
17:57 - on
18:01 - and then they can choose which writing
18:02 - prompts will be available for the
18:04 - student to respond
18:07 - to we're switching to the student
18:09 - application now research shows students
18:12 - often struggle with how to plan their
18:14 - writing but the more time students spend
18:16 - planning their essay the more effective
18:18 - they are at writing and the higher
18:19 - quality their writing is so we scaffold
18:21 - them through the planning process
18:23 - students brainstorm main
18:25 - ideas prioritize their main ideas
18:41 - and generate supporting details related
18:43 - to each main idea using a validated
18:45 - instructional strategy after the student
18:48 - has completed the planning phase they
18:50 - can use that plan to write a first draft
18:53 - for example here the student is writing
18:55 - their first main idea paragraph and has
18:57 - access to to the main idea and
18:59 - supporting
19:01 - details that they generated during
19:04 - brainstorming after writing each
19:06 - paragraph students can request AI
19:08 - generated feedback from the system we
19:10 - use AI models to do analysis of their
19:12 - paragraph to identify how closely their
19:14 - paragraph aligns with the supporting
19:15 - details that they included in their plan
19:17 - and to identify if the paragraph is too
19:19 - long or too short and if the student is
19:21 - making good transitions between their
19:23 - supporting details as students are
19:25 - working on their first draft teachers
19:26 - may want to review the system generated
19:28 - feedback with them to help their student
19:31 - incorporate more of their main ideas and
19:32 - supporting details into their
19:35 - essay after the student has finished
19:37 - writing and adjusting all of their
19:39 - paragraphs then they can submit their
19:41 - first draft at this point the teacher
19:43 - will be able to review the essay and the
19:45 - AI generated scoring which brings us to
19:47 - the revision
19:48 - phase the next step is for teachers to
19:51 - use the teacher application to read the
19:53 - students essay that they've submitted
19:55 - and then review the AI generated scores
19:57 - that we we have given them based on the
20:00 - rubric the scoring is built around
20:02 - teachers have the opportunity to view
20:04 - the rubric at many points during this
20:06 - process and a planned future feature
20:08 - would allow teachers to customize the
20:10 - rubric to allow align with their state
20:12 - standards and classroom scoring
20:17 - policies once the teacher reviews all of
20:19 - the scores and overrides any that they
20:22 - disagree
20:27 - with
20:30 - then they are able to move on to the
20:32 - next step which is reviewing the
20:33 - revision
20:35 - tasks that we have generated for the
20:41 - student these are based on their rubric
20:43 - scores and give the student system
20:44 - generated feedback in the form of a
20:47 - praise a question and a suggestion to
20:50 - help them improve their rubric
20:55 - score the teacher has the opportunity to
20:57 - prioritize this
20:59 - feedback and they can
21:03 - edit or hide any feedback that they
21:06 - disagree
21:11 - with as well as creating additional
21:13 - feedback
21:15 - messages after teachers see how their
21:17 - students are scoring on the persuasive
21:18 - writing rubric they may decide to teach
21:20 - a lesson about how to identify and
21:21 - address an alternate position in an
21:23 - essay for example but they won't need to
21:25 - individually add that feedback message
21:27 - to each student essay who needs it the
21:29 - program has already done that for them
21:31 - once the teacher has finished reviewing
21:32 - the student's first draft they can send
21:34 - it back to the student to make changes
21:36 - based on the feedback they received
21:37 - after the student makes those changes
21:39 - they'll send the essay back to their
21:40 - teacher and the teacher will go through
21:42 - that same process except that instead of
21:44 - looking at the revision tasks to align
21:46 - with the genre the student is writing in
21:48 - they will be looking at editing tasks
21:49 - which are related to the punctuation
21:51 - capitalization usage and spelling of the
21:54 - essay once the teacher is able to see
21:56 - which grammar errors are most common
21:58 - they may decide to pull aside a small
21:59 - group or individual students for further
22:02 - instruction on specific types of
22:04 - errors after the teacher has reviewed
22:06 - the second draft of the essay the
22:08 - student will have the opportunity to
22:09 - work on it again to create their third
22:11 - draft in the student application at this
22:13 - point they can read their essay and
22:15 - choose which of the categories they'd
22:17 - like to work on capitalization usage
22:20 - punctuation or
22:22 - spelling we show them all of the errors
22:25 - our AI models have detected
22:29 - they can choose to make changes to their
22:31 - essay to resolve an error or dismiss any
22:33 - error they disagree with before
22:35 - submitting their
22:38 - essay at every step of the process
22:40 - teachers can reinforce their students
22:42 - critical thinking skills they are
22:43 - receiving AI generated feedback but is
22:45 - it accurate how should a student react
22:47 - if they disagree one of our Middle
22:49 - School teachers summed it up this way
22:51 - the AI can only go so far you're the
22:53 - critical thinker here I need you to
22:54 - decide is that the word you meant or
22:57 - like that's a s
22:59 - fragment once the student has submitted
23:01 - their final draft of the essay the
23:03 - teacher will be able to review it one
23:05 - last
23:06 - time in the teacher application teachers
23:09 - will be able to see the final AI
23:10 - generated scores and make any necessary
23:13 - adjustments before the students see
23:15 - their
23:17 - score as you can see there are many
23:19 - steps in this flow where teachers will
23:21 - get the benefit of AI scoring and
23:23 - feedback generation to help make the
23:24 - review process faster for a whole
23:26 - classroom of students the insights
23:28 - report is available to help teachers
23:31 - once the assignment is started and will
23:33 - help them track class progress and begin
23:36 - to see patterns of common problem areas
23:38 - for their
23:40 - students a middle school Ela teacher who
23:42 - tested our prototype summed it up this
23:44 - way I mean it can grade papers in
23:46 - minutes where it takes me two to three
23:48 - weeks right this will help free up time
23:50 - for teachers to spend more time coaching
23:52 - their students based on how their
23:53 - students are performing and that's where
23:55 - teachers shine thank you

26:06 - available let's learn more about one of
26:09 - these
26:10 - opportunities well at one point AI was
26:13 - in the distant future right well that
26:16 - future is now so as Educators we need to
26:20 - prepare our students to interact with AI
26:24 - in in safe thoughtful intelligent ways
26:27 - most of the time when people hear
26:29 - artificial intelligence especially a
26:30 - teacher you are a little intimidated so
26:33 - you're thinking I can't teach that I'm
26:36 - not that techsavvy I don't know that
26:38 - much about artificial intelligence but
26:40 - after going through the AI Explorations
26:42 - course I gained way more confidence even
26:45 - as I was going along the course so there
26:47 - were sometimes where there might have
26:48 - been a term or a concept that I was
26:50 - totally unfamiliar with but by the end
26:52 - of the lesson then I knew more so to
26:54 - become the learner first that is what
26:57 - really empowered me as an educator AI
26:59 - exploration provides a variety of free
27:02 - opportunities and resources from
27:04 - Educators from our online PD course to
27:08 - the Hands-On AI project guides to our
27:10 - webinar series and our pln community the
27:13 - AI Hands-On guide and the isty course
27:16 - that I took about artificial
27:17 - intelligence really gave me everything I
27:19 - needed to teach my fifth grade class
27:21 - about artificial intelligence I'm really
27:24 - inspired by the fact that they're able
27:25 - to grasp onto these Concepts and I've
27:27 - even had some students realize I could
27:29 - be that person to create something using
27:33 - artificial intelligence I think learning
27:35 - about AI is really fun AI impacts Our
27:39 - Lives cuz you use the Google search you
27:42 - use robots like Alexa and Siri and
27:46 - Google you use all sorts of things if I
27:49 - did create things in the future with AI
27:52 - I would make a robot that brings you
27:55 - snacks when you can just watch TV and
27:57 - stuff I really hope that students who
28:00 - experience this program most of all walk
28:03 - away feeling empowered feeling like
28:06 - artificial intelligence isn't just
28:07 - something that happens to them but it's
28:09 - something that they can control
28:11 - something that they can design something
28:13 - that they can influence something that
28:15 - they can bring their values
28:18 - to that brings us to the end of our
28:20 - journey together hopefully this Series
28:22 - has provided you with the knowledge and
28:24 - skills you need to start exploring and

Cleaned transcript:

hi welcome to session five of the AI 101 for teachers professional learning series now that we've made it to the end of the series you may be wondering so now what how can I bring what I have learned into my classroom in this session we will explore resources that you can use in your classroom tomorrow we will also discuss topics for ating new AI tools resources and curricula let's get started as we start thinking about bringing AI to the classroom it is essential to distinguish between teaching with AI and teaching about AI when we teach with AI we are using AI as a tool to enhance teaching and learning when we teach with AI we are often also teaching students how to use AI as a tool when we teach about AI we teach students what AI is and how it works as with any technology we want students to move Beyond simply consuming the technology we want students to have the knowledge they need to be creators and critical evaluators of the technology you might be thinking if I want to teach about AI how do I know what I should be teaching what do my students really need to know we are in the early stages of AI in education although Comprehensive High high quality curricula may not be plentiful at the moment it is available and new curriculum will become more widely available over time these are some things to consider When selecting the curricula you will use with your students does the curricula provide teacher supports like lesson plans and Student Activities is there a focus on what AI is and how it works will students have the opportunity to think critically about the societal impacts of AI in a field often surrounded by hype and misinformation the curriculum should strive to dispel common misconceptions about AI clarifying its limitations and demystifying the fears around it always remember that teaching AI is not solely about the technology itself but also about cultivating critical thinking and informed judgment in students regarding its applications and implications let's take a look at an example of curriculum designed to teach students about AI hi my name is Anita dbar laen I taught artificial intelligence and machine learning to high school students for the last two years from the how AI Works page you'll notice a series of videos that c.org has put together to clearly explain different components of artificial intelligence though these could be Standalone videos each is supported with a comprehensive lesson plan with various components designed to make a learning process streamlined and efficient these elements are organized to provide both Educators and students with a cohesive and engaging learning experience let's take a look at the first lesson as you slowly scroll through the lesson plan take note that each lesson comes fully equipped with a complete set of resources to Aid in teaching including slides and activity guides clearly stated objectives warm up activities and guided notes accompany each lesson in addition to high quality videos you also find helpful teaching tips to enhance your delivery and a list of additional resources for further exploration all of these elements are meticulously designed to provide a rich wellrounded educational experience take time to become familiar with the material as you navigate through the lesson as we dive deeper into the course material it's important to highlight that some lessons come with interactive and engaging widgets these aren't just eyecatching elements they're designed with a pedagogical Focus to help simplify complex AI Concepts and make them more accessible to students to give you handson experience let's jump into our first activity recognizing fish this exercise is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of machine learning which is a subset of AI here we'll be training about distinguish between images of fish and those that are not fish allow me to demonstrate as you can see I'm providing input data to the bot by categorizing their images so how does the AI bot use this data essentially it takes the information we provided whether an image represent a fish or not and looks for patterns that it can use to identify a fish over time and with enough data the bot becomes increasingly accurate at identifying fish thereby giving us a simplified but impactful glimpse into how machine learning algorithms work based on the training provided the next step is to test the AI to see how well it is learn to identify fish this will involve presenting the bot with new unseen images and evaluating its ability to correctly categorize them as fish or not fish your students will be able to analyze the results of the training and how the opportunity to continue training the bot to increase the accuracy the second part of the lesson is a more openended as students explore their own ideas and feelings about the implications of labeling data let's check out another interactive lesson on how neuron networks work just as our brains have neurons connected by synapsis neuron networks have layers of mathematical neurons that process information and adapt based on patterns they find allowing them to make decisions or predictions in this lesson students watch a video introduce producing neuron networks and then experience a gget simulating a video recommender system that makes recommendations based on certain input once they understand how the widget Works they have the opportunity to customize a widget in this recommendation similar to how a newer Network can customize its recommendations on popular media sites they also examine how the recommendations they see are limited by the data that the network uses leading to a discussion on how they can gather more data to make sure diverse opinions are represented let's check out another engaging lesson that uses the unplugged activity in the computer vision lesson students start by observing and evaluating optical illusions after watching a video that explains how computer Vision Works and how computer process visual information they design and test algorithm that uses a network to decide what number is shown on a seven segment display we recognize that not every educational setting allows for extended periods of instructions for those who are pressed for time we offer a optimized alternative how AI Works in a day this is a condensed version of the course specifically tat for educators who have who only have a single day or precisely 65 minutes to dedicate to teaching AI this compact lesson ensures that the essential topics are covered efficiently without sacrificing educational impact throughout this professional learning series we have learned a lot about teaching with AI artificial intelligence has opened up extraordinary possibilities for revolutionizing Education changing how we approach teaching and learning it promises to deliver personalized adaptive learning experiences for students while providing Educators with tools to optimize their teaching strategies and reduce their workload like any tool generative AI tools have strengths and weaknesses one significant consideration for teachers is whether the generative AI tools meet the needs of their classrooms when considering which AI tool you will use you may want to consider the following was the tool designed to be used in an educational setting does the teacher have visibility into how students are interacting with the AI tool what guard rails are in place to ensure student safety let's take a look at a tool that is designed specifically for use in K12 education greetings excellent Educators my name is Michelle with KH academy by now you've seen the tremendous benefits of using artificial intelligence to supplement your teaching in the classroom well I'm here to introduce you to cono KH Academy's AI driven teaching assistant and student tutor it's built on the latest Cutting Edge artificial intelligence it's it's supported by all of our trusted and standard aligned content and it's Guided by humans and classroom teachers like me here at Con Academy conmigo has many exciting features and activities this video will showcase some of the ways that cono can transform into the teaching assistant that you've always wanted features like the class snapshot it's like a thermometer for your students progress get realtime feedback from our reporting tools on where your students might need a little extra help and what they should be celebrated for are you teaching a subject that's new to you or something that may not be in your wheelhouse the refresh my knowledge feature will help you fill in your own gaps so you're ready to teach your students lastly with the cocreative rubric feature we can help you customize your rubric to go along with your style of teaching so you can keep your students engaged with goals that interest them kigo is already being used in classrooms and school leaders are already seeing the benefit it's just another teacher a a assistant that is going to try to help them succeed and that's what I love about it it's just a beautiful tool again teaching assistant tutor what more could we want in education so let's get right to the magic of kigo I'm going to go ahead and select the class snapshot button and then I'm going to let kigo know which class I'd like information on and with one click of the button kmo is going to give me a highlevel overview of my students performance ments the last 7 Days highlighting key areas such as recent activity course Mastery progress assignments and skill development kigo then gives me additional prompts which tell me which students I should celebrate what students I need to check on which students are 25% to their Mastery goal and kigo will also group my students for me based on their recommendations which is so helpful I love to celebrate my students so normally I select this first option right here here today I really think I need to check on which students need additional support kigo gives me a list of students I should check in on and suggest that I view my student skill report and it even provides me this link so it's super accessible thanks for giving me a heads up about Douglas could you help me draft a progress report that I can send to his family oh this is great oh wait I forgot Douglas's mom speaks Spanish could you please translate to Spanish oh this is wonderful wonderful wonderful integrating kigo class snapshot into my classroom routine definitely helps me support my students by providing me with data that I can use to help drive my instruction thanks so much kigo if you're like me you've moved around a grade or two or maybe you've been asked to sub for a subject that you're not exactly comfortable with maybe this is your first year in the classroom let's jump in and ask kigo to help us refresh our knowledge so the first thing I want to do is I'm going to select the refresh my knowledge button and cono needs a little bit more information so how about Romeo and Juliet ninth grade great once I've provided that information to kigo it gives me the option of do I want kigo to quiz me on the topic or would I like to learn through conversation learn through conversation please great um kigo gives me a quick overview of five major Concepts in the play how about a character analysis so kigo is going to ask me a question that I may have to answer for my students you know what no I cannot that's perfectly okay thank you kigo is so understanding and so kigo is going to break it down for me so I'm able to refresh my knowledge on Romeo and Juliet therefore I'm able to teach my students better thanks kigo now with all this we're going to want to make sure we assess where our students are with what they're being taught so we'll need some helpful rubrics to figure that out good thing that's one of K Migo's Specialties once I select the cocreate a rubric feature cono requests the objective for for the lesson and wants to know what I'm planning to grade if I know the standard I can include that as well my students are going to be writing a research paper for the science lesson that we just finished kigo will then ask me a series of questions throughout this process so that we're truly collaborating to cocreate the perfect rubric that I want once I've answered all of K Migo's questions the Magic Begins and cono creates a rubric that is detailed and specific so my students will know exactly what they're being graded on this is awesome thanks so much for saving me so much time kigo pretty cool right as you can see incorporating conmigo into your classroom is going to be a game changer kigo insights and suggestions will enhance classroom instruction and learning while saving you time and energy so you'll have more time to focus on what's important your students check out kigo for yourself at con academy.org or in our con Academy for Teacher social media groups full of teachers helping teachers just like you happy teaching in addition to serving as a personalized tutor helping students to learn new Concepts or is a teachers assistant that creates more time for teachers to engage directly with students there's also a lot of Promise in AI assisted assessment whether you've struggled with with towering stacks of papers to grade wanted to provide more nuanced feedback to your high achieving students or felt overwhelmed by the task of collecting classroom data these tools offer a timely solution they offer instant feedback tailored to each students unique Learning Journey more than just a grading Aid these tools serve as a valuable Ally in managing classroom data transforming often tedious tasks into efficient processes when s sting an AI powered tool to support assessment consider the following key features instant feedback does the tool provide opportunities for timely interventions allowing students to improve their skills based on constructive feedback personalized learning does the tool adjust to each student's performance allowing for selfpaced skill Mastery datadriven analytics does the tool provide insight into each student's progress are you able to identify Trends and spot areas of improvement to adjust teaching strategies accordingly promote active dialogue does the tool promote active dialogue between you and your students let's take a look at an example of an AI assisted assessment tool for writing hi I'm Mandy Figaroa the product owner for the Criterion interactive prototype and I'll be giving you a walkthrough of our application this product provides examples of how AI can help but not replace teachers in the classroom by providing Time Savings and structure but it still relies on the teacher for HandsOn guidance and coaching for their students the Prototype is built around this user flow but we'll be focusing on the places where AI offers teachers and students the most benefit scoring and providing feedback on student writing to begin with the teacher creates the assignment and then the student will work on planning their essay and writing their first draft the main focus for the first draft is planning and executing on that plan the focus of the second draft is revising the essay to ensure it closely aligns with the standards of a specific genre in this case persuasive writing teachers will be able to review the AI generated provisional scores and feedback before the students begin revising their essays the focus of the third draft is editing the essay to improve spelling and grammatical correctness teachers will again be able to review the AI generated provisional scores and feedback before students begin on this phase teachers who tested the protot type liked the structure of the app to help them manage writing assignments in their classroom we'll start our demo with the setup and planning phase which will guide teachers and students through getting started and creating their first draft the first step is for teachers to create the assignment for their students in the teacher application we guide teachers step by step through the creation process they can choose the genre the student will be writing in the learning objectives the assignment will focus on and then they can choose which writing prompts will be available for the student to respond to we're switching to the student application now research shows students often struggle with how to plan their writing but the more time students spend planning their essay the more effective they are at writing and the higher quality their writing is so we scaffold them through the planning process students brainstorm main ideas prioritize their main ideas and generate supporting details related to each main idea using a validated instructional strategy after the student has completed the planning phase they can use that plan to write a first draft for example here the student is writing their first main idea paragraph and has access to to the main idea and supporting details that they generated during brainstorming after writing each paragraph students can request AI generated feedback from the system we use AI models to do analysis of their paragraph to identify how closely their paragraph aligns with the supporting details that they included in their plan and to identify if the paragraph is too long or too short and if the student is making good transitions between their supporting details as students are working on their first draft teachers may want to review the system generated feedback with them to help their student incorporate more of their main ideas and supporting details into their essay after the student has finished writing and adjusting all of their paragraphs then they can submit their first draft at this point the teacher will be able to review the essay and the AI generated scoring which brings us to the revision phase the next step is for teachers to use the teacher application to read the students essay that they've submitted and then review the AI generated scores that we we have given them based on the rubric the scoring is built around teachers have the opportunity to view the rubric at many points during this process and a planned future feature would allow teachers to customize the rubric to allow align with their state standards and classroom scoring policies once the teacher reviews all of the scores and overrides any that they disagree with then they are able to move on to the next step which is reviewing the revision tasks that we have generated for the student these are based on their rubric scores and give the student system generated feedback in the form of a praise a question and a suggestion to help them improve their rubric score the teacher has the opportunity to prioritize this feedback and they can edit or hide any feedback that they disagree with as well as creating additional feedback messages after teachers see how their students are scoring on the persuasive writing rubric they may decide to teach a lesson about how to identify and address an alternate position in an essay for example but they won't need to individually add that feedback message to each student essay who needs it the program has already done that for them once the teacher has finished reviewing the student's first draft they can send it back to the student to make changes based on the feedback they received after the student makes those changes they'll send the essay back to their teacher and the teacher will go through that same process except that instead of looking at the revision tasks to align with the genre the student is writing in they will be looking at editing tasks which are related to the punctuation capitalization usage and spelling of the essay once the teacher is able to see which grammar errors are most common they may decide to pull aside a small group or individual students for further instruction on specific types of errors after the teacher has reviewed the second draft of the essay the student will have the opportunity to work on it again to create their third draft in the student application at this point they can read their essay and choose which of the categories they'd like to work on capitalization usage punctuation or spelling we show them all of the errors our AI models have detected they can choose to make changes to their essay to resolve an error or dismiss any error they disagree with before submitting their essay at every step of the process teachers can reinforce their students critical thinking skills they are receiving AI generated feedback but is it accurate how should a student react if they disagree one of our Middle School teachers summed it up this way the AI can only go so far you're the critical thinker here I need you to decide is that the word you meant or like that's a s fragment once the student has submitted their final draft of the essay the teacher will be able to review it one last time in the teacher application teachers will be able to see the final AI generated scores and make any necessary adjustments before the students see their score as you can see there are many steps in this flow where teachers will get the benefit of AI scoring and feedback generation to help make the review process faster for a whole classroom of students the insights report is available to help teachers once the assignment is started and will help them track class progress and begin to see patterns of common problem areas for their students a middle school Ela teacher who tested our prototype summed it up this way I mean it can grade papers in minutes where it takes me two to three weeks right this will help free up time for teachers to spend more time coaching their students based on how their students are performing and that's where teachers shine thank you as an educator ready to delve into the exciting world of artificial intelligence you're poised to add a valuable layer to your teaching experience learning about AI can initially be intimidating however effective AI education is significantly enhanced by an Educator's personal enthusiasm and dedication to Student Success joining us for this professional learning series was a great first step but your journey does not need to end here with ai's momentum and popularity continuing to increase more and more information is available online as you seek out professional development opportunities in artificial intelligence consider these four components for
