engineer at Google.
01:50 - I work on a team that works on a backend server
that stores profiles and contacts.
01:57 - In my job, we think a lot about how contacts
can be sent to other devices, such as your
02:04 - phone.
02:06 - Most people have a lot of contacts, you might
have say, 1000 contacts and we don't want
02:12 - to send all of those contacts at once to your
phone because it's too large of a message.
02:19 - Similar to the way the internet breaks large
messages down into packets, we use a concept
02:24 - called paging where we might only send your
phone 100 contacts at a time and let your
02:30 - phone respond to us and ask for the next 100.

the fact that it can impact the entire world.

02:48 - The first program I remember writing is something
that converted Celsius to Fahrenheit.
02:54 - I like programming because I like helping
people.
02:58 - I can write programs at Google that help people
all over the world and that's really mind-boggling

Cleaned transcript:

This lesson is all about the internet. The internet is a very busy place and similar to this busy road. Messages like cars are zooming along to get to their destinations. Messages move through the internet very quickly. Acting out how the internet works will help you understand what's happening when you use the internet. You'll learn how messages get from your computer to a favorite website or from a friend to an email inbox. Just like it's easier to navigate busy roads when you know the roads and can read the signs, traveling the internet is not so complicated when you know what goes on behind the scenes. Sending messages on the internet is a little bit like sending messages in the mail but with a few differences. I'm here at Google.com. The IP address for this website is this number. You can think of an IP address as your return address in the mail. Let's imagine that I want to send a message in the mail to someone in the office down the there. Do you see URL and the IP address on that door? I've written this message and hit send.
