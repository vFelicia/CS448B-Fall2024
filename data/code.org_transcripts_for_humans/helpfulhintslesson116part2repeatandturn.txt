00:00 - so you'll see here that i've started out
00:02 - the code by saying while there's path
00:04 - ahead move forward if you're at a flower
00:07 - get nectar this will help us get all the
00:10 - way to the end of this path
00:12 - but what do we need to do when we get to
00:14 - the end of the path and how do we keep
00:16 - going until we've gotten all of the
00:17 - flowers
00:19 - i'll give you a hint
00:21 - you'll need to repeat this as many times
00:24 - as there are sides in this shape
00:26 - and each time you get to the end of the
00:28 - path you'll need to turn left to
00:31 - continue moving
00:32 - i know you can figure it out happy
