03:57 - hello and welcome to code break my name
04:00 - is hakati there are tens of thousands of
04:02 - people joining us about a thousand folks
04:04 - on the zoom call and about ten thousand
04:06 - more on facebook live and youtube live
04:09 - together we're hoping to build the
04:10 - world's largest live interactive
04:12 - classroom with so many students at home
04:14 - my team at code.org invites families
04:16 - everywhere to join us for a weekly dose
04:18 - of inspiration community and computer
04:20 - science
04:21 - this is my daughter and sidekick sophia
04:23 - hello
04:24 - she's a budding computer scientist
04:27 - please spread the word and invite others
04:29 - to join us the larger the audience the
04:30 - bigger this classroom will be i'd like
04:32 - to invite our first special guest keegan
04:34 - michael key actor and producer you
04:37 - probably know him from playing with fire
04:39 - or as a hyena on the lion king whereas
04:41 - ducky from toy story 4. keegan are you
04:44 - there with us today i'm here honey good
04:46 - to see you hi sophia it's great to see
04:49 - you how are you doing where are you
04:50 - calling from calling from los angeles
04:53 - california
04:54 - and uh and oh it's a nice foggy day here
04:58 - and um
04:59 - ready to have some fun with you guys and
05:01 - how have you been spending your time
05:02 - during the last six weeks
05:04 - well well um uh elle my wife and i have
05:07 - been um we have been working we have uh
05:09 - television shows that we produce that
05:11 - are still going and and
05:14 - we are doing some other work with um
05:16 - audio stuff that you know it can be done
05:18 - while we're in um while we're in
05:20 - lockdown so we've been just trying to
05:22 - kind of maintain our lives here and uh
05:25 - and keep our projects going so it's
05:27 - great to be to be productive even though
05:29 - you're at home do you have any message
05:31 - for students who are basically home and
05:33 - you know with school closed a billion
05:35 - students around the world have not
05:36 - nowhere to study or know where to go do
05:38 - you have any masters to help them just
05:40 - kind of stay focused during their day
05:41 - and think about how to make the most out
05:42 - of this time
05:44 - yeah i think if you if if they have
05:46 - opportunities to talk to their friends
05:48 - they can
05:49 - even though we're not together we can
05:51 - still share ideas and we can share ideas
05:53 - with our friends and also i think now's
05:56 - a good time since since we're we're all
05:57 - to get probably together kids are
05:59 - probably together with their families
06:00 - with their parents that maybe there's
06:02 - something that they don't know
06:04 - that they might think their parent might
06:05 - be an expert on or ask just ask their
06:08 - parents questions about when they were
06:09 - young what they were interested in and
06:11 - then you can learn something new beyond
06:13 - even school even online school so i
06:16 - think that's one thing is just is
06:18 - staying as connected to each other as we
06:20 - can so that we so and so that i know
06:22 - it's not a normal situation but if you
06:24 - have the opportunity to uh learn
06:26 - something our parents are like a wealth
06:29 - of knowledge for us so sophia you know
06:32 - that right your dad's pretty interesting
06:33 - guy he's got some stuff going on right
06:35 - you can learn some stuff from him
06:38 - i'm learning from her
06:40 - and vice versa and vice versa yep so
06:43 - sophia is going to start us off with the
06:45 - uh the computer joke of the day with
06:46 - sophia she also has a little soundtrack
06:49 - because we're kind of low tech but she
06:50 - makes sounds on her iphone but sophia
06:53 - asked keegan your joke of the day okay
06:55 - keegan why can't you email a picture to
06:58 - a jedi

07:18 - it actually officially does forbid
07:20 - attachments it forbids attachments oh my
07:23 - gosh really we write our own jokes at
07:26 - code.org we're pretty excited i like it
07:31 - so we're gonna switch to gallery mode so
07:33 - everybody who's uh on the zoom call can
07:35 - see all the faces and we're gonna unmute
07:38 - everybody and so everybody can say hi
07:39 - and tell us all at one time

09:13 - olds and different levels of experience
09:15 - either beginner computer scientists or
09:17 - even some advanced students for those of
09:19 - you who are advanced we're going to get
09:21 - to advanced stuff later in the episode
09:23 - for those of you who are beginners

09:48 - lastly we're going to learn about web
09:50 - pages wow okay cool
09:52 - before we start i want to welcome some
09:54 - students to demo their creations from
09:56 - last week
09:57 - last week we we were with bill gates and
09:59 - challenged students to make their own
10:00 - virus simulation or to visualize chrono
10:03 - virus data and each week when you share
10:05 - your creations with us we'll invite the
10:07 - best ones on next week's episode so we
10:09 - have two folks we wanted to invite to
10:11 - join us can we unmute victoria
10:15 - victoria
10:16 - hi there i'm here buddy
10:18 - hi victoria and victoria you're a
10:20 - teacher is that right
10:21 - that is correct at coral ridge
10:23 - elementary in louisville kentucky
10:25 - louisville kentucky all right yes
10:28 - awesome and can you share with us and
10:30 - with with keegan what it is that you
10:31 - built after last week
10:34 - well um
10:35 - you all had made the simulation
10:38 - about
10:40 - um
10:41 - how the coronavirus spreads
10:43 - and i added the nurse
10:45 - who provides vaccines
10:48 - and it can help stop the coronavirus
10:50 - from going to the other characters
10:52 - once it gets a vaccine it no longer can
10:54 - get covet 19 and i'll also change the
10:57 - background to the subway
10:59 - um in order to honor new york because of
11:02 - how bad the chronovirus has spread there
11:05 - that's very sweet victoria all right i'm
11:07 - going to screen share so we can see
11:09 - victoria's modification of our app
11:12 - so
11:14 - this is going to load inside our app lab
11:17 - tool
11:19 - and as you described it you basically
11:21 - have the
11:23 - there's a virus that's going to be going
11:25 - around infecting folks
11:26 - there's the virus that's covered up by
11:28 - the nurse i guess uh
11:30 - you can't see them both
11:32 - oh there they go so the virus is going
11:33 - and infecting people and your nurse is
11:35 - going to go and try to vaccinate people
11:37 - you have to um
11:39 - i'm going to double click this
11:47 - she has to get to the purple ones or the
11:49 - green ones first before the virus can
11:52 - get to them
12:01 - do you have to move her over to them no
12:03 - she's wandering
12:05 - and you have actually a screen share
12:06 - this is what it should look like when it
12:08 - moves
12:15 - do they change colors as a period of
12:17 - time has gone on and they're no longer
12:19 - infected
12:20 - um when the nurse comes in contact with
12:24 - the purple or green monsters
12:27 - that is like administering the vaccine
12:29 - and they turn the teal blue they're
12:31 - perfectly protected
12:33 - see yes they turn teal blue and on their
12:35 - belly it says covid19 with a circle and
12:38 - a slash
12:39 - so that shows that that they are immune
12:42 - and so if they touch
12:43 - the pink monsters they don't get it
12:46 - anymore because they have the vaccine
12:48 - gotcha gotcha yeah all right can we also
12:51 - unmute rifky for a second
12:55 - rifky where are you calling us from
12:58 - i'm calling you from kuala lumpur
13:00 - malaysia
13:02 - kuala lumpur in malaysia what time is it
13:04 - over there it's
13:07 - already 1 11.
13:10 - it's 1 11 in the morning i can't believe
13:12 - your parents let you stay up that late i
13:14 - guess that is what it takes for the
13:16 - folks who are calling all the way from
13:18 - from that far east uh so i'm gonna
13:20 - screen share your app briefly
13:23 - uh
13:24 - so that you took the app that we made
13:26 - the tracks the sort of data the spread
13:28 - of the coronavirus to show the number of
13:30 - cases in malaysia is that right
13:32 - yes that is correct
13:35 - everybody who joined us last week you
13:37 - can modify the app that we sent you to
13:39 - bring in live data from any country or
13:41 - state and then you modified these
13:43 - buttons so what are these different
13:44 - buttons doing
13:46 - the support local stalls when you press
13:48 - it you will go to a web
13:56 - it takes me to this webpage to about how
13:58 - to support coronavirus
14:00 - how to support local stalls in kuala
14:04 - lumpur and then these other buttons give
14:06 - more updates about corona virus in kuala
14:09 - lumpur and malaysia and hospitals in
14:10 - malaysia
14:12 - yes
14:13 - that's wonderful
14:15 - that's amazing
14:18 - yeah keegan so every week we we
14:19 - basically have students we share about a
14:21 - little bit of code and something we
14:23 - create and we challenge students to to
14:24 - make their own things as well so let's
14:26 - get started with today's lesson we're
14:28 - going to learn about the internet and
14:30 - today's word of the day is going to be
14:32 - protocol
14:33 - a protocol is a set of rules that a
14:35 - computer can use to talk to another
14:37 - computer it's basically what controls
14:39 - how computers send messages to each
14:41 - other
14:42 - a few episodes ago we learned about how
14:44 - information on computers is stored with
14:46 - ones and zeros like how images can be
14:48 - stored in ones and zeros and now what
14:50 - we're going to show is how you can send
14:52 - image data over a connection the
14:55 - connection we have right now is a visual
14:57 - connection so we're going to use light
14:58 - for sending the information but you
15:00 - could use light or electricity or sound
15:03 - or radio waves sophia is going to use a
15:06 - light bulb she's got a flashlight here
15:08 - and when she turns it on
15:10 - that's be a one and when she turns it
15:13 - off
15:14 - that's gonna mean a zero so on means one
15:18 - off in zero
15:19 - and what we want each of you to do is to
15:21 - write down the message that she sends
15:23 - but it's gonna be a graphic message so i
15:26 - want you all to make a two by two grid
15:28 - on a piece of paper okay so if you've
15:30 - got a piece of paper whether you're on
15:31 - the zoom call or whether you're watching
15:33 - on youtube or facebook make a two by two
15:35 - grid
15:36 - and when you get the ones and zeroes
15:38 - from sofia
15:40 - she's going to send a message
15:41 - of ones and zeros and one means white as
15:44 - you learned earlier a few weeks ago and
15:46 - zero means black so a message like that
15:48 - is going to translate into this
15:50 - image which is just a small set of
15:52 - pixels and images
15:54 - uh so before we start is everybody ready
15:57 - with your two by two grids
15:59 - okay all right can everybody share their
16:02 - two by two grids show them up on the
16:03 - screen so we can see them
16:05 - yep
16:06 - i'm ready yep can you hold up your
16:09 - pieces of paper so we can see your grids
16:10 - everybody are we all good
16:14 - all right
16:15 - so sophia we're going to get started and
16:16 - sophia is going to send
16:18 - the first
16:20 - message sophie are you ready yes keegan
16:23 - are you ready i'm ready
16:25 - all right
16:26 - ready set
16:27 - go
16:30 - okay i think all right
16:35 - all right
16:36 - so sophia sent you her message for this
16:38 - 2x2 grid
16:40 - all right so
16:41 - let's switch to gallery view and see
16:43 - what folks saw what folks draw
16:47 - what did you all draw keegan what did
16:49 - what did you draw for us could we can we
16:52 - this is what i got
16:54 - that's what i got
16:56 - is that
16:57 - is that right
16:58 - is that what you sent us no
17:00 - no
17:01 - how did you get that
17:03 - this this is the first one
17:05 - that's not the first one that's that's a
17:07 - one
17:08 - let's see what other half that's the one
17:10 - and that's that's the zero
17:12 - let's see what it let's see the gallery
17:14 - and see what other students drew
17:19 - all right there's all sorts of different
17:20 - pictures
17:22 - all right sophia can you share with us
17:24 - what you actually wanted to send as a
17:26 - message
17:27 - so it was a
17:29 - black white white
17:31 - black
17:32 - all right ken's white white black
17:34 - somebody who got something different uh
17:37 - let's can can somebody who uh raise your
17:39 - hand if you want to explain why you
17:41 - didn't get the same answer we'd like to
17:42 - see from the audience if you could raise
17:44 - your hand
17:46 - and see who's interested
17:49 - physically
17:52 - um and let me pick somebody
17:55 - i'm gonna unmute you zineb where are you
17:57 - calling us from
17:59 - london
18:00 - london and let's show us what you got
18:04 - what did you draw
18:08 - right so black black white black white
18:11 - huh right yeah so why was it hard for
18:14 - you to to get the message that sofia
18:16 - sent
18:19 - she went really fast
18:21 - he went really fast and
18:24 - the other thing is you couldn't tell how
18:26 - many blacks were coming in a row or how
18:28 - many whites were coming in a row yeah
18:30 - right because she had the flashlight on
18:32 - and that was for two whites two ones in
18:35 - a row but there's no real way of
18:37 - figuring out how many ones there are how
18:39 - many zeros
18:55 - which means white and an on is one which
18:57 - means white all right so then if so in
19:00 - in the grid the first box would have
19:03 - been
19:05 - then on and then on
19:07 - and then off okay then on
19:10 - on and then off gotcha okay all right so
19:13 - what we're doing
19:15 - not like that yes i'm not writing zeros
19:18 - i'm filling in
19:19 - because one okay all right all right
19:21 - okay i think i got it i think i got it
19:24 - all right right
19:25 - so
19:26 - how's it going
19:27 - another time but what we're going to do
19:28 - is improve on our protocol because the
19:30 - reason that protocol was tough partly
19:32 - because i went too fast for zineb but
19:34 - the other reason is because it was hard
19:36 - to know how many ones or zeros i was
19:38 - sending or sophia was sending so what
19:40 - we're going to do is add a timer so i'm
19:42 - going to snap
19:44 - and each time i snap
19:46 - then look at sophia's flashlight
19:49 - at the time of the snap to see what it
19:50 - is that way you can
19:52 - see the different ones and zeros now to
19:54 - do this we're gonna make it a little bit
19:56 - harder so draw everybody can you draw a
19:58 - three by three grid now
20:00 - three by three oh like a tic tac okay
20:02 - gotcha yeah like a tic-tac-toe board and
20:04 - we're to send nine different ones and
20:06 - zeros okay there's going to be nine of
20:08 - them now okay each one is going to come
20:11 - with a snap and i want everybody in the
20:13 - audience not just on camera to do it so
20:16 - even if you're on youtube or facebook
20:18 - we're going to ask you to draw this and
20:19 - then at the end we're going to ask you
20:21 - via a poll to see if you got the right
20:23 - answer
20:25 - so sophie are you ready for this
20:27 - yes slow and steady and all right
20:30 - are you ready
20:31 - okay
20:32 - here we go all right there's gonna be
20:34 - nine different ones and zeros and with a
20:36 - snap to see if you get it on time ready
20:39 - set go
21:02 - all right i hope that wasn't too fast
21:04 - for zaneb or for any students and i hope
21:06 - the snaps made it easier to tell when
21:08 - there was ones and when there were zeros
21:10 - we're gonna do a poll for the entire
21:12 - audience on zoom there's about 1500
21:14 - students
21:15 - sophia's ones and zeros spent spelled
21:18 - out a letter on the grid uh so let's see
21:20 - a poll was that a letter t
21:22 - was it an x was it a d
21:25 - or a c
21:26 - we have students answering in to collect
21:28 - the various results
21:33 - so different students got different
21:34 - answers but i can already tell that
21:37 - the most students got the answer that
21:38 - sophia was sending
21:40 - okay
21:42 - um okay
21:43 - and i am going to do the thing honey i
21:46 - have two letters
21:47 - yeah let's see keegan what did you get
21:49 - what okay so i have two letters
21:55 - hi
21:56 - hi keegan so i think
21:58 - that was sort of
21:59 - re-gritified in some way
22:02 - i am not getting the hang of this here
22:03 - hold on a second i mean that's pretty
22:05 - good can we switch to gallery view and
22:07 - see what this other what the students on
22:09 - camera see what everybody else got here
22:11 - what did everybody else get
22:13 - all right different people a lot of you
22:15 - got the right letter there and can we
22:17 - show what the poll results showed from
22:19 - the students in the audience
22:21 - the poll results showed that most people
22:24 - 46 percent of you got the right answer
22:26 - and this indeed is the right this is
22:28 - what sophia was trying to do if we can
22:30 - switch back to put me on camera
22:32 - [Music]
22:35 - did any did anybody else be an h
22:38 - did anybody else get an h and an i
22:41 - did anybody get an agent and i i don't
22:43 - think so
22:45 - no okay just me oh just me okay all
22:48 - right i must have been seeing little
22:50 - uh sub snaps i was hearing some snaps
22:57 - so what you saw there is the zeros and
22:59 - ones sent by a flashlight is literally
23:01 - how information is sent on the internet
23:03 - whether it's on a light wave on a sent
23:05 - on glass or whether it's an electrical
23:08 - wave uh sent on a wire
23:10 - and on on the actual internet and in
23:12 - computers there's actually a clock
23:14 - matching my snaps to make the difference
23:16 - between when it's a zero or when it's a
23:18 - one so if there's multiple zeros
23:20 - in a row these are these are changing
23:22 - not once a second like me but literally
23:24 - billions of times a second really buyer
23:27 - goes on and off to send this information
23:30 - and a protocol as we learned is just
23:32 - like the rules we set that we set as you
23:35 - know an on means of one or the snap is
23:37 - how you know what's going on protocols
23:39 - are how on the internet this information
23:41 - is sent on how the computers know how to
23:43 - communicate
23:44 - amazing
23:45 - amazing that's pretty incredible it's
23:47 - literally what we did is how information
23:49 - is sent on the internet every little
23:50 - thing you get on the internet is sent
23:52 - in a similar kind of way
23:55 - we want to do something else
23:56 - since you're going to be our first
23:57 - special guest who's going to play a new
23:59 - thing with us called a lightning round
24:00 - of questions you got okay we have an app
24:03 - that we've made here and sophia is going
24:05 - to put 60 seconds on the clock and she's
24:07 - going to keep score to see how many
24:09 - questions you can get done in 60 seconds
24:11 - 60 seconds
24:13 - for our future guests the high score
24:15 - right now is a zero
24:16 - okay i think i can do better than that i
24:19 - hope by yes
24:20 - hopefully you can beat the high school
24:22 - beat zero all right sophia are you ready
24:24 - yes keegan are you ready i am ready all
24:27 - right go
24:28 - okay the last person you have not living
24:31 - with you
24:32 - say it again we'll see if i lost in the
24:34 - middle the last person you hugged not
24:37 - living with you not living you uh doug
24:39 - lyman
24:40 - next question
24:41 - as a kid what did you want to be when
24:43 - you grew up veterinarian
24:47 - what is a superhero power you wish you
24:49 - had
24:50 - i would love to be able to fly
24:53 - first thing you can do in the morning
24:56 - uh i drink a
24:58 - cup of earl grey tea
25:00 - 30 seconds
25:02 - strangest thing in your refrigerator uh
25:05 - strange thing refrigerator
25:06 - uh
25:07 - uh duck liver pate
25:11 - okay
25:12 - your favorite smell
25:14 - uh my favorite smell is my favorite
25:16 - smell is beef stroganoff the the i like
25:21 - wow what's the best advice you've ever
25:23 - gotten
25:35 - what's the best advice you've ever
25:36 - gotten
25:39 - say that again hottie we're out of time
25:41 - in the lightning round but what is the
25:42 - best advice you've ever gotten
25:44 - um
25:46 - the best advice i've ever gotten let me
25:48 - see
25:49 - what is the best advice i've ever gotten
25:51 - appreciate appreciate appreciate
25:55 - that's beautiful yeah
25:57 - well thank you keegan and do you have
25:58 - any final messages for our students who
26:00 - are all studying at home
26:02 - well just just
26:03 - keep on keep at it everybody and this is
26:05 - a wonderful wonderful skill and if you
26:08 - enjoy something you should do it because
26:10 - it might move you by the way
26:12 - yes of course
26:13 - six you beat the high school i beat the
26:16 - high score yeah
26:18 - yeah
26:19 - that's six
26:21 - um and also i want to tell all the kids
26:23 - to watch next week
26:25 - thank you so much and let's switch to
26:26 - gallery view and have all the students
26:28 - wave goodbye and thank you so much
26:30 - keegan for joining us thank you guys for
26:32 - part of your day with us
26:34 - okay take care bye-bye
26:37 - all right so we've learned today that
26:38 - protocols are what makes the internet
26:40 - work and we learned how to send messages
26:42 - back and forth with ones and zeroes uh
26:44 - and how those
26:45 - create rules for how to send messages
26:48 - now sophie and i are going to jump into
26:49 - code.org internet simulator for the next
26:52 - part of our episode which is going to
26:54 - teach us about internet addresses
26:57 - internet addresses
27:01 - and what we're going to do is we're
27:03 - going to use something inside code.org
27:05 - called the internet simulator i'm going
27:08 - to screen share this briefly
27:12 - so here we are in the internet simulator
27:15 - we have four people here in a room now
27:18 - imagine these are four computers
27:20 - all connected on the internet via wires
27:23 - everybody's connected to each other
27:25 - and we're gonna send messages to each
27:27 - other there's four people sophia hannah
27:30 - akira and darius darius is my my son
27:33 - hannah and kira help me with running
27:35 - code break and what we're going to do is
27:37 - we're sending messages to each other
27:38 - instead of with ones and zeros they're
27:40 - going to be with letters but it's very
27:42 - similar as to how the internet works and
27:44 - what i want to do is sofia if you could
27:46 - send messages to akira back and forth
27:48 - and darius and hannah if you could
27:49 - communicate with each other i want you
27:51 - each to ask each other what your
27:53 - birthday is
27:57 - so if you could send messages
27:59 - asking each other sophia to akira hannah
28:02 - and darius to each other
28:08 - so sophia is sending her answer
28:10 - [Music]
28:13 - all right so akira's asking from
28:16 - from sophia and darris and hannah sent
28:18 - their messages back and forth
28:20 - all right darius
28:22 - darius can you speak up are you there
28:24 - yes
28:26 - so so you were asking from hannah so
28:27 - what is hannah's birthday what did you
28:29 - learn
28:30 - um i have no idea because it doesn't say
28:32 - who any of the messages are from or who
28:35 - they're to
28:36 - it doesn't say who the messages are from
28:37 - or too so we know a bunch of these
28:39 - birthdays but not who they're from or to
28:43 - the other thing is everybody's seeing
28:44 - everybody's birthday you're not just
28:46 - seeing
28:47 - hannah's message uh and what could cause
28:49 - a problem with that if you know on the
28:50 - internet if things are all public
28:54 - well i mean if you're trying to send
28:55 - personal information that you don't want
28:57 - everyone to know
28:59 - then like everybody can see it which is
29:01 - obviously better exactly what most
29:03 - people don't realize is when you're on
29:05 - the internet every single thing that is
29:06 - sent back and forth is going on a series
29:08 - of wires that literally the entire world
29:10 - could tap into and see every single bit
29:13 - of it
29:14 - and the only way to protect that
29:15 - information is to encrypt it as we
29:17 - learned a few episodes to go with ashton
29:19 - kutcher if you're on a web page if you
29:21 - see this little lock here at the where
29:23 - you see my mouse pointing in the upper
29:25 - left that lock means that the
29:27 - information that's being sent back and
29:28 - forth is encrypted if there's not a lock
29:31 - there
29:32 - literally everything that's you're
29:33 - sending or receiving back can be seen by
29:36 - every single other person
29:37 - but now let's deal with how to fix the
29:39 - problem of you couldn't tell whose name
29:41 - was which what can we do if we do the
29:43 - same exact thing and you you four
29:44 - communicate with each other to make it
29:46 - more clear
29:48 - i mean you could put your name before
29:49 - the message and who you're sending it to
29:52 - all right so let's do that so let's do
29:54 - it again sophia to akira and back and
29:56 - forth and say to whom and from whom
29:59 - and we're inventing a new change to our
30:01 - protocol to include the address of who
30:02 - the message is from into
30:05 - the question well why don't you ask each
30:07 - other your favorite flavor of ice cream
30:12 - so to akira from sophia
30:14 - what is your favorite ice cream is that
30:16 - correct okay yeah and everybody's
30:19 - sending messages
30:20 - to sophia from akira what is your
30:22 - favorite ice cream
30:24 - from hannah to darius what is your
30:26 - favorite ice cream
30:36 - so sophia what is akira's favorite ice
30:38 - cream um she loves salted caramel
30:42 - and darius did you learn what hannah's
30:45 - favorite ice cream is yes mint chocolate
30:47 - chip mint chocolate chip so
30:50 - what we just did is basically we
30:52 - invented an addition to our protocol
30:53 - where we put the two address and the
30:55 - from address
30:56 - from so that everybody's message you can
30:58 - tell who it's coming from and who it's
31:00 - coming to and this is literally how
31:02 - things work on the internet just as we
31:04 - learned with the flashlights the
31:06 - messages are sent in ones and zeros but
31:08 - they need addresses for who they're
31:10 - going to and who they're coming from
31:12 - we used first names but that's not what
31:14 - we use on the internet because we aren't
31:15 - on a first name basis with every single
31:17 - computer on the internet but but in fact
31:20 - every computer on the internet has an
31:21 - address called an ip address
31:24 - and ip stands for internet protocol the
31:27 - internet protocol basically says how
31:29 - with ones and zeros computers talk with
31:32 - each other and every single device on
31:34 - the internet even if it's your phone has
31:37 - a unique
31:38 - 64-digit long address that is one long
31:41 - number that helps know who the message
31:43 - is coming from who it's coming to and so
31:46 - using ones and zeros every time you send
31:48 - a text message every time you receive a
31:50 - video on youtube whatever it is that
31:52 - you're doing on the internet these ones
31:54 - and zeros spell out the two address and
31:56 - the from address when you get an answer
31:57 - back from google
31:59 - google says
32:00 - sends a message from google to your
32:02 - computer's address to do that now i want
32:05 - to introduce someone who knows a lot
32:06 - about the internet protocol we're going
32:08 - to play a short video to introduce them
32:11 - so
32:12 - let's go to the video hopefully it's not
32:14 - laggy
32:15 - it probably might be
32:18 - i don't have any idea where the internet
32:19 - came from and it just doesn't matter
32:21 - they don't need to it's sort of like
32:23 - asking who invented the ballpoint pen or
32:25 - the flush toilet or you know the zipper
32:28 - these are all things we just use every
32:29 - day we don't even think about the fact
32:31 - that one day somebody invented them
32:33 - so the internet is just like that many
32:36 - many years ago in the early 1970s
32:39 - my partner bob khan and i began working
32:42 - on the design of what we now call the
32:44 - internet
32:45 - it
32:47 - all right vince are you there with us
32:52 - vince surf are you there yes i i am i
32:54 - had to unmute and it took a moment to do
32:56 - that thank you very much for inviting me
32:58 - to join the show and i certainly enjoyed
33:00 - the the preamble with keegan that was a
33:02 - lot of fun i tried to do uh the uh the
33:06 - examinations that sophia gave us and i
33:08 - have to tell you there's one thing
33:10 - missing from the protocol that you
33:12 - introduced the timing was extremely
33:14 - important but the other thing that
33:16 - wasn't clear to me since i wasn't around
33:18 - for earlier shows is in which order the
33:21 - bits were supposed to be placed in the
33:22 - matrix
33:25 - another yeah so if you don't get the
33:28 - order correct you won't be able to get
33:29 - the shape of the letter correctly
33:30 - fortunately i took left to right top to
33:33 - bottom
33:34 - as my assumption for putting the bits
33:37 - into the nine three by three array but i
33:40 - could have been wrong because you could
33:42 - have picked another convention so but
33:44 - the example of needing to make decisions
33:46 - like that and make it clear
33:48 - you know what the protocol is what the
33:51 - parameters are is absolutely essential
33:53 - to successful communication
33:55 - absolutely
33:56 - and by the way for folks who are joining
33:58 - us vince just recently recovered from
34:01 - the coronavirus we are so lucky to have
34:03 - him on this show and on this episode uh
34:06 - it's just incredible that that somebody
34:07 - who's had this much impact on the world
34:09 - around us uh is somebody who we almost
34:11 - lost thanks to this this virus that is
34:14 - affecting our entire world we're so
34:16 - lucky to have you with us
34:17 - if anybody has questions for events you
34:20 - can use code.org questions to submit
34:22 - them or if you're on facebook you can
34:24 - submit them in the comments
34:27 - what i
34:28 - what i'd like to suggest next is usually
34:31 - we run polls for the students
34:33 - for the students to basically answer
34:35 - questions as a trivia question but with
34:37 - you here vince we're going to do things
34:38 - a little differently we'd like to host a
34:40 - quiz show so everybody can play along
34:42 - and we're going to have you ask the
34:44 - questions of the audience and the
34:46 - audience is going to do this via polls
34:48 - and if they don't show up on your screen
34:50 - i can read out the questions and you can
34:52 - help answer them so let's go with the
34:53 - first question
34:55 - so the first question is why was the
34:56 - internet invented in the first place
35:00 - option a to make person-to-person
35:01 - computer chat possible
35:04 - b is to have a communication network
35:06 - that could survive a nuclear war
35:08 - and c is to play games with friends
35:11 - uh and we have about 1500 students
35:13 - answering this poll so we're going to
35:15 - wait until a lot of the answers come in
35:17 - half of them have already voted on their
35:19 - answers
35:20 - and there's lots of pretty unique
35:21 - different answers
35:24 - four percent
35:26 - people
35:28 - all right if we could show the answers
35:29 - on screen
35:31 - right so vince uh about 50 people said
35:34 - that it was sorry fifty percent said is
35:36 - to have a communication network that
35:38 - could survive a nuclear war
35:40 - forty five percent said to the
35:42 - person-to-person computer chat possible
35:44 - about four percent said it's to play
35:46 - games with friends so uh tell us why did
35:48 - you invent the internet with your team
35:50 - there
35:52 - well it wasn't exactly to build
35:54 - something that would survive a nuclear
35:56 - war and i'm not sure that even today's
35:58 - internet would survive but it was
36:00 - intended to provide a platform for the
36:02 - defense department the u.s defense
36:04 - department to build a command and
36:05 - control system and so uh to the extent
36:08 - that we sort of think of command and
36:10 - control and nuclear war is somehow being
36:12 - related uh the uh the second answer is
36:15 - probably an accurate initial answer but
36:18 - it lets us do all those other things
36:20 - that that you listed and a whole bunch
36:22 - of other things that you didn't list
36:24 - like what we're doing right this moment
36:26 - so the answer is it wasn't designed for
36:28 - a particular purpose it was designed as
36:30 - a platform to support all kinds of
36:33 - applications if you could just figure
36:35 - out how to program them
36:37 - and also a big difference about the
36:38 - design relative to previous
36:40 - communication networks is that it was
36:41 - fault tolerance so in the event of a war
36:44 - attack with things being wrong it could
36:46 - stay up
36:47 - did you ever dream that it would be used
36:49 - this way when you when you did this work
36:52 - yes because when you think about command
36:54 - or control it's all about interactions
36:56 - of you know people trying to cooperate
36:59 - and collaborate with each other and so
37:01 - that works in the civilian sector too
37:03 - when we've seen the internet grow in
37:05 - that way the its predecessor the arpanet
37:08 - was designed to share resources among
37:10 - computer science departments in the u.s
37:12 - they were doing research on artificial
37:14 - intelligence and so we saw electronic
37:17 - mail we saw distribution lists we saw
37:19 - remote access to computing we saw file
37:21 - transfers and then of course in the
37:23 - early 1990s tim berners-lee invented the
37:26 - world wide web which enabled people to
37:28 - share even more information in more
37:30 - elaborate ways and more conveniently to
37:33 - find that information so the honest
37:35 - answer is we tried to build a very
37:36 - general platform that could be adapted
37:39 - to a wide range of applications
37:42 - all right so let's do our next question
37:44 - question number two is the internet made
37:47 - of
37:47 - a copper wires b
37:50 - glass fiber
37:52 - c
37:53 - radio waves
37:54 - d
37:55 - satellites or e
37:57 - all of the above
38:03 - all right so half the audience has put
38:05 - in their poland their poll results uh
38:08 - we got about
38:10 - 75 voting
38:13 - all right if we could display the poll
38:14 - answers on screen uh so 75 percent said
38:18 - all of the above with the uh the rest of
38:20 - folks saying it's radio waves and
38:21 - satellites so vince what is the internet
38:24 - made of
38:25 - well it's not only is it made of all
38:27 - those communication media that you
38:29 - mentioned
38:30 - uh it's also made of free space lasers
38:32 - among other things but it's also a
38:35 - layered architecture and so in addition
38:37 - to the basic transport mechanisms uh the
38:40 - ones that you listed uh there are
38:42 - computers that have to be part of the
38:44 - network we call them routers and they
38:45 - are the things that move internet
38:47 - packets around and then on top of that
38:49 - are the computers that have all the
38:51 - applications running in them so the
38:53 - internet is made up of a hierarchy
38:56 - of uh of systems
38:58 - that uh perform all of its various
39:01 - functions in a layered fashion so
39:03 - there's a lot that goes into the
39:05 - internet and in the end it ends up in
39:07 - your house because many of us right this
39:09 - moment are at home using our laptops
39:11 - connected to radio based wi-fi which is
39:14 - connected probably the optical fiber
39:17 - into the backbone of the internet so
39:19 - it's made up of a whole lot of things in
39:21 - a hierarchy
39:22 - right but the physical layer is a mix of
39:24 - all those things we said and the
39:26 - internet protocol is what enables
39:28 - communication across all those things to
39:30 - work the same way whether it's light
39:32 - being traveled as on and off or ones and
39:34 - zeros or whether it's electricity on or
39:36 - off
39:37 - let's go to the next question so
39:39 - question number three
39:40 - what is the difference between the
39:42 - internet and the original phone system
39:45 - option a the phone system is for phone
39:47 - calls and the internet is for web pages
39:50 - option b the phone system connects
39:52 - phones together and the internet
39:53 - connects computers
39:55 - and option c
39:56 - the phone system uses direct
39:58 - person-to-person communications but on
40:00 - the internet everybody's information
40:02 - mixes together in packets all in the
40:04 - same connection
40:07 - this one seems a little bit harder for
40:09 - folks about half of everybody's students
40:11 - that have voted
40:14 - all right we're at 75 having answered
40:18 - all right let's share the results
40:21 - so
40:22 - almost 80 percent said option c that the
40:24 - inter the phone system uses direct
40:26 - connections the internet uses packets
40:28 - all on the same connection
40:30 - all right vince
40:32 - so so actually the third answer is
40:35 - probably the closest uh to accurate uh
40:38 - in the telephone system we use another
40:40 - expression that's called circuit
40:41 - switching which means we connect
40:44 - connections between each endpoint each
40:46 - telephone and we dedicate that circuit
40:48 - to that one phone call and only used by
40:50 - those two parties whereas uh in the
40:53 - internet the packets uh share the common
40:55 - communications traffic
40:58 - communications capacity so it's like the
41:00 - difference between dedicating a railroad
41:03 - track from los angeles to new york for
41:05 - one train
41:06 - versus having a highway or a freeway
41:09 - with dozens or hundreds of thousands of
41:11 - cars all sharing the common highway uh
41:14 - and moving wherever they need to go
41:16 - getting on and off as they have to which
41:18 - is what internet packets do
41:20 - there's another analogy that might be
41:22 - useful for some of your listeners to
41:24 - think about if you know anything about
41:26 - postcards
41:27 - then you know a lot about how the
41:29 - internet works because the postcard has
41:30 - a to address and a from address just
41:32 - like we experimented with just a few
41:34 - minutes ago to figure out how to send
41:36 - messages to each other
41:38 - and then it has a certain amount of
41:39 - content so the postcard is very much
41:42 - like an internet package it doesn't know
41:45 - how it's being carried the postcards
41:47 - don't know whether they went on a
41:48 - bicycle or a car or an airplane or a
41:50 - boat
41:51 - and the postcard also doesn't have any
41:53 - idea what you wrote on it
41:55 - and that's also true of internet packets
41:57 - they don't care how they were carried
41:58 - and they have no idea what you wrote on
42:00 - it the reason that's important is that
42:02 - we don't have to change the internet
42:04 - when we invent new applications
42:06 - because the applications are at the
42:08 - edges of the network in the computers
42:10 - like the ones that you and i are using
42:11 - right now they interpret the content of
42:14 - the packets as video or audio or email
42:18 - or a piece of a web page the network
42:21 - doesn't know and it doesn't care and the
42:23 - reason that's important is that if
42:24 - somebody invents a new application we
42:26 - don't have to change the network it just
42:28 - keeps moving packets around and so it's
42:31 - been a stable
42:32 - uh element of the internet's
42:34 - architecture for the last 45 years or so
42:38 - that it hasn't had to change very much
42:40 - except to grow in capacity but the basic
42:42 - protocol architecture has been stable
42:45 - it boggles my mind to think that for
42:47 - every second that you're talking that
42:50 - one second of video is transited into
42:52 - ones and zeros each of them put on a
42:55 - digital postcard split up into millions
42:57 - and millions of individual packets that
42:59 - are then sent on what is effectively
43:01 - like a highway system and those packets
43:03 - they don't come on a direct line to me
43:05 - they go each their individual different
43:06 - ways through different routers they come
43:08 - to my computer and then they're put back
43:10 - in order and then recreated back into
43:12 - the video literally billions of times a
43:14 - second
43:16 - and it's an architecture that was
43:17 - invented 45 years ago it's crazy um
43:20 - let's go to our last question who is in
43:22 - charge of the internet
43:24 - option a nobody
43:26 - option b the phone and cable companies
43:29 - option c google and facebook and these
43:32 - big websites and option d the government
43:37 - that'll be interesting
43:39 - yeah it'll be interesting to see what
43:40 - people think about this one
43:41 - [Music]
43:43 - so about 67 percent of voted
43:48 - 75 voted all right let's share the
43:50 - results
43:52 - all right so 60 say nobody's in charge
43:55 - almost 30 says the government is in
43:58 - charge and 15 say it's the phone
44:00 - companies or google and facebook so
44:02 - who's in charge
44:04 - well the real answer is we all are
44:07 - and we have but we don't have charge of
44:09 - everything we have charge of portions of
44:11 - network so the cable companies and the
44:13 - telephone companies have charge of some
44:15 - of the underlying physical networks that
44:17 - we run the packets on top of but
44:19 - companies like google and facebook and
44:21 - others have charge of their data centers
44:24 - uh and all of the computers that are
44:25 - part of that and the applications that
44:27 - they offer to the public you and i are
44:29 - in charge of our own networks at home uh
44:31 - where we have wi-fi we have dedicated
44:33 - connections into the public internet
44:36 - uh the government has something to say
44:38 - about this there are other organizations
44:40 - uh they may have regulations for example
44:43 - about
44:44 - the way in which the internet is used
44:45 - and what to do about people who abuse
44:47 - the internet and cause harm by means of
44:50 - abusing it uh there are one very special
44:53 - organization however called the internet
44:55 - corporation for assigned names and
44:57 - numbers otherwise known as icam its
44:59 - responsibility is to make sure the
45:01 - domain names like www.google
45:04 - and internet addresses which we just
45:06 - talked about a few minutes ago get
45:08 - assigned uniquely to the parties who
45:10 - need them so you don't want to have the
45:12 - same address assigned to two different
45:15 - people you don't want to have a domain
45:16 - name assigned to two different organs
45:18 - the same domain name assigned to two
45:20 - different organizations so there's
45:21 - uniqueness
45:22 - which is assured by the internet
45:24 - corporation for assigned names and
45:25 - numbers that's really the only
45:28 - centralized responsibility which is to
45:30 - assure uniqueness of those protocols and
45:32 - their parameters
45:34 - identifiers so so that's really the only
45:37 - place where there's any centralization
45:38 - everything else is fully distributed
45:41 - thanks so much
45:43 - um so for
45:44 - for anybody who's listened to this and
45:46 - has more questions about how does it
45:48 - actually work like how does a picture
45:49 - travel from my phone to my friend's
45:51 - phone or when i type in google into a
45:53 - web browser what happens how does it
45:55 - work
45:56 - we have a video series at code.org and
45:58 - we're going to email that to folks at
45:59 - the end of this episode and the video
46:01 - series includes vince and a whole bunch
46:03 - of other people who basically helped
46:05 - create the internet and we're going to
46:07 - send that to you all at the end of the
46:08 - episode um this is it for our quiz show
46:11 - vince but we have a question from the
46:12 - audience uh from rosemary candles in
46:15 - louisville kentucky
46:19 - is rose unmuted
46:22 - oh actually akira is going to introduce
46:24 - this question akira
46:26 - if we could introduce akira who's helps
46:28 - as producing code.org
46:31 - codebreak hi kira
46:33 - um yes so rose submitted this question
46:36 - on our questions forum but also on
46:38 - twitter and she said you gave such a
46:40 - powerful speech and you said that the
46:41 - internet is for everyone so how do you
46:43 - think we're doing specifically in
46:44 - america but if you have other cultural
46:47 - contexts applied to please do how do you
46:49 - think we're doing in america to make it
46:50 - accessible for everyone
46:52 - so what a great
46:54 - question it's hard to answer briefly but
46:56 - let me say first of all that we think
46:58 - about half of the world's population has
47:01 - some access to the internet sometimes
47:03 - it's just through the mobile phones
47:04 - which are getting better and faster over
47:06 - time sometimes it's through dedicated
47:08 - circuits fiber connections or coaxial
47:11 - cable
47:12 - but that's only about half the world's
47:14 - population so
47:15 - and by the way this is not country
47:19 - even in countries that are heavily
47:21 - invested in internet there are places
47:23 - that do not have access in the us for
47:25 - example our rural parts of the country
47:28 - are very rarely have very good quality
47:31 - internet access at all this is also true
47:34 - in other parts of the world as i'm sure
47:35 - you must know there are barriers to
47:38 - providing access to the internet some of
47:40 - them is physical facilities which we
47:43 - need to build out uh and that may get um
47:47 - let's i won't say fixed but a new avenue
47:50 - for connectivity is coming
47:52 - spacex a company run by elon musk is
47:55 - planning to launch satellites in orbit
47:58 - thousands of them so that the entire
48:00 - surface of the earth will be able to get
48:02 - access to the internet assuming the
48:04 - system works so that's one
48:06 - step in the direction of making sure
48:08 - people could get some access the second
48:10 - issue of course is cost how much does it
48:12 - cost to get onto the net how much does
48:14 - the equipment cost and how much does the
48:17 - service cost and driving cost out is
48:19 - very important in order to make the
48:22 - internet affordable and reliably
48:24 - accessible to people so they can take
48:26 - advantage of it and so there are no then
48:29 - there may be regulatory issues
48:30 - associated with who is allowed to offer
48:32 - internet service do you have to get a
48:34 - license or not is it a regulated service
48:37 - uh is there competition permitted or not
48:40 - and so those things also have to be
48:42 - taken into account and then there is a
48:43 - much more general question of internet
48:45 - governance which we don't have time to
48:46 - get into but you can just imagine with
48:49 - the system as pervasive as the internet
48:51 - has become and as powerful as the
48:53 - internet has become there are a lot of
48:55 - arguments over who should be in charge
48:58 - and what the rules of the use should be
49:00 - so there are lots of things that get in
49:02 - the way of providing internet access to
49:04 - everyone i'm committed to trying to get
49:06 - the rest of the world up on the internet
49:09 - if they want to be in a way that's
49:11 - affordable and reliable safe and
49:14 - secure thank you so much vince uh
49:18 - i had one last question i wanted to ask
49:19 - but really briefly because we're short
49:21 - on time uh you know you're known as the
49:23 - father of the internet but you aren't
49:24 - the only person who was involved can you
49:26 - give us for all the
49:28 - young women in the audience names of two
49:30 - or three folks who you'd think of as the
49:32 - mothers of the internet that they can
49:33 - then google uh to get inspiration about
49:35 - the the people who helped create this
49:37 - this resource that all of us around the
49:39 - world use
49:40 - well first of all that you showed a
49:42 - brief picture early on an introduction
49:44 - of my colleague robert khan and he and i
49:46 - did the original internet design way
49:48 - back in 1973 but it was based on top of
49:51 - work that was done in a predecessor
49:53 - network called the arpanet so that
49:55 - project was run for the american defense
49:57 - department by larry roberts the network
50:00 - working group that did the original uh
50:02 - arpanet protocols the ones that you were
50:04 - demonstrating for internet was done by
50:06 - stephen crocker who happens to be my
50:08 - best friend in high school and still my
50:10 - best friend uh 60 years later
50:13 - david clark john postel there are a just
50:16 - endless number of people who have
50:18 - contributed to the internet and continue
50:21 - to contribute today so the big message
50:23 - for the students out there is to realize
50:27 - that the internet is still ready to
50:29 - accept new ideas it's ready to adapt and
50:32 - evolve
50:33 - and you have the opportunity to invent
50:35 - new applications as long as you can
50:37 - figure out how to program them which is
50:38 - what code.org is all about
50:41 - and so software is an endless frontier
50:44 - the internet is a place where you can
50:45 - invent to your heart's content
50:48 - and perhaps create applications that the
50:50 - rest of the world can take advantage of
50:52 - so just go out there and do that
50:55 - well thank you so much vince uh let's
50:57 - switch to gallery view and give the
50:59 - audience a chance to say goodbye to
51:01 - vince and sophie is going to play you
51:03 - some applause
51:04 - thank you so much everybody goodbye
51:08 - well we learned basically about how the
51:10 - internet is how computing devices
51:12 - communicate whether it's from a laptop
51:14 - or a phone or a giant data center or an
51:16 - automobile even a watch all these
51:18 - devices communicate over the internet
51:20 - whether it's to send data text messages
51:22 - video chats snapchats tick tock really
51:25 - any sort of information but one of the
51:27 - most popular things the internet is used
51:28 - for is for browsing web pages so when
51:30 - you use google's chrome or microsoft's
51:33 - edge or internet explorer or safari on
51:36 - apple devices you're browsing web pages
51:38 - and this is what we're going to learn
51:39 - about next
51:41 - in the last segment of our episode which
51:43 - is about web pages
51:46 - all right uh
51:48 - are you ready sophia yes
51:50 - all right so for our final segment what
51:52 - we're going to do is we're going to go
51:53 - into code.org and use something called
51:55 - weblab a tool that helps us make simple
51:58 - websites uh and i'm going to screen
52:00 - share
52:01 - web lab right now and show it to you
52:05 - so here we are and uh this is inside
52:08 - code.org and basically we have two files
52:10 - here an html file and a css file and
52:13 - we're going to add these sofia is going
52:15 - to help me build a website about her
52:17 - cats so i'm gonna go first edit the html
52:20 - and html is the language that is sent
52:23 - instead of the ones and zeros we sent
52:24 - for sending images web pages on the
52:27 - internet are sent in html and you don't
52:29 - need to memorize how i do this right now
52:31 - we're gonna send you an email at the end
52:32 - of this uh to help you make your own so
52:34 - sophia what do you want me to put inside
52:36 - my web page um first let's have a title
52:39 - okay we're gonna put a title so that
52:41 - uses a header tag and the way you do
52:43 - headers is you put this little angle
52:44 - bracket and then an h1 and then a close
52:47 - of an angle angle bracket and that means
52:49 - it's a title or a header what do you
52:51 - want to say my cat sunshine my cat
52:55 - sunshine
52:57 - and now you have to close each tag to
52:59 - say that it's the end of the title which
53:01 - is an angle bracket and a slash and an
53:04 - h1 and by this language was invented by
53:06 - a guy named tim berners-lee who invented
53:08 - the world wide web and here we have our
53:10 - title my cat sunshine in our webpage uh
53:13 - what else would you like to put in there
53:15 - um let's put a photo of sunshine right
53:19 - the photo is done with an image tag
53:21 - which is an angle bracket img
53:24 - and instead of text we're gonna put the
53:25 - information about where the photo is so
53:27 - i'm going to say the source of the photo
53:29 - equals
53:30 - and i already uploaded a photo of sunny
53:32 - by clicking the add image button up here
53:34 - so it knows about sunny which is your
53:37 - cat's name
53:38 - and i'm going to say let's make it the
53:40 - width
53:40 - of the entire web page 100.
53:45 - so there's sunny
53:46 - my cat's sunshine and you know this
53:48 - width hundred goes from here to here but
53:50 - if i expand to see the whole web page
53:53 - it makes it a hundred percent of the
53:54 - page no matter what so i'm going to make
53:56 - this a little bit smaller to make it 50
53:59 - percent of the web page so it goes half
54:01 - half width on the web page and is there
54:04 - anything else you want to put in there
54:05 - let's add a paragraph about function all
54:07 - right we're going to add some text so
54:09 - we're going to use the paragraph tag
54:11 - which is just a p
54:13 - and what what do you want to put in our
54:14 - paragraph um this is my cat sunshine he
54:18 - is an orange polydactyl cat which means
54:21 - he has
54:22 - seven toes on the front pause instead of
54:25 - four
54:31 - oh you speak really fast all right i
54:34 - think i got that all
54:35 - uh but it the text hasn't showed up yet
54:38 - because i need to close my paragraph
54:40 - again with this close tag and as soon as
54:42 - i close it it shows up and now here's
54:45 - our very simple web page that we just
54:48 - made and when you see any web page on
54:50 - the internet like on google on facebook
54:52 - amazon microsoft anywhere it's being
54:55 - sent in this language called html but if
54:57 - you look here this doesn't look like
54:59 - most web pages because the font and text
55:01 - are just really simple we can add styles
55:04 - to to to make them more interesting so
55:06 - what what do you want to do to make them
55:08 - more interesting um let's change the
55:10 - title color you want to change the color
55:12 - all right let's change the color of the
55:13 - header
55:15 - so let's make another color let's make
55:17 - it a dark orange dark orange
55:21 - it's a dark orange
55:23 - and look the title is a different color
55:25 - do you want to change any of the fonts
55:27 - as well yes let's change it to
55:29 - um i'm going to change the font family
55:32 - what do you want the font
55:36 - all right my cat sunshine that already
55:38 - looks a little prettier do you want to
55:40 - change the phone to the paragraph text
55:41 - as well make it cursive
55:44 - we can change this
55:48 - and i have to put these semicolons to
55:50 - end these so here now it says this is my
55:53 - cat sunshine and again if you look at
55:55 - the whole web page these styles carry
55:58 - through
55:59 - and what's interesting about styles we
56:01 - didn't style the individual piece of
56:03 - text we said just change the style for
56:06 - headers or let's change the style for
56:07 - paragraphs so if i go back to my html
56:10 - page and if i add another header so let
56:13 - me say another header
56:16 - this is another
56:18 - header
56:19 - again i need to close this header tag
56:22 - you see it shows up in the orange
56:23 - applied to both of them
56:25 - and if i go back to the style sheet and
56:28 - i change this from orange to blue
56:31 - it changes all the headers all at the
56:33 - same time and that's why they call it a
56:35 - style sheet because you're not changing
56:38 - just the individual text
56:40 - i don't know why that didn't work i
56:42 - don't think you spelled it correctly
56:44 - either way so this is how web pages work
56:46 - and you can see the html here and the
56:48 - style sheet and the actual content on
56:50 - the right and anybody can use code.org
56:53 - to make these simple html pages and then
56:55 - to see the end result of how it works
56:58 - what we're going to do is we're actually
56:59 - going to send this out to you so that
57:00 - any of you can create
57:02 - your own and in fact if you're watching
57:04 - right now please make sure we have you
57:06 - on our mailing list for code break so if
57:09 - you haven't signed up already go to
57:11 - code.org
57:12 - break
57:13 - and enter your email address where it
57:14 - says to sign up if you do that then at
57:17 - the end of this episode we're going to
57:18 - email you a really fun set of activities
57:21 - that's going to include first of all the
57:23 - video series that you can watch about
57:25 - how the internet works that video series
57:27 - works even on a smartphone for students
57:29 - who don't have computers
57:30 - then you can learn if you're an older
57:32 - student you can learn how web lab works
57:34 - and to create your own html and then for
57:36 - the challenge we have two challenges one
57:39 - for younger students is to come up with
57:40 - a communication protocol
57:42 - to share information between your
57:44 - parents or with a brother and sister
57:46 - using a flashlight just like sophia did
57:48 - and if you're more advanced to build a
57:49 - simple website and when you're done
57:51 - creating stuff not only share it with
57:54 - your parents but if they have social
57:55 - media ask them to share it on social
57:58 - media with the hashtag codebreak and as
58:00 - we always do we're going to pick the
58:01 - best things that people share and invite
58:04 - them back on the show next week to join
58:06 - us with next week's special guest and
58:08 - speaking of for next week i'm excited to
58:10 - announce our special guest next week is
58:12 - going to be sal khan the founder of khan
58:15 - academy which is like code one of the
58:17 - most popular ways students learn online
58:20 - khan academy isn't about coding in
58:22 - computer science it's about math and
58:24 - science and all sorts of subjects
58:27 - social studies and all sorts of subjects
58:29 - that are taught in schools we're so
58:31 - excited to have sal khan join us next
58:32 - week and then finally if you're a parent

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to code break my name is hakati there are tens of thousands of people joining us about a thousand folks on the zoom call and about ten thousand more on facebook live and youtube live together we're hoping to build the world's largest live interactive classroom with so many students at home my team at code.org invites families everywhere to join us for a weekly dose of inspiration community and computer science this is my daughter and sidekick sophia hello she's a budding computer scientist please spread the word and invite others to join us the larger the audience the bigger this classroom will be i'd like to invite our first special guest keegan michael key actor and producer you probably know him from playing with fire or as a hyena on the lion king whereas ducky from toy story 4. keegan are you there with us today i'm here honey good to see you hi sophia it's great to see you how are you doing where are you calling from calling from los angeles california and uh and oh it's a nice foggy day here and um ready to have some fun with you guys and how have you been spending your time during the last six weeks well well um uh elle my wife and i have been um we have been working we have uh television shows that we produce that are still going and and we are doing some other work with um audio stuff that you know it can be done while we're in um while we're in lockdown so we've been just trying to kind of maintain our lives here and uh and keep our projects going so it's great to be to be productive even though you're at home do you have any message for students who are basically home and you know with school closed a billion students around the world have not nowhere to study or know where to go do you have any masters to help them just kind of stay focused during their day and think about how to make the most out of this time yeah i think if you if if they have opportunities to talk to their friends they can even though we're not together we can still share ideas and we can share ideas with our friends and also i think now's a good time since since we're we're all to get probably together kids are probably together with their families with their parents that maybe there's something that they don't know that they might think their parent might be an expert on or ask just ask their parents questions about when they were young what they were interested in and then you can learn something new beyond even school even online school so i think that's one thing is just is staying as connected to each other as we can so that we so and so that i know it's not a normal situation but if you have the opportunity to uh learn something our parents are like a wealth of knowledge for us so sophia you know that right your dad's pretty interesting guy he's got some stuff going on right you can learn some stuff from him i'm learning from her and vice versa and vice versa yep so sophia is going to start us off with the uh the computer joke of the day with sophia she also has a little soundtrack because we're kind of low tech but she makes sounds on her iphone but sophia asked keegan your joke of the day okay keegan why can't you email a picture to a jedi um gosh why can't i don't know sophia why can't you send is it send a picture yeah why can't you send a picture to a jedi email the jedi code for bid attachments it actually officially does forbid attachments it forbids attachments oh my gosh really we write our own jokes at code.org we're pretty excited i like it so we're gonna switch to gallery mode so everybody who's uh on the zoom call can see all the faces and we're gonna unmute everybody and so everybody can say hi and tell us all at one time all right uh thanks everybody and we're going to go back on youth there's a few dozen folks all on camera but i also want to share where everybody's calling in from on the zoom call when you were joining uh we added a little qr code so people could put their location on a map so oh wow here all over the world all over the world are there any spots that you see that surprise you that you didn't expect to see people calling in from um i was not expecting to see someone calling in from wherever northern wherever they are in northern russia is that siberia where is that i feel like whoever's calling in there is shivering um it's very cool that is amazing oh and iceland rake somebody's calling from reykjavik what's this here what's that little number three in the north pacific ocean is that hawaii that's hawaii let's go up to hawaii yeah it's i think 7am in hawaii and it's well after midnight wherever oh and look right in here somebody's going from eritrea or ethiopia right there in eastern africa i like that yep i was not necessarily expecting to sit and then and then there's uh there's an uh a green is that person irish no and they're not irish and you know how you get to be green on our map all right uh also just to give you a sense of who the audience is we have folks uh joining on multiple different areas but they range from all ages from six year olds all the way to 60 year olds and different levels of experience either beginner computer scientists or even some advanced students for those of you who are advanced we're going to get to advanced stuff later in the episode for those of you who are beginners please stick with us even if things go too quickly for you you'll you should be able to keep up okay i'm going to try to keep up i'm a beginner i'm going to try to keep up all right we have four parts that we're gonna be talking about today part one we're gonna be learning about the internet part one we're gonna learn about protocols then we're gonna learn about internet addresses and then we're gonna have the vint surf quiz show with the inventor of the internet and then lastly we're going to learn about web pages wow okay cool before we start i want to welcome some students to demo their creations from last week last week we we were with bill gates and challenged students to make their own virus simulation or to visualize chrono virus data and each week when you share your creations with us we'll invite the best ones on next week's episode so we have two folks we wanted to invite to join us can we unmute victoria victoria hi there i'm here buddy hi victoria and victoria you're a teacher is that right that is correct at coral ridge elementary in louisville kentucky louisville kentucky all right yes awesome and can you share with us and with with keegan what it is that you built after last week well um you all had made the simulation about um how the coronavirus spreads and i added the nurse who provides vaccines and it can help stop the coronavirus from going to the other characters once it gets a vaccine it no longer can get covet 19 and i'll also change the background to the subway um in order to honor new york because of how bad the chronovirus has spread there that's very sweet victoria all right i'm going to screen share so we can see victoria's modification of our app so this is going to load inside our app lab tool and as you described it you basically have the there's a virus that's going to be going around infecting folks there's the virus that's covered up by the nurse i guess uh you can't see them both oh there they go so the virus is going and infecting people and your nurse is going to go and try to vaccinate people you have to um i'm going to double click this she has to get to the purple ones or the green ones first before the virus can get to them do you have to move her over to them no she's wandering and you have actually a screen share this is what it should look like when it moves do they change colors as a period of time has gone on and they're no longer infected um when the nurse comes in contact with the purple or green monsters that is like administering the vaccine and they turn the teal blue they're perfectly protected see yes they turn teal blue and on their belly it says covid19 with a circle and a slash so that shows that that they are immune and so if they touch the pink monsters they don't get it anymore because they have the vaccine gotcha gotcha yeah all right can we also unmute rifky for a second rifky where are you calling us from i'm calling you from kuala lumpur malaysia kuala lumpur in malaysia what time is it over there it's already 1 11. it's 1 11 in the morning i can't believe your parents let you stay up that late i guess that is what it takes for the folks who are calling all the way from from that far east uh so i'm gonna screen share your app briefly uh so that you took the app that we made the tracks the sort of data the spread of the coronavirus to show the number of cases in malaysia is that right yes that is correct everybody who joined us last week you can modify the app that we sent you to bring in live data from any country or state and then you modified these buttons so what are these different buttons doing the support local stalls when you press it you will go to a web it takes me to this webpage to about how to support coronavirus how to support local stalls in kuala lumpur and then these other buttons give more updates about corona virus in kuala lumpur and malaysia and hospitals in malaysia yes that's wonderful that's amazing yeah keegan so every week we we basically have students we share about a little bit of code and something we create and we challenge students to to make their own things as well so let's get started with today's lesson we're going to learn about the internet and today's word of the day is going to be protocol a protocol is a set of rules that a computer can use to talk to another computer it's basically what controls how computers send messages to each other a few episodes ago we learned about how information on computers is stored with ones and zeros like how images can be stored in ones and zeros and now what we're going to show is how you can send image data over a connection the connection we have right now is a visual connection so we're going to use light for sending the information but you could use light or electricity or sound or radio waves sophia is going to use a light bulb she's got a flashlight here and when she turns it on that's be a one and when she turns it off that's gonna mean a zero so on means one off in zero and what we want each of you to do is to write down the message that she sends but it's gonna be a graphic message so i want you all to make a two by two grid on a piece of paper okay so if you've got a piece of paper whether you're on the zoom call or whether you're watching on youtube or facebook make a two by two grid and when you get the ones and zeroes from sofia she's going to send a message of ones and zeros and one means white as you learned earlier a few weeks ago and zero means black so a message like that is going to translate into this image which is just a small set of pixels and images uh so before we start is everybody ready with your two by two grids okay all right can everybody share their two by two grids show them up on the screen so we can see them yep i'm ready yep can you hold up your pieces of paper so we can see your grids everybody are we all good all right so sophia we're going to get started and sophia is going to send the first message sophie are you ready yes keegan are you ready i'm ready all right ready set go okay i think all right all right so sophia sent you her message for this 2x2 grid all right so let's switch to gallery view and see what folks saw what folks draw what did you all draw keegan what did what did you draw for us could we can we this is what i got that's what i got is that is that right is that what you sent us no no how did you get that this this is the first one that's not the first one that's that's a one let's see what other half that's the one and that's that's the zero let's see what it let's see the gallery and see what other students drew all right there's all sorts of different pictures all right sophia can you share with us what you actually wanted to send as a message so it was a black white white black all right ken's white white black somebody who got something different uh let's can can somebody who uh raise your hand if you want to explain why you didn't get the same answer we'd like to see from the audience if you could raise your hand and see who's interested physically um and let me pick somebody i'm gonna unmute you zineb where are you calling us from london london and let's show us what you got what did you draw right so black black white black white huh right yeah so why was it hard for you to to get the message that sofia sent she went really fast he went really fast and the other thing is you couldn't tell how many blacks were coming in a row or how many whites were coming in a row yeah right because she had the flashlight on and that was for two whites two ones in a row but there's no real way of figuring out how many ones there are how many zeros which means white and an on is one which means white all right so then if so in in the grid the first box would have been then on and then on and then off okay then on on and then off gotcha okay all right so what we're doing not like that yes i'm not writing zeros i'm filling in because one okay all right all right okay i think i got it i think i got it all right right so how's it going another time but what we're going to do is improve on our protocol because the reason that protocol was tough partly because i went too fast for zineb but the other reason is because it was hard to know how many ones or zeros i was sending or sophia was sending so what we're going to do is add a timer so i'm going to snap and each time i snap then look at sophia's flashlight at the time of the snap to see what it is that way you can see the different ones and zeros now to do this we're gonna make it a little bit harder so draw everybody can you draw a three by three grid now three by three oh like a tic tac okay gotcha yeah like a tictactoe board and we're to send nine different ones and zeros okay there's going to be nine of them now okay each one is going to come with a snap and i want everybody in the audience not just on camera to do it so even if you're on youtube or facebook we're going to ask you to draw this and then at the end we're going to ask you via a poll to see if you got the right answer so sophie are you ready for this yes slow and steady and all right are you ready okay here we go all right there's gonna be nine different ones and zeros and with a snap to see if you get it on time ready set go all right i hope that wasn't too fast for zaneb or for any students and i hope the snaps made it easier to tell when there was ones and when there were zeros we're gonna do a poll for the entire audience on zoom there's about 1500 students sophia's ones and zeros spent spelled out a letter on the grid uh so let's see a poll was that a letter t was it an x was it a d or a c we have students answering in to collect the various results so different students got different answers but i can already tell that the most students got the answer that sophia was sending okay um okay and i am going to do the thing honey i have two letters yeah let's see keegan what did you get what okay so i have two letters hi hi keegan so i think that was sort of regritified in some way i am not getting the hang of this here hold on a second i mean that's pretty good can we switch to gallery view and see what this other what the students on camera see what everybody else got here what did everybody else get all right different people a lot of you got the right letter there and can we show what the poll results showed from the students in the audience the poll results showed that most people 46 percent of you got the right answer and this indeed is the right this is what sophia was trying to do if we can switch back to put me on camera did any did anybody else be an h did anybody else get an h and an i did anybody get an agent and i i don't think so no okay just me oh just me okay all right i must have been seeing little uh sub snaps i was hearing some snaps so what you saw there is the zeros and ones sent by a flashlight is literally how information is sent on the internet whether it's on a light wave on a sent on glass or whether it's an electrical wave uh sent on a wire and on on the actual internet and in computers there's actually a clock matching my snaps to make the difference between when it's a zero or when it's a one so if there's multiple zeros in a row these are these are changing not once a second like me but literally billions of times a second really buyer goes on and off to send this information and a protocol as we learned is just like the rules we set that we set as you know an on means of one or the snap is how you know what's going on protocols are how on the internet this information is sent on how the computers know how to communicate amazing amazing that's pretty incredible it's literally what we did is how information is sent on the internet every little thing you get on the internet is sent in a similar kind of way we want to do something else since you're going to be our first special guest who's going to play a new thing with us called a lightning round of questions you got okay we have an app that we've made here and sophia is going to put 60 seconds on the clock and she's going to keep score to see how many questions you can get done in 60 seconds 60 seconds for our future guests the high score right now is a zero okay i think i can do better than that i hope by yes hopefully you can beat the high school beat zero all right sophia are you ready yes keegan are you ready i am ready all right go okay the last person you have not living with you say it again we'll see if i lost in the middle the last person you hugged not living with you not living you uh doug lyman next question as a kid what did you want to be when you grew up veterinarian what is a superhero power you wish you had i would love to be able to fly first thing you can do in the morning uh i drink a cup of earl grey tea 30 seconds strangest thing in your refrigerator uh strange thing refrigerator uh uh duck liver pate okay your favorite smell uh my favorite smell is my favorite smell is beef stroganoff the the i like wow what's the best advice you've ever gotten what's the best advice you've ever gotten say that again hottie we're out of time in the lightning round but what is the best advice you've ever gotten um the best advice i've ever gotten let me see what is the best advice i've ever gotten appreciate appreciate appreciate that's beautiful yeah well thank you keegan and do you have any final messages for our students who are all studying at home well just just keep on keep at it everybody and this is a wonderful wonderful skill and if you enjoy something you should do it because it might move you by the way yes of course six you beat the high school i beat the high score yeah yeah that's six um and also i want to tell all the kids to watch next week thank you so much and let's switch to gallery view and have all the students wave goodbye and thank you so much keegan for joining us thank you guys for part of your day with us okay take care byebye all right so we've learned today that protocols are what makes the internet work and we learned how to send messages back and forth with ones and zeroes uh and how those create rules for how to send messages now sophie and i are going to jump into code.org internet simulator for the next part of our episode which is going to teach us about internet addresses internet addresses and what we're going to do is we're going to use something inside code.org called the internet simulator i'm going to screen share this briefly so here we are in the internet simulator we have four people here in a room now imagine these are four computers all connected on the internet via wires everybody's connected to each other and we're gonna send messages to each other there's four people sophia hannah akira and darius darius is my my son hannah and kira help me with running code break and what we're going to do is we're sending messages to each other instead of with ones and zeros they're going to be with letters but it's very similar as to how the internet works and what i want to do is sofia if you could send messages to akira back and forth and darius and hannah if you could communicate with each other i want you each to ask each other what your birthday is so if you could send messages asking each other sophia to akira hannah and darius to each other so sophia is sending her answer all right so akira's asking from from sophia and darris and hannah sent their messages back and forth all right darius darius can you speak up are you there yes so so you were asking from hannah so what is hannah's birthday what did you learn um i have no idea because it doesn't say who any of the messages are from or who they're to it doesn't say who the messages are from or too so we know a bunch of these birthdays but not who they're from or to the other thing is everybody's seeing everybody's birthday you're not just seeing hannah's message uh and what could cause a problem with that if you know on the internet if things are all public well i mean if you're trying to send personal information that you don't want everyone to know then like everybody can see it which is obviously better exactly what most people don't realize is when you're on the internet every single thing that is sent back and forth is going on a series of wires that literally the entire world could tap into and see every single bit of it and the only way to protect that information is to encrypt it as we learned a few episodes to go with ashton kutcher if you're on a web page if you see this little lock here at the where you see my mouse pointing in the upper left that lock means that the information that's being sent back and forth is encrypted if there's not a lock there literally everything that's you're sending or receiving back can be seen by every single other person but now let's deal with how to fix the problem of you couldn't tell whose name was which what can we do if we do the same exact thing and you you four communicate with each other to make it more clear i mean you could put your name before the message and who you're sending it to all right so let's do that so let's do it again sophia to akira and back and forth and say to whom and from whom and we're inventing a new change to our protocol to include the address of who the message is from into the question well why don't you ask each other your favorite flavor of ice cream so to akira from sophia what is your favorite ice cream is that correct okay yeah and everybody's sending messages to sophia from akira what is your favorite ice cream from hannah to darius what is your favorite ice cream so sophia what is akira's favorite ice cream um she loves salted caramel and darius did you learn what hannah's favorite ice cream is yes mint chocolate chip mint chocolate chip so what we just did is basically we invented an addition to our protocol where we put the two address and the from address from so that everybody's message you can tell who it's coming from and who it's coming to and this is literally how things work on the internet just as we learned with the flashlights the messages are sent in ones and zeros but they need addresses for who they're going to and who they're coming from we used first names but that's not what we use on the internet because we aren't on a first name basis with every single computer on the internet but but in fact every computer on the internet has an address called an ip address and ip stands for internet protocol the internet protocol basically says how with ones and zeros computers talk with each other and every single device on the internet even if it's your phone has a unique 64digit long address that is one long number that helps know who the message is coming from who it's coming to and so using ones and zeros every time you send a text message every time you receive a video on youtube whatever it is that you're doing on the internet these ones and zeros spell out the two address and the from address when you get an answer back from google google says sends a message from google to your computer's address to do that now i want to introduce someone who knows a lot about the internet protocol we're going to play a short video to introduce them so let's go to the video hopefully it's not laggy it probably might be i don't have any idea where the internet came from and it just doesn't matter they don't need to it's sort of like asking who invented the ballpoint pen or the flush toilet or you know the zipper these are all things we just use every day we don't even think about the fact that one day somebody invented them so the internet is just like that many many years ago in the early 1970s my partner bob khan and i began working on the design of what we now call the internet it all right vince are you there with us vince surf are you there yes i i am i had to unmute and it took a moment to do that thank you very much for inviting me to join the show and i certainly enjoyed the the preamble with keegan that was a lot of fun i tried to do uh the uh the examinations that sophia gave us and i have to tell you there's one thing missing from the protocol that you introduced the timing was extremely important but the other thing that wasn't clear to me since i wasn't around for earlier shows is in which order the bits were supposed to be placed in the matrix another yeah so if you don't get the order correct you won't be able to get the shape of the letter correctly fortunately i took left to right top to bottom as my assumption for putting the bits into the nine three by three array but i could have been wrong because you could have picked another convention so but the example of needing to make decisions like that and make it clear you know what the protocol is what the parameters are is absolutely essential to successful communication absolutely and by the way for folks who are joining us vince just recently recovered from the coronavirus we are so lucky to have him on this show and on this episode uh it's just incredible that that somebody who's had this much impact on the world around us uh is somebody who we almost lost thanks to this this virus that is affecting our entire world we're so lucky to have you with us if anybody has questions for events you can use code.org questions to submit them or if you're on facebook you can submit them in the comments what i what i'd like to suggest next is usually we run polls for the students for the students to basically answer questions as a trivia question but with you here vince we're going to do things a little differently we'd like to host a quiz show so everybody can play along and we're going to have you ask the questions of the audience and the audience is going to do this via polls and if they don't show up on your screen i can read out the questions and you can help answer them so let's go with the first question so the first question is why was the internet invented in the first place option a to make persontoperson computer chat possible b is to have a communication network that could survive a nuclear war and c is to play games with friends uh and we have about 1500 students answering this poll so we're going to wait until a lot of the answers come in half of them have already voted on their answers and there's lots of pretty unique different answers four percent people all right if we could show the answers on screen right so vince uh about 50 people said that it was sorry fifty percent said is to have a communication network that could survive a nuclear war forty five percent said to the persontoperson computer chat possible about four percent said it's to play games with friends so uh tell us why did you invent the internet with your team there well it wasn't exactly to build something that would survive a nuclear war and i'm not sure that even today's internet would survive but it was intended to provide a platform for the defense department the u.s defense department to build a command and control system and so uh to the extent that we sort of think of command and control and nuclear war is somehow being related uh the uh the second answer is probably an accurate initial answer but it lets us do all those other things that that you listed and a whole bunch of other things that you didn't list like what we're doing right this moment so the answer is it wasn't designed for a particular purpose it was designed as a platform to support all kinds of applications if you could just figure out how to program them and also a big difference about the design relative to previous communication networks is that it was fault tolerance so in the event of a war attack with things being wrong it could stay up did you ever dream that it would be used this way when you when you did this work yes because when you think about command or control it's all about interactions of you know people trying to cooperate and collaborate with each other and so that works in the civilian sector too when we've seen the internet grow in that way the its predecessor the arpanet was designed to share resources among computer science departments in the u.s they were doing research on artificial intelligence and so we saw electronic mail we saw distribution lists we saw remote access to computing we saw file transfers and then of course in the early 1990s tim bernerslee invented the world wide web which enabled people to share even more information in more elaborate ways and more conveniently to find that information so the honest answer is we tried to build a very general platform that could be adapted to a wide range of applications all right so let's do our next question question number two is the internet made of a copper wires b glass fiber c radio waves d satellites or e all of the above all right so half the audience has put in their poland their poll results uh we got about 75 voting all right if we could display the poll answers on screen uh so 75 percent said all of the above with the uh the rest of folks saying it's radio waves and satellites so vince what is the internet made of well it's not only is it made of all those communication media that you mentioned uh it's also made of free space lasers among other things but it's also a layered architecture and so in addition to the basic transport mechanisms uh the ones that you listed uh there are computers that have to be part of the network we call them routers and they are the things that move internet packets around and then on top of that are the computers that have all the applications running in them so the internet is made up of a hierarchy of uh of systems that uh perform all of its various functions in a layered fashion so there's a lot that goes into the internet and in the end it ends up in your house because many of us right this moment are at home using our laptops connected to radio based wifi which is connected probably the optical fiber into the backbone of the internet so it's made up of a whole lot of things in a hierarchy right but the physical layer is a mix of all those things we said and the internet protocol is what enables communication across all those things to work the same way whether it's light being traveled as on and off or ones and zeros or whether it's electricity on or off let's go to the next question so question number three what is the difference between the internet and the original phone system option a the phone system is for phone calls and the internet is for web pages option b the phone system connects phones together and the internet connects computers and option c the phone system uses direct persontoperson communications but on the internet everybody's information mixes together in packets all in the same connection this one seems a little bit harder for folks about half of everybody's students that have voted all right we're at 75 having answered all right let's share the results so almost 80 percent said option c that the inter the phone system uses direct connections the internet uses packets all on the same connection all right vince so so actually the third answer is probably the closest uh to accurate uh in the telephone system we use another expression that's called circuit switching which means we connect connections between each endpoint each telephone and we dedicate that circuit to that one phone call and only used by those two parties whereas uh in the internet the packets uh share the common communications traffic communications capacity so it's like the difference between dedicating a railroad track from los angeles to new york for one train versus having a highway or a freeway with dozens or hundreds of thousands of cars all sharing the common highway uh and moving wherever they need to go getting on and off as they have to which is what internet packets do there's another analogy that might be useful for some of your listeners to think about if you know anything about postcards then you know a lot about how the internet works because the postcard has a to address and a from address just like we experimented with just a few minutes ago to figure out how to send messages to each other and then it has a certain amount of content so the postcard is very much like an internet package it doesn't know how it's being carried the postcards don't know whether they went on a bicycle or a car or an airplane or a boat and the postcard also doesn't have any idea what you wrote on it and that's also true of internet packets they don't care how they were carried and they have no idea what you wrote on it the reason that's important is that we don't have to change the internet when we invent new applications because the applications are at the edges of the network in the computers like the ones that you and i are using right now they interpret the content of the packets as video or audio or email or a piece of a web page the network doesn't know and it doesn't care and the reason that's important is that if somebody invents a new application we don't have to change the network it just keeps moving packets around and so it's been a stable uh element of the internet's architecture for the last 45 years or so that it hasn't had to change very much except to grow in capacity but the basic protocol architecture has been stable it boggles my mind to think that for every second that you're talking that one second of video is transited into ones and zeros each of them put on a digital postcard split up into millions and millions of individual packets that are then sent on what is effectively like a highway system and those packets they don't come on a direct line to me they go each their individual different ways through different routers they come to my computer and then they're put back in order and then recreated back into the video literally billions of times a second and it's an architecture that was invented 45 years ago it's crazy um let's go to our last question who is in charge of the internet option a nobody option b the phone and cable companies option c google and facebook and these big websites and option d the government that'll be interesting yeah it'll be interesting to see what people think about this one so about 67 percent of voted 75 voted all right let's share the results all right so 60 say nobody's in charge almost 30 says the government is in charge and 15 say it's the phone companies or google and facebook so who's in charge well the real answer is we all are and we have but we don't have charge of everything we have charge of portions of network so the cable companies and the telephone companies have charge of some of the underlying physical networks that we run the packets on top of but companies like google and facebook and others have charge of their data centers uh and all of the computers that are part of that and the applications that they offer to the public you and i are in charge of our own networks at home uh where we have wifi we have dedicated connections into the public internet uh the government has something to say about this there are other organizations uh they may have regulations for example about the way in which the internet is used and what to do about people who abuse the internet and cause harm by means of abusing it uh there are one very special organization however called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers otherwise known as icam its responsibility is to make sure the domain names like www.google and internet addresses which we just talked about a few minutes ago get assigned uniquely to the parties who need them so you don't want to have the same address assigned to two different people you don't want to have a domain name assigned to two different organs the same domain name assigned to two different organizations so there's uniqueness which is assured by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers that's really the only centralized responsibility which is to assure uniqueness of those protocols and their parameters identifiers so so that's really the only place where there's any centralization everything else is fully distributed thanks so much um so for for anybody who's listened to this and has more questions about how does it actually work like how does a picture travel from my phone to my friend's phone or when i type in google into a web browser what happens how does it work we have a video series at code.org and we're going to email that to folks at the end of this episode and the video series includes vince and a whole bunch of other people who basically helped create the internet and we're going to send that to you all at the end of the episode um this is it for our quiz show vince but we have a question from the audience uh from rosemary candles in louisville kentucky is rose unmuted oh actually akira is going to introduce this question akira if we could introduce akira who's helps as producing code.org codebreak hi kira um yes so rose submitted this question on our questions forum but also on twitter and she said you gave such a powerful speech and you said that the internet is for everyone so how do you think we're doing specifically in america but if you have other cultural contexts applied to please do how do you think we're doing in america to make it accessible for everyone so what a great question it's hard to answer briefly but let me say first of all that we think about half of the world's population has some access to the internet sometimes it's just through the mobile phones which are getting better and faster over time sometimes it's through dedicated circuits fiber connections or coaxial cable but that's only about half the world's population so and by the way this is not country even in countries that are heavily invested in internet there are places that do not have access in the us for example our rural parts of the country are very rarely have very good quality internet access at all this is also true in other parts of the world as i'm sure you must know there are barriers to providing access to the internet some of them is physical facilities which we need to build out uh and that may get um let's i won't say fixed but a new avenue for connectivity is coming spacex a company run by elon musk is planning to launch satellites in orbit thousands of them so that the entire surface of the earth will be able to get access to the internet assuming the system works so that's one step in the direction of making sure people could get some access the second issue of course is cost how much does it cost to get onto the net how much does the equipment cost and how much does the service cost and driving cost out is very important in order to make the internet affordable and reliably accessible to people so they can take advantage of it and so there are no then there may be regulatory issues associated with who is allowed to offer internet service do you have to get a license or not is it a regulated service uh is there competition permitted or not and so those things also have to be taken into account and then there is a much more general question of internet governance which we don't have time to get into but you can just imagine with the system as pervasive as the internet has become and as powerful as the internet has become there are a lot of arguments over who should be in charge and what the rules of the use should be so there are lots of things that get in the way of providing internet access to everyone i'm committed to trying to get the rest of the world up on the internet if they want to be in a way that's affordable and reliable safe and secure thank you so much vince uh i had one last question i wanted to ask but really briefly because we're short on time uh you know you're known as the father of the internet but you aren't the only person who was involved can you give us for all the young women in the audience names of two or three folks who you'd think of as the mothers of the internet that they can then google uh to get inspiration about the the people who helped create this this resource that all of us around the world use well first of all that you showed a brief picture early on an introduction of my colleague robert khan and he and i did the original internet design way back in 1973 but it was based on top of work that was done in a predecessor network called the arpanet so that project was run for the american defense department by larry roberts the network working group that did the original uh arpanet protocols the ones that you were demonstrating for internet was done by stephen crocker who happens to be my best friend in high school and still my best friend uh 60 years later david clark john postel there are a just endless number of people who have contributed to the internet and continue to contribute today so the big message for the students out there is to realize that the internet is still ready to accept new ideas it's ready to adapt and evolve and you have the opportunity to invent new applications as long as you can figure out how to program them which is what code.org is all about and so software is an endless frontier the internet is a place where you can invent to your heart's content and perhaps create applications that the rest of the world can take advantage of so just go out there and do that well thank you so much vince uh let's switch to gallery view and give the audience a chance to say goodbye to vince and sophie is going to play you some applause thank you so much everybody goodbye well we learned basically about how the internet is how computing devices communicate whether it's from a laptop or a phone or a giant data center or an automobile even a watch all these devices communicate over the internet whether it's to send data text messages video chats snapchats tick tock really any sort of information but one of the most popular things the internet is used for is for browsing web pages so when you use google's chrome or microsoft's edge or internet explorer or safari on apple devices you're browsing web pages and this is what we're going to learn about next in the last segment of our episode which is about web pages all right uh are you ready sophia yes all right so for our final segment what we're going to do is we're going to go into code.org and use something called weblab a tool that helps us make simple websites uh and i'm going to screen share web lab right now and show it to you so here we are and uh this is inside code.org and basically we have two files here an html file and a css file and we're going to add these sofia is going to help me build a website about her cats so i'm gonna go first edit the html and html is the language that is sent instead of the ones and zeros we sent for sending images web pages on the internet are sent in html and you don't need to memorize how i do this right now we're gonna send you an email at the end of this uh to help you make your own so sophia what do you want me to put inside my web page um first let's have a title okay we're gonna put a title so that uses a header tag and the way you do headers is you put this little angle bracket and then an h1 and then a close of an angle angle bracket and that means it's a title or a header what do you want to say my cat sunshine my cat sunshine and now you have to close each tag to say that it's the end of the title which is an angle bracket and a slash and an h1 and by this language was invented by a guy named tim bernerslee who invented the world wide web and here we have our title my cat sunshine in our webpage uh what else would you like to put in there um let's put a photo of sunshine right the photo is done with an image tag which is an angle bracket img and instead of text we're gonna put the information about where the photo is so i'm going to say the source of the photo equals and i already uploaded a photo of sunny by clicking the add image button up here so it knows about sunny which is your cat's name and i'm going to say let's make it the width of the entire web page 100. so there's sunny my cat's sunshine and you know this width hundred goes from here to here but if i expand to see the whole web page it makes it a hundred percent of the page no matter what so i'm going to make this a little bit smaller to make it 50 percent of the web page so it goes half half width on the web page and is there anything else you want to put in there let's add a paragraph about function all right we're going to add some text so we're going to use the paragraph tag which is just a p and what what do you want to put in our paragraph um this is my cat sunshine he is an orange polydactyl cat which means he has seven toes on the front pause instead of four oh you speak really fast all right i think i got that all uh but it the text hasn't showed up yet because i need to close my paragraph again with this close tag and as soon as i close it it shows up and now here's our very simple web page that we just made and when you see any web page on the internet like on google on facebook amazon microsoft anywhere it's being sent in this language called html but if you look here this doesn't look like most web pages because the font and text are just really simple we can add styles to to to make them more interesting so what what do you want to do to make them more interesting um let's change the title color you want to change the color all right let's change the color of the header so let's make another color let's make it a dark orange dark orange it's a dark orange and look the title is a different color do you want to change any of the fonts as well yes let's change it to um i'm going to change the font family what do you want the font all right my cat sunshine that already looks a little prettier do you want to change the phone to the paragraph text as well make it cursive we can change this and i have to put these semicolons to end these so here now it says this is my cat sunshine and again if you look at the whole web page these styles carry through and what's interesting about styles we didn't style the individual piece of text we said just change the style for headers or let's change the style for paragraphs so if i go back to my html page and if i add another header so let me say another header this is another header again i need to close this header tag you see it shows up in the orange applied to both of them and if i go back to the style sheet and i change this from orange to blue it changes all the headers all at the same time and that's why they call it a style sheet because you're not changing just the individual text i don't know why that didn't work i don't think you spelled it correctly either way so this is how web pages work and you can see the html here and the style sheet and the actual content on the right and anybody can use code.org to make these simple html pages and then to see the end result of how it works what we're going to do is we're actually going to send this out to you so that any of you can create your own and in fact if you're watching right now please make sure we have you on our mailing list for code break so if you haven't signed up already go to code.org break and enter your email address where it says to sign up if you do that then at the end of this episode we're going to email you a really fun set of activities that's going to include first of all the video series that you can watch about how the internet works that video series works even on a smartphone for students who don't have computers then you can learn if you're an older student you can learn how web lab works and to create your own html and then for the challenge we have two challenges one for younger students is to come up with a communication protocol to share information between your parents or with a brother and sister using a flashlight just like sophia did and if you're more advanced to build a simple website and when you're done creating stuff not only share it with your parents but if they have social media ask them to share it on social media with the hashtag codebreak and as we always do we're going to pick the best things that people share and invite them back on the show next week to join us with next week's special guest and speaking of for next week i'm excited to announce our special guest next week is going to be sal khan the founder of khan academy which is like code one of the most popular ways students learn online khan academy isn't about coding in computer science it's about math and science and all sorts of subjects social studies and all sorts of subjects that are taught in schools we're so excited to have sal khan join us next week and then finally if you're a parent who's been enjoying each week please consider supporting code.org by visiting code.org help we would love all the support we can get before we close off let's switch to gallery view again and have all the students on camera get a chance to wave goodbye and if we could unmute them and everybody say goodbye you're studying alone take a code break we'll see you again next week goodbye you
