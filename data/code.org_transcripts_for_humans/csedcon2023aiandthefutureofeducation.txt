With timestamps:

00:00 - hi everyone it's nice to see you all
00:02 - welcome to Vegas we're going to have a
00:03 - lot of fun and we're going to learn a
00:06 - lot about computer
00:07 - science um I have the pleasure of
00:11 - introducing uh three colleagues who I've
00:14 - gotten to know very very well over the
00:16 - last uh five to six months um tachai is
00:21 - an initiative that is led by co.org
00:25 - ETS isty KH Academy and the world
00:30 - economic forum and today we're going to
00:32 - have leaders from ETS isty and K Academy
00:36 - speak on this panel uh with me today
00:39 - unfortunately our our friends at at the
00:41 - world economic Forum chose to stay in
00:44 - Switzerland imagine
00:46 - that but with that I'd like to introduce
00:50 - uh these three uh Kristen desero the
00:52 - chief learning officer of KH Academy
00:54 - come on
00:58 - up
01:00 - nine Mancan head of AI Labs at
01:04 - etss and Joseph South Chief Innovation
01:08 - officer of
01:12 - ISTC okay so if you've ever seen me do a
01:16 - panel uh you know that I like to keep it
01:20 - Lively and I've warned these folks that
01:23 - I might go off
01:24 - script so they are warned also I'd like
01:28 - to engage you all as quickly as possible
01:31 - so rather than save uh the Q&A from the
01:34 - audience for the last five minutes we're
01:36 - actually going to pause Midway through
01:39 - and get to your questions and I believe
01:41 - there are either mic stands out there in
01:43 - the darkness or there are Mike Runners
01:46 - are there Mike stands or Mike
01:49 - Runners all right
01:52 - excellent and so please get ready with
01:56 - your questions we're going to start off
01:58 - with a fun question if if you all could
02:00 - just uh again introduce yourself name
02:02 - title or and then answer one of these
02:05 - three questions what is one thing AI has
02:09 - done for you recently or what is one
02:12 - thing you hope AI can or will do for
02:16 - you or what's one thing you think AI
02:18 - will never be able to do and we'll start
02:22 - off with
02:23 - Kristen hello thanks all for being here
02:26 - today it's I'm really looking forward to
02:29 - this panel and uh and meeting more of
02:32 - you I'm the chief learning officer at
02:34 - Khan Academy as we said and the I've
02:38 - been working in educational technology
02:40 - for oh gosh 20 years now um and AI has
02:45 - given me and us at Khan Academy the
02:49 - ability to create a tutor that we have
02:53 - never been able to do before with
02:55 - technology to be able to have a dialogue
02:57 - with students and we we think that
03:01 - that's going to significantly improve
03:02 - learning outcomes for students so that's
03:05 - really exciting for us and not to not to
03:08 - plug
03:10 - kigo but that's been what we I've been
03:13 - sleeping and dreaming we just realized
03:15 - it really was just about a year ago that
03:18 - we launched the idea for kigo at a hack
03:21 - week internally and it's hack week at
03:23 - Con Academy this week so uh it's been an
03:26 - exciting year and uh so it's an exciting
03:29 - time with thank you for joining us
03:30 - Kristen
03:32 - Narine good afternoon everyone I'm
03:34 - Narine I head AI at ETS um I have a
03:37 - 9-year-old and she's learning Tamil uh
03:40 - the language and I don't uh read or
03:43 - write Tamil so I wasn't able to support
03:45 - her because my husband travels but with
03:48 - AI I use it to you know show me the
03:52 - Tamil script in English so that I can
03:54 - help her work I don't think that would
03:55 - have been possible without
03:58 - AI thank you you our mean Joseph hi um
04:02 - it's wonderful to be in a room with
04:03 - Educators um I feel the energy just
04:06 - flowing from you um I it sort of
04:09 - supercharges me to be with you um I'm
04:12 - Joseph South I'm the chief Innovation
04:13 - officer at IST um and the thing that I
04:16 - really really want AI to do is fold my
04:21 - laundry me too me too Joseph and get me
04:25 - a beer um so uh this is a question for
04:30 - all of you um uh superintendent Ebert
04:33 - mentioned this AI guidance for schools
04:36 - toolkit uh that was uh led by the
04:39 - steering committee at tji KH Academy IST
04:43 - ETS and the world economic Forum as well
04:45 - as some co-authors who are part of the
04:47 - advisory committee actually there are
04:49 - many tji advisory committee members here
04:53 - uh this uh at cscom this year but five
04:57 - co-authors led the development of the
04:58 - toolkit as well
05:00 - um uh Ken the Consortium for school
05:03 - networking digital promise uh pace which
05:06 - is the is policy analysis for California
05:09 - education and the European edtech
05:12 - Alliance um this this guidance for
05:14 - schools toolkit actually the four pager
05:16 - is in your padfolio so if you haven't
05:17 - seen it check it out please and there's
05:19 - a full toolkit available on the website
05:22 - in Google doc form as well as web page
05:25 - form we released this toolkit two weeks
05:27 - ago and today uh you know we released
05:30 - that special mini guide what is one
05:32 - thing you hope AI can do for education
05:36 - and what guidance will make that likely
05:41 - and and uh anyone can can
05:44 - begin everybody's looking at me um so
05:48 - what I hope one thing that I hope it
05:50 - will do and I have a I have a list um
05:53 - but one thing I hope is that it will
05:54 - jump start a long overdue conversation
05:57 - about assessment
06:00 - um we have gotten away with outmoded
06:04 - approaches to assessment for far too
06:06 - long and if um you know we the the
06:11 - guidance that will help us is if we
06:14 - Embrace AI as a tool to uplevel our
06:17 - assessment rather than a threat to our
06:20 - assessments then we can make a change
06:22 - towards more relevant more authentic
06:24 - more Competency Based learning thank you
06:26 - Joseph so Joseph I think that was my
06:28 - answer sorry
06:30 - should first because I come from ETS but
06:33 - yes a to what you said CU you know the
06:35 - future is going to be test lless as we
06:37 - know it but since you already said that
06:40 - um My Hope with AI is that it will allow
06:44 - teachers and Educators to offer a more
06:47 - individualized learning to all kinds of
06:49 - students to students in every Walk of
06:52 - Life that we don't have this digital
06:54 - divide anymore and it'll accelerate that
06:56 - learning and the guidance that you know
06:59 - I would give to Educators and all
07:02 - stakeholders really in the edtech space
07:04 - is to engage with the AI to have these
07:06 - conversations to not shy away or ignore
07:09 - but really Embrace The Challenge in
07:11 - front of
07:12 - us I'll build on that I think there's
07:15 - help having teachers have more
07:17 - personalized conversations but I think
07:19 - it's having teachers
07:21 - build those Human Relationships that are
07:24 - so important for student outcomes and if
07:26 - they're spending less time on some of
07:28 - the more rot tasks there's more time
07:31 - available to be able to have those
07:33 - conversations with students to sit down
07:35 - with them over their work but also just
07:37 - about their lives and what they're doing
07:40 - and I think the things we need to do
07:42 - that is to start to be able to find out
07:45 - what can AI do for teachers and what can
07:49 - it do uh to help ease some of that
07:51 - burden all right and uh actually I I'll
07:54 - add to this um I hope that we use this
07:58 - window of opportunity during this time
08:01 - where we're trying to figure out how to
08:03 - incorporate AI in education to examine
08:06 - uh things that actually aren't as much
08:09 - aren't as technical as AI or even
08:11 - computer science but to really examine
08:13 - things like societal bias and uh
08:17 - misinformation in a in a in a new way or
08:21 - in a revitalized way because obviously
08:24 - we see the consequences of students who
08:28 - grow up into adults
08:29 - who don't know how to critically
08:31 - evaluate
08:32 - information and who don't even
08:34 - understand that AI isn't biased we are
08:40 - biased and we're the ones hopefully who
08:43 - need to
08:44 - ultimately uh change and then thus
08:48 - hopefully AI will reflect and mirror
08:51 - that change in us so you know I I'm
08:54 - hoping for things even beyond the
08:55 - teaching of AI or teaching uh how people
08:59 - how to use AI uh Joseph
09:03 - um as as the chief Innovation officer
09:06 - for the international Society for
09:08 - technology and education well done um
09:11 - and ASC by the way you know that they're
09:13 - going to have a new name at some point
09:15 - Jo you can't put him on the I'm not I I
09:19 - always ply him to get like uh updates as
09:22 - to what their new name is going to be
09:23 - because I'm so curious an organization
09:25 - that's so well known they're going to
09:27 - change their name and I'm so curious
09:28 - what that name is going to be yeah well
09:30 - one that our naming Consultants came up
09:32 - with was tangelo but we we went back to
09:35 - the drawing board yeah you fired them
09:38 - and then you uh yeah okay um that wasn't
09:41 - the question though now the real
09:42 - question Joseph um Joseph what's
09:46 - different about
09:48 - this wave of AI hitting schools and the
09:52 - world but let's just focus on schools
09:54 - what's different about this about AI
09:57 - compared to other edtech waves previous
10:00 - and what have we learned from those
10:01 - previous waves that can help us
10:05 - now so there's I think a couple things
10:07 - that are different that I think are
10:08 - probably pretty apparent to anyone in
10:10 - this room the first of all is the speed
10:12 - of adoption um it's been adopted so
10:16 - quickly um there is a recent survey that
10:19 - 35% of Educators in the UK are using AI
10:23 - to do work doing their work um and you
10:26 - have to realize that you know generative
10:29 - AI pretty much became in the public
10:32 - Consciousness in November of last year
10:35 - it it hasn't even been a year um that is
10:37 - a massive rapid adoption and there's a
10:39 - couple reasons for that I think one is
10:41 - one that Bill Gates mentioned at the um
10:44 - 10th anniversary of code.org which I had
10:45 - the privilege of attending um and that
10:47 - is that the infrastructure is already in
10:49 - place for most new technologies you
10:52 - first have to get the infrastructure in
10:53 - place and it's incredibly expensive and
10:56 - it takes a lot of technical ability and
10:58 - then you can bring in the technology we
11:01 - pretty much have the infrastructure the
11:03 - second is that it's conversational
11:06 - anyone not everyone but most people who
11:09 - have the ability to type um can access
11:13 - um AI generative Ai and so the speed is
11:17 - fast um the second thing that I would
11:20 - say that's different is that it's
11:23 - happening across all sectors of society
11:25 - at once um I'm G to pause and make a
11:29 - really important point which is AI that
11:31 - wave already came right a is already
11:33 - here it's already in every aspect of
11:35 - your life it's every nook and cranny
11:36 - it's in every one of the apps on your
11:38 - phone it's it's which groceries are
11:41 - showing on which shelves in your grocery
11:43 - store it's all here a generative AI is
11:47 - hitting us all at once and so as a
11:50 - result usually the policy conversation
11:53 - around new technologies comes to
11:55 - education last but it's coming to us at
11:58 - the same time time as it's coming to the
12:00 - rest of society and as a result we have
12:02 - federal state local leaders
12:04 - International leaders all focused in at
12:07 - the same time and that is really
12:09 - different um not to mention that the
12:12 - people who make the technology are
12:14 - requesting to be regulated requesting
12:17 - guard rails so that's really different
12:20 - um as far as things that we can do or
12:23 - learn from previous waves I think
12:25 - there's three things that I would
12:26 - mention one is that we know it's going
12:28 - to be distributed inequitably every wave
12:32 - of technology has been distributed
12:34 - inequitably and if we know that up front
12:37 - we can start taking steps right now to
12:39 - mitigate that um and banning AI is
12:43 - actually one of the ways you can
12:45 - guarantee an equitable adoption of AI
12:48 - because the people with means are going
12:50 - to have it anyway and the people without
12:52 - will
12:53 - not
12:55 - [Applause]
12:57 - um second the tech part is the easy part
13:02 - the hard part is building the capacity
13:04 - of Educators to use it effectively for
13:07 - teaching and learning and I mean we have
13:09 - a teacher shortage we are coming out of
13:12 - coid we have the most
13:14 - diverse differentiated student body
13:17 - we've ever had um and getting this on
13:21 - the radar of a teacher is tough and
13:25 - having them be able to use it
13:26 - effectively even harder and then last
13:29 - thing that I'll say is I believe that
13:31 - the most potent use of new technologies
13:34 - is not when we do it to a student but
13:37 - when a student becomes a creator with
13:39 - the new
13:41 - technology yeah you like that I um and
13:46 - that um we can learn from previous waves
13:50 - that if we really want the full impact
13:52 - of this technology we need to put
13:54 - students in the seat of the
13:56 - Creator Joseph will be here till so
13:59 - tomorrow afternoon so please seek him
14:01 - out you can tell that he's a wealth of
14:04 - wisdom and what I appreciate about
14:06 - Joseph it's not just a bunch of talking
14:08 - points though he has those um it's a lot
14:11 - of pragmatism as well and a lot of um um
14:17 - just useful practical knowledge so
14:20 - please seek him out uh in the hallway
14:22 - sorry Joseph you're now going to be
14:24 - swamped um but I I want I want them to
14:28 - uh uh profit from you being here as much
14:31 - as um you being on the tji steering
14:34 - committee so thank you Joseph um Narine
14:37 - I have a question for you uh nine I
14:41 - think I mean I I'm I'm with a whole
14:43 - bunch of really educated people we got
14:45 - Dr derbo Dr South but Narine I'm pretty
14:48 - sure you're the only AI scientist here
14:50 - right Kristen you didn't okay yes uh
14:52 - Narine Narine is the only AI scientist
14:55 - here so Narine AI I think it's quite
14:59 - powerful though he can't fold Joseph's
15:01 - laundry can't get me a beer yet Narine
15:05 - AI is quite powerful right now what's
15:07 - the future of AI short and longer term
15:10 - give us like gaze into that crystal ball
15:12 - let us know what else we might expect
15:16 - and and obviously for this audience how
15:19 - is that relevant for education I like to
15:22 - be an engineer
15:23 - though so if you asked me this question
15:26 - last week Pat I would have said that you
15:28 - know most of the generative AI we're
15:30 - seeing is text based and multimodel
15:32 - would be the next you know obvious
15:34 - Frontier except that open AI already
15:36 - released GPT 4V so we're already there
15:39 - with the multimodel and being able to
15:41 - process images um and PDFs Etc I think
15:45 - in the short term what we're going to
15:47 - see is that accumulation of knowledge as
15:49 - a repository knowledge was distributed
15:52 - it is distributed you have PDFs you have
15:54 - SharePoint you have Google Docs you have
15:57 - stuff all over the place and bringing
15:59 - that conversational piece into that
16:01 - knowledge repository and combining it
16:04 - with generative AI I think we're going
16:05 - to see that very very quickly happen and
16:09 - that's going to impact education because
16:11 - now you can pretty much ask a question
16:14 - whether it's within your domain within
16:16 - your company within your education
16:18 - environment or more generic across the
16:21 - internet in the slightly longer term I
16:25 - see things like personalization combined
16:28 - with generative AI so right now you see
16:31 - you know your grocery list pre-populated
16:33 - or your Netflix recommendation your
16:35 - Spotify song list combining that with
16:38 - generative AI gets you the Persona or
16:40 - the character you're most comfortable
16:42 - with so think of applications in who do
16:45 - you want to talk to at different moments
16:47 - in your life at different times of the
16:49 - day or for different purposes you might
16:51 - want a certain Persona asking reminding
16:54 - you to take your medicines versus a
16:56 - different Persona teaching you math and
16:58 - a different Persona bringing you a
17:00 - grocery list a little longer than that I
17:04 - see skills re and competencies really
17:07 - taking off with this generative AI I
17:09 - think we're almost there uh Dr Glen
17:12 - Glenn yesterday he talked about
17:14 - education currently measuring the
17:16 - product and you know trying to move
17:18 - towards process we've had the concept of
17:20 - performance tasks and situational
17:22 - judgment tasks in education for a long
17:25 - time but they've been really really
17:27 - difficult because of how how resource
17:29 - intensive they are with AI being able to
17:33 - have the data sets have the knowledge I
17:35 - think we're going to very quickly
17:37 - accelerate being able to combine that
17:40 - behavioral the process data or the
17:43 - performance data as well as your
17:46 - explicit response together to start
17:49 - making predictions around the durable
17:52 - skills you know can you think critically
17:55 - are you being empathetic in your
17:57 - conversation can I jump on that quick so
18:01 - when I first met Joseph he was in the US
18:04 - Department of ad and I was making games
18:06 - and trying to work on game based
18:08 - assessment and you may have noticed you
18:11 - don't have a ton of exciting game based
18:13 - Assessments in your classroom and it
18:15 - turns is that because of
18:18 - Joseph sorry I tried I really did try it
18:22 - turns out that they were really
18:25 - expensive and difficult to make and we
18:27 - would spend you know eight months
18:29 - building this game and it would cover
18:30 - like a week of curriculum um and trying
18:34 - to figure out the process data from them
18:37 - and how we were going to pull them
18:38 - together was a Monumental task and I do
18:41 - think that this
18:43 - technology really LeapFrogs us in a way
18:47 - that we're going to be able to do some
18:49 - much more understanding of that process
18:51 - that students are using and how they're
18:52 - how they're having those conversations
18:54 - and maybe get us where we wanted to get
18:56 - 10 years ago that would be awesome
18:59 - um so Kristen actually the next question
19:01 - is for you um tji the initiative is
19:04 - about empowering Educators to teach with
19:07 - AI and about
19:09 - AI how are these different where do they
19:12 - overlap what do we need to teach about
19:16 - AI so we can teach with
19:19 - AI yeah so we and many others are
19:25 - creating these tools for students to use
19:28 - the idea of a chatbot tutor I think
19:30 - we're gonna see ubiquitous in the next
19:32 - couple of months um but for students to
19:36 - really be able to use those effectively
19:39 - they need to have some understanding of
19:41 - what's Happening under the hood so AI
19:45 - can be
19:46 - wrong how do we help students understand
19:49 - that understand when it's most likely to
19:51 - be wrong what kinds of things it's most
19:54 - likely to be wrong about and how they
19:55 - should be thinking critically about the
19:57 - respon responses they're getting from Ai
20:01 - and what that might look like in the
20:03 - same way they're trying to we try to
20:05 - teach them to think critically about the
20:06 - internet search results they get when
20:08 - they do a search that's just one example
20:11 - of the idea that if we're going to be
20:13 - using AI to teach with we need to help
20:18 - students understand what's happening
20:20 - with it in order to be able to be
20:23 - effective consumers of AI and so I think
20:26 - you all are in the s space and I think
20:29 - could be leaders in your schools in
20:33 - terms of helping teachers think about
20:37 - building their own understanding about
20:38 - what's happening with AI and then
20:41 - helping their students understand what's
20:43 - happening with these tools so that
20:45 - they're more effective and critical
20:47 - consumers so so I actually have a a
20:50 - personal anecdote uh relevant to what
20:52 - you just shared Kristen I uh I got
20:55 - taught about how chatbots work and how
20:57 - large large language models work from
21:00 - open ai's Chief technology officer her
21:03 - name is Mera moradi it was through a
21:05 - video so it wasn't personal but and so
21:08 - you all can be taught the same thing too
21:10 - it's uh it's a it's a video uh that we
21:13 - shot with uh her as well as Christ Bal
21:17 - Valenzuela from one Runway another AI
21:19 - company but after merera explained how
21:23 - these chatbots and large language models
21:25 - work it totally changed my ability
21:29 - to potentially use an AI tool as like a
21:34 - a personal therapist because I knew
21:37 - technically what it was doing it was it
21:39 - was going to be hard for me now I feel
21:40 - like it's going to be hard for me now
21:42 - there by the way there's a lot of AI
21:45 - like characters out there character. a
21:48 - uh that are providing informal advice in
21:52 - ways that they probably shouldn't but
21:53 - they are but for me it's not going to
21:55 - work because I know what's happening
21:58 - under the hood and I hope that all kids
22:01 - will be able to uh critically evaluate
22:04 - these apps because they understand
22:06 - what's actually happening under the hood
22:08 - so I really agree with what you just
22:10 - shared we're going to go to audience
22:12 - questions and so I don't know again if
22:15 - there are mic runners or mic stands if
22:17 - there are mic Runners please raise your
22:19 - hand but if out that they're mic Runners
22:22 - yes they're mic Runners so you there's
22:23 - some uh c.org staff with mics in their
22:27 - hands right up so just raise your hand
22:29 - and what I'd like you to do is briefly
22:32 - introduce yourself name and affiliation
22:34 - and then get straight to your
22:36 - question K I'm Jeff Bentley from OMG
22:40 - tech in altero New Zealand um I have a
22:43 - question for kisten uh K Migo has only
22:48 - been
22:49 - out as you said it it's it's probably
22:52 - only what 6 months n months yeah we
22:54 - released March 14th so is there anything
22:57 - that you can tell tell us uh in terms of
23:00 - evaluation about results and how uh the
23:04 - impact that it's been having for
23:07 - students and
23:09 - teachers oh you teed me up for what I
23:12 - was going to talk about in the next
23:14 - session that I'm in but I'll give you a
23:17 - preview so uh we have been learning a
23:20 - lot there are some things that so first
23:25 - of all on uh con Academy for those who
23:28 - aren't aware the kigo can act in a
23:30 - couple of different ways one is what we
23:32 - call Companion mode where it's basically
23:34 - acting like a tutor you're working on a
23:36 - problem on Con Academy often math
23:39 - problems is that's what as our most used
23:41 - courses and conmigo can be there and say
23:45 - hey I'm trying to solve this 2x plus 3
23:47 - equals 5 I don't know what to do and it
23:49 - acts as a tutor there also a number of
23:52 - other activities that we basically put
23:54 - out as a Sandbox to try things out
23:57 - including including debate me uh write a
24:00 - story with me get feedback on my college
24:03 - admissions essay a bunch of things that
24:05 - we've been just testing what what's
24:07 - sticking what students like what's
24:09 - helping them learn so we have a few
24:13 - things that we've learned in the spring
24:15 - we had a couple of partner districts uh
24:19 - including Newark New Jersey and uh
24:22 - Hobart in Indiana uh who agreed to work
24:26 - with us to let us observe classes
24:29 - interview teachers interview School
24:31 - administrators about where things were
24:33 - so what did we learn from all of this
24:35 - first uh we learned we have set up in
24:38 - the system some moderation so if
24:40 - students are doing things with uh that
24:43 - indicate violence threats of self harm
24:46 - uh sexual content they raise a flag that
24:49 - flag gets to teachers we heard from
24:52 - District administrators we want to see
24:54 - that too um and so the the
24:57 - generalization from that is people are
24:59 - definitely concerned with safety and
25:01 - thinking about how do we know what
25:03 - students are doing when they're
25:05 - interacting with these models so heard
25:08 - and and uh understood and we we've done
25:11 - some new things to build that in so
25:13 - that's the the first piece is concerns
25:15 - about safety um second students uh most
25:19 - liked and most used the companion mode
25:22 - the hey help me solve this problem that
25:24 - I'm working on and I want to talk to you
25:27 - about where this problem is so that was
25:28 - the most used thing we get lots of
25:31 - questions that I'll say they we get
25:33 - what's our error rate on math so uh when
25:36 - you get an answer from kigo you can give
25:38 - a thumbs up or thumbs down and you can
25:40 - write us feedback about what you worked
25:43 - or didn't work there we I will say get
25:46 - about a
25:47 - 2% rate of people saying that it made a
25:51 - mistake and what that looks like so it's
25:53 - interesting um and then in our
25:56 - comparison
25:58 - this is not a randomized control trial
26:00 - this is not uh anything uh where we had
26:04 - much control over who had it and who
26:06 - didn't but we were able to have some
26:09 - schools in the districts that were using
26:11 - it and some schools that were not and we
26:13 - were able to see that the students who
26:15 - were using it got more are this is going
26:19 - to take again more discussion uh we have
26:22 - an internal metric called skills to
26:23 - proficient because on KH Academy you can
26:26 - work from attempted to familiar to
26:29 - proficient to master it on a skill and
26:31 - so we count as an internal metric of
26:33 - learning how many skills students get to
26:35 - proficient because that is the level
26:38 - that tells us they're most likely to see
26:39 - improvements on external assessments uh
26:42 - and so we saw the the the big positive
26:47 - thing for us was we saw students using
26:48 - conmigo got more skills to proficient
26:51 - than students who didn't use it now here
26:54 - is my uh
26:56 - request in order order to really
26:58 - understand how well this is working we
27:00 - need Partners in schools that are
27:04 - willing to share their external
27:06 - assessment data with us in a way that
27:07 - helps us link it to students who are
27:10 - using and not using conmigo and maybe
27:13 - even letting us do some random
27:15 - assignment uh by classes of who gets it
27:17 - and who doesn't and that's from our
27:20 - perspective sometimes hard to find
27:22 - schools that are willing to do that but
27:24 - everyone wants to know if it works or
27:25 - not so uh if you want to know if it
27:28 - works or not think about how you can
27:30 - help us get that evidence that's my
27:33 - pitch Kristen and and Kristen will be
27:34 - here till the end of the day so if
27:36 - you're going to if you're going to holl
27:37 - at her and and say hey we're we're game
27:39 - for sharing our data uh that's the time
27:42 - uh we have other questions out
27:45 - there
27:47 - yes do do do you have a
27:54 - mic testing there we go yes my my
27:57 - question realizing that I'm new to the
27:59 - whole AI large language um model is
28:04 - about the biases when I first heard
28:06 - about it that my mind immediately went
28:09 - to the bias question because you only
28:12 - get out what people put in and so I'm
28:16 - not sure that what is in there is
28:20 - representative of the culture within the
28:24 - world and so I wonder if you could
28:26 - address that a little bit more about how
28:30 - you see it it's not being biased when I
28:33 - went directly to the
28:35 - biases well I I can quickly start by and
28:39 - then I I'll pass it to whoever wants to
28:41 - jump in but um because it relates to
28:45 - something I said earlier uh these models
28:47 - reflect societal bias that's what they
28:49 - do in fact uh I don't know if you know
28:52 - but the the way these generative AI
28:54 - models work is the way machine learning
28:57 - work works is through bias but bias in
29:00 - the sense that you throw a lot of data
29:02 - at it and it learns to make uh uh
29:05 - inferences about other things that's a
29:08 - form of bias um what we're talking about
29:12 - here is our bias as humans in this room
29:16 - uh both uh biases that we know about and
29:18 - biases we don't know about and those
29:20 - things unfortunately are reflected in
29:23 - the training data and so the question is
29:26 - knowing that
29:29 - how do we deal with
29:31 - that yeah so 100% accurate there are
29:35 - biases in pretty much every single model
29:37 - that's out there which is why it is
29:40 - really critically important to choose
29:42 - the use cases that you're directly
29:44 - applying to the model
29:46 - wisely the
29:49 - biases have a milder impact on some use
29:53 - cases than other like for example if I
29:55 - was going to give you a high stakes
29:57 - assessment score based on a large
29:58 - language model it's proba that is biased
30:01 - is probably not a good idea the way we
30:04 - combat it is by fine-tuning the models
30:09 - based on multiple subgroups continuously
30:12 - monitor those subgroup analyses make
30:15 - sure that we are trying to eradicate as
30:17 - much of as much of the data bias that we
30:21 - can the other aspect of it is when you
30:24 - use these large language models within a
30:26 - use case some times it gets exacerbated
30:29 - by the design of the product itself so
30:31 - you know ensuring that you have D
30:33 - diverse enough teams that you have user
30:36 - research across a wide variety of
30:39 - subgroups that you build the product
30:42 - wisely and without as much bias as you
30:45 - can really helps control any bias that
30:48 - the model itself um generates and then
30:53 - you know even though we all like Joseph
30:55 - mentioned generative AI is how you know
30:57 - know most of us are thinking about AI
30:59 - That's not the end all and Beall of AI
31:02 - there are lots of
31:04 - fantastic um groups open source as well
31:07 - as other um groups that have created AI
31:10 - models that are based on smaller subsets
31:12 - subsets of data that are truly unbiased
31:15 - as much as they could be and you know in
31:18 - a lot of the use cases maybe it's a
31:20 - wiser idea to go with those smaller
31:23 - fine-tuned models than to just apply a
31:26 - large language model
31:27 - model and the only thing I would add and
31:30 - and I actually I regret that I didn't
31:33 - mention you know my answer of what makes
31:36 - this different than other Technologies
31:38 - because I you know my my tagline for
31:39 - technology is technolog is an
31:41 - accelerator it's neutral but large
31:44 - language models are not neutral they are
31:46 - biased that is a difference between this
31:47 - technology and other technologies that
31:49 - we're used to um and so so my the thing
31:52 - I might add is just as we have had to
31:55 - learn that none of your news comes
31:58 - without bias none of it none of your
32:01 - generative AI is going to come without
32:02 - bias and so we have to prepare our
32:05 - students as digital citizens to
32:07 - anticipate the bias that's in the system
32:10 - um we'll work as hard as we can to get
32:12 - it out but in the end we just that needs
32:16 - to be part of what they
32:18 - learn yeah I agree with both of those
32:21 - things of thinking about students and
32:23 - how it gets back to the point where we
32:25 - making earlier about understanding how
32:26 - the work and what's under the hood as
32:28 - they understand what they're doing and
32:30 - then on the work as hard as we can to
32:32 - get it out uh we much of what we have
32:36 - done with conmigo is around prompt
32:38 - engineering and there are things where
32:41 - we have used our content principles
32:44 - around science-based answers and uh some
32:48 - of those kinds of things to direct the
32:51 - model to certain kinds of responses and
32:54 - we do what's called red teaming which is
32:56 - where we all get together and try to
32:57 - break the model and demonstrate find its
33:00 - biases and be able then to work through
33:03 - them but none of that's a 100% which is
33:06 - why we need the other piece about
33:07 - teaching um teaching students what's
33:09 - happening and how to spot biases yeah
33:12 - exactly and and in fact as students
33:15 - understand more about teaching uh about
33:17 - how AI works and how these models are
33:19 - trained and how machine Learning Works
33:21 - how deep learning works and how even
33:23 - like classical AI Works they're better
33:25 - able to make decisions about how to use
33:30 - AI because they understand the technical
33:32 - limitations and thus will hopefully
33:34 - understand the societal implications as
33:36 - well that's the theory um we are running
33:40 - out of time so we're going to go to a
33:41 - lightning round you have a room my my
33:45 - colleagues here I'm actually I'm talking
33:48 - to them but I'm talking about you all uh
33:50 - you are you all are a room full of very
33:53 - influential people in your in your
33:55 - little spheres whether that sphere is
33:56 - the the entire country of Biz or Kosovo
34:01 - or uh just you know a small County like
34:05 - Clark County it's not a small small
34:06 - County uh or a school or a a smaller
34:10 - District a rural District whatever uh an
34:12 - a National Organization like CS for all
34:15 - or uh a more Regional organization um
34:19 - you're all very influential
34:21 - people what would you all like them to
34:25 - think feel or
34:28 - do per AI in
34:30 - education uh moving forward this is uh
34:34 - last
34:36 - words I think so much of the public
34:39 - conversation about AI in education is
34:41 - around things like cheating and how
34:44 - we're going to stop plagiarism and a lot
34:47 - of the potential things that we
34:49 - absolutely need to address but I think
34:51 - we also need to be thinking about the
34:54 - positive uses and the potential use use
34:57 - cases and how this might be to Joseph's
34:59 - Point different than the technology
35:02 - that's come
35:03 - before thank you Christen Engage The
35:06 - more you engage the more you have
35:08 - conversations the more you put forward
35:10 - your use cases the biases you are seeing
35:13 - the better we can develop
35:15 - AI um create a sense of urgency around
35:20 - schools really taking this seriously um
35:24 - every learner deserves to know how the
35:28 - technology works that's influencing
35:31 - every decision that they make in their
35:33 - lives every digital interaction they
35:36 - have is influenced by artificial
35:39 - intelligence they they must know how
35:42 - that works we owe it to them to know
35:44 - what what this invisible technology is
35:47 - we need to make that visible to them and
35:49 - if for no other reason than that um AI
35:51 - needs to be part of our schooling and i'
35:55 - I'd like to end with a practical thing
35:56 - that you already have in your pfolio
35:58 - that uh that mini guide to the AI
36:00 - guidance for schools toolkit you know
36:02 - the steering committee the advisory
36:04 - committee out there for tji worked very
36:06 - hard to push this out early so that
36:09 - schools have guidance even this year and
36:12 - are not waiting yet for another school
36:14 - year to potentially think about guidance
36:17 - around AI now guidance is never going to
36:19 - be definitive but this is a great place
36:21 - to start so I'd just like you all to
36:23 - just consider if you have if within your
36:25 - sphere of influence
36:27 - you are uh supposed to provide guidance
36:30 - on AI whether at the state level the
36:32 - district level the country level just
36:34 - take a look at the toolkit we created it
36:36 - practically uh I mean for practical
36:38 - usage please take a look at it we we
36:40 - hope that whatever you do with it we
36:42 - just hope it leads to what Joseph ended
36:44 - with which is really helping your
36:47 - schools your classrooms take this
36:49 - situation seriously and really use it
36:52 - for good I want to thank my
36:55 - colleagues uh thank you for being here
36:57 - they're going to be here uh the rest of
36:59 - the day at least so please look for them
37:01 - in the hallways and say hi to them thank
37:04 - [Applause]
37:09 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone it's nice to see you all welcome to Vegas we're going to have a lot of fun and we're going to learn a lot about computer science um I have the pleasure of introducing uh three colleagues who I've gotten to know very very well over the last uh five to six months um tachai is an initiative that is led by co.org ETS isty KH Academy and the world economic forum and today we're going to have leaders from ETS isty and K Academy speak on this panel uh with me today unfortunately our our friends at at the world economic Forum chose to stay in Switzerland imagine that but with that I'd like to introduce uh these three uh Kristen desero the chief learning officer of KH Academy come on up nine Mancan head of AI Labs at etss and Joseph South Chief Innovation officer of ISTC okay so if you've ever seen me do a panel uh you know that I like to keep it Lively and I've warned these folks that I might go off script so they are warned also I'd like to engage you all as quickly as possible so rather than save uh the Q&A from the audience for the last five minutes we're actually going to pause Midway through and get to your questions and I believe there are either mic stands out there in the darkness or there are Mike Runners are there Mike stands or Mike Runners all right excellent and so please get ready with your questions we're going to start off with a fun question if if you all could just uh again introduce yourself name title or and then answer one of these three questions what is one thing AI has done for you recently or what is one thing you hope AI can or will do for you or what's one thing you think AI will never be able to do and we'll start off with Kristen hello thanks all for being here today it's I'm really looking forward to this panel and uh and meeting more of you I'm the chief learning officer at Khan Academy as we said and the I've been working in educational technology for oh gosh 20 years now um and AI has given me and us at Khan Academy the ability to create a tutor that we have never been able to do before with technology to be able to have a dialogue with students and we we think that that's going to significantly improve learning outcomes for students so that's really exciting for us and not to not to plug kigo but that's been what we I've been sleeping and dreaming we just realized it really was just about a year ago that we launched the idea for kigo at a hack week internally and it's hack week at Con Academy this week so uh it's been an exciting year and uh so it's an exciting time with thank you for joining us Kristen Narine good afternoon everyone I'm Narine I head AI at ETS um I have a 9yearold and she's learning Tamil uh the language and I don't uh read or write Tamil so I wasn't able to support her because my husband travels but with AI I use it to you know show me the Tamil script in English so that I can help her work I don't think that would have been possible without AI thank you you our mean Joseph hi um it's wonderful to be in a room with Educators um I feel the energy just flowing from you um I it sort of supercharges me to be with you um I'm Joseph South I'm the chief Innovation officer at IST um and the thing that I really really want AI to do is fold my laundry me too me too Joseph and get me a beer um so uh this is a question for all of you um uh superintendent Ebert mentioned this AI guidance for schools toolkit uh that was uh led by the steering committee at tji KH Academy IST ETS and the world economic Forum as well as some coauthors who are part of the advisory committee actually there are many tji advisory committee members here uh this uh at cscom this year but five coauthors led the development of the toolkit as well um uh Ken the Consortium for school networking digital promise uh pace which is the is policy analysis for California education and the European edtech Alliance um this this guidance for schools toolkit actually the four pager is in your padfolio so if you haven't seen it check it out please and there's a full toolkit available on the website in Google doc form as well as web page form we released this toolkit two weeks ago and today uh you know we released that special mini guide what is one thing you hope AI can do for education and what guidance will make that likely and and uh anyone can can begin everybody's looking at me um so what I hope one thing that I hope it will do and I have a I have a list um but one thing I hope is that it will jump start a long overdue conversation about assessment um we have gotten away with outmoded approaches to assessment for far too long and if um you know we the the guidance that will help us is if we Embrace AI as a tool to uplevel our assessment rather than a threat to our assessments then we can make a change towards more relevant more authentic more Competency Based learning thank you Joseph so Joseph I think that was my answer sorry should first because I come from ETS but yes a to what you said CU you know the future is going to be test lless as we know it but since you already said that um My Hope with AI is that it will allow teachers and Educators to offer a more individualized learning to all kinds of students to students in every Walk of Life that we don't have this digital divide anymore and it'll accelerate that learning and the guidance that you know I would give to Educators and all stakeholders really in the edtech space is to engage with the AI to have these conversations to not shy away or ignore but really Embrace The Challenge in front of us I'll build on that I think there's help having teachers have more personalized conversations but I think it's having teachers build those Human Relationships that are so important for student outcomes and if they're spending less time on some of the more rot tasks there's more time available to be able to have those conversations with students to sit down with them over their work but also just about their lives and what they're doing and I think the things we need to do that is to start to be able to find out what can AI do for teachers and what can it do uh to help ease some of that burden all right and uh actually I I'll add to this um I hope that we use this window of opportunity during this time where we're trying to figure out how to incorporate AI in education to examine uh things that actually aren't as much aren't as technical as AI or even computer science but to really examine things like societal bias and uh misinformation in a in a in a new way or in a revitalized way because obviously we see the consequences of students who grow up into adults who don't know how to critically evaluate information and who don't even understand that AI isn't biased we are biased and we're the ones hopefully who need to ultimately uh change and then thus hopefully AI will reflect and mirror that change in us so you know I I'm hoping for things even beyond the teaching of AI or teaching uh how people how to use AI uh Joseph um as as the chief Innovation officer for the international Society for technology and education well done um and ASC by the way you know that they're going to have a new name at some point Jo you can't put him on the I'm not I I always ply him to get like uh updates as to what their new name is going to be because I'm so curious an organization that's so well known they're going to change their name and I'm so curious what that name is going to be yeah well one that our naming Consultants came up with was tangelo but we we went back to the drawing board yeah you fired them and then you uh yeah okay um that wasn't the question though now the real question Joseph um Joseph what's different about this wave of AI hitting schools and the world but let's just focus on schools what's different about this about AI compared to other edtech waves previous and what have we learned from those previous waves that can help us now so there's I think a couple things that are different that I think are probably pretty apparent to anyone in this room the first of all is the speed of adoption um it's been adopted so quickly um there is a recent survey that 35% of Educators in the UK are using AI to do work doing their work um and you have to realize that you know generative AI pretty much became in the public Consciousness in November of last year it it hasn't even been a year um that is a massive rapid adoption and there's a couple reasons for that I think one is one that Bill Gates mentioned at the um 10th anniversary of code.org which I had the privilege of attending um and that is that the infrastructure is already in place for most new technologies you first have to get the infrastructure in place and it's incredibly expensive and it takes a lot of technical ability and then you can bring in the technology we pretty much have the infrastructure the second is that it's conversational anyone not everyone but most people who have the ability to type um can access um AI generative Ai and so the speed is fast um the second thing that I would say that's different is that it's happening across all sectors of society at once um I'm G to pause and make a really important point which is AI that wave already came right a is already here it's already in every aspect of your life it's every nook and cranny it's in every one of the apps on your phone it's it's which groceries are showing on which shelves in your grocery store it's all here a generative AI is hitting us all at once and so as a result usually the policy conversation around new technologies comes to education last but it's coming to us at the same time time as it's coming to the rest of society and as a result we have federal state local leaders International leaders all focused in at the same time and that is really different um not to mention that the people who make the technology are requesting to be regulated requesting guard rails so that's really different um as far as things that we can do or learn from previous waves I think there's three things that I would mention one is that we know it's going to be distributed inequitably every wave of technology has been distributed inequitably and if we know that up front we can start taking steps right now to mitigate that um and banning AI is actually one of the ways you can guarantee an equitable adoption of AI because the people with means are going to have it anyway and the people without will not um second the tech part is the easy part the hard part is building the capacity of Educators to use it effectively for teaching and learning and I mean we have a teacher shortage we are coming out of coid we have the most diverse differentiated student body we've ever had um and getting this on the radar of a teacher is tough and having them be able to use it effectively even harder and then last thing that I'll say is I believe that the most potent use of new technologies is not when we do it to a student but when a student becomes a creator with the new technology yeah you like that I um and that um we can learn from previous waves that if we really want the full impact of this technology we need to put students in the seat of the Creator Joseph will be here till so tomorrow afternoon so please seek him out you can tell that he's a wealth of wisdom and what I appreciate about Joseph it's not just a bunch of talking points though he has those um it's a lot of pragmatism as well and a lot of um um just useful practical knowledge so please seek him out uh in the hallway sorry Joseph you're now going to be swamped um but I I want I want them to uh uh profit from you being here as much as um you being on the tji steering committee so thank you Joseph um Narine I have a question for you uh nine I think I mean I I'm I'm with a whole bunch of really educated people we got Dr derbo Dr South but Narine I'm pretty sure you're the only AI scientist here right Kristen you didn't okay yes uh Narine Narine is the only AI scientist here so Narine AI I think it's quite powerful though he can't fold Joseph's laundry can't get me a beer yet Narine AI is quite powerful right now what's the future of AI short and longer term give us like gaze into that crystal ball let us know what else we might expect and and obviously for this audience how is that relevant for education I like to be an engineer though so if you asked me this question last week Pat I would have said that you know most of the generative AI we're seeing is text based and multimodel would be the next you know obvious Frontier except that open AI already released GPT 4V so we're already there with the multimodel and being able to process images um and PDFs Etc I think in the short term what we're going to see is that accumulation of knowledge as a repository knowledge was distributed it is distributed you have PDFs you have SharePoint you have Google Docs you have stuff all over the place and bringing that conversational piece into that knowledge repository and combining it with generative AI I think we're going to see that very very quickly happen and that's going to impact education because now you can pretty much ask a question whether it's within your domain within your company within your education environment or more generic across the internet in the slightly longer term I see things like personalization combined with generative AI so right now you see you know your grocery list prepopulated or your Netflix recommendation your Spotify song list combining that with generative AI gets you the Persona or the character you're most comfortable with so think of applications in who do you want to talk to at different moments in your life at different times of the day or for different purposes you might want a certain Persona asking reminding you to take your medicines versus a different Persona teaching you math and a different Persona bringing you a grocery list a little longer than that I see skills re and competencies really taking off with this generative AI I think we're almost there uh Dr Glen Glenn yesterday he talked about education currently measuring the product and you know trying to move towards process we've had the concept of performance tasks and situational judgment tasks in education for a long time but they've been really really difficult because of how how resource intensive they are with AI being able to have the data sets have the knowledge I think we're going to very quickly accelerate being able to combine that behavioral the process data or the performance data as well as your explicit response together to start making predictions around the durable skills you know can you think critically are you being empathetic in your conversation can I jump on that quick so when I first met Joseph he was in the US Department of ad and I was making games and trying to work on game based assessment and you may have noticed you don't have a ton of exciting game based Assessments in your classroom and it turns is that because of Joseph sorry I tried I really did try it turns out that they were really expensive and difficult to make and we would spend you know eight months building this game and it would cover like a week of curriculum um and trying to figure out the process data from them and how we were going to pull them together was a Monumental task and I do think that this technology really LeapFrogs us in a way that we're going to be able to do some much more understanding of that process that students are using and how they're how they're having those conversations and maybe get us where we wanted to get 10 years ago that would be awesome um so Kristen actually the next question is for you um tji the initiative is about empowering Educators to teach with AI and about AI how are these different where do they overlap what do we need to teach about AI so we can teach with AI yeah so we and many others are creating these tools for students to use the idea of a chatbot tutor I think we're gonna see ubiquitous in the next couple of months um but for students to really be able to use those effectively they need to have some understanding of what's Happening under the hood so AI can be wrong how do we help students understand that understand when it's most likely to be wrong what kinds of things it's most likely to be wrong about and how they should be thinking critically about the respon responses they're getting from Ai and what that might look like in the same way they're trying to we try to teach them to think critically about the internet search results they get when they do a search that's just one example of the idea that if we're going to be using AI to teach with we need to help students understand what's happening with it in order to be able to be effective consumers of AI and so I think you all are in the s space and I think could be leaders in your schools in terms of helping teachers think about building their own understanding about what's happening with AI and then helping their students understand what's happening with these tools so that they're more effective and critical consumers so so I actually have a a personal anecdote uh relevant to what you just shared Kristen I uh I got taught about how chatbots work and how large large language models work from open ai's Chief technology officer her name is Mera moradi it was through a video so it wasn't personal but and so you all can be taught the same thing too it's uh it's a it's a video uh that we shot with uh her as well as Christ Bal Valenzuela from one Runway another AI company but after merera explained how these chatbots and large language models work it totally changed my ability to potentially use an AI tool as like a a personal therapist because I knew technically what it was doing it was it was going to be hard for me now I feel like it's going to be hard for me now there by the way there's a lot of AI like characters out there character. a uh that are providing informal advice in ways that they probably shouldn't but they are but for me it's not going to work because I know what's happening under the hood and I hope that all kids will be able to uh critically evaluate these apps because they understand what's actually happening under the hood so I really agree with what you just shared we're going to go to audience questions and so I don't know again if there are mic runners or mic stands if there are mic Runners please raise your hand but if out that they're mic Runners yes they're mic Runners so you there's some uh c.org staff with mics in their hands right up so just raise your hand and what I'd like you to do is briefly introduce yourself name and affiliation and then get straight to your question K I'm Jeff Bentley from OMG tech in altero New Zealand um I have a question for kisten uh K Migo has only been out as you said it it's it's probably only what 6 months n months yeah we released March 14th so is there anything that you can tell tell us uh in terms of evaluation about results and how uh the impact that it's been having for students and teachers oh you teed me up for what I was going to talk about in the next session that I'm in but I'll give you a preview so uh we have been learning a lot there are some things that so first of all on uh con Academy for those who aren't aware the kigo can act in a couple of different ways one is what we call Companion mode where it's basically acting like a tutor you're working on a problem on Con Academy often math problems is that's what as our most used courses and conmigo can be there and say hey I'm trying to solve this 2x plus 3 equals 5 I don't know what to do and it acts as a tutor there also a number of other activities that we basically put out as a Sandbox to try things out including including debate me uh write a story with me get feedback on my college admissions essay a bunch of things that we've been just testing what what's sticking what students like what's helping them learn so we have a few things that we've learned in the spring we had a couple of partner districts uh including Newark New Jersey and uh Hobart in Indiana uh who agreed to work with us to let us observe classes interview teachers interview School administrators about where things were so what did we learn from all of this first uh we learned we have set up in the system some moderation so if students are doing things with uh that indicate violence threats of self harm uh sexual content they raise a flag that flag gets to teachers we heard from District administrators we want to see that too um and so the the generalization from that is people are definitely concerned with safety and thinking about how do we know what students are doing when they're interacting with these models so heard and and uh understood and we we've done some new things to build that in so that's the the first piece is concerns about safety um second students uh most liked and most used the companion mode the hey help me solve this problem that I'm working on and I want to talk to you about where this problem is so that was the most used thing we get lots of questions that I'll say they we get what's our error rate on math so uh when you get an answer from kigo you can give a thumbs up or thumbs down and you can write us feedback about what you worked or didn't work there we I will say get about a 2% rate of people saying that it made a mistake and what that looks like so it's interesting um and then in our comparison this is not a randomized control trial this is not uh anything uh where we had much control over who had it and who didn't but we were able to have some schools in the districts that were using it and some schools that were not and we were able to see that the students who were using it got more are this is going to take again more discussion uh we have an internal metric called skills to proficient because on KH Academy you can work from attempted to familiar to proficient to master it on a skill and so we count as an internal metric of learning how many skills students get to proficient because that is the level that tells us they're most likely to see improvements on external assessments uh and so we saw the the the big positive thing for us was we saw students using conmigo got more skills to proficient than students who didn't use it now here is my uh request in order order to really understand how well this is working we need Partners in schools that are willing to share their external assessment data with us in a way that helps us link it to students who are using and not using conmigo and maybe even letting us do some random assignment uh by classes of who gets it and who doesn't and that's from our perspective sometimes hard to find schools that are willing to do that but everyone wants to know if it works or not so uh if you want to know if it works or not think about how you can help us get that evidence that's my pitch Kristen and and Kristen will be here till the end of the day so if you're going to if you're going to holl at her and and say hey we're we're game for sharing our data uh that's the time uh we have other questions out there yes do do do you have a mic testing there we go yes my my question realizing that I'm new to the whole AI large language um model is about the biases when I first heard about it that my mind immediately went to the bias question because you only get out what people put in and so I'm not sure that what is in there is representative of the culture within the world and so I wonder if you could address that a little bit more about how you see it it's not being biased when I went directly to the biases well I I can quickly start by and then I I'll pass it to whoever wants to jump in but um because it relates to something I said earlier uh these models reflect societal bias that's what they do in fact uh I don't know if you know but the the way these generative AI models work is the way machine learning work works is through bias but bias in the sense that you throw a lot of data at it and it learns to make uh uh inferences about other things that's a form of bias um what we're talking about here is our bias as humans in this room uh both uh biases that we know about and biases we don't know about and those things unfortunately are reflected in the training data and so the question is knowing that how do we deal with that yeah so 100% accurate there are biases in pretty much every single model that's out there which is why it is really critically important to choose the use cases that you're directly applying to the model wisely the biases have a milder impact on some use cases than other like for example if I was going to give you a high stakes assessment score based on a large language model it's proba that is biased is probably not a good idea the way we combat it is by finetuning the models based on multiple subgroups continuously monitor those subgroup analyses make sure that we are trying to eradicate as much of as much of the data bias that we can the other aspect of it is when you use these large language models within a use case some times it gets exacerbated by the design of the product itself so you know ensuring that you have D diverse enough teams that you have user research across a wide variety of subgroups that you build the product wisely and without as much bias as you can really helps control any bias that the model itself um generates and then you know even though we all like Joseph mentioned generative AI is how you know know most of us are thinking about AI That's not the end all and Beall of AI there are lots of fantastic um groups open source as well as other um groups that have created AI models that are based on smaller subsets subsets of data that are truly unbiased as much as they could be and you know in a lot of the use cases maybe it's a wiser idea to go with those smaller finetuned models than to just apply a large language model model and the only thing I would add and and I actually I regret that I didn't mention you know my answer of what makes this different than other Technologies because I you know my my tagline for technology is technolog is an accelerator it's neutral but large language models are not neutral they are biased that is a difference between this technology and other technologies that we're used to um and so so my the thing I might add is just as we have had to learn that none of your news comes without bias none of it none of your generative AI is going to come without bias and so we have to prepare our students as digital citizens to anticipate the bias that's in the system um we'll work as hard as we can to get it out but in the end we just that needs to be part of what they learn yeah I agree with both of those things of thinking about students and how it gets back to the point where we making earlier about understanding how the work and what's under the hood as they understand what they're doing and then on the work as hard as we can to get it out uh we much of what we have done with conmigo is around prompt engineering and there are things where we have used our content principles around sciencebased answers and uh some of those kinds of things to direct the model to certain kinds of responses and we do what's called red teaming which is where we all get together and try to break the model and demonstrate find its biases and be able then to work through them but none of that's a 100% which is why we need the other piece about teaching um teaching students what's happening and how to spot biases yeah exactly and and in fact as students understand more about teaching uh about how AI works and how these models are trained and how machine Learning Works how deep learning works and how even like classical AI Works they're better able to make decisions about how to use AI because they understand the technical limitations and thus will hopefully understand the societal implications as well that's the theory um we are running out of time so we're going to go to a lightning round you have a room my my colleagues here I'm actually I'm talking to them but I'm talking about you all uh you are you all are a room full of very influential people in your in your little spheres whether that sphere is the the entire country of Biz or Kosovo or uh just you know a small County like Clark County it's not a small small County uh or a school or a a smaller District a rural District whatever uh an a National Organization like CS for all or uh a more Regional organization um you're all very influential people what would you all like them to think feel or do per AI in education uh moving forward this is uh last words I think so much of the public conversation about AI in education is around things like cheating and how we're going to stop plagiarism and a lot of the potential things that we absolutely need to address but I think we also need to be thinking about the positive uses and the potential use use cases and how this might be to Joseph's Point different than the technology that's come before thank you Christen Engage The more you engage the more you have conversations the more you put forward your use cases the biases you are seeing the better we can develop AI um create a sense of urgency around schools really taking this seriously um every learner deserves to know how the technology works that's influencing every decision that they make in their lives every digital interaction they have is influenced by artificial intelligence they they must know how that works we owe it to them to know what what this invisible technology is we need to make that visible to them and if for no other reason than that um AI needs to be part of our schooling and i' I'd like to end with a practical thing that you already have in your pfolio that uh that mini guide to the AI guidance for schools toolkit you know the steering committee the advisory committee out there for tji worked very hard to push this out early so that schools have guidance even this year and are not waiting yet for another school year to potentially think about guidance around AI now guidance is never going to be definitive but this is a great place to start so I'd just like you all to just consider if you have if within your sphere of influence you are uh supposed to provide guidance on AI whether at the state level the district level the country level just take a look at the toolkit we created it practically uh I mean for practical usage please take a look at it we we hope that whatever you do with it we just hope it leads to what Joseph ended with which is really helping your schools your classrooms take this situation seriously and really use it for good I want to thank my colleagues uh thank you for being here they're going to be here uh the rest of the day at least so please look for them in the hallways and say hi to them thank you
