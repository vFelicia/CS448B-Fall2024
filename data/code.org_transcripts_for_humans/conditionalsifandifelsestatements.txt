inside a conditional block runs if a

00:15 - In puzzles with conditionals, we might want to check a
00:19 - condition, like if path ahead. This code
only, move forward if there is a path ahead.
00:25 - You can use conditionals in lots
of different ways, like this, or this.
00:34 - What if you want something else to happen if
a condition is false?
00:38 - You can use an if-else block for that. This
code will move forward if there is a
00:45 - path ahead. Otherwise, it will turn left.
Your code will either move forward or
00:50 - turn left, but never both. This is helpful
if you want your code to make decisions
00:56 - based on certain conditions.

some more ways you can use conditionals in if-else blocks.
