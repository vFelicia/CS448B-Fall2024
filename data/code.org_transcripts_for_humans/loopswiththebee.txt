00:08 - A loop is a repetition of activity. Going
into a hive to inspect, I look at a frame,
00:17 - and then I put it back. I repeat that same
activity multiple times. It's looping around,
00:22 - doing the same activity multiple times. This
is the repeat block. Whatever you put inside
00:30 - the repeat block will repeat those actions
the number of times that you tell it to. For
00:36 - example, in this level, rather than drag out
move forward and get nectar three times, we're
00:42 - going to just drag them out once each and
repeat the action three times.
00:51 - That made it easy!
