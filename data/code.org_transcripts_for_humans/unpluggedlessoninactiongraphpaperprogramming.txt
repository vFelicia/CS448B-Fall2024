00:11 - so this first lesson we're going to do
00:13 - is
00:14 - using graphing in a very specific way
00:17 - and there's two really important words
00:19 - that we need to know for this lesson as
00:21 - we start it
00:22 - and they are conveniently up here
00:25 - algorithm have you heard that word
00:26 - before no will you say it with me then
00:29 - algorithm
00:31 - thank you
00:32 - does anyone have an idea what could
00:35 - algorithm mean
00:37 - hint hint it's on the wall
00:40 - sean
00:42 - is a set of um
00:44 - to solve a problem
00:46 - right it's a set of steps to solve a
00:48 - problem
00:49 - do you think you guys have ever used an
00:51 - algorithm before yeah yeah like what
00:54 - what what would it be what do you think
00:56 - axel um eight steps or the steps
01:01 - you read my mind i was thinking you guys
01:03 - have all done algorithms because of
01:06 - model drawing you're taking a big
01:07 - problem and you're breaking it down into
01:09 - little steps that are totally doable
01:12 - and then you see the whole process of
01:14 - getting there and you're doing algebra
01:16 - and you don't even know it and then the
01:18 - other word we need to know is program
01:22 - have you guys heard that word before
01:26 - it can mean a lot of different things
01:27 - for this very specific lesson
01:30 - cyan what do you think it means the
01:32 - algorithm that has been coded
01:35 - by a machine hey fantastic
01:38 - you took it right out of my brain again
01:40 - an algorithm that's been coded into
01:42 - something
01:43 - that can be run by a machine so an
01:45 - algorithm's a list of steps great you've
01:48 - got this list of steps
01:50 - but if you want a machine to do that
01:52 - list of steps for you
01:54 - you have to
01:55 - put it into code that the machine knows
01:58 - how to read
01:59 - it's like your dog needs commands
02:02 - to sit and walk and roll over and all
02:05 - that right
02:06 - that's the only anything about your
02:07 - computer that way too your computer
02:09 - needs specific commands to be able to
02:12 - follow a list of steps so before we get
02:15 - deeper into giving computers commands
02:18 - i am going to turn into a robot
02:21 - saw okay
02:23 - okay and i only follow specific
02:26 - instructions
02:28 - i have a very certain list of specific
02:30 - instructions that i follow
02:32 - and my goal as teacher robot
02:35 - is to fill in this graph
02:38 - so that it looks like a checkerboard
02:41 - or another way to think of it is every
02:44 - other square is filled in with blue pen
02:48 - so it started
02:50 - and then your job as a class is going to
02:52 - give me instructions
02:54 - and we'll do this together as a class
02:56 - and then you'll practice with each other
02:57 - so you all will become roblox too
03:01 - but i'll be the robot first i'll be
03:02 - teacher robot and then you'll be student
03:03 - robots
03:05 - so i've got a very specific set
03:07 - of commands
03:10 - voila that are right there
03:13 - so those are the only things that i can
03:15 - follow
03:16 - and my job is to fill in this chart this
03:20 - graph so that every other space is
03:22 - colored in
03:24 - so who can tell me what's this top one
03:26 - lorenzo
03:28 - move one square right
03:30 - okay what's the next one harry move one
03:33 - square left okay
03:35 - next one scion move one square up okay
03:38 - next one
03:40 - audrey
03:41 - move one skip a square down okay and the
03:44 - very last one arian
03:47 - fill in square with color okay so if i
03:50 - start here this is my starting point
03:54 - what would you tell me
03:55 - to do next this one is done for us but
03:57 - let's pretend it's not so let's pretend
04:00 - if i was starting here
04:02 - would you tell me
04:03 - move one scare right would you say
04:06 - move one square left
04:07 - would you say move one square down
04:09 - because i'm going to get here and then
04:11 - fill this in so from starting what would
04:14 - be the very first command
04:16 - what do you guys think talk with your
04:17 - table groups real quick and what would
04:19 - the first command be
04:23 - okay when you're ready to tell me about
04:24 - your pinky's in the air yeah
04:26 - like you're drinking tea
04:30 - okay so
04:31 - uh
04:32 - raeanne's table group will you tell me
04:34 - what's my first movement from the start
04:38 - move one square right okay i'm going to
04:39 - write that down move
04:42 - one
04:45 - square right
04:49 - okay
04:50 - i also can write and talk as a robot
04:53 - okay so i moved one square right what's
04:55 - my very next job robot command
04:59 - robot command command anya what do i do
05:02 - next
05:04 - fill and square with color okay so this
05:05 - is step two
05:14 - okay fill and square the color okay did
05:16 - that
05:18 - what's my very next
05:20 - what's my very next movement
05:23 - very next movement
05:25 - ethan
05:27 - okay so now i'm here move one square
05:29 - right
05:39 - and
05:42 - that's a lot of learning that's a lot of
05:44 - writing my robot arm is so tired of
05:46 - writing and making this pretty pattern
05:48 - on our graph
05:50 - i wonder what i could do
05:54 - to make the writing
05:55 - not so
05:58 - laborious not so difficult could i draw
06:01 - a symbol
06:02 - to represent what if we did this move
06:05 - one square right
06:07 - is an arrow moving right how about that
06:10 - okay how about move one square left left
06:13 - an arrow moving left
06:16 - okay
06:18 - and then here's the really tricky one
06:20 - move one square up
06:22 - okay
06:24 - and then what's the next one airplane
06:27 - okay and then what should i do for
06:28 - filling with colors it's like drawing
06:30 - time
06:31 - with color i could can i do like
06:34 - little scribbles and then maybe an arrow
06:37 - that's kind of funny
06:38 - meaning like
06:41 - scribble this one that you're on
06:42 - yeah does that make sense to you yeah so
06:45 - then if i was going to do another one
06:47 - with a different pattern
06:49 - it would be a lot less writing of the
06:52 - algorithm right
06:54 - right so before we do that as a class
06:56 - again i want you guys to practice
07:05 - so sometimes it's really tricky for kids
07:07 - to figure out
07:09 - which direction they should read or
07:10 - write instructions and for this age
07:13 - group i found it's really easy for them
07:15 - to just do it and figure it out together
07:17 - as a group or with their partner for
07:19 - younger ages though i would be specific
07:21 - about if it's left to right if you're
07:23 - making a column of instructions and that
07:25 - takes out that frustration when they're
07:27 - working together as a partner
07:32 - so another thing that's confusing to
07:34 - kids is the fill in square
07:37 - symbol
07:38 - because it's the fill-in symbol and then
07:40 - there's a down arrow so kids sometimes
07:42 - think they need to move down to do that
07:45 - but what i explain to the kids is you're
07:46 - staying on that square and filling it in
07:49 - and the way i filled it on the board
07:50 - looks a lot like the symbol so that
07:52 - reinforces
07:53 - what it's instructing them to do
07:59 - so
08:00 - when we're thinking about that activity
08:01 - that we just did
08:03 - our commands are up here move right move
08:05 - left move up move down fill in color
08:08 - what if
08:10 - that last command wasn't fill in color
08:14 - but what if it was lay brick
08:17 - what could you use that for
08:19 - building
08:20 - building have you used that before have
08:23 - you guys ever played
08:25 - isn't that don't you lay bricks in
08:27 - minecraft yeah just click left i thought
08:29 - you just run around that's that's
08:31 - essentially what you're doing though too
08:33 - right you're moving around and then
08:35 - you're laying a brick down instead of
08:36 - filling in color
08:38 - so little did you know you were doing an
08:40 - algorithm for minecraft does that make
08:42 - sense do you guys have questions
08:45 - jack how is it computer programming if
08:47 - it's on a piece of paper right we're not
08:49 - using a computer how does that work
08:52 - so one of the biggest things of computer
08:54 - programming is something called
08:55 - computational thinking
08:57 - and it's like
08:58 - it's training your brain
09:00 - to pay attention to what you do every
09:02 - day in your life you take big problems
09:04 - and you break them down into small
09:05 - pieces that you can solve
09:07 - that's what computational thinking is
09:09 - and it's figuring out ways that you can
09:11 - solve
09:12 - any kind of problem either with other
09:14 - people or alone or for any kind of
09:17 - reason
09:18 - so if you're training your brain to
09:19 - think that way
09:20 - without a computer when you start
09:22 - working on computer and working in
09:24 - coding with computers
09:26 - you're set up for anything you want to
09:28 - do it's like the math you're learning in
09:30 - fourth grade
09:31 - you'll be amazing when you do
09:33 - algebra and calculus in high school and
09:35 - college because you've got that
09:36 - foundation that's what the computational
09:38 - thinking is that's what we're doing now

Cleaned transcript:

so this first lesson we're going to do is using graphing in a very specific way and there's two really important words that we need to know for this lesson as we start it and they are conveniently up here algorithm have you heard that word before no will you say it with me then algorithm thank you does anyone have an idea what could algorithm mean hint hint it's on the wall sean is a set of um to solve a problem right it's a set of steps to solve a problem do you think you guys have ever used an algorithm before yeah yeah like what what what would it be what do you think axel um eight steps or the steps you read my mind i was thinking you guys have all done algorithms because of model drawing you're taking a big problem and you're breaking it down into little steps that are totally doable and then you see the whole process of getting there and you're doing algebra and you don't even know it and then the other word we need to know is program have you guys heard that word before it can mean a lot of different things for this very specific lesson cyan what do you think it means the algorithm that has been coded by a machine hey fantastic you took it right out of my brain again an algorithm that's been coded into something that can be run by a machine so an algorithm's a list of steps great you've got this list of steps but if you want a machine to do that list of steps for you you have to put it into code that the machine knows how to read it's like your dog needs commands to sit and walk and roll over and all that right that's the only anything about your computer that way too your computer needs specific commands to be able to follow a list of steps so before we get deeper into giving computers commands i am going to turn into a robot saw okay okay and i only follow specific instructions i have a very certain list of specific instructions that i follow and my goal as teacher robot is to fill in this graph so that it looks like a checkerboard or another way to

what do you guys think talk with your table groups real quick and what would the first command be okay when you're ready to tell me about your pinky's in the air yeah like you're drinking tea okay so uh raeanne's table group will you tell me what's my first movement from the start move one square right okay i'm going to write that down move one square right okay i also can write and talk as a robot okay so i moved one square right what's my very next job robot command robot command command anya what do i do next fill and square with color okay so this is step two okay fill and square the color okay did that what's my very next what's my very next movement very next movement ethan okay so now i'm here move one square right and that's a lot of learning that's a lot of writing my robot arm is so tired of writing and making this pretty pattern on our graph i wonder what i could do to make the writing not so laborious not so difficult could i draw a symbol to represent what if we did this move one square right is an arrow moving right how about that okay how about move one square left left an arrow moving left okay and then here's the really tricky one move one square up okay and then what's the next one airplane okay and then what should i do for filling with colors it's like drawing time with color i could can i do like little scribbles and then maybe an arrow that's kind of
