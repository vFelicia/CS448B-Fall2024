00:10 - let's imagine we have a lot of fish in
00:12 - an aquarium
00:14 - there are different shapes colors and
00:16 - lengths
00:17 - so we can set up a fish class with
00:20 - instance variables specific to each fish
00:23 - in the tank
00:25 - but what if we need information that is
00:27 - shared between the fish
00:30 - in that case
00:31 - we keep track of this type of
00:33 - information using something called a
00:35 - static variable
00:37 - a static variable
00:39 - is a variable defined in a class that
00:41 - stores a shared value across all
00:44 - instances of the class
00:47 - when is a static variable useful or
00:49 - necessary
00:51 - if you need to keep track of information
00:53 - over all instances that is for every
00:56 - object then it may be necessary
01:00 - let's go back to our aquarium we have
01:02 - information about this aquarium that is
01:04 - related to each individual fish like
01:07 - length and color
01:09 - each value is unique to a particular
01:11 - fish
01:12 - those are instance variables
01:15 - we also have information that is related
01:17 - to all the fish not unique to each
01:19 - individual
01:20 - for example
01:22 - water temperature number of fish and
01:24 - last fish added
01:26 - this information should be stored in
01:28 - static variables
01:30 - let's look at the number of fish
01:32 - this variable called num fish
01:35 - holds the total number of fish added to
01:37 - the aquarium
01:39 - let's create a static variable by
01:41 - writing static
01:43 - then add the data type
01:45 - then the name of the variable num fish
01:49 - and set it to a value
01:51 - now
01:52 - in any part of our fish class we can
01:55 - modify this num fish variable
01:58 - in our case we can modify num fish in
02:00 - our constructor by incrementing by one
02:04 - that way whenever a new fish is created
02:07 - numb fish is increased by one
02:11 - even though they're called static
02:13 - variables they can be changed
02:16 - we now have the ability to encapsulate
02:18 - data within each object like a fish and
02:22 - also be able to store data at the class
02:24 - level as well
