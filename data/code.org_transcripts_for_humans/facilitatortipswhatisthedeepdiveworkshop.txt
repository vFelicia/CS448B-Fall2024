00:05 - code.org's deep dive workshop for cs
00:07 - fundamentals teachers is really designed
00:09 - for folks who are already in the
00:10 - classroom and already implementing
00:12 - unlike the introductory workshop which
00:14 - is really for folks who are still trying
00:15 - to figure out if they want to teach the
00:17 - course this workshop is really really
00:19 - focused on helping you identify and
00:21 - address the barriers that you see in
00:22 - your classroom right now
00:24 - the deep dive and introductory workshops
00:26 - are often offered together and when we
00:29 - do that there are two one-day workshops
00:31 - it's really important to note that in
00:33 - order to attend the deep dive workshop
00:34 - you don't actually have to go to the
00:36 - introductory workshop so in situations
00:38 - where schools and districts are offering
00:40 - both we recommend that there's at least
00:43 - one month in between the two to give
00:45 - those teachers who have gotten started
00:47 - through the intro workshop time to
00:49 - implement before they come to the deep
00:51 - dive
00:52 - the deep dive workshop is built around
00:54 - really achieving three goals with the
00:56 - teachers
00:57 - first is to help them identify and
00:59 - address the barriers that are keeping
01:01 - them from implementing the course in the
01:02 - way they want
01:03 - the second is to help them improve and
01:06 - expand their teaching practice by really
01:08 - exploring the curriculum and getting
01:10 - hands-on
01:12 - and the third is to help them plan for
01:14 - the future and plan to go above and
01:16 - beyond what they're already doing with
01:18 - cs fundamentals in their classroom
01:20 - all of the activities that we do during
01:22 - the workshop are in service of helping
01:24 - achieve these goals with our teachers
01:27 - let's start with barriers and supports
01:30 - we start our day at the deep dive
01:31 - workshop trying to really understand and
01:33 - draw out the challenges and barriers
01:36 - that teachers are facing in their
01:37 - classrooms and in their schools right
01:39 - now this is why it's so important that
01:41 - they've started teaching the course
01:42 - already if you haven't started teaching
01:44 - you might not know what questions you're
01:45 - going to have
01:47 - during this time we're pulling out the
01:49 - real life challenges that folks have and
01:51 - we're not trying to answer them all in
01:53 - the moment but we are trying to figure
01:54 - out how we can answer them over the
01:56 - course of the day that's why we start
01:58 - with barriers and supports but we
02:00 - certainly don't end that in the first
02:02 - couple of hours it's something that we
02:03 - do for the whole workshop
02:05 - the middle section of the agenda in the
02:07 - deep dive workshop is really focused on
02:09 - using the curriculum with your students
02:12 - we spend time here thinking about
02:14 - instructional strategies and classroom
02:16 - practices like supporting debugging
02:18 - practices with your students and really
02:20 - leveraging the code.org tools in order
02:22 - to manage your classroom but we also
02:25 - focus on using lessons themselves and
02:28 - the instructional practices that
02:29 - teachers can can really exemplify during
02:32 - those lessons in order to build an
02:34 - inclusive environment in their classroom
02:37 - during this period of time teachers are
02:39 - getting hands-on experience as learners
02:41 - and as teachers in order to get better
02:44 - context for how this stuff can work in
02:46 - their classroom and with their kids
02:48 - we finished the day with planning and
02:50 - this is planning in the form of both
02:52 - lesson planning and implementation
02:54 - planning
02:55 - in lesson planning time we're trying to
02:57 - help teachers think really concretely
02:59 - about how they will take the written
03:00 - lesson that's on the code.org website
03:03 - and then use it with their students this
03:05 - is how you take the activities and turn
03:07 - them into action
03:09 - implementation planning time is flexible
03:11 - time focused on giving people space to
03:14 - coordinate with other people who have
03:16 - similar constraints so tech teachers
03:18 - with tech teachers classroom teachers
03:20 - with classroom teachers to go forward
03:22 - and make a concrete plan for how they're
03:24 - going to implement cs fundamentals in
03:26 - the rest of the year
03:28 - [Music]
03:37 - you
