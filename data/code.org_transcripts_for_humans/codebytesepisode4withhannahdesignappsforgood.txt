00:21 - hello and welcome to code bite today
00:24 - we're going to be learning all about
00:26 - making
00:27 - apps for good we're gonna make two apps
00:30 - together both for good causes so
00:33 - this week we're celebrating the hour of
00:36 - code and millions of students are
00:38 - learning basic computer science and the
00:41 - hour of code has actually passed one
00:43 - billion student engagements reaching
00:46 - students in every city and every country
00:49 - in the world my name is hannah walden
00:51 - i'm a curriculum developer at code.org
00:54 - and this is my nephew joining me today
00:56 - leo who's going to be helping us out hi
00:58 - leo hi
01:00 - hi
01:02 - uh thank you

01:08 - fantastic all right and we are also
01:10 - joined by you at home so many students
01:12 - that want to learn to code in our huge
01:14 - global classroom even more students are
01:17 - joining in as we're getting started here
01:19 - so let's actually look at the map and
01:22 - see who's with us here today

01:52 - who are joining us today
01:54 - so before we get started on our main
01:56 - content uh this week in addition to
01:59 - being computer science education week i
02:01 - guess as a part of computer science
02:03 - education week there's a lot of
02:05 - birthdays that we've been celebrating so
02:07 - yesterday we celebrated grace hopper's
02:10 - birthday
02:11 - and today
02:12 - we are going to celebrate someone else's
02:15 - birthday so i'm going to share my screen
02:17 - now
02:18 - so you can see
02:21 - who we are going to
02:23 - celebrate all right so
02:25 - happy birthday
02:26 - aydah lovelace
02:29 - all right leo
02:31 - based on this picture i just want you to
02:33 - give me kind of a guess what do you what
02:35 - do you think aydah lovelace is famous
02:38 - for
02:39 - any ideas
02:41 - um
02:44 - being pretty
02:46 - yeah i'm looking at this here maybe you
02:48 - know olympic gold in fan holding or
02:52 - something like that
02:54 - uh no actually ada lovelace um
02:58 - she is known for being the first
03:00 - programmer um way back in the 19th
03:03 - century she was born in 1815 and she was
03:06 - the daughter of the poet lord byron and
03:09 - uh byron was kind of known for being uh
03:11 - sort of a wild guy um and so aydah's
03:15 - mother decided that uh she didn't want
03:18 - aydah going down that pathway so she
03:20 - decided that she was going to be tutored
03:21 - in mathematics
03:23 - well aydah uh not only succeeded in
03:25 - mathematics and became a fantastic
03:27 - mathematician um she also
03:30 - retained some of the wild child side
03:32 - which i think is fantastic uh and her um
03:37 - you know she had this outlook on life
03:39 - that uh when she was you know looking at
03:42 - math and science and things like that
03:43 - she called it a poetical science which i
03:45 - think is really cool but anyway the
03:47 - thing that she programmed she was
03:49 - friends with charles babbage and he had
03:50 - this idea for this analytical engine um
03:53 - which
03:54 - was never fully built but it would look
03:55 - like this if it had been built during
03:57 - his time
03:58 - and essentially it was a way to
03:59 - calculate numbers uh different equations
04:02 - and things like that and ada she uh
04:04 - wrote some notes about how this machine
04:06 - was used and uh basically ended up
04:09 - writing the first algorithm the first
04:11 - program that really showed how this
04:14 - machine could be used uh to go even
04:16 - further than just calculating basic
04:17 - equations so we
04:20 - credit ada with being the first
04:21 - programmer and i love her she's
04:23 - fantastic so that
04:25 - is our story about ada lovelace
04:27 - so i'm gonna stop sharing now and leo uh
04:30 - we're gonna talk a little bit about you
04:32 - now um because i think it'd be great if
04:34 - everybody got to know you a little bit
04:35 - better uh so you can can you tell us a
04:37 - little bit more about yourself how old
04:39 - you are some of your interests where you
04:40 - live um i'm 16. i live in durham and i
04:46 - like
04:47 - reading writing and drawing
04:50 - ah all very good indoor activities for
04:54 - pandemic yeah so you live in durham
04:56 - north carolina and uh so when you are
05:00 - able to go outdoors what are the kind of
05:02 - activities you like doing outdoors
05:04 - um i like hiking
05:06 - and
05:08 - like picnics and just spending time with
05:10 - family outside on walks
05:12 - oh that's great because today we're
05:15 - gonna build an app uh that is all
05:17 - related to the outdoors but it has kind
05:20 - of a twist on it it's not just about the
05:21 - outdoors it's about volunteering for the
05:24 - outdoors and every time i've been down
05:26 - in durham to visit you i just noticed
05:28 - that there's a wonderful community there
05:30 - people like to help each other out do
05:31 - you like getting involved in the
05:33 - community there yeah i really like
05:34 - volunteering a lot
05:36 - yeah great all right so uh let's let's
05:39 - build this app together so to kick us
05:41 - off i'm gonna share my screen
05:45 - there we go uh and let's take a look at
05:47 - the basics of this app uh before we
05:50 - build a couple additions to it so this
05:51 - is our do-more durum app and we've got
05:54 - two buttons on this screen and if i
05:56 - click on the veggie button
05:58 - this is going to take me to a page with
06:01 - some links to websites that you can
06:03 - volunteer at different community gardens
06:05 - in durham
06:06 - and what i want to show you here is that
06:08 - i can click on the home button and i can
06:10 - go back so i can navigate i'm going to
06:12 - go here to my parks this is what we're
06:14 - going to be building and i can navigate
06:15 - back so there's all different ways i can
06:17 - use my app if i click on the seeds
06:19 - button i can continue on and then i go
06:22 - to the website so let's build this
06:25 - together leo you ready
06:28 - all right so here we are this is app lab
06:32 - and what's so great about app lab is
06:34 - that you can design the look and feel of
06:37 - your app make it just as you want so
06:40 - i've already got the home screen here
06:42 - but like i said we're gonna build the
06:44 - park screen together so you can notice
06:46 - it's just a blank screen here uh so leo
06:49 - um maybe you could guide me here if i
06:52 - want to make some buttons on my screen
06:54 - what would i do
06:55 - uh you would drag out the button element
06:59 - yeah right there so i'm dragging out the
07:00 - button element i can resize it i can
07:03 - make it big i can make it little
07:05 - um
07:06 - and the first button this is going to
07:09 - take us to
07:10 - the eno river association what do you
07:13 - know about the eno river leo um there's
07:16 - a lot of good trails it's along the
07:18 - water there's marshes and
07:21 - it's very
07:22 - um
07:23 - it's very important to people in durham
07:25 - i guess
07:26 - yeah yeah so we want to keep it really
07:28 - nice we want to protect it so there's
07:30 - lots of volunteer opportunities there
07:32 - so we're going to call this
07:34 - the eno button
07:36 - and this is going to take us information
07:38 - about the eno river
07:40 - association uh now leo um looking at
07:44 - this button
07:46 - what do you think about it do you want
07:47 - to change the way it looks at all
07:49 - um
07:51 - don't make it a circle
07:53 - all right let's make it a circle so if
07:55 - we go down to the bottom here i can
07:58 - change the border radius and all i have
08:00 - to do is push these arrows up and down
08:02 - and i can change you can see on the
08:04 - screen but it's changing how much the
08:06 - radius is so let's i'm going to bump
08:08 - this way up
08:10 - uh
08:10 - and kind of drag it around
08:13 - and i've got a circle
08:15 - okay fantastic all right so let's make
08:18 - another button and i can just duplicate
08:20 - this so it looks exactly the same
08:22 - and this button is going to go to
08:25 - durham central park
08:27 - and durham central park also has a lot
08:30 - of ways you can get involved in your
08:31 - community and volunteer
08:33 - so let's just change this to we'll call
08:36 - this
08:36 - the central button
08:39 - durham central park
08:42 - okay all right that's looking okay i'll
08:44 - show you one other thing leo uh when i
08:46 - click on this screen here i can change
08:49 - the background of it
08:51 - so i'm gonna choose an image here
08:53 - and i'll just choose that same bridge
08:55 - from the first picture
08:56 - okay that's looking
08:58 - all right
08:59 - um
09:01 - let's see maybe maybe we should make the
09:02 - borders a little bit thicker what do you
09:04 - think yeah
09:05 - okay
09:06 - so let's go down and we're going to make
09:09 - them
09:10 - a little bit thicker i think 10 looks
09:12 - good and maybe a different color what
09:13 - color do you like
09:14 - um
09:15 - blue
09:16 - okay try out a blue
09:19 - i kind of like that
09:21 - all right i'm going to copy this color
09:23 - and remember that my border width was 10
09:25 - and do the same thing here
09:27 - so my border width is 10.
09:30 - and there we go okay that's looking
09:31 - pretty pretty good um but actually you
09:35 - know what there's another way that we
09:37 - can change the look and feel for our app
09:39 - we can use themes so those of you at
09:42 - home this is where you're going to get
09:43 - involved you're going to help us pick a
09:46 - theme so a couple different options here
09:48 - we've got lemonade that's how that would
09:51 - look we've got watermelon
09:54 - we've got
09:55 - let's see um crushed velvet
09:59 - and
10:00 - peachy all right let's throw up a poll
10:01 - and see uh what people at home want to
10:03 - do
10:05 - all right
10:06 - seeing some some answers come in here
10:09 - let's give it three more seconds three
10:12 - two one and close the poll
10:15 - all right uh
10:16 - what do we got here leo
10:18 - uh lemonade's the winner lemonade is the
10:21 - winner
10:22 - i do like that nice and clean that looks
10:24 - good all right so uh let's run our app
10:27 - um
10:28 - i click here uh uh-oh
10:31 - why is it not working leo
10:36 - i haven't programmed it i haven't told
10:38 - it to do anything
10:39 - so let's let's do that
10:42 - um so i was just in design mode now i'm
10:45 - going to go to code mode it's time to
10:46 - program this app um but let's actually
10:49 - see if people at home know what we need
10:51 - to do so basically what i want to have
10:53 - happen is when i click on this button i
10:55 - want to go to not that one i want to go
10:58 - to this screen
11:00 - so
11:01 - knowing that
11:03 - all of you at home we're going to throw
11:04 - up a poll which block should we use to
11:06 - change the screen when the button is
11:08 - clicked we could use an on event button
11:11 - a set check button show element or set
11:13 - screen let's put the poll up
11:16 - all right
11:19 - answers are coming in
11:21 - all right all right
11:23 - we'll give it two more seconds
11:25 - one two and let's close the poll
11:28 - all right
11:29 - so what do you see here leo what's the
11:31 - top choice
11:32 - uh set screen
11:34 - all right yeah so this is actually kind
11:36 - of a trick question
11:38 - there are two blocks that we need to
11:40 - change the screen we do need the set
11:43 - screen block and then we also need the
11:45 - the second choice here that i see is the
11:47 - most popular second most popular choice
11:49 - which was the on event block so well
11:51 - done everybody nice job
11:54 - all right so
11:55 - let's go here we're going to drag out
11:57 - this on event block now if you have been
12:00 - watching any of the other code break
12:02 - code by episodes
12:04 - um you'll know that we've been talking a
12:06 - lot about events so events trigger when
12:09 - you do something so when we click on
12:12 - this button
12:13 - we're gonna go somewhere
12:15 - so this button is called the park button
12:17 - let's go ahead and change that
12:20 - fantastic okay leo and where are we
12:22 - gonna go when we click the park button
12:24 - uh park screen
12:26 - yeah so we're going to grab this set
12:28 - screen
12:30 - and we're going to go to the park screen
12:31 - let's test it out
12:33 - it works
12:34 - but nothing's working here so now we
12:36 - need to program these buttons
12:39 - so we need to use our
12:40 - on event again
12:42 - and this is the
12:44 - let's go
12:45 - to our park screen and i can hover over
12:47 - to see what it is this is the eno button
12:49 - so we go to the eno button and now we
12:52 - want to go to this website so what i'm
12:54 - going to do is i'm going to copy the url
12:56 - bring it back over here
12:58 - and i'm going to grab all the way down
12:59 - at the bottom of the toolbox there's
13:01 - this really great block called the open
13:03 - block
13:04 - and this will open a website
13:06 - so we don't want to open the code.org
13:08 - website
13:09 - i'm going to paste in the eno river
13:11 - website so that works um and now to do
13:15 - this button we're just going to
13:17 - copy paste
13:19 - there we go um and we just got to change
13:21 - it up so not the eno button which button
13:23 - is that leo that's the
13:27 - looks like the central button
13:30 - and let's grab the url here
13:34 - pull it in okay let's test it out run
13:37 - here central
13:39 - and we're going to our website and it
13:41 - works
13:42 - all right um one quick last thing that
13:45 - we should have done in our design mode
13:48 - when we're on the park screen we should
13:50 - make a home button so we can go back to
13:52 - the home screen so i'm just going to
13:53 - grab home
13:54 - grab a button out here i'm going to call
13:56 - it my home button
13:59 - um
14:00 - and uh let's see this is my home button
14:03 - number two because i have one on the
14:04 - other screen
14:06 - and let's see let's um
14:10 - let's grab an image here to put there
14:12 - i'm gonna choose icons and i can search
14:15 - for
14:17 - pop that in there and there now now i
14:19 - just need to program it
14:21 - do the same thing gonna grab copy paste
14:25 - and now i'm gonna do my home button and
14:27 - that is gonna go to not gonna open
14:29 - something
14:30 - i'm gonna set the screen
14:32 - and go to the home all right we're ready
14:34 - let's test it out here here
14:36 - and i go home here here and i go home
14:39 - all right but this is not as exciting as
14:41 - testing it out on your phone so all of
14:44 - those of you at home or leo you can grab
14:46 - your phones and you can actually scan
14:49 - this qr code that is up on the screen
14:51 - right now
14:53 - and we're gonna see what this app looks
14:55 - like on leo's phone go ahead and pull it
14:58 - up leo you got it
15:00 - uh
15:01 - yep all right i'm gonna stop sharing so
15:03 - we can see all right go ahead and uh
15:04 - click on one of the
15:07 - there we go all right perfect it works
15:09 - exactly as expected so that was our
15:11 - first app great job uh and i hope that
15:14 - was useful
15:16 - now the second app that we're going to
15:17 - make i'm super excited about this one
15:19 - this one's really fun
15:21 - um
15:22 - so
15:23 - i think you know when we think about
15:24 - making apps for good we think about
15:25 - things like volunteer opportunities
15:27 - which is great uh we can also think
15:29 - about ways that we can help our mental
15:31 - health uh so i don't know leo have you
15:33 - ever seen those youtube videos that are
15:36 - pep talk videos that are like you got
15:37 - this you can do this uh you know a
15:40 - little girl standing up in the mirror
15:42 - saying i'm the best i got this i know i
15:44 - can do this
15:45 - yeah
15:46 - yeah i love those they're so great all
15:49 - right so
15:50 - we can make one of those so we're gonna
15:52 - try that out together um and see how
15:55 - this goes so i'm gonna share my screen
15:57 - again
15:59 - and
16:00 - here we go
16:01 - so here's my app i'm gonna click on this
16:04 - little photo button here i'm gonna
16:06 - choose a photo um and pop it up and see
16:10 - what happens
16:12 - leo does that look familiar
16:14 - i wonder who that is
16:17 - that was from the last time you visited
16:18 - me up in maine in the winter
16:21 - kind of a long time ago um but it says
16:23 - today is your day so uh it pops it up on
16:27 - your um
16:28 - on the screen you kind of basically are
16:30 - able to take a selfie um or choose a
16:32 - photo from your file and i'm gonna stop
16:34 - sharing and i'm going to actually show
16:36 - you all what this looks like on my phone
16:38 - so here is
16:41 - my phone you can sort of see it when i
16:42 - twist it a little bit i'm going to click
16:44 - this button
16:45 - i'm going to take a photo so now i'm
16:47 - going to embarrass myself
16:52 - um and i choose to use that one
16:56 - and then it says on there you are
16:58 - amazing
17:00 - all right so now we're gonna build this
17:02 - app
17:04 - and i'm gonna share my screen again so
17:06 - we can do this
17:08 - here we go
17:11 - okay so i've already got the basics laid
17:13 - out but i'm missing one button so this
17:16 - is the button that gets something from
17:18 - my camera leo any idea what button that
17:20 - might be
17:21 - um photo select yeah the one that looks
17:24 - like a camera
17:25 - great choice okay um
17:28 - i'm gonna refresh my screen because it
17:29 - seems like it's not working right now
17:31 - there we go
17:33 - so i'm going to drag this out
17:36 - i'm going to call this the photo select
17:38 - button and now let's program it
17:40 - so here's how this works
17:42 - when my photo button is clicked
17:45 - when it's changed actually that's what
17:46 - happens when you when you tap on it it's
17:48 - changed it's going to get a picture from
17:50 - your camera and put it on the screen to
17:53 - do that we're going to grab
17:55 - um
17:57 - set image url this block and this is
18:00 - going to set the picture
18:01 - right here the picture output and we're
18:03 - not going to put it to the code.org logo
18:06 - we're going to put it to the picture
18:07 - that shows up here and to do that we're
18:09 - going to grab
18:10 - this block get image
18:13 - and we're going to get the image
18:15 - from photo select and that's all we have
18:16 - to do let's test it out
18:18 - so run
18:19 - and click
18:21 - uh let's see
18:23 - all right since i embarrassed you
18:24 - there's me as a kid
18:26 - and your mom
18:28 - all right
18:29 - great picture but there's no encouraging
18:31 - statement we got to get that up on the
18:32 - screen so the last part we need to do
18:34 - now is we need to get set text
18:39 - there it is
18:40 - um and we're gonna get something from
18:43 - our uh list up here but before we do
18:46 - that audience um we've got a couple
18:48 - different things that we're saying here
18:49 - today is amazing today is your day
18:51 - believe in yourself a whole bunch of
18:52 - options but let's see what options you
18:54 - want to include in our list so go ahead
18:57 - and answer the poll
18:59 - let's see our top two options
19:03 - we're gonna give it two more seconds
19:05 - two one and closing the poll
19:08 - all right leah what are the top two
19:10 - uh reach for the stars and you are
19:12 - strong
19:14 - reach for the stars
19:16 - and you are strong all right
19:20 - here we go
19:24 - perfect
19:25 - okay now
19:26 - uh so we're gonna set the text of our
19:29 - text output to one of these items
19:32 - uh and so let's actually jump over here
19:34 - and talk a little bit about what's going
19:36 - on here so here's my list and this is
19:39 - the first the original list before we
19:40 - added stuff on and when you have a list
19:43 - in javascript which is the language
19:44 - we're programming in the list has a name
19:47 - which goes over here and then each item
19:50 - in the list is at a different location
19:52 - so this is location zero because in
19:54 - computer science we start counting at
19:56 - zero so even though we have three items
19:59 - in our list
20:00 - we have
20:01 - only
20:02 - all the way up to location two so this
20:04 - is location zero location one and
20:07 - location two
20:09 - so let's test out our audience now i'm
20:11 - gonna print out the encouragement at
20:13 - location one what will be printed uh so
20:16 - let's throw up the poll which statement
20:18 - do you think is going to print at
20:20 - location one
20:23 - all right and three
20:25 - two one let's close it
20:28 - what's the answer there leo today is
20:30 - your day today is your day and indeed
20:33 - today is your day because great job
20:35 - people at home you got the right answer
20:37 - you are amazings at position zero today
20:39 - your day is at position one and then
20:42 - believe in yourself is that position two
20:45 - so let's use this information to program
20:48 - our app last part of it
20:50 - all right so
20:52 - um what we're going to do here
20:54 - is we're going to use this list block
20:57 - because we want to get something from
20:58 - the list
20:59 - so encouragement
21:02 - and then in between these square
21:03 - brackets we want to put the location of
21:05 - the phrase we want to put in here
21:07 - but we don't want
21:09 - to choose just one one thing from this
21:11 - list we want it to be anything from this
21:12 - list it's totally random so we're going
21:14 - to use a random block
21:16 - and now leo i need your help here
21:18 - now this random block is telling me to
21:20 - pick something between 1 and 0 and 10.
21:22 - but we wanted to pick something between
21:24 - the first item in the list and the last
21:26 - item in the list so what's the location
21:28 - of the first item in the list zero yeah
21:31 - and the last one
21:33 - four
21:34 - four yeah zero one two three four
21:37 - fantastic
21:38 - all right so with that we're gonna run
21:40 - it
21:42 - and we're gonna test it out i'll put my
21:44 - picture in there and it works all right
21:47 - so like i said before this is not as fun
21:50 - uh if you're not doing it on your phone
21:53 - so let's share this out you at home can
21:55 - also try this uh when you try it on your
21:57 - phone you're not going to get my picture
21:59 - you're going to get your picture your
22:01 - selfie picture with an encouraging
22:02 - statement to kind of give you a a boost
22:05 - today so leo go ahead and
22:08 - scan the code you get it
22:10 - all right i'm going to stop sharing
22:12 - all right leo can you show us what you
22:14 - have

22:47 - own apps you can either watch the
22:49 - recording of this and follow along or
22:51 - you can try out the intro to app lab our
22:55 - code tutorial and that's at code.org app
22:58 - lab
22:59 - and we want to see all the apps that you
23:01 - make for good causes so if you do make
23:04 - an app go ahead and click share and

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to code bite today we're going to be learning all about making apps for good we're gonna make two apps together both for good causes so this week we're celebrating the hour of code and millions of students are learning basic computer science and the hour of code has actually passed one billion student engagements reaching students in every city and every country in the world my name is hannah walden i'm a curriculum developer at code.org and this is my nephew joining me today leo who's going to be helping us out hi leo hi hi uh thank you great no i'm i'm in 11th grade fantastic all right and we are also joined by you at home so many students that want to learn to code in our huge global classroom even more students are joining in as we're getting started here so let's actually look at the map and see who's with us here today oh wow okay so we've got people all over north america we've got some in alaska in canada is that venezuela down there uh my screen's kind of small can't quite see that uh looks like we've got some over in uh in afghanistan wow we've got people all over the world this is really great i live up in maine which is in the northeast corner of the united states so it's exciting to see all these people who are joining us today so before we get started on our main content uh this week in addition to being computer science education week i guess as a part of computer science education week there's a lot of birthdays that we've been celebrating so yesterday we celebrated grace hopper's birthday and today we are going to celebrate someone else's birthday so i'm going to share my screen now so you can see who we are going to celebrate all right so happy birthday aydah lovelace all right leo based on this picture i just want you to give me kind of a guess what do you what do you think aydah lovelace is famous for any ideas um being pretty yeah i'm looking at this here maybe you know olympic gold in fan holding or something like that uh no actually ada lovelace um she is known for being the first programmer um way back in the 19th century she was born in 1815 and she was the daughter of the poet lord byron and uh byron was kind of known for being uh sort of a wild guy um and so aydah's mother decided that uh she didn't want aydah going down that pathway so she decided that she was going to be tutored in mathematics well aydah uh not only succeeded in mathematics and became a fantastic mathematician um she also retained some of the wild child side which i think is fantastic uh and her um you know she had this outlook on life that uh when she was you know looking at math and science and things like that she called it a poetical science which i think is really cool but anyway the thing that she programmed she was friends with charles babbage and he had this idea for this analytical engine um which was never fully built but it would look like this if it had been built during his time and essentially it was a way to calculate numbers uh different equations and things like that and ada she uh wrote some notes about how this machine was used and uh basically ended up writing the first algorithm the first program that really showed how this machine could be used uh to go even further than just calculating basic equations so we credit ada with being the first programmer and i love her she's fantastic so that is our story about ada lovelace so i'm gonna stop sharing now and leo uh we're gonna talk a little bit about you now um because i think it'd be great if everybody got to know you a little bit better uh so you can can you tell us a little bit more about yourself how old you are some of your interests where you live um i'm 16. i live in durham and i like reading writing and drawing ah all very good indoor activities for pandemic yeah so you live in durham north carolina and uh so when you are able to go outdoors what are the kind of activities you like doing outdoors um i like hiking and like picnics and just spending time with family outside on walks oh that's great because today we're gonna build an app uh that is all related to the outdoors but it has kind of a twist on it it's not just about the outdoors it's about volunteering for the outdoors and every time i've been down in durham to visit you i just noticed that there's a wonderful community there people like to help each other out do you like getting involved in the community there yeah i really like volunteering a lot yeah great all right so uh let's let's build this app together so to kick us off i'm gonna share my screen there we go uh and let's take a look at the basics of this app uh before we build a couple additions to it so this is our domore durum app and we've got two buttons on this screen and if i click on the veggie button this is going to take me to a page with some links to websites that you can volunteer at different community gardens in durham and what i want to show you here is that i can click on the home button and i can go back so i can navigate i'm going to go here to my parks this is what we're going to be building and i can navigate back so there's all different ways i can use my app if i click on the seeds button i can continue on and then i go to the website so let's build this together leo you ready all right so here we are this is app lab and what's so great about app lab is that you can design the look and feel of your app make it just as you want so i've already got the home screen here but like i said we're gonna build the park screen together so you can notice it's just a blank screen here uh so leo um maybe you could guide me here if i want to make some buttons on my screen what would i do uh you would drag out the button element yeah right there so i'm dragging out the button element i can resize it i can make it big i can make it little um and the first button this is going to take us to the eno river association what do you know about the eno river leo um there's a lot of good trails it's along the water there's marshes and it's very um it's very important to people in durham i guess yeah yeah so we want to keep it really nice we want to protect it so there's lots of volunteer opportunities there so we're going to call this the eno button and this is going to take us information about the eno river association uh now leo um looking at this button what do you think about it do you want to change the way it looks at all um don't make it a circle all right let's make it a circle so if we go down to the bottom here i can change the border radius and all i have to do is push these arrows up and down and i can change you can see on the screen but it's changing how much the radius is so let's i'm going to bump this way up uh and kind of drag it around and i've got a circle okay fantastic all right so let's make another button and i can just duplicate this so it looks exactly the same and this button is going to go to durham central park and durham central park also has a lot of ways you can get involved in your community and volunteer so let's just change this to we'll call this the central button durham central park okay all right that's looking okay i'll show you one other thing leo uh when i click on this screen here i can change the background of it so i'm gonna choose an image here and i'll just choose that same bridge from the first picture okay that's looking all right um let's see maybe maybe we should make the borders a little bit thicker what do you think yeah okay so let's go down and we're going to make them a little bit thicker i think 10 looks good and maybe a different color what color do you like um blue okay try out a blue i kind of like that all right i'm going to copy this color and remember that my border width was 10 and do the same thing here so my border width is 10. and there we go okay that's looking pretty pretty good um but actually you know what there's another way that we can change the look and feel for our app we can use themes so those of you at home this is where you're going to get involved you're going to help us pick a theme so a couple different options here we've got lemonade that's how that would look we've got watermelon we've got let's see um crushed velvet and peachy all right let's throw up a poll and see uh what people at home want to do all right seeing some some answers come in here let's give it three more seconds three two one and close the poll all right uh what do we got here leo uh lemonade's the winner lemonade is the winner i do like that nice and clean that looks good all right so uh let's run our app um i click here uh uhoh why is it not working leo i haven't programmed it i haven't told it to do anything so let's let's do that um so i was just in design mode now i'm going to go to code mode it's time to program this app um but let's actually see if people at home know what we need to do so basically what i want to have happen is when i click on this button i want to go to not that one i want to go to this screen so knowing that all of you at home we're going to throw up a poll which block should we use to change the screen when the button is clicked we could use an on event button a set check button show element or set screen let's put the poll up all right answers are coming in all right all right we'll give it two more seconds one two and let's close the poll all right so what do you see here leo what's the top choice uh set screen all right yeah so this is actually kind of a trick question there are two blocks that we need to change the screen we do need the set screen block and then we also need the the second choice here that i see is the most popular second most popular choice which was the on event block so well done everybody nice job all right so let's go here we're going to drag out this on event block now if you have been watching any of the other code break code by episodes um you'll know that we've been talking a lot about events so events trigger when you do something so when we click on this button we're gonna go somewhere so this button is called the park button let's go ahead and change that fantastic okay leo and where are we gonna go when we click the park button uh park screen yeah so we're going to grab this set screen and we're going to go to the park screen let's test it out it works but nothing's working here so now we need to program these buttons so we need to use our on event again and this is the let's go to our park screen and i can hover over to see what it is this is the eno button so we go to the eno button and now we want to go to this website so what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy the url bring it back over here and i'm going to grab all the way down at the bottom of the toolbox there's this really great block called the open block and this will open a website so we don't want to open the code.org website i'm going to paste in the eno river website so that works um and now to do this button we're just going to copy paste there we go um and we just got to change it up so not the eno button which button is that leo that's the looks like the central button and let's grab the url here pull it in okay let's test it out run here central and we're going to our website and it works all right um one quick last thing that we should have done in our design mode when we're on the park screen we should make a home button so we can go back to the home screen so i'm just going to grab home grab a button out here i'm going to call it my home button um and uh let's see this is my home button number two because i have one on the other screen and let's see let's um let's grab an image here to put there i'm gonna choose icons and i can search for pop that in there and there now now i just need to program it do the same thing gonna grab copy paste and now i'm gonna do my home button and that is gonna go to not gonna open something i'm gonna set the screen and go to the home all right we're ready let's test it out here here and i go home here here and i go home all right but this is not as exciting as testing it out on your phone so all of those of you at home or leo you can grab your phones and you can actually scan this qr code that is up on the screen right now and we're gonna see what this app looks like on leo's phone go ahead and pull it up leo you got it uh yep all right i'm gonna stop sharing so we can see all right go ahead and uh click on one of the there we go all right perfect it works exactly as expected so that was our first app great job uh and i hope that was useful now the second app that we're going to make i'm super excited about this one this one's really fun um so i think you know when we think about making apps for good we think about things like volunteer opportunities which is great uh we can also think about ways that we can help our mental health uh so i don't know leo have you ever seen those youtube videos that are pep talk videos that are like you got this you can do this uh you know a little girl standing up in the mirror saying i'm the best i got this i know i can do this yeah yeah i love those they're so great all right so we can make one of those so we're gonna try that out together um and see how this goes so i'm gonna share my screen again and here we go so here's my app i'm gonna click on this little photo button here i'm gonna choose a photo um and pop it up and see what happens leo does that look familiar i wonder who that is that was from the last time you visited me up in maine in the winter kind of a long time ago um but it says today is your day so uh it pops it up on your um on the screen you kind of basically are able to take a selfie um or choose a photo from your file and i'm gonna stop sharing and i'm going to actually show you all what this looks like on my phone so here is my phone you can sort of see it when i twist it a little bit i'm going to click this button i'm going to take a photo so now i'm going to embarrass myself um and i choose to use that one and then it says on there you are amazing all right so now we're gonna build this app and i'm gonna share my screen again so we can do this here we go okay so i've already got the basics laid out but i'm missing one button so this is the button that gets something from my camera leo any idea what button that might be um photo select yeah the one that looks like a camera great choice okay um i'm gonna refresh my screen because it seems like it's not working right now there we go so i'm going to drag this out i'm going to call this the photo select button and now let's program it so here's how this works when my photo button is clicked when it's changed actually that's what happens when you when you tap on it it's changed it's going to get a picture from your camera and put it on the screen to do that we're going to grab um set image url this block and this is going to set the picture right here the picture output and we're not going to put it to the code.org logo we're going to put it to the picture that shows up here and to do that we're going to grab this block get image and we're going to get the image from photo select and that's all we have to do let's test it out so run and click uh let's see all right since i embarrassed you there's me as a kid and your mom all right great picture but there's no encouraging statement we got to get that up on the screen so the last part we need to do now is we need to get set text there it is um and we're gonna get something from our uh list up here but before we do that audience um we've got a couple different things that we're saying here today is amazing today is your day believe in yourself a whole bunch of options but let's see what options you want to include in our list so go ahead and answer the poll let's see our top two options we're gonna give it two more seconds two one and closing the poll all right leah what are the top two uh reach for the stars and you are strong reach for the stars and you are strong all right here we go perfect okay now uh so we're gonna set the text of our text output to one of these items uh and so let's actually jump over here and talk a little bit about what's going on here so here's my list and this is the first the original list before we added stuff on and when you have a list in javascript which is the language we're programming in the list has a name which goes over here and then each item in the list is at a different location so this is location zero because in computer science we start counting at zero so even though we have three items in our list we have only all the way up to location two so this is location zero location one and location two so let's test out our audience now i'm gonna print out the encouragement at location one what will be printed uh so let's throw up the poll which statement do you think is going to print at location one all right and three two one let's close it what's the answer there leo today is your day today is your day and indeed today is your day because great job people at home you got the right answer you are amazings at position zero today your day is at position one and then believe in yourself is that position two so let's use this information to program our app last part of it all right so um what we're going to do here is we're going to use this list block because we want to get something from the list so encouragement and then in between these square brackets we want to put the location of the phrase we want to put in here but we don't want to choose just one one thing from this list we want it to be anything from this list it's totally random so we're going to use a random block and now leo i need your help here now this random block is telling me to pick something between 1 and 0 and 10. but we wanted to pick something between the first item in the list and the last item in the list so what's the location of the first item in the list zero yeah and the last one four four yeah zero one two three four fantastic all right so with that we're gonna run it and we're gonna test it out i'll put my picture in there and it works all right so like i said before this is not as fun uh if you're not doing it on your phone so let's share this out you at home can also try this uh when you try it on your phone you're not going to get my picture you're going to get your picture your selfie picture with an encouraging statement to kind of give you a a boost today so leo go ahead and scan the code you get it all right i'm going to stop sharing all right leo can you show us what you have all right and go ahead and click the button and take a selfie of yourself fantastic all right and show us oh i love it and what does it say you are strong you are strong good job leo you are strong all right and that is it that is our show thank you everybody for joining us today a couple of notes for you all um if you want to learn how to make your own apps you can either watch the recording of this and follow along or you can try out the intro to app lab our code tutorial and that's at code.org app lab and we want to see all the apps that you make for good causes so if you do make an app go ahead and click share and share it on social media and use the hashtag hourofcode or even the hashtag codebytes we'll find it and we love to see all the creative things you make make sure also that you tune in tomorrow for minecraft heroes journey which is going to be a really interesting episode i'm really looking forward to it i think it's going to be a lot of fun and that's it so thanks for helping me out today leo no problem all right bye everyone you
