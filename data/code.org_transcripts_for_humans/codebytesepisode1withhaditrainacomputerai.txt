01:24 - b
01:43 - here we are
01:46 - yeah all right sophia already
01:50 - i think we're live really
01:53 - yeah okay
02:16 - hi everybody this is hadi partovi i'm
02:19 - the creator of the hour of code and the
02:21 - ceo of code.org and i'm here with my
02:23 - daughter
02:24 - sophia hi sophia and this is our first
02:27 - episode of code bytes
02:29 - uh you know this week is the computer
02:30 - science education week and collectively
02:32 - we're celebrating
02:34 - the hour of code which is you know this
02:36 - global celebration of computer science
02:39 - uh today and every day of this week
02:41 - millions of students all around the
02:43 - world are going to be coding
02:45 - and what's exciting wait let me turn off
02:47 - my background this is weird
02:48 - hold on a second i'm going to turn off
02:51 - my zoom background
02:52 - so um every day of this week millions of
02:56 - students around the world are going to
02:57 - be doing the hour of code
02:58 - and this is an idea the hour of code is
03:00 - something that i came up with
03:02 - just eight years ago and it's been
03:03 - incredible that over the past eight
03:05 - years
03:05 - one billion times an hour of code has
03:08 - been done
03:09 - uh now today we're not going to be
03:10 - together for an entire hour this is
03:12 - going to be fast we're calling this code
03:13 - bytes
03:14 - uh because it's little bite-sized
03:16 - lessons so we're going to be together
03:18 - for about
03:18 - maybe 20 25 minutes i know lots of
03:22 - students have school days whether you're
03:23 - in school or whether you're doing remote
03:25 - learning
03:25 - we want to support students doing an
03:28 - hour of code and you're part of
03:29 - something much much larger than the
03:31 - hundreds of students that are online
03:33 - right now uh you know
03:34 - because there's going to be literally
03:36 - millions of people around the world
03:37 - coding today uh sophia are you ready
03:40 - sure all right so first we're gonna
03:43 - today we're gonna learn
03:45 - about artificial intelligence
03:48 - or a.i sophia do you know what
03:51 - artificial intelligence is
03:53 - yeah um okay i always say get the
03:56 - um definition mixed up but um it's a
03:59 - computer or
04:01 - like a technology that um doesn't need
04:04 - to be explicitly
04:05 - programmed to do something yeah that's
04:08 - really
04:09 - advanced we've explained it ai is
04:11 - generally just
04:12 - when a computer does something that
04:13 - seems really smart like it's got
04:15 - it seems to have human intelligence and
04:17 - it's a way of programming computers to
04:19 - learn
04:20 - um but before we talk about this i want
04:22 - to find out where all of our students
04:24 - are from
04:24 - we had a qr code at the beginning for
04:26 - people to show where they are on the map
04:28 - but instead of using that i'm going to
04:29 - ask everybody to use the chat so if you
04:31 - click on the little chat button at the
04:32 - bottom of your screen
04:34 - if you're in the chat uh choose a little
04:37 - drop down that looks like this that says
04:39 - to all panelists and attendees
04:42 - that way you'll be able to types and
04:43 - everybody can see what you type
04:45 - and if you could just type in the
04:46 - location you're calling in from
04:48 - so we can see where everybody's calling
04:50 - from i hope this works
04:54 - maybe you need to enable the chat the
04:57 - chat might be i'm
04:58 - not enabled for people uh-oh
05:01 - also a serious problem here where's my
05:04 - bug
05:05 - we don't don't worry about that all
05:07 - right it does look like the chat is
05:09 - enabled but let's go on to learning
05:10 - about ai
05:11 - so what we're going to do is we're going
05:12 - to teach a computer
05:14 - how to recognize stuff but let me first
05:17 - start by saying
05:18 - um if if uh
05:22 - to do this together with sophia sophia
05:24 - i'm going to show you a face and you
05:26 - tell me if i'm angry or i'm sad
05:28 - okay ready set go
05:31 - i think that's angry how about this
05:34 - that's happy at least it should be
05:39 - okay so you can recognize my face easily
05:41 - now but what's
05:42 - what a i can try to do is recognize that
05:44 - same thing but what happens if you don't
05:46 - see the entire face
05:48 - now what am i that's still angry
05:51 - how about this
05:54 - happy i think maybe surprised
05:57 - i i don't know that's not really scared
06:00 - but i'm
06:01 - sad how about if i show you this way
06:09 - [Music]
06:11 - so i'm showing you that because ai can
06:13 - sometimes recognize things like humans
06:15 - and sometimes it can do even better
06:16 - because it sees more than the
06:18 - than just a part of the picture so we're
06:20 - going to go
06:21 - use a tutorial where we can teach an ai
06:24 - something
06:25 - so give me just one second i'm going to
06:27 - share my screen
06:29 - sharing screen so where we are
06:33 - is that the code.org ai for oceans
06:35 - tutorial
06:38 - and what you can see is uh
06:42 - this ai for oceans where you can program
06:44 - something to
06:45 - program the ai if you go into it we're
06:47 - going to program ai to recognize fish
06:50 - and to distinguish what is fish and what
06:52 - is not fish
06:53 - so to help clean the oceans so sophia
06:56 - the more we program this the better ai
06:58 - learns so tell me is this a fish
07:00 - no are you sure i think so
07:04 - all right it's not a fish how about that
07:06 - no nothing she just rotated
07:09 - how about this one that's a fish this
07:11 - one's a fish
07:12 - how about this yes this is a fish that's
07:14 - a fish
07:16 - yes to fish i think that's a fish
07:19 - of course it's a fish what about that
07:21 - kind of looks like a fish when you first
07:22 - see it i know it's not
07:23 - not a fish and look over here is showing
07:26 - how many times we've trained ai
07:28 - so how about this that's a fish how
07:31 - about this
07:32 - that's a fish that's not a fish not a
07:35 - fish
07:36 - yes a fish no definitely not a fish
07:40 - not a fish it should know this one by
07:42 - now but so now we've given
07:43 - ai 13 different things to go from do you
07:45 - think that's enough for it to learn
07:47 - i don't think so well let's continue and
07:49 - see what happens
07:51 - so now ai's gonna get to decide on its
07:55 - own based on the training we gave it we
07:56 - gave it 13 examples let's see how
07:59 - how well it learned i don't think it's
08:01 - gonna work
08:06 - see what dad you couldn't put a gasoline
08:09 - in the ocean
08:12 - so we can go quickly so okay it is doing
08:15 - a really really bad job
08:17 - let's see and if i finish continuing to
08:20 - see all the things that it's trained
08:25 - so this shows what it put in the ocean
08:26 - it said all of these
08:28 - classified these as fish yeah and if we
08:31 - see what it says was
08:32 - not fish okay it did pretty well at
08:34 - recognizing the not fish it didn't put
08:36 - any
08:37 - fish into the trash well
08:40 - so now if we want we can click to train
08:42 - more
08:43 - to get it a little bit smarter so help
08:45 - me a little bit out with this
08:46 - is this fish yes
08:49 - fish fish you can also do this the way
08:53 - where you try to get all the garbage
08:55 - into the ocean for fun but in real life
08:57 - you probably should that's not
08:59 - fun that is not fun
09:02 - so i'm gonna do this fast because i know
09:04 - what's fishing that's fish that's fish
09:06 - that's fish that's fish
09:09 - that's fish all right now let's see if
09:11 - it does much better we gave it 28
09:13 - examples
09:14 - so tell me is the computer doing well
09:16 - wait
09:18 - but when i did this i gave it like 130
09:21 - examples just to be
09:22 - safe there's a tire in there
09:27 - did it still make a mistake ah it's
09:29 - still making mistakes
09:31 - so what we realized is to get ai to get
09:33 - actually smart to do recognition
09:35 - you need to give it a lot more training
09:37 - than what we did so even though we gave
09:38 - it 28 examples
09:40 - that was still not enough to recognize
09:42 - fish from trash
09:44 - so you can see it still is putting all
09:46 - sorts of garbage in the ocean wait but
09:48 - we see the locker
09:49 - you want to see the not garbage right
09:51 - you get a fish in there
09:54 - dad you created them
09:57 - you did better when before with less
10:00 - training it did better yeah oh that's
10:02 - terrible
10:03 - you're you're taking out the fish now
10:06 - right so one of the things we
10:07 - i want to show is how ai can actually be
10:10 - used to train a computer something that
10:11 - it didn't know
10:12 - and by the way check it out the the chat
10:15 - has now been turned on
10:16 - so now people can type everywhere that
10:18 - they're from so they're calling from
10:20 - india from arizona from lebanon
10:23 - maharashtra indiana texas
10:26 - canada michigan new york it's going
10:30 - super fast only like see colorado
10:33 - massachusetts
10:34 - georgia miami toronto
10:38 - it is going way too fast to see all this
10:41 - that's pretty awesome
10:44 - all right so one of the things i want to
10:45 - show is we just showed how to recognize
10:47 - fish from not fish but we can teach ai
10:49 - to do
10:50 - other things as well so let's teach the
10:52 - ai how to recognize a word
10:54 - that it never learned before all right
10:56 - so let me
10:57 - share the screen again one second
11:03 - all right so now we want to teach the ai
11:05 - a new word
11:07 - so everybody who's there chatting can
11:09 - you all instead of chatting
11:11 - where you're from look at these words on
11:13 - screen
11:14 - and tell me what word should we teach ai
11:17 - we want to teach it to recognize a type
11:18 - of fish
11:19 - it could be a delicious fish it could be
11:21 - a happy fish
11:23 - it could be a playful fish
11:28 - people are saying scary fun
11:30 - [Music]
11:32 - silly personal favorite is delicious
11:36 - all right let's choose from the ones
11:37 - that people have chosen scary is coming
11:40 - up a lot so i'm going to choose scary
11:41 - we're going to teach
11:42 - what's a scary fish all right so is that
11:45 - scary
11:46 - that fish just looks quite funny
11:50 - all right this one's not scary right no
11:53 - but the next one is
11:54 - this one is definitely scary look at
11:56 - those angry eyes
11:57 - spooky how about this one no not scary
12:01 - how about this one not scary
12:05 - not scary this one's got funny teeth
12:08 - but scary but but it's really kind eyes
12:11 - what do you say for this one
12:12 - yeah not scary definitely not
12:16 - not scary right this fish looks kind of
12:20 - scary right
12:21 - now definitely the next one does and
12:23 - this one is definitely scary
12:26 - this one's not so scary so sophia can
12:28 - you go through this really quickly and
12:29 - do like
12:30 - 50 of them or even more that one's kind
12:33 - of
12:33 - yeah go quickly without talking about it
12:35 - so as sophia's training this
12:37 - there's a couple of things to think
12:38 - about one is what are the features of
12:40 - the fist she's looking at
12:41 - to decide what is or isn't scary is she
12:44 - looking at the eyes is she looking at
12:46 - the mouth
12:47 - there's another question which is is it
12:48 - even fair to decide whether fish is
12:51 - scary or not based on its looks
12:53 - now maybe for an animal that might be
12:54 - fair but when ai is
12:56 - being trained when we train machine
12:59 - machines to do things based on what they
13:01 - see
13:02 - there's a really important question are
13:03 - we teaching them to be fair or not fair
13:05 - and in fact did you know that scientists
13:07 - in
13:09 - in europe are already training ai
13:13 - to recognize from human faces whether
13:15 - somebody looks trustworthy or not
13:17 - that's a terrible way to use ai to
13:19 - suggest that
13:20 - a computer can detect whether or not
13:22 - they can trust you based on the look of
13:24 - your face that's just not fair at all
13:26 - so it's really important when people
13:29 - train ai
13:30 - why is this fish where's the mouth of
13:32 - the fish it's got a really big
13:34 - separated from the fish's body
13:37 - all right that's scary so my point from
13:40 - what i was saying is just because you
13:41 - can train a computer to do something it
13:43 - doesn't necessarily mean it's a good
13:44 - thing to do that
13:45 - so training to recognize whether a fish
13:47 - is scary or not that may just sound kind
13:49 - of fun
13:50 - but doing that with human faces and
13:51 - trying to decide if somebody is
13:52 - trustworthy based on their look is not
13:54 - okay
13:55 - so we've done this 59 times now let's
13:57 - see did ai learn what
13:59 - sofia believes is scary yeah this is my
14:01 - opinion
14:02 - yeah it's important to know that we just
14:04 - taught it sophia's biased opinion of
14:06 - what is or isn't scary somebody else
14:08 - might choose something different
14:11 - so somebody might have thought those
14:12 - sharp teeth were scary
14:15 - so let's go through this really fast and
14:17 - get a whole bunch of
14:18 - fish that one with a smile was not scary
14:22 - did you see it okay
14:26 - all right so i'm continuing on these are
14:27 - all the scary things okay
14:29 - that squiggly one at the very bottom
14:32 - this one
14:33 - yeah that's kind of funny but one of
14:35 - these was just not scary at all
14:37 - let's see like we can look in fact if
14:39 - you click on one if you click on this
14:41 - one you can click on the i
14:43 - and find out why did it think it was
14:44 - scary because it had scary eyes
14:48 - right there how come this one was scary
14:51 - its
14:52 - eyes weren't scary but it thought its
14:53 - body and its tail and its mouth were
14:55 - scary
14:56 - that's
15:00 - yeah yeah this one its eyes weren't
15:03 - scary but because it had a dorsal fin
15:05 - and a scary looking tail and i think
15:08 - we've labeled enough of the s-shaped
15:09 - fish this
15:10 - snake scary that i just thought all the
15:12 - snakes are scary because it has a scary
15:14 - looking body
15:15 - so you can tell why ai thinks different
15:18 - things are scary like this has scary
15:20 - eyes
15:20 - or this has
15:23 - this one it's because of its eyes but
15:25 - also its mouth
15:27 - so ai doesn't know what is or isn't
15:30 - scary
15:31 - it is learning from what you tell it and
15:33 - you gave it only 58 examples and that's
15:35 - what it's going from
15:36 - so obviously when you train a real
15:38 - computer to do stuff using ai
15:40 - it needs a lot more information than
15:41 - that but since we have only 20 minutes
15:44 - to go
15:45 - or 20 minutes total we have about less
15:47 - than about 10 minutes to go
15:49 - we don't have enough time to train it
15:50 - with enough data now i want to train
15:53 - something
15:53 - more complicated to show ai which is
15:56 - american sign language
15:58 - does anybody know what sign language is
16:00 - what is sign language
16:01 - used for it's um
16:04 - a language used for people that can't
16:07 - people that are deaf
16:08 - people who can't hear or people who
16:10 - can't speak if somebody can't speak they
16:12 - also need to use signs
16:14 - and also if they can't hear they need to
16:15 - use signs as well so i want to
16:18 - teach a computer to recognize a very
16:20 - short word
16:22 - using sign language so if you google
16:25 - sign language this is the american sign
16:27 - language but
16:28 - i want to teach it to recognize code so
16:32 - we're going to make a code spelling so
16:34 - can you spell this out
16:36 - how do you spell a c that's a c
16:39 - and then do an o o
16:42 - and then do a d it's a d and then an
16:45 - e that's an e great so now we want to
16:48 - take a computer to recognize those
16:51 - letters from each other
16:52 - we're going to go into something called
16:53 - teachable machine you can just google
16:55 - teachable machine to find it
16:58 - and we're going to make an image project
17:00 - which is going to recognize different
17:01 - images
17:02 - and we're going to make it recognize a
17:05 - bunch of things the letter
17:07 - c we're going to differentiate that from
17:09 - the letter
17:11 - o and then
17:14 - the letter d and then lastly
17:19 - the letter e we want to teach it all of
17:22 - these
17:22 - letters so we're going to use our webcam
17:26 - to train it
17:27 - what okay
17:30 - okay sophia we're using one camera to
17:32 - show us up here
17:34 - and a different camera that's now being
17:36 - trained over here so you show the letter
17:38 - c make it a good one
17:42 - and i'm going to click hold to record
17:44 - and now move it around a little bit
17:46 - keep doing it okay we gave it 18 images
17:49 - of c
17:51 - that's enough no that's okay it'll make
17:53 - mistakes
17:54 - i'm gonna keep changing these cameras
17:56 - here do you want okay now show the
17:58 - letter o
17:59 - make it really different than the c
18:01 - ready i'm going to record it
18:02 - bring it bring your hand closer a little
18:04 - bit move it around
18:07 - okay we have 20 images of o's now we're
18:10 - going to do a letter
18:11 - d this shouldn't quite recognize it
18:14 - my finger ready okay
18:17 - [Music]
18:21 - all right and then lastly the letter e
18:24 - each time we're doing this we're giving
18:26 - the computer example images make sure
18:28 - this doesn't look like an
18:29 - o i don't think it does at least i don't
18:32 - think it does either but the computer
18:34 - might get confused
18:35 - so now that we did that we're going to
18:38 - train the model
18:38 - we've given it 23 images of these 20
18:42 - 20 that has about 80 different images to
18:44 - look at as its training
18:46 - which that adds up to a lot more than
18:48 - the you know
18:49 - 15 fish that we showed it but that's not
18:51 - a lot of images
18:52 - so the question is is that going to be
18:54 - enough for the computer to learn how to
18:56 - do this or not
18:57 - training an ai the more images you get
18:59 - it the better it's going to get and in
19:01 - fact
19:01 - when computer scientists use this when
19:03 - when people talk about cars that learn
19:05 - to drive themselves
19:07 - they're training the ai to recognize
19:09 - street signs what is a pedestrian what
19:11 - is a road
19:12 - have you ever been on a website where
19:15 - the website asks you
19:16 - which of these things are traffic lights
19:18 - or which of these things or something
19:19 - else
19:21 - yeah you're actually when you're doing
19:22 - that you're training an ai
19:24 - to to do this uh to recognize
19:27 - street things from each other so now
19:29 - let's see our ai has
19:31 - already been trained and let me change
19:33 - the webcam
19:34 - and it's already yelling okay all right
19:37 - so now show it the letter c
19:41 - and look over here it says with 70
19:44 - likelihood
19:45 - it knows this way
19:48 - it knows that that's a c now show an o
19:52 - and no it definitely got that you have
19:54 - an o
19:55 - now show letter d it's having trouble
19:59 - with that one bring it down a little bit
20:00 - or move it
20:01 - oh it got it yeah it knows that that's a
20:03 - d and i'll show the e
20:08 - it's struggling with this one if you
20:10 - move it a little bit so basically as
20:12 - you're
20:12 - recognizing down here the computer can
20:14 - tell what you're doing
20:16 - and now i want to show something else we
20:17 - can do this with this you can
20:20 - export this model and we just train the
20:23 - ai and we can
20:24 - upload what we trained to the internet
20:28 - what yeah you haven't seen this before
20:30 - and now we have a url
20:32 - this right here is a web page that can
20:35 - recognize what we just did or we can
20:37 - even take this
20:38 - and put it in code so i over here
20:42 - have code that i've written to make our
20:44 - own web page
20:46 - if i hit play and we can edit the code
20:50 - to do whatever we want with it
20:53 - wait for the camera to start wait for it
20:56 - ready come on
21:06 - all right maybe it's not going to go
21:09 - well let's try this
21:10 - other way that's actually quite funny
21:12 - okay
21:13 - so if i take this model
21:16 - that we copied i can open it in a new
21:19 - new url
21:24 - and look here's a web page that's a
21:25 - brand new web page that you can
21:27 - basically
21:29 - turn on maybe it's having trouble
21:31 - because of
21:32 - my other camera being on well
21:36 - when it does work oh here it is so
21:39 - here's this camera that finally turned
21:40 - on it's very glitchy though
21:43 - it's glitchy can you show it the letter
21:45 - o it got it
21:46 - try the letter put the letter
21:50 - d it's having trouble my finger is right
21:54 - there there i got it i'll put the letter
21:56 - e
21:59 - it's confusing the d and the e because
22:01 - i'm not seeing your finger but
22:03 - now let's see if how it does with my
22:04 - hand it got the letter c
22:07 - you got the letter it doesn't get the
22:10 - letter okay
22:17 - okay if it doesn't work very well for my
22:19 - hand because we only trained it on your
22:20 - hand
22:21 - sideway so what we just saw there is we
22:25 - just trained the ai
22:26 - how to recognize the sign language those
22:29 - four letters using your hand but we
22:31 - didn't train it using my hand
22:33 - and so the computer can only see when
22:35 - you're showing signs
22:36 - not what i'm doing and this shows
22:37 - another part of what it means to train
22:40 - an ai and how to avoid training bias
22:42 - because if you train an ai to learn and
22:45 - recognize
22:45 - only one type of thing from one type of
22:48 - person
22:48 - and not a broad representation of people
22:51 - you don't get as good a sense
22:53 - of how it works or you know it might not
22:55 - work fairly or equally for some people
22:58 - this happens very much in today's day
23:00 - you know as people are training
23:01 - computers to
23:02 - recognize diseases imagine if it
23:05 - recognizes
23:06 - a disease better among women than among
23:08 - men
23:09 - or better among people with white skin
23:11 - than people with dark skin
23:13 - and it's really important this is
23:14 - actually happening in today's world
23:16 - computers need to be trained
23:17 - with a broad representation of images so
23:20 - that they get
23:20 - get the answer right in a way that is
23:22 - fair for everybody that's looking at it
23:26 - all right so we are now getting at the
23:27 - end of our lesson we promised that these
23:29 - would be short
23:30 - uh thank you for joining us for computer
23:32 - science education week
23:33 - if you want to try using ai for oceans
23:35 - yourself to train
23:37 - a computer to recognize a fish from
23:39 - trash or teach your own world
23:41 - go to code.org at home
23:44 - all of our lessons that students can
23:46 - learn at home are listed over there and
23:47 - look for ai for oceans
23:49 - or if you want to use teachable machine
23:50 - like we did you could just google
23:52 - teachable machine
23:54 - and go to that website and you can teach
23:56 - nai to recognize a smile from an angry
23:58 - face
23:59 - you can teach it to recognize sign
24:01 - language or you can teach your computer
24:03 - to play rock paper scissors
24:04 - by teaching it a rock and a paper and
24:07 - scissors
24:08 - that all of those are possible using
24:10 - that teachable machine tool that we
24:11 - showed
24:12 - so go try on your own to see what you
24:14 - can teach ai to do
24:16 - and learn more about how computers do
24:18 - computer vision and by the way if you're
24:19 - enjoying learning about ai
24:21 - just this week we launched something new
24:24 - which i want to show you
24:26 - if you go to code.org ai
24:30 - and i'm going to share my screen one
24:31 - last time to show this
24:38 - where's my screen here it is
24:42 - so we have if you go to code.org ai this
24:45 - is an entire page about artificial
24:47 - intelligence
24:48 - and you can see the ai for oceans that
24:50 - we did
24:51 - there's also this new video series how
24:53 - ai
24:54 - works which talks about what is machine
24:56 - learning
24:57 - what is training data and bias what are
24:59 - neural networks
25:00 - how does computer vision work and two
25:03 - different videos about
25:04 - ethics and ai which are really important
25:06 - the questions of equal access
25:08 - algorithmic bias data privacy and the
25:11 - future of work when computers are
25:13 - starting to automate jobs
25:14 - using artificial intelligence that video
25:17 - series is at code.org
25:19 - ai and it's something you can watch
25:20 - yourselves and
25:22 - families can watch it together with
25:23 - parents or with uh
25:25 - with their children or even with your
25:26 - grandparents uh
25:28 - thank you everybody for joining us have
25:30 - a wonderful computer science education
25:31 - week
25:32 - and we'll see you we're going to be
25:34 - doing this every day this week so we'll
25:36 - see you tomorrow
25:38 - say bye bye
25:41 - yay
25:47 - [Music]
26:08 - so
26:19 - [Music]
26:22 - so
26:27 - [Music]
26:34 - [Music]
26:39 - you

Cleaned transcript:

b here we are yeah all right sophia already i think we're live really yeah okay hi everybody this is hadi partovi i'm the creator of the hour of code and the ceo of code.org and i'm here with my daughter sophia hi sophia and this is our first episode of code bytes uh you know this week is the computer science education week and collectively we're celebrating the hour of code which is you know this global celebration of computer science uh today and every day of this week millions of students all around the world are going to be coding and what's exciting wait let me turn off my background this is weird hold on a second i'm going to turn off my zoom background so um every day of this week millions of students around the world are going to be doing the hour of code and this is an idea the hour of code is something that i came up with just eight years ago and it's been incredible that over the past eight years one billion times an hour of code has been done uh now today we're not going to be together for an entire hour this is going to be fast we're calling this code bytes uh because it's little bitesized lessons so we're going to be together for about maybe 20 25 minutes i know lots of students have school days whether you're in school or whether you're doing remote learning we want to support students doing an hour of code and you're part of something much much larger than the hundreds of students that are online right now uh you know because there's going to be literally millions of people around the world coding today uh sophia are you ready sure all right so first we're gonna today we're gonna learn about artificial intelligence or a.i sophia do you know what artificial intelligence is yeah um okay i always say get the um definition mixed up but um it's a computer or like a technology that um doesn't need to be explicitly programmed to do something yeah that's really advanced we've explained it ai is generally just when a computer does something that seems really smart like it's got it seems to have human intelligence and it's a way of programming computers to learn um but before we talk about this i want to find out where all of our students are from we had a qr code at the beginning for people to show where they are on the map but instead of using that i'm going to ask everybody to use the chat so if you click on the little chat button at the bottom of your screen if you're in the chat uh choose a little drop down that looks like this that says to all panelists and attendees that way you'll be able to types and everybody can see what you type and if you could just type in the location you're calling in from so we can see where everybody's calling from i hope this works maybe you need to enable the chat the chat might be i'm not enabled for people uhoh also a serious problem here where's my bug we don't don't worry about that all right it does look like the chat is enabled but let's go on to learning about ai so what we're going to do is we're going to teach a computer how to recognize stuff but let me first start by saying um if if uh to do this together with sophia sophia i'm going to show you a face and you tell me if i'm angry or i'm sad okay ready set go i think that's angry how about this that's happy at least it should be okay so you can recognize my face easily now but what's what a i can try to do is recognize that same thing but what happens if you don't see the entire face now what am i that's still angry how about this happy i think maybe surprised i i don't know that's not really scared but i'm sad how about if i show you this way so i'm showing you that because ai can sometimes recognize things like humans and sometimes it can do even better because it sees more than the than just a part of the picture so we're going to go use a tutorial where we can teach an ai something so give me just one second i'm going to share my screen sharing screen so where we are is that the code.org ai for oceans tutorial and what you can see is uh this ai for oceans where you can program something to program the ai if you go into it we're going to program ai to recognize fish and to distinguish what is fish and what is not fish so to help clean the oceans so sophia the more we program this the better ai learns so tell me is this a fish no are you sure i think so all right it's not a fish how about that no nothing she just rotated how about this one that's a fish this one's a fish how about this yes this is a fish that's a fish yes to fish i think that's a fish of course it's a fish what about that kind of looks like a fish when you first see it i know it's not not a fish and look over here is showing how many times we've trained ai so how about this that's a fish how about this that's a fish that's not a fish not a fish yes a fish no definitely not a fish not a fish it should know this one by now but so now we've given ai 13 different things to go from do you think that's enough for it to learn i don't think so well let's continue and see what happens so now ai's gonna get to decide on its own based on the training we gave it we gave it 13 examples let's see how how well it learned i don't think it's gonna work see what dad you couldn't put a gasoline in the ocean so we can go quickly so okay it is doing a really really bad job let's see and if i finish continuing to see all the things that it's trained so this shows what it put in the ocean it said all of these classified these as fish yeah and if we see what it says was not fish okay it did pretty well at recognizing the not fish it didn't put any fish into the trash well so now if we want we can click to train more to get it a little bit smarter so help me a little bit out with this is this fish yes fish fish you can also do this the way where you try to get all the garbage into the ocean for fun but in real life you probably should that's not fun that is not fun so i'm gonna do this fast because i know what's fishing that's fish that's fish that's fish that's fish that's fish all right now let's see if it does much better we gave it 28 examples so tell me is the computer doing well wait but when i did this i gave it like 130 examples just to be safe there's a tire in there did it still make a mistake ah it's still making mistakes so what we realized is to get ai to get actually smart to do recognition you need to give it a lot more training than what we did so even though we gave it 28 examples that was still not enough to recognize fish from trash so you can see it still is putting all sorts of garbage in the ocean wait but we see the locker you want to see the not garbage right you get a fish in there dad you created them you did better when before with less training it did better yeah oh that's terrible you're you're taking out the fish now right so one of the things we i want to show is how ai can actually be used to train a computer something that it didn't know and by the way check it out the the chat has now been turned on so now people can type everywhere that they're from so they're calling from india from arizona from lebanon maharashtra indiana texas canada michigan new york it's going super fast only like see colorado massachusetts georgia miami toronto it is going way too fast to see all this that's pretty awesome all right so one of the things i want to show is we just showed how to recognize fish from not fish but we can teach ai to do other things as well so let's teach the ai how to recognize a word that it never learned before all right so let me share the screen again one second all right so now we want to teach the ai a new word so everybody who's there chatting can you all instead of chatting where you're from look at these words on screen and tell me what word should we teach ai we want to teach it to recognize a type of fish it could be a delicious fish it could be a happy fish it could be a playful fish people are saying scary fun silly personal favorite is delicious all right let's choose from the ones that people have chosen scary is coming up a lot so i'm going to choose scary we're going to teach what's a scary fish all right so is that scary that fish just looks quite funny all right this one's not scary right no but the next one is this one is definitely scary look at those angry eyes spooky how about this one no not scary how about this one not scary not scary this one's got funny teeth but scary but but it's really kind eyes what do you say for this one yeah not scary definitely not not scary right this fish looks kind of scary right now definitely the next one does and this one is definitely scary this one's not so scary so sophia can you go through this really quickly and do like 50 of them or even more that one's kind of yeah go quickly without talking about it so as sophia's training this there's a couple of things to think about one is what are the features of the fist she's looking at to decide what is or isn't scary is she looking at the eyes is she looking at the mouth there's another question which is is it even fair to decide whether fish is scary or not based on its looks now maybe for an animal that might be fair but when ai is being trained when we train machine machines to do things based on what they see there's a really important question are we teaching them to be fair or not fair and in fact did you know that scientists in in europe are already training ai to recognize from human faces whether somebody looks trustworthy or not that's a terrible way to use ai to suggest that a computer can detect whether or not they can trust you based on the look of your face that's just not fair at all so it's really important when people train ai why is this fish where's the mouth of the fish it's got a really big separated from the fish's body all right that's scary so my point from what i was saying is just because you can train a computer to do something it doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing to do that so training to recognize whether a fish is scary or not that may just sound kind of fun but doing that with human faces and trying to decide if somebody is trustworthy based on their look is not okay so we've done this 59 times now let's see did ai learn what sofia believes is scary yeah this is my opinion yeah it's important to know that we just taught it sophia's biased opinion of what is or isn't scary somebody else might choose something different so somebody might have thought those sharp teeth were scary so let's go through this really fast and get a whole bunch of fish that one with a smile was not scary did you see it okay all right so i'm continuing on these are all the scary things okay that squiggly one at the very bottom this one yeah that's kind of funny but one of these was just not scary at all let's see like we can look in fact if you click on one if you click on this one you can click on the i and find out why did it think it was scary because it had scary eyes right there how come this one was scary its eyes weren't scary but it thought its body and its tail and its mouth were scary that's yeah yeah this one its eyes weren't scary but because it had a dorsal fin and a scary looking tail and i think we've labeled enough of the sshaped fish this snake scary that i just thought all the snakes are scary because it has a scary looking body so you can tell why ai thinks different things are scary like this has scary eyes or this has this one it's because of its eyes but also its mouth so ai doesn't know what is or isn't scary it is learning from what you tell it and you gave it only 58 examples and that's what it's going from so obviously when you train a real computer to do stuff using ai it needs a lot more information than that but since we have only 20 minutes to go or 20 minutes total we have about less than about 10 minutes to go we don't have enough time to train it with enough data now i want to train something more complicated to show ai which is american sign language does anybody know what sign language is what is sign language used for it's um a language used for people that can't people that are deaf people who can't hear or people who can't speak if somebody can't speak they also need to use signs and also if they can't hear they need to use signs as well so i want to teach a computer to recognize a very short word using sign language so if you google sign language this is the american sign language but i want to teach it to recognize code so we're going to make a code spelling so can you spell this out how do you spell a c that's a c and then do an o o and then do a d it's a d and then an e that's an e great so now we want to take a computer to recognize those letters from each other we're going to go into something called teachable machine you can just google teachable machine to find it and we're going to make an image project which is going to recognize different images and we're going to make it recognize a bunch of things the letter c we're going to differentiate that from the letter o and then the letter d and then lastly the letter e we want to teach it all of these letters so we're going to use our webcam to train it what okay okay sophia we're using one camera to show us up here and a different camera that's now being trained over here so you show the letter c make it a good one and i'm going to click hold to record and now move it around a little bit keep doing it okay we gave it 18 images of c that's enough no that's okay it'll make mistakes i'm gonna keep changing these cameras here do you want okay now show the letter o make it really different than the c ready i'm going to record it bring it bring your hand closer a little bit move it around okay we have 20 images of o's now we're going to do a letter d this shouldn't quite recognize it my finger ready okay all right and then lastly the letter e each time we're doing this we're giving the computer example images make sure this doesn't look like an o i don't think it does at least i don't think it does either but the computer might get confused so now that we did that we're going to train the model we've given it 23 images of these 20 20 that has about 80 different images to look at as its training which that adds up to a lot more than the you know 15 fish that we showed it but that's not a lot of images so the question is is that going to be enough for the computer to learn how to do this or not training an ai the more images you get it the better it's going to get and in fact when computer scientists use this when when people talk about cars that learn to drive themselves they're training the ai to recognize street signs what is a pedestrian what is a road have you ever been on a website where the website asks you which of these things are traffic lights or which of these things or something else yeah you're actually when you're doing that you're training an ai to to do this uh to recognize street things from each other so now let's see our ai has already been trained and let me change the webcam and it's already yelling okay all right so now show it the letter c and look over here it says with 70 likelihood it knows this way it knows that that's a c now show an o and no it definitely got that you have an o now show letter d it's having trouble with that one bring it down a little bit or move it oh it got it yeah it knows that that's a d and i'll show the e it's struggling with this one if you move it a little bit so basically as you're recognizing down here the computer can tell what you're doing and now i want to show something else we can do this with this you can export this model and we just train the ai and we can upload what we trained to the internet what yeah you haven't seen this before and now we have a url this right here is a web page that can recognize what we just did or we can even take this and put it in code so i over here have code that i've written to make our own web page if i hit play and we can edit the code to do whatever we want with it wait for the camera to start wait for it ready come on all right maybe it's not going to go well let's try this other way that's actually quite funny okay so if i take this model that we copied i can open it in a new new url and look here's a web page that's a brand new web page that you can basically turn on maybe it's having trouble because of my other camera being on well when it does work oh here it is so here's this camera that finally turned on it's very glitchy though it's glitchy can you show it the letter o it got it try the letter put the letter d it's having trouble my finger is right there there i got it i'll put the letter e it's confusing the d and the e because i'm not seeing your finger but now let's see if how it does with my hand it got the letter c you got the letter it doesn't get the letter okay okay if it doesn't work very well for my hand because we only trained it on your hand sideway so what we just saw there is we just trained the ai how to recognize the sign language those four letters using your hand but we didn't train it using my hand and so the computer can only see when you're showing signs not what i'm doing and this shows another part of what it means to train an ai and how to avoid training bias because if you train an ai to learn and recognize only one type of thing from one type of person and not a broad representation of people you don't get as good a sense of how it works or you know it might not work fairly or equally for some people this happens very much in today's day you know as people are training computers to recognize diseases imagine if it recognizes a disease better among women than among men or better among people with white skin than people with dark skin and it's really important this is actually happening in today's world computers need to be trained with a broad representation of images so that they get get the answer right in a way that is fair for everybody that's looking at it all right so we are now getting at the end of our lesson we promised that these would be short uh thank you for joining us for computer science education week if you want to try using ai for oceans yourself to train a computer to recognize a fish from trash or teach your own world go to code.org at home all of our lessons that students can learn at home are listed over there and look for ai for oceans or if you want to use teachable machine like we did you could just google teachable machine and go to that website and you can teach nai to recognize a smile from an angry face you can teach it to recognize sign language or you can teach your computer to play rock paper scissors by teaching it a rock and a paper and scissors that all of those are possible using that teachable machine tool that we showed so go try on your own to see what you can teach ai to do and learn more about how computers do computer vision and by the way if you're enjoying learning about ai just this week we launched something new which i want to show you if you go to code.org ai and i'm going to share my screen one last time to show this where's my screen here it is so we have if you go to code.org ai this is an entire page about artificial intelligence and you can see the ai for oceans that we did there's also this new video series how ai works which talks about what is machine learning what is training data and bias what are neural networks how does computer vision work and two different videos about ethics and ai which are really important the questions of equal access algorithmic bias data privacy and the future of work when computers are starting to automate jobs using artificial intelligence that video series is at code.org ai and it's something you can watch yourselves and families can watch it together with parents or with uh with their children or even with your grandparents uh thank you everybody for joining us have a wonderful computer science education week and we'll see you we're going to be doing this every day this week so we'll see you tomorrow say bye bye yay so so you
