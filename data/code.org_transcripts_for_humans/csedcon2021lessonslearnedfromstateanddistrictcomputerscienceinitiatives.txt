06:56 - we're celebrating computer science
06:58 - education week all across the 720 square
07:02 - miles that encompasses la unified
07:06 - it's a jackson product
07:08 - so my students were trying to figure out
07:10 - a way to help design for those further
07:12 - away from power we were making a
07:14 - prototype so that we could help other
07:16 - students with autism express themselves
07:19 - so some of them had designed a sweater
07:22 - where he pressed the finger if you moved
07:24 - it it said hi my name is another one
07:26 - said i'm hungry
07:28 - for me it's like a whole new world so i
07:31 - feel grateful to have access to those
07:33 - things because i can really
07:35 - do a lot more to help others they're
07:37 - integrating language arts they're
07:39 - integrating art they're integrating
07:41 - music and so to put all of that together
07:43 - to something for good i feel that coding
07:45 - is a way to help everybody no matter who
07:48 - they are so when you do an event like
07:50 - today there's a couple of things that
07:52 - are happening one you're inviting the
07:53 - whole school to the table if you have
07:55 - new students at the school they've maybe
07:57 - never engaged in computer science ever
07:59 - before they have an opportunity to
08:01 - experience that today the folks that
08:03 - came today are community stakeholders at
08:06 - our school i wanted them to know this is
08:08 - what you've been investing in this is
08:09 - what you've been partnering with us in
08:10 - those principals that come in and say
08:12 - we've only been doing this for three or
08:14 - four months this can be at your school
08:15 - too in just a short period of time it's
08:17 - an important skill because you don't
08:19 - only learn how to code but you also
08:21 - learn about life skills so teamwork
08:24 - patience double checking so even though
08:27 - you might not think about using coding
08:29 - as your future career those skills that
08:31 - you have you can take them with you
08:32 - anywhere and any job that you decide to
08:35 - do because you're always working with
08:36 - people around you it's got a lot of
08:39 - design principles in it and logical
08:41 - thinking and that's what really computer
08:44 - science is and it's now critical across
08:47 - all fields and all careers ways we
08:50 - communicate everything for so long
08:52 - computer science was not really fully
08:55 - present in schools with high numbers of
08:58 - kids of color and low-income students so
09:01 - in la unified the demographics of our
09:03 - students is 73
09:05 - latino however the private industry in
09:08 - terms of computer science does not
09:09 - reflect that whatsoever so if we were
09:12 - able to really provide that opportunity
09:14 - for access we would also be having an
09:16 - impact on the industry and so this
09:19 - computer science movement is really an
09:22 - equity movement that's what the work is
09:25 - about providing the opportunities for
09:27 - students who wouldn't have it otherwise
09:30 - and really opening up the field for
09:32 - everyone what we're seeing here is only
09:35 - one of the many initiatives that the
09:37 - instructional technology initiative is
09:39 - undertaking if you're not exposed to
09:41 - these kinds of opportunities whether
09:43 - it's computer science or anything having
09:46 - to do with instructional technology you
09:47 - don't know where you can go
09:49 - that's a blocked off path for you if we
09:52 - can change the computer science
09:53 - educational pathways of youth today that
09:56 - they'll be able to take that knowledge
09:57 - into whatever career pathways they
09:59 - choose to pursue in the future to solve
10:01 - community issues and problems that need
10:04 - the diverse perspectives of many people
10:06 - to solve them
10:13 - i did i did i had it here it was okay
10:15 - okay
10:16 - welcome everyone to day two of cs edcon
10:20 - i'm sean roberts vice president of
10:22 - government affairs for code.org if i
10:25 - haven't met you yet please come say hi
10:26 - to me sometime this week i'm so
10:28 - appreciative that we all have this
10:29 - chance to be together and the great work
10:32 - you all are doing and i'm so
10:34 - appreciative of the
10:36 - momentum you all have built for computer
10:38 - science education
10:40 - in our country over the past several
10:42 - years
10:43 - we're going to get started with our
10:44 - first panel today
10:46 - lessons learned from district state and
10:48 - national computer science initiatives
10:51 - i'm especially excited and honored to be
10:53 - hosting this panel i'm just very
10:56 - interested in what
10:57 - our panelists have to say today i don't

11:09 - opening remarks from our panelists
11:12 - and during that time
11:15 - they'll be sharing some of the lessons
11:17 - they've learned from their own computer
11:19 - science initiatives we'll then move into
11:21 - some question and answer from you the
11:23 - audience and if you're live streaming

13:31 - [Applause]
13:36 - so let's go ahead and start with uh some
13:39 - lessons learned in your opening remarks
13:41 - just a few minutes for each of our
13:43 - panelists let's start with sophia great
13:45 - well good morning everyone and good
13:47 - morning afternoon to everyone and
13:49 - evening if some of our international
13:51 - folks joining us uh streaming
13:54 - you know it's been a very long time here
13:57 - in l.a unified for our cs movement and
14:00 - along those years
14:02 - i've kind of compiled a list of my top
14:06 - 10
14:07 - lessons learned so i brought them to
14:10 - share them with you today
14:11 - the first
14:13 - is really leading with an organizational
14:16 - change management strategy anytime we
14:18 - want to bring about change
14:21 - my biggest tip is let's have an
14:23 - organizational change management
14:24 - strategy ready
14:27 - also it's been very important i know we
14:29 - had a video earlier that we shared with
14:32 - you around our call to action here in la
14:34 - unified is to center
14:36 - our computer science initiative around a
14:40 - social justice lens
14:43 - and the connection with that is finding
14:45 - your partners and that will also join
14:48 - that movement of computer science that's
14:50 - directed around social justice and
14:53 - cultivate a partnership really
14:56 - understanding the mutual beneficial
14:59 - aspects of partnerships
15:01 - and one that is really dear to me you
15:04 - know being you know i've been here with
15:06 - inela unified since i was a
15:07 - kindergartner i like to tell everyone
15:09 - that my mom dropped me off in
15:10 - kindergarten and she has yet to pick me
15:12 - up
15:13 - one thing i've noticed
15:15 - is that our educators
15:17 - love to be spotlighted right so when we
15:20 - spotlight our practitioners it inspires
15:23 - others to step into this new arena
15:27 - all the while you are continuously
15:30 - reinforcing the change that you want to
15:32 - see in your movement
15:34 - you we've done this through newsletters
15:37 - where as soon as you open the newsletter
15:38 - you're going to see a featured
15:40 - educator
15:42 - leveraging computer science in multiple
15:44 - different ways
15:46 - we've also highlighted and spotlighted
15:49 - educators during board of education
15:52 - meetings
15:53 - special showcase events
15:55 - where we
15:57 - have the educators tell their own story
16:00 - and their successes
16:02 - another big
16:05 - lesson learned is really influencing
16:08 - policy so i'm so glad we're here today
16:10 - because i'm really looking forward to a
16:11 - couple of sessions that i i want to
16:14 - attend around policy
16:16 - this is your chance to make your voice
16:19 - heard
16:20 - locally leveraging our district policies
16:24 - so that um you know we we have the
16:27 - support of our elected board members
16:29 - that has been such a
16:31 - major piece and then looking at how we
16:34 - collaborate regionally so another great
16:37 - aspect of being a regional partner here
16:39 - with code.org is that
16:41 - we're able to have those regional
16:43 - coalitions
16:44 - as well as
16:46 - specific legislative dates also looking
16:49 - to our administrators you know that's an
16:52 - untapped um group our administrators so
16:55 - when you're looking to impact policy and
16:58 - influence it don't forget about your
17:00 - administrator organizations
17:04 - also looking at how you might want to
17:06 - re-imagine instruction around
17:10 - leveraging computer science
17:12 - also a big big piece because you know
17:15 - i'm going to share with you all i am not
17:17 - a computer scientist by degree i have
17:21 - learned to reimagine instruction i have
17:24 - learned to be prepared to be a learner
17:26 - so when you're inviting your
17:28 - administrators when you're inviting your
17:30 - educators to step into the cs arena
17:34 - it's really about being comfortable with
17:36 - being a learner but also articulating
17:39 - learning in different ways
17:41 - and
17:42 - i think
17:43 - the third one i'm sorry the the the next
17:46 - biggest piece that i think has been
17:48 - really beneficial is be being agnostic
17:52 - providing very thoughtful points
17:54 - for your educators you know here in la
17:56 - unified we have about 25 000 ish
17:59 - educators
18:00 - and
18:02 - doing so we have to meet our our
18:04 - educators where they might be on the
18:06 - continuum
18:07 - looking at different frameworks
18:09 - curriculum
18:10 - devices even having devices that are
18:13 - agnostic
18:14 - the platforms
18:16 - but overall looking for
18:18 - agnostic opportunities where it's a low
18:21 - floor and high ceiling easy entry points
18:25 - and my last tip would be
18:27 - let's collaborate more with higher ed
18:30 - looking at our areas of pre-service so
18:33 - that's just a little bit about my top 10
18:35 - lesson learned over the years
18:38 - great thank you very much sophia let's
18:40 - hear from claudia you're
18:42 - you're opening remarks on lessons
18:44 - learned in your national initiative in
18:47 - el salvador
18:48 - thank you thank you shane
18:50 - um
18:52 - first of all i want to thank you for the
18:54 - invitation i'm really glad to be here
18:56 - and and talk about uh the things that we
18:59 - are doing at el salvador well
19:02 - establishing partnership um with the
19:04 - private sector has been a priority for a
19:07 - president najib
19:09 - in this sense as a government we have
19:12 - we have seen signed important agreements
19:16 - with big tech companies such as
19:18 - microsoft google plazi oracle amazon
19:22 - nokia hp and dell
19:24 - as well as with the main
19:26 - telecommunications company in the
19:28 - country these agreements allow us to
19:31 - implement unprecedented strategies
19:34 - within the public administration to
19:36 - guarantee innovative and quality
19:39 - services
19:40 - in different areas such as education
19:43 - health and security
19:46 - as is common in countries of central
19:48 - america as government we face the
19:51 - challenge to find funds to develop
19:53 - projects allowed to allow us to build
19:57 - and maintain political and digital
19:59 - infrastructure
20:00 - for digital services
20:02 - so
20:03 - in this sense public-private partnership
20:06 - is a model that make resource more
20:08 - efficient reduce response times and
20:11 - considerably increases the scope of
20:13 - project for the benefit of our people
20:16 - this also increases the chance of
20:18 - success and sustainability of all
20:20 - projects in this way in el salvador from
20:23 - the secretariat of innovation we are
20:26 - working involving all different
20:28 - institutions of government with the
20:30 - private sector academia civil society
20:33 - and international organization within an
20:35 - innovation ecosystem that guarantees the
20:38 - closing of technological gap mainly
20:41 - through transfer of knowledge that
20:43 - allows the adoption of new technologies
20:46 - helping people to use computers and
20:48 - funds to learn about computer science
20:52 - also we are working on the rollout of
20:55 - digital infrastructure for connectivity
20:58 - in all the country this coordinated work
21:01 - allow us to influence important public
21:04 - policies as the higher education law
21:08 - where thanks to the approach with the
21:09 - private sector and academy together with
21:12 - the ministry of education and the
21:14 - ministry of economy we have identified
21:16 - the demand of the labor market at
21:19 - national and international level
21:21 - prioritizing our efforts towards the
21:24 - ones that guarantees greater job
21:25 - opportunities with more competitive
21:28 - salaries
21:29 - and this work incorporate our strategic
21:31 - allies such as code.org microsoft and
21:35 - plazi
21:37 - with whom we have developed in recent
21:39 - months a very ambitious project to train
21:42 - those salvadorians in higher education
21:45 - careers such as accelerated engineering
21:48 - for software development degree which
21:50 - include learning paths in computer
21:52 - science artificial intelligence cyber
21:55 - security cloud computing and others
21:58 - similarly together with other strategic
22:01 - allies also from the private sector we
22:04 - are designing degrees in
22:05 - telecommunications and fintech
22:08 - which respond to a strategic
22:11 - projects of our government
22:13 - all these learning paths are aimed at
22:15 - women and men of all ages to certify
22:19 - their skills through first level
22:21 - training programs in an accelerated mode
22:24 - that is
22:25 - one or two years maximum at the first
22:29 - higher school of innovation and
22:31 - technology in our country created by
22:33 - president bukele
22:35 - with a flexible and innovative academic
22:38 - curriculum started as totally virtual
22:41 - mode allowing to bring quality content
22:46 - to all people of all ages as a
22:49 - government and thanks to the partnership
22:51 - with private sector through this school
22:53 - we are providing completely free
22:56 - training programs through a scholarship
22:58 - and to thousands of salvatorians in
23:01 - order to guarantee the employability the
23:03 - people form the alliance
23:06 - with more national and international
23:09 - companies allowing salvadorans to work
23:11 - from our country accessing more
23:13 - opportunities from entrepreneurship or
23:16 - exporting the services obtaining truly
23:19 - competitive salaries that allow them to
23:22 - transform their life and those of their
23:24 - families
23:27 - thank you great thank you very much
23:30 - let's go on to
23:32 - superintendent basler your takeaways
23:35 - from your initiative in north dakota
23:37 - thank you so much sean um and thank you
23:39 - to code.org for hosting this very very
23:41 - important convening and this
23:42 - conversation for many years i think
23:44 - you're going to hear
23:46 - a theme from all of us i've heard it
23:47 - already you're going to hear the same
23:48 - thing from me and that is
23:51 - the theme of this doesn't happen
23:53 - overnight it needs to be done
23:55 - strategically
23:56 - and you need partners and that that's
23:59 - that's the way that it and that's the
24:00 - story of north dakota as well so our
24:02 - journey really began or my journey began
24:05 - uh nine and a half years ago when i took
24:07 - office my first lonely night in the
24:10 - capitol building uh my first legislative
24:12 - session as an elected official you uh
24:15 - you know you don't know how many cycles
24:16 - you're going to have you don't know how
24:17 - many years you might be able to
24:20 - make a difference and so i jotted out on
24:21 - a piece of notebook because i was a
24:23 - elementary principal and and teacher
24:24 - before that so i had my spiral bound
24:26 - notebook
24:27 - tore out a sheet of paper and
24:29 - thought jotted down some things that
24:31 - before
24:32 - my ride on the merry-go-round was over i
24:34 - wanted to accomplish as an elected
24:36 - leader and one of those was to bring
24:38 - computer science and to to all of our
24:40 - students every zip code every child in
24:42 - north dakota that sticky note is or that
24:45 - spiral bound notebook is still taped to
24:48 - the inside of my cupboard door and we
24:49 - nine and a half years later we're we're
24:51 - at we're at a tipping point now in fact
24:53 - our special session will be meeting next
24:55 - week monday
24:56 - and we have a bill in to require it in
24:58 - all of our elementary middle and high
25:00 - schools and make it a graduation
25:02 - requirement so hopefully we can get it
25:03 - across the finish line
25:08 - fingers crossed
25:10 - so that brings me to the point of okay
25:12 - as an elected official as an educator
25:14 - and an elected official how do we do
25:16 - that the first thing that we needed to
25:18 - do was bring more people on board than
25:20 - just the education community
25:23 - as educators we're fully committed to
25:25 - our students parents are fully committed
25:27 - to their own children but the challenge
25:29 - is for parents
25:31 - for for families their kids kind of age
25:34 - out of the major issues uh they they are
25:38 - very passionate about making sure that
25:39 - their students have what they need in
25:41 - elementary school but as soon as they
25:42 - move on to middle school or high school
25:44 - they let somebody else worry about
25:46 - what's happening in elementary school so
25:48 - we needed to make this a different
25:49 - conversation more than just about what's
25:51 - best for students
25:52 - even if i didn't care and this is kind
25:54 - of how i talk to to legislators that
25:56 - aren't on the education committee those
25:57 - that get to vote for the appropriation
25:59 - and the policy that's going to complete
26:01 - this
26:02 - it's just pretend for a minute that i
26:03 - didn't even care about young people that
26:05 - i don't care about children this is an
26:07 - economic conversation that we need to
26:08 - have for our state of north dakota
26:10 - and that gets even those committee
26:12 - members that are serving on the the
26:14 - the government affairs committee or the
26:17 - uh taxation committee it gets them
26:19 - interested because we're talking about
26:20 - economy
26:21 - so we formed a partnership that's called
26:23 - pk20w
26:26 - and
26:27 - it's because this conversation about
26:28 - computer science needs to start with our
26:31 - preschoolers and continue through phd
26:34 - level work and into the workforce so we
26:36 - have a pk 20w group that has been
26:39 - meeting for the last four years so we're
26:41 - all hands on deck pushing the flywheel
26:43 - in the same direction
26:44 - and why pk
26:46 - because it's actually quite a pet peeve
26:48 - of mine that when we talk about computer
26:50 - science and cyber security that we tend
26:52 - to just talk about it through the lens
26:53 - of high school classes and college
26:56 - courses while very important it's true
26:59 - but we know that by the end of third
27:02 - grade
27:03 - young people
27:05 - have a belief of what they're good at
27:07 - and what they want to be
27:08 - that year between third grade and fourth
27:10 - grade is critically important so if
27:12 - we're just beginning to have a
27:13 - conversation about introducing
27:16 - computer science into middle schools
27:17 - we're too late as with any sector the
27:20 - workforce shortage issue is is is every
27:22 - sector's challenge right now with the
27:24 - great resignation but
27:26 - when our preschoolers come into their
27:28 - first you know day of school one of the
27:30 - first lessons that every preschool
27:31 - teacher does is hands them a pot of soil
27:34 - they plant a seed
27:36 - and they watch it grow and it's not
27:38 - because we want them to be agronomists
27:39 - or botanists or even farmers
27:42 - it's because it's part of their everyday
27:44 - world
27:45 - so similarly we need to begin to help
27:47 - our students understand what is
27:48 - happening around them how the internet
27:50 - works at preschool and help them develop
27:52 - those ideas so that's why we did pre-k
27:54 - pk 20w
27:56 - and making it an economic issue
27:59 - you really have to have that explanation
28:01 - that 30-second elevator speech ready and
28:03 - make it about what's important to them
28:06 - employers need employees that are
28:08 - computer science literate there will
28:10 - never be
28:12 - a time where this generation is using
28:14 - less technology when you say those
28:16 - things and you make it about the economy
28:19 - you have the opportunity to
28:21 - have a broader influence and still
28:23 - care about kids and make sure that
28:25 - they're getting what they need for their
28:26 - future
28:29 - thank you superintendent i'd like to
28:31 - move to some questions now for for all
28:33 - of you um the the first one is i think
28:35 - this panel is really unique and one of
28:37 - the reasons i'm honored and excited to
28:39 - be able to host it is because we have uh
28:41 - so many different locations el salvador
28:44 - is very different from los angeles it's
28:46 - very different from north dakota and and
28:48 - so on
28:49 - but also the different levels
28:51 - at which you're approaching your plans
28:54 - from a district level from a
28:55 - country-wide level from a state level so
28:58 - one of the things i'm interested in is
29:00 - what you think you need from the other
29:02 - two levels in your role so maybe we'll
29:04 - start with you superintendent what do
29:06 - you need
29:07 - from a district level to be successful
29:10 - and what do you need from a national
29:11 - level to be successful
29:13 - so from the district level
29:17 - i guess
29:18 - what i would if i could have a magic
29:19 - wand and wave my wand is to have every
29:21 - teacher understand the importance of
29:23 - computer science and in north dakota we
29:25 - have computer science and cyber security
29:27 - skills so we have included another
29:30 - strategic i think important because
29:32 - words matter you can't get a lot of
29:34 - people excited often about computer
29:36 - science but everybody understands the
29:38 - importance and the urgency of cyber
29:40 - security
29:41 - so
29:42 - um
29:43 - if we can
29:44 - at the elementary level we have a better
29:46 - buy in with our elementary teachers
29:48 - understanding that it can be integrated
29:50 - should be integrated but unfortunately
29:52 - and when we reach middle school and
29:54 - secondary level that tends to be some
29:56 - other teachers responsibility and so if
29:59 - we can have
30:00 - more people take responsibility for
30:02 - being computer science cyber security
30:04 - teachers rather than just that math
30:06 - teacher or just that computer science
30:08 - certified teacher or
30:10 - that would be helpful so engaging our
30:12 - principals to understand that they need
30:14 - to have
30:15 - um allow the time for professional
30:17 - development to have teachers co-plan
30:20 - together would be helpful and to really
30:22 - just maybe get out of their own
30:24 - disciplined content areas and understand
30:26 - that this is a holistic issue that every
30:28 - student needs what do we need from the
30:30 - national level i think that we we need
30:32 - to market this we need to continue to
30:34 - market this so you know when i speak
30:36 - nationally i'm not talking about the
30:37 - federal government at this point but as
30:39 - a nation
30:40 - we need to engage our workforce as as
30:43 - we've all know there isn't a there at
30:45 - the hearing on monday
30:47 - are the executive director of our
30:49 - hospitality association we'll be
30:51 - testifying in favor of this our commerce
30:54 - people will be in testifying in favor of
30:56 - this this move and so as a nation we all
31:00 - need to be talking about computer
31:01 - science and cyber security and you need
31:03 - to talk about it at your dinner parties
31:05 - on sunday afternoon when you know when
31:07 - you're when your football is on when
31:09 - your football team is on at halftime
31:11 - break talk about those things have that
31:12 - conversation federally
31:15 - you know it's it's it's
31:17 - wonderfully amazing that the national
31:19 - governors association is lifting this up
31:21 - as their event their chairman or their
31:23 - their the president of the nga
31:26 - um asa hutchinson is going to announce
31:28 - that that's his platform we need to have
31:30 - more leaders stepping up on a national
31:32 - level and saying this is important and
31:34 - this is a number one priority we have a
31:37 - point in time where we are the we are
31:39 - going to either be importing our talent
31:41 - on this issue or we will be providing
31:43 - the service to the rest of the world
31:45 - yeah it sounds like that's something
31:47 - secretariat you've done really well in
31:49 - el salvador is getting a common theme
31:51 - and messaging and
31:53 - leadership around computer science
31:55 - education i know el salvador's education
31:58 - system is uh more centralized than we
32:01 - have here in the united states so maybe
32:03 - for you the question is what do you need
32:05 - from the provinces you you work with and
32:07 - also the ministry of education what do
32:09 - you need from those entities to be
32:11 - successful
32:13 - well
32:14 - we are
32:16 - working in
32:17 - from the presidency with the ministry of
32:20 - education
32:21 - uh i have to say that before the
32:23 - pandemic and with the secretary of
32:26 - innovation vladimir hand that we work on
32:29 - develop a national digital agenda
32:32 - that contemplate inc import important
32:35 - areas all with very ambitious projects
32:38 - to achieve the digital transformation of
32:40 - our country in fact at that time we
32:43 - received the visit in our country of
32:45 - leonardo ortiz
32:47 - a vp of international partnership of
32:50 - cod.org and we agreed to implement
32:54 - in the coming
32:55 - years the computer science in the
32:57 - curriculum for all educational levels in
33:00 - el salvador
33:02 - however the pandemic accelerates the
33:04 - implementation of several of these
33:06 - projects mainly those related to
33:09 - education innovation and connectivity
33:12 - since the beginning of the pandemic or
33:14 - president naibokel established the
33:17 - importance of guaranteed educational
33:19 - continuing
33:21 - so under his mandate we began to work
33:24 - strongly with the ministry of education
33:26 - to implement a digital transformation
33:28 - project of the educational system
33:31 - which within the digital agenda was
33:34 - contemplated to be implement implement
33:37 - in the next 10 years with the pandemic
33:40 - the challenge seem bigger but we start
33:42 - training the teachers because teachers
33:45 - preparation is key
33:47 - in any education initiative and because
33:50 - the work that they are doing every day
33:52 - with the students in their classroom is
33:55 - one of the most important important part
33:58 - of all this project
34:00 - so we joined force with strategic allies
34:02 - and in the first three months we managed
34:05 - to digital literature for more
34:08 - than 46 dollars and teachers from the
34:11 - public and private sector training and
34:13 - certifying them in the use and
34:15 - management of the google classroom
34:17 - platform which by an agreement with
34:19 - google was adopted by our government as
34:22 - the platform for the for the entire
34:24 - public education system and we created
34:28 - more than 1.2 million google workspace
34:31 - accounts for all students and teachers
34:34 - at the same time we trained the
34:36 - specialists of the ministry of education
34:39 - for the creation of virtual content for
34:42 - all the soviet of all educational levels
34:44 - from early childhood to high school
34:47 - including the computer science content
34:49 - that code.org made available to us
34:53 - as the first step to include it in the
34:55 - national curriculum
34:57 - and now we are excited of how fast this
35:00 - effort is growing
35:02 - by that time we have trained 94 percent
35:05 - of teachers from
35:07 - public sector created a platform for
35:09 - educational continuity and also began to
35:12 - manage important financial cooperation
35:14 - projects with the idv and unicef
35:18 - what involves more than 85 million
35:20 - dollars to develop the state's own
35:23 - digital infrastructure for the
35:24 - connectivity of thousands of public
35:27 - schools
35:28 - and health units also by monday for
35:31 - president and the first lady gabriela
35:35 - we began to work on one of the most
35:37 - employment projects of our government
35:40 - the delivery of computer for all
35:42 - students and teachers in the public
35:44 - sector with an investment of more than
35:47 - 400 million dollars in order to provide
35:51 - all the resources
35:53 - that are necessary to guarantee the
35:55 - educational continuity
35:57 - delivery of equipment is a window of
36:00 - opportunities for all the students and
36:03 - their families who in addition to their
36:05 - computer receive a mobile data plan to
36:08 - guarantee connectivity
36:11 - and in the case of the more than 60 000
36:14 - high school
36:16 - um students they also receive a virtual
36:19 - training program to learn english
36:21 - through the platzi platform
36:23 - all this has allowed us to implement in
36:25 - parallel hundreds of mass training
36:28 - programs not only for students and
36:30 - teachers but also for people of all ages
36:34 - including public servers whom we have
36:37 - even certified for the use of different
36:40 - digital tools currently we are training
36:44 - all means ministry of health technology
36:47 - staff
36:48 - on an advanced software development
36:51 - learning path that incorporate a
36:53 - training program to learn english the
36:56 - pandemic has shown us that we can
36:58 - accelerate the implementation of program
37:01 - aimed at closet closing at the
37:04 - technological and gender gap in this
37:06 - sense we currently implement inclusive
37:09 - programs for the adoption and use of
37:11 - technology providing all the tools so
37:14 - that more girls and women have better
37:17 - training and job opportunities so that
37:19 - they can continue taking spaces in the
37:22 - fields of science and technology and
37:25 - have a true participation in the digital
37:27 - transformation of our country
37:30 - achieving this implementation in an
37:32 - accelerated way has been possible
37:34 - thanks to the leadership of our
37:36 - president the articulated work between
37:39 - institutions and the private sector and
37:41 - the commitment of an incredible team
37:44 - which we work tirelessly every day to
37:47 - improve the life of salvadorians all
37:50 - these efforts take us to an
37:52 - unprecedented point in our country where
37:54 - children and young people can become who
37:57 - they want to be
37:58 - this true transformation of the
38:00 - education system involves profound
38:03 - changes that will allow more salvadorans
38:05 - to access more opportunities in the
38:07 - falls of science technology and
38:10 - innovation we are sure that in the
38:12 - coming years we will see exponential
38:14 - growth in the number of salvadorans
38:17 - specialized in robotics artificial
38:20 - intelligence machine learning aerospace
38:23 - or more programming skills and we are
38:26 - also sure that more salvadorians will
38:28 - lead technology companies in our country
38:31 - or outside
38:32 - as a result of all this great effort and
38:36 - i'm really excited for what this means
38:38 - for the future of el salvador
38:41 - thank you sophia how about you from a
38:43 - district perspective what would be
38:45 - helpful for you from a national
38:47 - perspective and also from your state you
38:49 - know i'd like to first start with with
38:51 - state because i think that has more of
38:52 - like this local impact you know i see
38:55 - multiple lanes that need to be running
38:58 - at the same time definitely the
39:01 - partnerships with our higher ed
39:04 - you know ensuring that our educators
39:06 - once they step into the classroom
39:09 - have the knowledge the disposition the
39:13 - skills to be able to integrate computer
39:16 - science effectively right
39:19 - i think that's number one because what
39:21 - we've seen happen recently
39:23 - is especially with our
39:25 - with our most youngest learners to our
39:27 - middle grades we're doing a lot of back
39:29 - filling for our educators so
39:32 - might that be great if there was a
39:34 - partnership where it was you come in and
39:38 - it also will help our educators feel
39:40 - that sense of belonging you know they
39:42 - come in they have these assets and they
39:44 - can immediately contribute to the school
39:47 - culture and the district culture
39:50 - so
39:51 - my number one would be
39:52 - how can we ensure that our educators are
39:56 - coming in prepared and have those skill
39:59 - sets from from higher ed so then that
40:01 - makes you know that brings up the
40:03 - question what is credentialing looking
40:06 - like what is you know what our
40:08 - authorizations looking like so that we
40:10 - can
40:11 - cast a wider net there are so many
40:13 - educators that want to
40:16 - teach computer science but if it's not
40:18 - being offered in their pre-service then
40:20 - that's creating additional gaps so i see
40:22 - definitely those two lanes that would
40:24 - really help us as a district-wide
40:28 - the and then when i think about how the
40:30 - federal
40:31 - government can help and support us
40:34 - you know right now we're leveraging
40:36 - title four dollars
40:38 - and out of title four we have the
40:40 - effective use of technology bucket in
40:43 - there
40:43 - might it be
40:45 - amazing wonderful opportunity to create
40:48 - a statue where we can have
40:51 - dollars earmarked specifically for
40:54 - computer science education so just
40:56 - putting that out there in case anyone's
40:57 - listening so you know that's been very
40:59 - effective leveraging our title four
41:01 - dollars
41:02 - to really start some of the other
41:04 - expansion pieces here in la unified so i
41:07 - think those two pieces um for federal to
41:10 - create some sort of a statute for
41:12 - earmarking specific dollars for
41:15 - computer science education
41:18 - agreed
41:19 - um i want to open this up to the the
41:22 - entire panel um we we've talked about
41:24 - our lessons learned and
41:26 - what we've learned from our cs
41:27 - initiatives i want to look forward a
41:29 - little bit thinking about the various
41:31 - initiatives you have going on um
41:35 - in three years
41:36 - if you were not successful
41:39 - what what would have caused it do you
41:41 - think looking ahead three years from now
41:46 - let me make sure i understand the
41:47 - question sean so in three years
41:49 - if if we don't get this across the
41:51 - finish line what's the last part of the
41:52 - question
41:53 - yeah you you haven't met your goal that
41:55 - was in your notebook in three years what
41:58 - would you attribute that to
41:59 - well
42:01 - i'll take a stab at that so you know
42:03 - let's let's
42:04 - we don't live in a vacuum here we've
42:06 - just had a pandemic for the last 18
42:08 - months
42:09 - and so i think that there's a there's a
42:12 - risk
42:13 - that some of us
42:15 - as a nation
42:16 - might say
42:17 - well we've got to focus on just the
42:19 - fundamentals we've got to focus on just
42:22 - recovering that lost learning time for
42:23 - our young people and keep our eye on
42:25 - that ball
42:27 - and we've had those conversations in our
42:28 - state i've had those conversations with
42:30 - our school leaders and i've had those
42:31 - conversations with my colleagues across
42:32 - the nation
42:34 - but the thing about it is if you if you
42:35 - step outside of that box if you step
42:38 - outside of i don't think anybody wants
42:40 - to return to normal
42:41 - we want our students to be learning and
42:43 - engaged in learning but we've realized
42:46 - because of the pandemic that learning
42:47 - can happen in a whole host of different
42:50 - ways and delivery methods and through a
42:52 - lot of different engaging activities
42:54 - that aren't necessarily what the
42:55 - traditional learning is
42:57 - so i i think that there the pandemic
42:59 - will certainly play a risk our our
43:01 - policy
43:02 - leaders our school district leaders
43:05 - may believe that they need to set
43:08 - computer science cyber security aside
43:09 - while they focus on recovery
43:12 - i would caution anybody that thinks that
43:15 - way that they're really selling their
43:16 - students short and they're selling their
43:18 - schools short
43:20 - hottie you know talks all the time about
43:23 - the impact that computer science courses
43:25 - have on reading and math scores
43:27 - in our elementary and just the increase
43:29 - that are of of those proficiency levels
43:32 - in math and reading so rather than look
43:34 - at the pandemic as something we have to
43:35 - address first we should be looking at
43:38 - using computer science to accelerate
43:40 - excite our young people and help in the
43:43 - recovery from the pandemic
43:50 - sophie are claudia any thoughts dad
43:53 - yeah i'd like to add um
43:56 - definitely you know what we have
43:57 - collectively experienced over the last
44:00 - 18 months yes it's been a disruption and
44:03 - we will continue to see disruptions
44:06 - continue to monitor
44:08 - the plan right so you know we've set out
44:11 - to do something yes we've had a huge
44:13 - disruption over the last 18 months and
44:16 - currently we're still seeing these
44:18 - disruptions
44:19 - um i think if we don't meet our mark in
44:22 - three years
44:23 - it will be because we were not closely
44:25 - monitoring we were not closely listening
44:29 - especially to our educators and
44:30 - listening to our families
44:33 - if we don't meet the mark that is
44:35 - because
44:37 - we have not tried something that we
44:40 - haven't done before
44:43 - thinking about
44:44 - these opportunities that we had over
44:46 - these last 18 months we really had to
44:49 - come together strategize quickly try
44:51 - something
44:53 - and iterate oh we found a bug oh let's
44:55 - try something different so
44:57 - really kind of applying some of those
44:59 - computer science strategies and
45:01 - principles to
45:03 - our inner workings as as a system
45:05 - whatever type of system you might be so
45:08 - um i think if we don't meet our mark
45:10 - that's because we were not listening
45:13 - we're not carefully watching um how
45:16 - things are are changing right in front
45:18 - of us
45:22 - who are you all learning from right now
45:25 - what resources leaders or examples are
45:28 - you taking from in your own initiatives
45:30 - that are influencing your leadership in
45:32 - computer science
45:36 - oh my goodness
45:39 - so i've learned a great deal from
45:40 - organizations like this cnn code.org
45:43 - cs4all microsoft teals all of our
45:46 - partners in north dakota that are
45:47 - helping me palo alto with the cyber
45:49 - security issues
45:52 - those are the partners that i'm learning
45:54 - from but but frankly i'm learning from
45:55 - all of you the the tremendous articles
45:57 - that are being written by computer
46:00 - science advocates educators yourself
46:03 - the the information that is shared on
46:05 - the listserv all of those things i take
46:07 - i digest i learn from i look into other
46:10 - states plans i look at the review of the
46:13 - state of the state and so i think i'm
46:16 - relying heavily on on my colleagues in
46:18 - the nation
46:24 - so some of the folks that i've been
46:25 - learning from
46:27 - i think someone who really had a
46:28 - profound impact when i started to
46:34 - look at how computer science can be
46:37 - integrated
46:38 - was
46:40 - dr mitch resnick in his work around the
46:43 - four ps
46:44 - and um bringing that work and you know
46:47 - yesterday you heard from our chief
46:49 - academic officer allison towery and
46:51 - she's really charged us with bringing
46:53 - that joy and engagement
46:56 - back into school and into learning and
46:59 - so that became a natural fit for us
47:01 - looking at how we can
47:04 - leverage computer science for
47:08 - engaging in mathematics game-based
47:10 - learning um we think about
47:13 - the work that's happening right now with
47:15 - one of our partners just down the down
47:18 - the road
47:19 - university
47:20 - california los angeles and the work that
47:23 - is happening around cgi cognitive guided
47:26 - instruction
47:28 - that is something else that
47:30 - is also
47:31 - making connections to the
47:34 - broader
47:36 - education landscape here in los angeles
47:38 - so you know those are just uh just a few
47:41 - of several others but
47:44 - definitely
47:46 - coming to events like this
47:49 - meeting in the hallway with someone and
47:52 - just like getting your
47:53 - um those nuggets that that brain candy i
47:56 - like to call it because it's just
47:58 - these are
47:59 - opportunities to engage with one another
48:02 - and be inspired and also be influenced
48:08 - well in my case
48:10 - i have to say that
48:12 - this organization code.org is
48:15 - really inspiring for us
48:18 - we admire the work that you are doing um
48:22 - to transform life
48:24 - through teaching learning
48:26 - computer science
48:28 - and because
48:30 - this is a dynamic field
48:32 - which requires
48:33 - constant work a stroke commitment and a
48:37 - resilient attitude
48:39 - to embrace success but are also failure
48:42 - in order to learn from it but above all
48:46 - requires passion ambition to go beyond
48:48 - traditional strategies
48:50 - to implement
48:52 - innovative ones and you are doing that
48:55 - thank you
48:57 - what are you doing one of the things we
49:00 - talked about yesterday with the release
49:02 - of the state of cs report was
49:05 - the the difference between access and
49:07 - participation so
49:09 - there continues to be a gap
49:11 - in participation
49:12 - especially among our hispanic latino
49:15 - latina latinx students
49:17 - and
49:18 - also
49:19 - young women in computer science which
49:21 - secretariat i know has been a specific
49:24 - focus of of years i'm curious
49:26 - from from anyone what you're doing to
49:29 - encourage
49:30 - participation as well as access
49:36 - so
49:38 - about gosh i want to say maybe about
49:40 - four five years now here in la unified
49:44 - every year
49:46 - we celebrate
49:48 - computer science education week i mean
49:50 - it's a it's a big deal here in los
49:52 - angeles so much so that our
49:55 - board of education members you know have
49:58 - marked it with
50:01 - a resolution to bring computer science
50:03 - in various ways to our most youngest
50:05 - learners our middle grade
50:07 - and our
50:09 - and our secondary students and the the
50:12 - resolution that they've passed is
50:15 - really to ensure that our most youngest
50:18 - learners have
50:20 - 20 hours of computer science and we
50:23 - catch and we hook so many educators
50:26 - during that awareness of computer
50:28 - science education week and there's
50:32 - multiple types of entry points for our
50:34 - most youngest learners and those
50:36 - educators to step into whether it be
50:40 - let's just try an hour of code or it
50:43 - might even be i'm a school site
50:45 - principal and i'm inviting my local
50:48 - principals to come check out what we've
50:50 - done here at our school and then that
50:53 - kind of starts to inspire others like
50:55 - wow you're doing it i think i better do
50:58 - something like this um so it's it's
51:01 - those type of opportunities with
51:04 - professional development i know claudia
51:06 - mentioned earlier like professional
51:08 - development is like at the heart of
51:10 - what we need to do and prepare our
51:12 - educators
51:13 - but not just bringing our educators to a
51:16 - professional development but ensuring
51:18 - that they walk away
51:20 - with the tools they have the strategies
51:22 - but those physical computing devices
51:24 - again whatever they might be you know
51:26 - again being diagnostic
51:28 - whatever physical computing devices they
51:30 - need to implement with their entire
51:32 - class not just with two students not
51:34 - just with four but if you need a class
51:36 - set you're gonna walk away with the
51:37 - class set that's how
51:39 - important our board members
51:41 - uh and sirius have have taken their
51:43 - resolution to ensure that the funding is
51:45 - backing up this resolution so those are
51:48 - some ways that we
51:52 - want to
51:53 - bring that dis close that disparity but
51:55 - we still have a long way to go not going
51:56 - to sugarcoat that we have a long way to
51:59 - go
52:00 - i think
52:02 - my colleague tabitha thiel is here with
52:04 - me and she is part of the edutech team
52:05 - in north dakota but
52:08 - she could list off she could rattle off
52:09 - a whole lot of things that they're doing
52:11 - and i'll touch on some of those in a
52:13 - minute
52:14 - but
52:15 - i'm a firm believer that student
52:17 - outcomes don't change will never change
52:19 - until adult behaviors change
52:22 - and so i mean that that's just a fact
52:24 - student outcomes will never improve
52:25 - never change until adult behaviors do
52:28 - and so i think we have to do as much
52:29 - educating of school board members
52:31 - helping them set not only reading and
52:34 - writing goals for their district but
52:35 - computer science goals and equity and
52:37 - access goals
52:39 - uh helping our leaders do that
52:41 - specifically what are some boots on the
52:42 - ground things that we're doing um we
52:45 - there's our i t
52:47 - chief information officer has created um
52:49 - uh replicating march madness where
52:51 - they're doing computer science
52:52 - competition during the month of january
52:54 - and february making it fun uh girls who
52:56 - code um partnering with the girl scouts
52:59 - providing
53:00 - our local communities our boys and girls
53:02 - clubs within our communities in the
53:04 - state providing them funding to actually
53:06 - start up coding clubs
53:08 - for after-school programs integrating it
53:10 - expecting it for the 21st century grants
53:12 - that the state provides to school
53:14 - districts in the state um providing that
53:17 - as a if for because they're competitive
53:19 - grants
53:20 - if they have computer science and coding
53:22 - activities as part of their after school
53:24 - programming their 21st century program
53:26 - they get more they get additional points
53:28 - and so really incentivizing there's only
53:30 - so many levers that you have right as a
53:32 - state as a state leader you have policy
53:35 - and you have funding and so we try to
53:37 - push and pull those levers as much as we
53:39 - can by incentivizing our partners which
53:41 - is why partnership is so so critically
53:43 - important
53:45 - how the the the racial equity i want to
53:48 - speak to a little bit as well north
53:49 - dakota has shares its borders with five
53:52 - sovereign nations
53:53 - and so we are behind the nation and the
53:55 - number of native american students that
53:57 - have access to
53:59 - and are engaging in are taking taking
54:02 - computer science courses at all levels
54:04 - that's not okay
54:05 - and so
54:06 - we have to go to them we have to go to
54:08 - their nation we need to go to their
54:10 - tribal leaders we need to partner with
54:11 - them just this morning a member of my
54:13 - team and tabitha we're on a one-on-one
54:16 - call with a specific school that was is
54:18 - on one of our reservations the standing
54:19 - rock reservation
54:21 - telling them that we will come to them
54:23 - they don't need to go come to us what do
54:24 - they need specifically tailoring our
54:27 - offerings our professional development
54:29 - and our services to those those schools
54:32 - that we share our nation or share our
54:33 - borders with
54:36 - no superintendent you just made me think
54:38 - about something that you know bringing
54:40 - the
54:40 - the um services to the communities
54:44 - um you know one thing that we have found
54:46 - success and thank you for sparking my
54:48 - memory on that um one of our
54:50 - partnerships was with
54:52 - google
54:53 - they have googlers right have you met
54:56 - any of the googlers
54:58 - that um it was really important for our
55:00 - students to see themselves in this role
55:04 - you know when we talk about racial
55:05 - identity gender identity our partners at
55:08 - google you know raised their hands they
55:10 - said hey we have a whole we have a team
55:12 - here and you know we're in la or stone's
55:14 - throw from silicon valley from your
55:16 - hotel room you can probably see silicon
55:18 - valley i'm sorry not silicon valley
55:20 - silicon beach apologies silicon beach
55:24 - and googlers came out to the schools
55:27 - and you know we we said we want to make
55:29 - sure they look like our students
55:31 - and they come from represented
55:32 - neighborhoods from our students and they
55:34 - stepped up and they brought googlers
55:36 - that you know identified with the
55:39 - stories of our students so that i mean
55:41 - just remind remembering about that that
55:43 - gives me chill so that was another way
55:45 - that we wanted to have our students kind
55:48 - of see themselves in professions that
55:50 - were connected to computer science
55:52 - education
55:57 - we have time for audience questions we
55:59 - have two microphones at either end here
56:03 - welcome the opportunity for anyone to
56:05 - take advantage of of this to ask
56:07 - questions of our distinguished panelists
56:09 - here
56:10 - also obviously if you're live streaming
56:12 - as we said at the top you can use the
56:14 - hashtag csedcon to submit any questions
56:17 - you might have any questions for our
56:19 - panelists
56:41 - uh
56:45 - hello thank you for your time short guy
56:47 - here um so sam morris from north
56:49 - carolina i'm a code.org regional partner
56:52 - and a common theme has been partnership
56:54 - between private industry
56:57 - and education
56:59 - and one of the
57:00 - one of the challenges i see as we try to
57:03 - do that is
57:05 - companies and industry right now are
57:07 - desperate for return on investment right
57:10 - that
57:11 - they see the more
57:13 - the more ripened fruit to be
57:15 - college students community college
57:17 - students
57:19 - a 12 year old who they might impact
57:22 - is 10 years away from employability and
57:25 - showing up on a csr roi report that
57:29 - their investment paid off
57:32 - how do you
57:33 - sort of phrase the conversation or help
57:35 - them better see the investment in a 12
57:38 - year old
57:39 - versus just recruiting that 22 year old
57:42 - out of college
57:44 - thanks
57:49 - so i'm just going to add that you know i
57:50 - think it's important with any partner
57:52 - that you bring to the table
57:54 - is that you're clear with what your
57:56 - expectations are and what those outcomes
58:00 - those and i want to say this it's
58:02 - mutually beneficial outcomes
58:04 - right and
58:06 - i know in the work that we've done with
58:08 - our partners and one of the reasons i
58:09 - feel it's been why it's been so
58:11 - successful is because our partnerships
58:14 - our partners
58:15 - want to build on our assets they don't
58:18 - want to come in and fix us
58:20 - they say what
58:22 - do you have and where do you want to
58:24 - grow
58:26 - and we share with them we want to grow
58:29 - from an instructional lens an
58:31 - instructional purpose
58:33 - here are our instructional outcomes
58:36 - where can this be a mutually beneficial
58:40 - conversation
58:42 - as opposed to taking it from you know
58:44 - what are they going to get where is
58:45 - their roi at the end of the day
58:48 - and maybe that might not be a fit and
58:51 - it's okay sometimes to say it's not a
58:53 - fit right now
58:56 - and that's just what i found to be
58:57 - successful within our partnerships
59:01 - so that's a really great question
59:04 - and
59:05 - a really hard question if it were easy
59:07 - we'd have you know we'd have done it
59:09 - right i mean we'd have figured it out
59:10 - what are we waiting for but it is really
59:12 - hard and i understand that um
59:14 - i think that's what is so hard about
59:16 - education in general the the return on
59:18 - investment the investment that you make
59:20 - in five and six-year-olds is a long time
59:23 - and basically educators
59:26 - stick with it to see that that roi so
59:29 - what we've found has been successful
59:31 - with some of the companies that we've
59:32 - worked with isn't necessarily the roi
59:36 - that they'll get from that student or
59:37 - that classroom that they are helping but
59:40 - in actually allowing their current
59:42 - employees to go in and make a difference
59:45 - in the world
59:46 - and so we found that this generation of
59:48 - 20-somethings and you know early
59:51 - 30-somethings job satisfaction matters
59:53 - and so while they're doing you know
59:55 - technical work and in a work that is has
59:58 - a has a fiscal you know a bottom line to
60:00 - it they also have a desire to to be of
60:04 - service and give to their community and
60:06 - so those community those partners that
60:08 - we've found success with has been the
60:10 - roi that they got on a happier current
60:13 - workforce
60:14 - by allowing them to go in and help in
60:16 - their child's school or in their
60:18 - neighborhood school or they've always
60:20 - wanted to be a teacher they've always
60:21 - wanted to be you know it brings back
60:23 - great memories but they just you know
60:25 - teachers don't make a lot for whatever
60:26 - economic reasons but allowing them
60:28 - that's where they get the more immediate
60:30 - roi is from their current workforce
60:34 - higher job satisfaction
60:39 - it is important
60:41 - that all the strategic allies that we we
60:46 - are identifying and all the
60:49 - the path that
60:51 - you are working
60:53 - share the same mission
60:55 - and
60:56 - that passion for designing implementing
60:59 - and promoting programs for teaching
61:00 - computer science is a is a way so
61:04 - um
61:05 - [Music]
61:06 - you have to find take your time it like
61:10 - sofia said it's okay
61:12 - if it don't work
61:15 - you know you have to
61:17 - find
61:18 - that allies that
61:20 - share all
61:22 - the vision that you are implementing
61:25 - in your work
61:28 - i think we have time for one more
61:29 - question
61:32 - thank you hi i'm kathy schofield i'm a
61:34 - code.org regional partner from florida
61:37 - and um i i thank you for sharing
61:40 - everything from the district the
61:42 - national and estate level and what i'm
61:45 - curious about very granular
61:47 - is your professional development that
61:50 - you're doing and all are you making
61:52 - modifications to either like the state
61:54 - level course descriptions or locally the
61:57 - um curriculum guides and pacing maps
62:00 - that when the teacher goes to their
62:02 - common resources are they able to see
62:05 - where this fits into um
62:08 - their everyday life in the classrooms
62:12 - that's a that's a great question um
62:14 - thank you for that
62:16 - so i did fail to mention that in 2015 we
62:19 - had put to forward a suite of bills uh
62:22 - during that session where a biennial
62:23 - legislative session it was a
62:24 - three-pronged approach and the first was
62:26 - develop computer cybersecurity standards
62:28 - that did not lead legislative action
62:29 - that was under the authority of the
62:31 - department so we were able to do that
62:32 - independently the second was to create
62:35 - credentials
62:36 - so we received authority from our state
62:37 - legislature to
62:40 - authorize authorizing the department to
62:43 - issue credentials to be added to teacher
62:45 - licenses at each level so we have
62:47 - different credentialing expectations for
62:49 - elementary middle and high school
62:51 - teachers
62:52 - so we've uh we have
62:54 - computer science cyber security level
62:56 - one or level level one two and three in
62:59 - ascending order so the professional
63:01 - development that we do with those is
63:02 - certain number hours the more the higher
63:04 - the credential the the um the more hours
63:07 - that you would need we partnered with
63:09 - our north dakota university system uh
63:11 - our state system and particularly our
63:14 - bismarck state college polytechnic
63:15 - college to issue the highest credentials
63:18 - so they'll they'll get their credential
63:20 - from a university system
63:22 - so the professional development that we
63:23 - do is actually tailored to whatever
63:26 - needs those school districts are and
63:27 - again partnering with our i.t department
63:29 - the edutech arm of that the technology
63:32 - education technology arm of that we go
63:34 - out and do provide the technology
63:36 - provide the professional development
63:37 - that is in person and online obviously
63:40 - and we partner with our regional
63:41 - education agencies we have seven reas in
63:44 - our state that we also partner with and
63:46 - again the leverage that we have is the
63:48 - authority of policy to issue the
63:50 - credential and then the funding to
63:52 - support our reas and our edutec partners
63:57 - and as far so the other piece of our is
63:59 - their access and so
64:01 - so 2015 is we've had the credentials
64:04 - since since 17 um and now we're bringing
64:07 - together paying teachers for their time
64:09 - right we shouldn't ask them to work for
64:11 - free but we're paying teachers to come
64:13 - in and develop lessons
64:14 - that are integrating computer science
64:16 - and cyber security into math
64:18 - english
64:19 - science so our teachers don't need to
64:22 - start from scratch and we'll have a
64:23 - warehouse of those lessons that we'll
64:25 - integrate available to our north dakota
64:27 - teachers based on align to our north
64:28 - dakota standards in those content areas
64:32 - if i could add on
64:34 - something we've been able to do and have
64:36 - some
64:37 - i like to say some some success with
64:40 - this and
64:41 - i won't be able to give like examples of
64:43 - every
64:44 - outcome but um we do have a twitter
64:47 - handle at iti underscore lausd and then
64:50 - we have a hashtag cs4lausd
64:54 - where you can see examples of what it
64:56 - looks like in the lower grades even
64:59 - you'll see some four year olds and some
65:01 - two-year-olds
65:03 - but i think what's really unique about
65:05 - us here in la unified is that we have a
65:07 - dedicated
65:09 - central office team because you know we
65:11 - live in a duality here in la unified
65:13 - we're not only centralized but we are
65:16 - also decentralized so by having this
65:19 - dedicated uh team that works on that
65:24 - develops designs iterates professional
65:27 - development they're able to be
65:30 - nimble we're able to
65:32 - make these quick turns where we're
65:36 - looking at the framework the k12cs
65:38 - framework we're looking at the computer
65:40 - science standards in california and
65:43 - another overarching umbrella that we
65:45 - leverage when we do our design and
65:47 - around computer science lessons and
65:50 - content for our most youngest learners
65:53 - we do leverage the international society
65:55 - for technology and education standards
65:57 - like these are huge big goals and
65:59 - dispositions that you can apply to all
66:02 - content areas but we've really taken
66:05 - that lens to layer it on top of our
66:07 - computer science professional
66:09 - development so any professional
66:11 - development you come to you're going to
66:12 - see a connection to the iste standards
66:16 - but with that i think what's most
66:18 - unique for our most youngest learners is
66:21 - that when our educators attend these
66:24 - sessions we ask them
66:26 - what are you again building on their
66:28 - assets what are you going to be teaching
66:31 - in your next unit
66:32 - bring those concepts bring those
66:34 - standards that you're going to need to
66:35 - teach
66:36 - and then they have the opportunity to
66:38 - start building the lesson
66:41 - there and then come back two weeks later
66:43 - and then share with the larger community
66:46 - what they've learned so in essence we
66:48 - start creating these repositories of
66:51 - experiences and what it looks like
66:53 - because we get asked that question well
66:55 - what does it look like for a
66:56 - two-year-old to experience computational
66:59 - thinking um computer science
67:01 - dispositions and strategies so i welcome
67:03 - you to visit our twitter handle as well
67:05 - as the hashtag cs4lausd
67:09 - for our final remarks here would love to
67:12 - hear just from each of you a one
67:14 - sentence takeaway you're either taking
67:17 - away from this panel or that you would
67:18 - like the audience to take with them from
67:21 - from our remarks of our discussion today
67:29 - i will say just one word inspired
67:33 - you know the moment um i opened up the
67:36 - schedule for this event
67:39 - i was just super inspired you know and
67:41 - then when i stepped in the other day the
67:43 - energy you all have brought the
67:46 - the colleagues that i've met the keynote
67:48 - speakers just again inspired so thank
67:51 - you
67:56 - i would say
67:58 - what i taking away is that this this
68:01 - work is about relationships it's about
68:04 - in cultivating opportunities for our
68:07 - young people for our for our students
68:09 - and it's really about inspiring that
68:11 - growth i i think inspired is is the
68:13 - theme for me as well so the
68:15 - relationships the the opportunities that
68:18 - can be created and inspiring us to all
68:20 - grow and get better we're in this
68:22 - together
68:26 - um
68:27 - i think that also inspiring but
68:30 - empowering
68:32 - because um
68:34 - we all
68:35 - all we know that computer science
68:37 - changed life
68:39 - and we have to empower
68:42 - principally more girls more women to use
68:47 - digital tools use the the internet
68:51 - the
68:52 - in now in a way that they feel
68:55 - secure and free to use it so it's
68:59 - important that
69:01 - we we
69:03 - have
69:04 - spaces to share
69:06 - all the experience all the work that we
69:09 - are doing so
69:11 - that's the way that i define
69:14 - great thank you all
69:15 - um we have about 15 minutes until our
69:18 - next sessions start i encourage you
69:21 - to think about this the same question
69:23 - for yourself what you're taking away
69:25 - from
69:26 - the the morning plenary and this great
69:28 - group of
69:29 - cs leaders we we've had the opportunity
69:32 - to learn from today and share it with a
69:34 - colleague of yours as you move forward
69:36 - today for me personally i'm really
69:38 - thinking a lot more about that federal
69:40 - funding strategy
69:42 - for for computer science and how that
69:44 - fits in between state and and national
69:47 - private public partnerships as well that
69:49 - i've taken away from all of our
69:51 - panelists here today
69:52 - so please join me in thanking our
69:54 - panelists one more time for joining us
69:55 - here
70:01 - thank you sean claudia kirsten sophia
70:05 - thank you so much

Cleaned transcript:

so do do so so foreign do so so so do good morning this session will begin in five minutes thank you do so do so so do we're celebrating computer science education week all across the 720 square miles that encompasses la unified it's a jackson product so my students were trying to figure out a way to help design for those further away from power we were making a prototype so that we could help other students with autism express themselves so some of them had designed a sweater where he pressed the finger if you moved it it said hi my name is another one said i'm hungry for me it's like a whole new world so i feel grateful to have access to those things because i can really do a lot more to help others they're integrating language arts they're integrating art they're integrating music and so to put all of that together to something for good i feel that coding is a way to help everybody no matter who they are so when you do an event like today there's a couple of things that are happening one you're inviting the whole school to the table if you have new students at the school they've maybe never engaged in computer science ever before they have an opportunity to experience that today the folks that came today are community stakeholders at our school i wanted them to know this is what you've been investing in this is what you've been partnering with us in those principals that come in and say we've only been doing this for three or four months this can be at your school too in just a short period of time it's an important skill because you don't only learn how to code but you also learn about life skills so teamwork patience double checking so even though you might not think about using coding as your future career those skills that you have you can take them with you anywhere and any job that you decide to do because you're always working with people around you it's got a lot of design principles in it and logical thinking and that's what really computer science is and it's now critical across all fields and all careers ways we communicate everything for so long computer science was not really fully present in schools with high numbers of kids of color and lowincome students so in la unified the demographics of our students is 73 latino however the private industry in terms of computer science does not reflect that whatsoever so if we were able to really provide that opportunity for access we would also be having an impact on the industry and so this computer science movement is really an equity movement that's what the work is about providing the opportunities for students who wouldn't have it otherwise and really opening up the field for everyone what we're seeing here is only one of the many initiatives that the instructional technology initiative is undertaking if you're not exposed to these kinds of opportunities whether it's computer science or anything having to do with instructional technology you don't know where you can go that's a blocked off path for you if we can change the computer science educational pathways of youth today that they'll be able to take that knowledge into whatever career pathways they choose to pursue in the future to solve community issues and problems that need the diverse perspectives of many people to solve them i did i did i had it here it was okay okay welcome everyone to day two of cs edcon i'm sean roberts vice president of government affairs for code.org if i haven't met you yet please come say hi to me sometime this week i'm so appreciative that we all have this chance to be together and the great work you all are doing and i'm so appreciative of the momentum you all have built for computer science education in our country over the past several years we're going to get started with our first panel today lessons learned from district state and national computer science initiatives i'm especially excited and honored to be hosting this panel i'm just very interested in what our panelists have to say today i don't know what their answers are going to be i'm looking forward to hearing them along with you i think we're going to have a really great discussion this morning so we're going to start with some brief opening remarks from our panelists and during that time they'll be sharing some of the lessons they've learned from their own computer science initiatives we'll then move into some question and answer from you the audience and if you're live streaming with us from home welcome we would love for you to join the conversation tweet us using our hashtag csedcon and we'll try to answer those questions as well if my parents are worth watching please make sure you direct your questions toward the panelists they're very supportive of me so let's go ahead and get started and let's meet our panelists if you haven't had a chance to check in on your table tents yet using the qr code please do so joining us today first after 24 years as a teacher administrator and instructional aide kirsten basler was first elected to this to the position of state superintendent in north dakota in 2012 where she currently sits she's also the director of the national council of chief state school officers please join me in welcoming welcoming state superintendent kirsten basler since joining president buchelle's administration in 2019 claudia de la den and her team have trained over 46 000 teachers in el salvador she serves as the director general of the higher school of innovation in public administration and works to establish strategic partnerships to expand technology opportunities in particular for girls and women please welcome claudia de lerin secretary of benefit innovation republic of el salvador finally with over 20 years experience in los angeles unified school district here in la sophia is a member of the board of directors for the international society for technology and education she's been named to the most influential people in education technology and a next generation leader by ed scoop and she currently serves as the director of the instructional technology initiative at la unified please welcome sophia mendoza so let's go ahead and start with uh some lessons learned in your opening remarks just a few minutes for each of our panelists let's start with sophia great well good morning everyone and good morning afternoon to everyone and evening if some of our international folks joining us uh streaming you know it's been a very long time here in l.a unified for our cs movement and along those years i've kind of compiled a list of my top 10 lessons learned so i brought them to share them with you today the first is really leading with an organizational change management strategy anytime we want to bring about change my biggest tip is let's have an organizational change management strategy ready also it's been very important i know we had a video earlier that we shared with you around our call to action here in la unified is to center our computer science initiative around a social justice lens and the connection with that is finding your partners and that will also join that movement of computer science that's directed around social justice and cultivate a partnership really understanding the mutual beneficial aspects of partnerships and one that is really dear to me you know being you know i've been here with inela unified since i was a kindergartner i like to tell everyone that my mom dropped me off in kindergarten and she has yet to pick me up one thing i've noticed is that our educators love to be spotlighted right so when we spotlight our practitioners it inspires others to step into this new arena all the while you are continuously reinforcing the change that you want to see in your movement you we've done this through newsletters where as soon as you open the newsletter you're going to see a featured educator leveraging computer science in multiple different ways we've also highlighted and spotlighted educators during board of education meetings special showcase events where we have the educators tell their own story and their successes another big lesson learned is really influencing policy so i'm so glad we're here today because i'm really looking forward to a couple of sessions that i i want to attend around policy this is your chance to make your voice heard locally leveraging our district policies so that um you know we we have the support of our elected board members that has been such a major piece and then looking at how we collaborate regionally so another great aspect of being a regional partner here with code.org is that we're able to have those regional coalitions as well as specific legislative dates also looking to our administrators you know that's an untapped um group our administrators so when you're looking to impact policy and influence it don't forget about your administrator organizations also looking at how you might want to reimagine instruction around leveraging computer science also a big big piece because you know i'm going to share with you all i am not a computer scientist by degree i have learned to reimagine instruction i have learned to be prepared to be a learner so when you're inviting your administrators when you're inviting your educators to step into the cs arena it's really about being comfortable with being a learner but also articulating learning in different ways and i think the third one i'm sorry the the the next biggest piece that i think has been really beneficial is be being agnostic providing very thoughtful points for your educators you know here in la unified we have about 25 000 ish educators and doing so we have to meet our our educators where they might be on the continuum looking at different frameworks curriculum devices even having devices that are agnostic the platforms but overall looking for agnostic opportunities where it's a low floor and high ceiling easy entry points and my last tip would be let's collaborate more with higher ed looking at our areas of preservice so that's just a little bit about my top 10 lesson learned over the years great thank you very much sophia let's hear from claudia you're you're opening remarks on lessons learned in your national initiative in el salvador thank you thank you shane um first of all i want to thank you for the invitation i'm really glad to be here and and talk about uh the things that we are doing at el salvador well establishing partnership um with the private sector has been a priority for a president najib in this sense as a government we have we have seen signed important agreements with big tech companies such as microsoft google plazi oracle amazon nokia hp and dell as well as with the main telecommunications company in the country these agreements allow us to implement unprecedented strategies within the public administration to guarantee innovative and quality services in different areas such as education health and security as is common in countries of central america as government we face the challenge to find funds to develop projects allowed to allow us to build and maintain political and digital infrastructure for digital services so in this sense publicprivate partnership is a model that make resource more efficient reduce response times and considerably increases the scope of project for the benefit of our people this also increases the chance of success and sustainability of all projects in this way in el salvador from the secretariat of innovation we are working involving all different institutions of government with the private sector academia civil society and international organization within an innovation ecosystem that guarantees the closing of technological gap mainly through transfer of knowledge that allows the adoption of new technologies helping people to use computers and funds to learn about computer science also we are working on the rollout of digital infrastructure for connectivity in all the country this coordinated work allow us to influence important public policies as the higher education law where thanks to the approach with the private sector and academy together with the ministry of education and the ministry of economy we have identified the demand of the labor market at national and international level prioritizing our efforts towards the ones that guarantees greater job opportunities with more competitive salaries and this work incorporate our strategic allies such as code.org microsoft and plazi with whom we have developed in recent months a very ambitious project to train those salvadorians in higher education careers such as accelerated engineering for software development degree which include learning paths in computer science artificial intelligence cyber security cloud computing and others similarly together with other strategic allies also from the private sector we are designing degrees in telecommunications and fintech which respond to a strategic projects of our government all these learning paths are aimed at women and men of all ages to certify their skills through first level training programs in an accelerated mode that is one or two years maximum at the first higher school of innovation and technology in our country created by president bukele with a flexible and innovative academic curriculum started as totally virtual mode allowing to bring quality content to all people of all ages as a government and thanks to the partnership with private sector through this school we are providing completely free training programs through a scholarship and to thousands of salvatorians in order to guarantee the employability the people form the alliance with more national and international companies allowing salvadorans to work from our country accessing more opportunities from entrepreneurship or exporting the services obtaining truly competitive salaries that allow them to transform their life and those of their families thank you great thank you very much let's go on to superintendent basler your takeaways from your initiative in north dakota thank you so much sean um and thank you to code.org for hosting this very very important convening and this conversation for many years i think you're going to hear a theme from all of us i've heard it already you're going to hear the same thing from me and that is the theme of this doesn't happen overnight it needs to be done strategically and you need partners and that that's that's the way that it and that's the story of north dakota as well so our journey really began or my journey began uh nine and a half years ago when i took office my first lonely night in the capitol building uh my first legislative session as an elected official you uh you know you don't know how many cycles you're going to have you don't know how many years you might be able to make a difference and so i jotted out on a piece of notebook because i was a elementary principal and and teacher before that so i had my spiral bound notebook tore out a sheet of paper and thought jotted down some things that before my ride on the merrygoround was over i wanted to accomplish as an elected leader and one of those was to bring computer science and to to all of our students every zip code every child in north dakota that sticky note is or that spiral bound notebook is still taped to the inside of my cupboard door and we nine and a half years later we're we're at we're at a tipping point now in fact our special session will be meeting next week monday and we have a bill in to require it in all of our elementary middle and high schools and make it a graduation requirement so hopefully we can get it across the finish line fingers crossed so that brings me to the point of okay as an elected official as an educator and an elected official how do we do that the first thing that we needed to do was bring more people on board than just the education community as educators we're fully committed to our students parents are fully committed to their own children but the challenge is for parents for for families their kids kind of age out of the major issues uh they they are very passionate about making sure that their students have what they need in elementary school but as soon as they move on to middle school or high school they let somebody else worry about what's happening in elementary school so we needed to make this a different conversation more than just about what's best for students even if i didn't care and this is kind of how i talk to to legislators that aren't on the education committee those that get to vote for the appropriation and the policy that's going to complete this it's just pretend for a minute that i didn't even care about young people that i don't care about children this is an economic conversation that we need to have for our state of north dakota and that gets even those committee members that are serving on the the the government affairs committee or the uh taxation committee it gets them interested because we're talking about economy so we formed a partnership that's called pk20w and it's because this conversation about computer science needs to start with our preschoolers and continue through phd level work and into the workforce so we have a pk 20w group that has been meeting for the last four years so we're all hands on deck pushing the flywheel in the same direction and why pk because it's actually quite a pet peeve of mine that when we talk about computer science and cyber security that we tend to just talk about it through the lens of high school classes and college courses while very important it's true but we know that by the end of third grade young people have a belief of what they're good at and what they want to be that year between third grade and fourth grade is critically important so if we're just beginning to have a conversation about introducing computer science into middle schools we're too late as with any sector the workforce shortage issue is is is every sector's challenge right now with the great resignation but when our preschoolers come into their first you know day of school one of the first lessons that every preschool teacher does is hands them a pot of soil they plant a seed and they watch it grow and it's not because we want them to be agronomists or botanists or even farmers it's because it's part of their everyday world so similarly we need to begin to help our students understand what is happening around them how the internet works at preschool and help them develop those ideas so that's why we did prek pk 20w and making it an economic issue you really have to have that explanation that 30second elevator speech ready and make it about what's important to them employers need employees that are computer science literate there will never be a time where this generation is using less technology when you say those things and you make it about the economy you have the opportunity to have a broader influence and still care about kids and make sure that they're getting what they need for their future thank you superintendent i'd like to move to some questions now for for all of you um the the first one is i think this panel is really unique and one of the reasons i'm honored and excited to be able to host it is because we have uh so many different locations el salvador is very different from los angeles it's very different from north dakota and and so on but also the different levels at which you're approaching your plans from a district level from a countrywide level from a state level so one of the things i'm interested in is what you think you need from the other two levels in your role so maybe we'll start with you superintendent what do you need from a district level to be successful and what do you need from a national level to be successful so from the district level i guess what i would if i could have a magic wand and wave my wand is to have every teacher understand the importance of computer science and in north dakota we have computer science and cyber security skills so we have included another strategic i think important because words matter you can't get a lot of people excited often about computer science but everybody understands the importance and the urgency of cyber security so um if we can at the elementary level we have a better buy in with our elementary teachers understanding that it can be integrated should be integrated but unfortunately and when we reach middle school and secondary level that tends to be some other teachers responsibility and so if we can have more people take responsibility for being computer science cyber security teachers rather than just that math teacher or just that computer science certified teacher or that would be helpful so engaging our principals to understand that they need to have um allow the time for professional development to have teachers coplan together would be helpful and to really just maybe get out of their own disciplined content areas and understand that this is a holistic issue that every student needs what do we need from the national level i think that we we need to market this we need to continue to market this so you know when i speak nationally i'm not talking about the federal government at this point but as a nation we need to engage our workforce as as we've all know there isn't a there at the hearing on monday are the executive director of our hospitality association we'll be testifying in favor of this our commerce people will be in testifying in favor of this this move and so as a nation we all need to be talking about computer science and cyber security and you need to talk about it at your dinner parties on sunday afternoon when you know when you're when your football is on when your football team is on at halftime break talk about those things have that conversation federally you know it's it's it's wonderfully amazing that the national governors association is lifting this up as their event their chairman or their their the president of the nga um asa hutchinson is going to announce that that's his platform we need to have more leaders stepping up on a national level and saying this is important and this is a number one priority we have a point in time where we are the we are going to either be importing our talent on this issue or we will be providing the service to the rest of the world yeah it sounds like that's something secretariat you've done really well in el salvador is getting a common theme and messaging and leadership around computer science education i know el salvador's education system is uh more centralized than we have here in the united states so maybe for you the question is what do you need from the provinces you you work with and also the ministry of education what do you need from those entities to be successful well we are working in from the presidency with the ministry of education uh i have to say that before the pandemic and with the secretary of innovation vladimir hand that we work on develop a national digital agenda that contemplate inc import important areas all with very ambitious projects to achieve the digital transformation of our country in fact at that time we received the visit in our country of leonardo ortiz a vp of international partnership of cod.org and we agreed to implement in the coming years the computer science in the curriculum for all educational levels in el salvador however the pandemic accelerates the implementation of several of these projects mainly those related to education innovation and connectivity since the beginning of the pandemic or president naibokel established the importance of guaranteed educational continuing so under his mandate we began to work strongly with the ministry of education to implement a digital transformation project of the educational system which within the digital agenda was contemplated to be implement implement in the next 10 years with the pandemic the challenge seem bigger but we start training the teachers because teachers preparation is key in any education initiative and because the work that they are doing every day with the students in their classroom is one of the most important important part of all this project so we joined force with strategic allies and in the first three months we managed to digital literature for more than 46 dollars and teachers from the public and private sector training and certifying them in the use and management of the google classroom platform which by an agreement with google was adopted by our government as the platform for the for the entire public education system and we created more than 1.2 million google workspace accounts for all students and teachers at the same time we trained the specialists of the ministry of education for the creation of virtual content for all the soviet of all educational levels from early childhood to high school including the computer science content that code.org made available to us as the first step to include it in the national curriculum and now we are excited of how fast this effort is growing by that time we have trained 94 percent of teachers from public sector created a platform for educational continuity and also began to manage important financial cooperation projects with the idv and unicef what involves more than 85 million dollars to develop the state's own digital infrastructure for the connectivity of thousands of public schools and health units also by monday for president and the first lady gabriela we began to work on one of the most employment projects of our government the delivery of computer for all students and teachers in the public sector with an investment of more than 400 million dollars in order to provide all the resources that are necessary to guarantee the educational continuity delivery of equipment is a window of opportunities for all the students and their families who in addition to their computer receive a mobile data plan to guarantee connectivity and in the case of the more than 60 000 high school um students they also receive a virtual training program to learn english through the platzi platform all this has allowed us to implement in parallel hundreds of mass training programs not only for students and teachers but also for people of all ages including public servers whom we have even certified for the use of different digital tools currently we are training all means ministry of health technology staff on an advanced software development learning path that incorporate a training program to learn english the pandemic has shown us that we can accelerate the implementation of program aimed at closet closing at the technological and gender gap in this sense we currently implement inclusive programs for the adoption and use of technology providing all the tools so that more girls and women have better training and job opportunities so that they can continue taking spaces in the fields of science and technology and have a true participation in the digital transformation of our country achieving this implementation in an accelerated way has been possible thanks to the leadership of our president the articulated work between institutions and the private sector and the commitment of an incredible team which we work tirelessly every day to improve the life of salvadorians all these efforts take us to an unprecedented point in our country where children and young people can become who they want to be this true transformation of the education system involves profound changes that will allow more salvadorans to access more opportunities in the falls of science technology and innovation we are sure that in the coming years we will see exponential growth in the number of salvadorans specialized in robotics artificial intelligence machine learning aerospace or more programming skills and we are also sure that more salvadorians will lead technology companies in our country or outside as a result of all this great effort and i'm really excited for what this means for the future of el salvador thank you sophia how about you from a district perspective what would be helpful for you from a national perspective and also from your state you know i'd like to first start with with state because i think that has more of like this local impact you know i see multiple lanes that need to be running at the same time definitely the partnerships with our higher ed you know ensuring that our educators once they step into the classroom have the knowledge the disposition the skills to be able to integrate computer science effectively right i think that's number one because what we've seen happen recently is especially with our with our most youngest learners to our middle grades we're doing a lot of back filling for our educators so might that be great if there was a partnership where it was you come in and it also will help our educators feel that sense of belonging you know they come in they have these assets and they can immediately contribute to the school culture and the district culture so my number one would be how can we ensure that our educators are coming in prepared and have those skill sets from from higher ed so then that makes you know that brings up the question what is credentialing looking like what is you know what our authorizations looking like so that we can cast a wider net there are so many educators that want to teach computer science but if it's not being offered in their preservice then that's creating additional gaps so i see definitely those two lanes that would really help us as a districtwide the and then when i think about how the federal government can help and support us you know right now we're leveraging title four dollars and out of title four we have the effective use of technology bucket in there might it be amazing wonderful opportunity to create a statue where we can have dollars earmarked specifically for computer science education so just putting that out there in case anyone's listening so you know that's been very effective leveraging our title four dollars to really start some of the other expansion pieces here in la unified so i think those two pieces um for federal to create some sort of a statute for earmarking specific dollars for computer science education agreed um i want to open this up to the the entire panel um we we've talked about our lessons learned and what we've learned from our cs initiatives i want to look forward a little bit thinking about the various initiatives you have going on um in three years if you were not successful what what would have caused it do you think looking ahead three years from now let me make sure i understand the question sean so in three years if if we don't get this across the finish line what's the last part of the question yeah you you haven't met your goal that was in your notebook in three years what would you attribute that to well i'll take a stab at that so you know let's let's we don't live in a vacuum here we've just had a pandemic for the last 18 months and so i think that there's a there's a risk that some of us as a nation might say well we've got to focus on just the fundamentals we've got to focus on just recovering that lost learning time for our young people and keep our eye on that ball and we've had those conversations in our state i've had those conversations with our school leaders and i've had those conversations with my colleagues across the nation but the thing about it is if you if you step outside of that box if you step outside of i don't think anybody wants to return to normal we want our students to be learning and engaged in learning but we've realized because of the pandemic that learning can happen in a whole host of different ways and delivery methods and through a lot of different engaging activities that aren't necessarily what the traditional learning is so i i think that there the pandemic will certainly play a risk our our policy leaders our school district leaders may believe that they need to set computer science cyber security aside while they focus on recovery i would caution anybody that thinks that way that they're really selling their students short and they're selling their schools short hottie you know talks all the time about the impact that computer science courses have on reading and math scores in our elementary and just the increase that are of of those proficiency levels in math and reading so rather than look at the pandemic as something we have to address first we should be looking at using computer science to accelerate excite our young people and help in the recovery from the pandemic sophie are claudia any thoughts dad yeah i'd like to add um definitely you know what we have collectively experienced over the last 18 months yes it's been a disruption and we will continue to see disruptions continue to monitor the plan right so you know we've set out to do something yes we've had a huge disruption over the last 18 months and currently we're still seeing these disruptions um i think if we don't meet our mark in three years it will be because we were not closely monitoring we were not closely listening especially to our educators and listening to our families if we don't meet the mark that is because we have not tried something that we haven't done before thinking about these opportunities that we had over these last 18 months we really had to come together strategize quickly try something and iterate oh we found a bug oh let's try something different so really kind of applying some of those computer science strategies and principles to our inner workings as as a system whatever type of system you might be so um i think if we don't meet our mark that's because we were not listening we're not carefully watching um how things are are changing right in front of us who are you all learning from right now what resources leaders or examples are you taking from in your own initiatives that are influencing your leadership in computer science oh my goodness so i've learned a great deal from organizations like this cnn code.org cs4all microsoft teals all of our partners in north dakota that are helping me palo alto with the cyber security issues those are the partners that i'm learning from but but frankly i'm learning from all of you the the tremendous articles that are being written by computer science advocates educators yourself the the information that is shared on the listserv all of those things i take i digest i learn from i look into other states plans i look at the review of the state of the state and so i think i'm relying heavily on on my colleagues in the nation so some of the folks that i've been learning from i think someone who really had a profound impact when i started to look at how computer science can be integrated was dr mitch resnick in his work around the four ps and um bringing that work and you know yesterday you heard from our chief academic officer allison towery and she's really charged us with bringing that joy and engagement back into school and into learning and so that became a natural fit for us looking at how we can leverage computer science for engaging in mathematics gamebased learning um we think about the work that's happening right now with one of our partners just down the down the road university california los angeles and the work that is happening around cgi cognitive guided instruction that is something else that is also making connections to the broader education landscape here in los angeles so you know those are just uh just a few of several others but definitely coming to events like this meeting in the hallway with someone and just like getting your um those nuggets that that brain candy i like to call it because it's just these are opportunities to engage with one another and be inspired and also be influenced well in my case i have to say that this organization code.org is really inspiring for us we admire the work that you are doing um to transform life through teaching learning computer science and because this is a dynamic field which requires constant work a stroke commitment and a resilient attitude to embrace success but are also failure in order to learn from it but above all requires passion ambition to go beyond traditional strategies to implement innovative ones and you are doing that thank you what are you doing one of the things we talked about yesterday with the release of the state of cs report was the the difference between access and participation so there continues to be a gap in participation especially among our hispanic latino latina latinx students and also young women in computer science which secretariat i know has been a specific focus of of years i'm curious from from anyone what you're doing to encourage participation as well as access so about gosh i want to say maybe about four five years now here in la unified every year we celebrate computer science education week i mean it's a it's a big deal here in los angeles so much so that our board of education members you know have marked it with a resolution to bring computer science in various ways to our most youngest learners our middle grade and our and our secondary students and the the resolution that they've passed is really to ensure that our most youngest learners have 20 hours of computer science and we catch and we hook so many educators during that awareness of computer science education week and there's multiple types of entry points for our most youngest learners and those educators to step into whether it be let's just try an hour of code or it might even be i'm a school site principal and i'm inviting my local principals to come check out what we've done here at our school and then that kind of starts to inspire others like wow you're doing it i think i better do something like this um so it's it's those type of opportunities with professional development i know claudia mentioned earlier like professional development is like at the heart of what we need to do and prepare our educators but not just bringing our educators to a professional development but ensuring that they walk away with the tools they have the strategies but those physical computing devices again whatever they might be you know again being diagnostic whatever physical computing devices they need to implement with their entire class not just with two students not just with four but if you need a class set you're gonna walk away with the class set that's how important our board members uh and sirius have have taken their resolution to ensure that the funding is backing up this resolution so those are some ways that we want to bring that dis close that disparity but we still have a long way to go not going to sugarcoat that we have a long way to go i think my colleague tabitha thiel is here with me and she is part of the edutech team in north dakota but she could list off she could rattle off a whole lot of things that they're doing and i'll touch on some of those in a minute but i'm a firm believer that student outcomes don't change will never change until adult behaviors change and so i mean that that's just a fact student outcomes will never improve never change until adult behaviors do and so i think we have to do as much educating of school board members helping them set not only reading and writing goals for their district but computer science goals and equity and access goals uh helping our leaders do that specifically what are some boots on the ground things that we're doing um we there's our i t chief information officer has created um uh replicating march madness where they're doing computer science competition during the month of january and february making it fun uh girls who code um partnering with the girl scouts providing our local communities our boys and girls clubs within our communities in the state providing them funding to actually start up coding clubs for afterschool programs integrating it expecting it for the 21st century grants that the state provides to school districts in the state um providing that as a if for because they're competitive grants if they have computer science and coding activities as part of their after school programming their 21st century program they get more they get additional points and so really incentivizing there's only so many levers that you have right as a state as a state leader you have policy and you have funding and so we try to push and pull those levers as much as we can by incentivizing our partners which is why partnership is so so critically important how the the the racial equity i want to speak to a little bit as well north dakota has shares its borders with five sovereign nations and so we are behind the nation and the number of native american students that have access to and are engaging in are taking taking computer science courses at all levels that's not okay and so we have to go to them we have to go to their nation we need to go to their tribal leaders we need to partner with them just this morning a member of my team and tabitha we're on a oneonone call with a specific school that was is on one of our reservations the standing rock reservation telling them that we will come to them they don't need to go come to us what do they need specifically tailoring our offerings our professional development and our services to those those schools that we share our nation or share our borders with no superintendent you just made me think about something that you know bringing the the um services to the communities um you know one thing that we have found success and thank you for sparking my memory on that um one of our partnerships was with google they have googlers right have you met any of the googlers that um it was really important for our students to see themselves in this role you know when we talk about racial identity gender identity our partners at google you know raised their hands they said hey we have a whole we have a team here and you know we're in la or stone's throw from silicon valley from your hotel room you can probably see silicon valley i'm sorry not silicon valley silicon beach apologies silicon beach and googlers came out to the schools and you know we we said we want to make sure they look like our students and they come from represented neighborhoods from our students and they stepped up and they brought googlers that you know identified with the stories of our students so that i mean just remind remembering about that that gives me chill so that was another way that we wanted to have our students kind of see themselves in professions that were connected to computer science education we have time for audience questions we have two microphones at either end here welcome the opportunity for anyone to take advantage of of this to ask questions of our distinguished panelists here also obviously if you're live streaming as we said at the top you can use the hashtag csedcon to submit any questions you might have any questions for our panelists uh hello thank you for your time short guy here um so sam morris from north carolina i'm a code.org regional partner and a common theme has been partnership between private industry and education and one of the one of the challenges i see as we try to do that is companies and industry right now are desperate for return on investment right that they see the more the more ripened fruit to be college students community college students a 12 year old who they might impact is 10 years away from employability and showing up on a csr roi report that their investment paid off how do you sort of phrase the conversation or help them better see the investment in a 12 year old versus just recruiting that 22 year old out of college thanks so i'm just going to add that you know i think it's important with any partner that you bring to the table is that you're clear with what your expectations are and what those outcomes those and i want to say this it's mutually beneficial outcomes right and i know in the work that we've done with our partners and one of the reasons i feel it's been why it's been so successful is because our partnerships our partners want to build on our assets they don't want to come in and fix us they say what do you have and where do you want to grow and we share with them we want to grow from an instructional lens an instructional purpose here are our instructional outcomes where can this be a mutually beneficial conversation as opposed to taking it from you know what are they going to get where is their roi at the end of the day and maybe that might not be a fit and it's okay sometimes to say it's not a fit right now and that's just what i found to be successful within our partnerships so that's a really great question and a really hard question if it were easy we'd have you know we'd have done it right i mean we'd have figured it out what are we waiting for but it is really hard and i understand that um i think that's what is so hard about education in general the the return on investment the investment that you make in five and sixyearolds is a long time and basically educators stick with it to see that that roi so what we've found has been successful with some of the companies that we've worked with isn't necessarily the roi that they'll get from that student or that classroom that they are helping but in actually allowing their current employees to go in and make a difference in the world and so we found that this generation of 20somethings and you know early 30somethings job satisfaction matters and so while they're doing you know technical work and in a work that is has a has a fiscal you know a bottom line to it they also have a desire to to be of service and give to their community and so those community those partners that we've found success with has been the roi that they got on a happier current workforce by allowing them to go in and help in their child's school or in their neighborhood school or they've always wanted to be a teacher they've always wanted to be you know it brings back great memories but they just you know teachers don't make a lot for whatever economic reasons but allowing them that's where they get the more immediate roi is from their current workforce higher job satisfaction it is important that all the strategic allies that we we are identifying and all the the path that you are working share the same mission and that passion for designing implementing and promoting programs for teaching computer science is a is a way so um you have to find take your time it like sofia said it's okay if it don't work you know you have to find that allies that share all the vision that you are implementing in your work i think we have time for one more question thank you hi i'm kathy schofield i'm a code.org regional partner from florida and um i i thank you for sharing everything from the district the national and estate level and what i'm curious about very granular is your professional development that you're doing and all are you making modifications to either like the state level course descriptions or locally the um curriculum guides and pacing maps that when the teacher goes to their common resources are they able to see where this fits into um their everyday life in the classrooms that's a that's a great question um thank you for that so i did fail to mention that in 2015 we had put to forward a suite of bills uh during that session where a biennial legislative session it was a threepronged approach and the first was develop computer cybersecurity standards that did not lead legislative action that was under the authority of the department so we were able to do that independently the second was to create credentials so we received authority from our state legislature to authorize authorizing the department to issue credentials to be added to teacher licenses at each level so we have different credentialing expectations for elementary middle and high school teachers so we've uh we have computer science cyber security level one or level level one two and three in ascending order so the professional development that we do with those is certain number hours the more the higher the credential the the um the more hours that you would need we partnered with our north dakota university system uh our state system and particularly our bismarck state college polytechnic college to issue the highest credentials so they'll they'll get their credential from a university system so the professional development that we do is actually tailored to whatever needs those school districts are and again partnering with our i.t department the edutech arm of that the technology education technology arm of that we go out and do provide the technology provide the professional development that is in person and online obviously and we partner with our regional education agencies we have seven reas in our state that we also partner with and again the leverage that we have is the authority of policy to issue the credential and then the funding to support our reas and our edutec partners and as far so the other piece of our is their access and so so 2015 is we've had the credentials since since 17 um and now we're bringing together paying teachers for their time right we shouldn't ask them to work for free but we're paying teachers to come in and develop lessons that are integrating computer science and cyber security into math english science so our teachers don't need to start from scratch and we'll have a warehouse of those lessons that we'll integrate available to our north dakota teachers based on align to our north dakota standards in those content areas if i could add on something we've been able to do and have some i like to say some some success with this and i won't be able to give like examples of every outcome but um we do have a twitter handle at iti underscore lausd and then we have a hashtag cs4lausd where you can see examples of what it looks like in the lower grades even you'll see some four year olds and some twoyearolds but i think what's really unique about us here in la unified is that we have a dedicated central office team because you know we live in a duality here in la unified we're not only centralized but we are also decentralized so by having this dedicated uh team that works on that develops designs iterates professional development they're able to be nimble we're able to make these quick turns where we're looking at the framework the k12cs framework we're looking at the computer science standards in california and another overarching umbrella that we leverage when we do our design and around computer science lessons and content for our most youngest learners we do leverage the international society for technology and education standards like these are huge big goals and dispositions that you can apply to all content areas but we've really taken that lens to layer it on top of our computer science professional development so any professional development you come to you're going to see a connection to the iste standards but with that i think what's most unique for our most youngest learners is that when our educators attend these sessions we ask them what are you again building on their assets what are you going to be teaching in your next unit bring those concepts bring those standards that you're going to need to teach and then they have the opportunity to start building the lesson there and then come back two weeks later and then share with the larger community what they've learned so in essence we start creating these repositories of experiences and what it looks like because we get asked that question well what does it look like for a twoyearold to experience computational thinking um computer science dispositions and strategies so i welcome you to visit our twitter handle as well as the hashtag cs4lausd for our final remarks here would love to hear just from each of you a one sentence takeaway you're either taking away from this panel or that you would like the audience to take with them from from our remarks of our discussion today i will say just one word inspired you know the moment um i opened up the schedule for this event i was just super inspired you know and then when i stepped in the other day the energy you all have brought the the colleagues that i've met the keynote speakers just again inspired so thank you i would say what i taking away is that this this work is about relationships it's about in cultivating opportunities for our young people for our for our students and it's really about inspiring that growth i i think inspired is is the theme for me as well so the relationships the the opportunities that can be created and inspiring us to all grow and get better we're in this together um i think that also inspiring but empowering because um we all all we know that computer science changed life and we have to empower principally more girls more women to use digital tools use the the internet the in now in a way that they feel secure and free to use it so it's important that we we have spaces to share all the experience all the work that we are doing so that's the way that i define great thank you all um we have about 15 minutes until our next sessions start i encourage you to think about this the same question for yourself what you're taking away from the the morning plenary and this great group of cs leaders we we've had the opportunity to learn from today and share it with a colleague of yours as you move forward today for me personally i'm really thinking a lot more about that federal funding strategy for for computer science and how that fits in between state and and national private public partnerships as well that i've taken away from all of our panelists here today so please join me in thanking our panelists one more time for joining us here thank you sean claudia kirsten sophia thank you so much our next session is our birds of feather discussions these are facilitated discussions not presentations um so please pick your the topic that you're interested in there are eight topics and actually a number of these topics reflect what you were interested in when you filled out your registration uh form so again those are the rooms those are the topics after that we're gonna go into our first breakout session slot of five breakouts that's from 11 30 to 12 30. then we'll have lunch that's a great time by the way to catch up on that email you know work never stops even when you're at a conference and then in the afternoon two to three pm we'll have more breakouts and then a happy hour at the end um one more thing rapid antigen testing just wanted to give you a reminder we'll be in the san diego room which is actually right next door from 3 to 5 p.m today just to let you know that and that's obviously free you're dismissed thank you very well done i can make your hands claps luxury am i the only living soul around
