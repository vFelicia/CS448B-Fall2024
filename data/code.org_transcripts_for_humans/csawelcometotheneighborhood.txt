00:05 - welcome to the neighborhood
00:06 - we will use the neighborhood to learn
00:08 - java while navigating mazes and painting
00:11 - murals
00:14 - to use the neighborhood we have to
00:15 - import the package containing all of the
00:17 - classes that make up the neighborhood
00:20 - this is usually provided for us
00:23 - the painter is one of the classes in
00:25 - this package
00:27 - we can make a painter object and use it
00:29 - to navigate and paint in the
00:31 - neighborhood
00:33 - a painter can be placed at an x and y
00:35 - location and face either north
00:39 - south
00:40 - east
00:42 - or west
00:44 - we can determine the x and y location on
00:46 - the grid by the dots
00:50 - by default a painter starts at 0 0 which
00:53 - is the top left corner of the grid
00:57 - this grid is eight spaces wide
01:00 - and eight spaces tall
01:03 - so the available locations for x and y
01:06 - are zero through seven
01:09 - a painter can move
01:11 - in the direction they are facing
01:19 - unless there's an obstacle
01:22 - a painter cannot move through or on top
01:25 - of buildings
01:26 - grass sidewalks food trucks
01:30 - or any other obstacles we might find in
01:32 - the neighborhood
01:34 - a painter can only move on the asphalt
01:38 - a painter can also turn left
01:48 - and a painter can take paint
02:09 - and
02:10 - a painter can paint
02:28 - we can make painter objects to navigate
02:31 - and paint in the neighborhood and solve
02:33 - all kinds of problems
02:34 - have fun
